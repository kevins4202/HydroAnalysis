16065,as coastal areas become more vulnerable to climatic impacts the need for understanding estuarine carbon budgets with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution arises under various hydrologic extremes ranging from drought to hurricane induced flooding a mass balance model was constructed for carbon fluxes and their variabilities in four estuaries along the northwestern gulf of mexico nwgom coast over a four year period 2014 2018 loading of total organic carbon toc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic to estuaries included riverine discharge and lateral exchange from tidal wetlands the lateral exchanges of toc and dic reached 4 5 5 7 and 8 9 1 4 mol c m 2 yr 1 accounting for 86 5 and 62 7 of total toc and dic inputs into these estuaries respectively a relatively high regional co2 efflux 4 0 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 was found which was two times the average value in north american coastal estuaries reported in the literature oceanic export was the major pathway for losses of toc 5 6 1 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 81 2 of total and dic 9 9 2 9 mol c m 2 yr 1 69 7 of total the carbon budget exhibited high variability in response to hydrologic changes for example storm or hurricane induced flooding elevated co2 efflux by 2 10 times in short periods of time flood following a drought also increased lateral toc exchange from 3 5 4 7 to 67 8 17 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 but decreased lateral dic exchange from 28 9 3 5 to 7 1 7 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 the large variability of carbon budgets highlights the importance of high resolution spatiotemporal coverage under different hydrologic conditions and the importance of carbon contribution from tidal wetlands to coastal carbon cycling keywords estuarine carbon budget air water co2 flux lateral exchange hydrologic changes 1 introduction coastal areas consisting of tidal wetlands and estuaries play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle attempts to synthesize estuarine carbon budgets must deal with its high spatiotemporal heterogeneity that is due to geomorphological climatic and hydrologic differences bauer et al 2013 more importantly the lack of direct observations creates challenges with identifying exchange between tidal wetlands and estuarine waters najjar et al 2018 even though a broad consensus regarding tidal wetlands significance on estuarine carbon processing has recently emerged maher et al 2018 santos et al 2021 generally tidal wetlands transport carbon through lateral exchange including tidal activities and submarine groundwater discharge santos et al 2021 thus a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is needed to constrain these non point source driven exchanges santos et al 2019 tamborski et al 2021 however comprehensive budgets that combine organic and inorganic carbon fluxes over annual or longer timescales have been scarce bogard et al 2020 although wet dry climatic cycles have been reported to alternate estuarine systems between heterotrophy and autotrophy yao et al 2020 the variability of the coastal carbon cycle in response to hydrologic change remains understudied all climate models predict the high possibility of hydrologic extremes e g drought and flooding in tropical and subtropical estuaries liu et al 2019 sherwood and fu 2014 therefore elucidating carbon budget variability spanning a full hydrologic spectrum is important to improve our knowledge and predict responses to future climate change carbon fluxes can be estimated in several different ways process based models that couple estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry can link organic and inorganic carbon cycles gordon et al 1996 however detailed information at fine spatial and temporal scales is required to constrain potential errors in these models bauer et al 2013 kemp et al 1997 on the other hand mass balance approaches based on observations and stoichiometric relationships may amplify uncertainties because of the propagation of errors smith et al 1991 nevertheless models based on the latter approach can sepaprate individual processes that significantly influence the regional carbon cycle and errors could be constrained or at least recognized if temporal and spatial patterns are chosen carefully maher and eyre 2012 there are few carbon budget estimates in subtropical estuaries worldwide crosswell et al 2017 maher and eyre 2012 tanner and eyre 2020 the northwestern gulf of mexico nwgom has the world s largest lagoonal estuary laguna madre of both texas u s a and tamaulipas mexico and many other smaller lagoonal estuaries dürr et al 2011 i e estuaries that are separated from the coastal ocean by barrier islands through which channels and waterways connect the water bodies on the nwgom coast river discharge or inflow decreases sharply southward which is one of the most distinctive hydrologic features in this area montagna et al 2013 climate fluctuations between drought and flood periods further alter and drive the hydrologic conditions of this coastal region yao and hu 2017 yao et al 2020 moreover nwgom coast has a long history of hurricane landfalls roth 2010 through studying these estuarine systems that share geomorphological similarities it is possible to assess the effects of hydrologic variations on the coastal carbon cycle and provide useful information for future climate change related investigations the objectives of this study were to 1 construct comprehensive carbon budgets for nwgom estuaries using a mass balance model based on bi weekly i e twice a month to quarterly observations 2 examine different biogeochemical drivers for processes including riverine inflow lateral exchange burial air water co2 flux net ecosystem metabolism nem and oceanic export and 3 assess the climatic impact on the estuarine carbon budget including alternating between drought and flood conditions 2 methods 2 1 study sites four nwgom estuaries fig 1 a lavaca colorado estuary lce guadalupe estuary ge mission aransas estuary mae and nueces estuary ne were investigated from april 2014 to april 2018 average depth of these microtidal estuaries is approximately 1 m table 1 and these estuaries have restricted connections to the nwgom due to the presence of a series of barrier islands fig 1 each estuary receives input from one or two rivers we designated the upper estuary as the area subject to more freshwater influence from rivers whereas the lower estuary represents the area connected with the nwgom through a tidal inlet the only exception was ge which is river inflow dominated due to its limited tidal exchange fig 1 montagna and kalke 1992 hurricane harvey a category 4 storm made landfall near the southern end of this coastal area on 25 august 2017 walker et al 2021 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analyses field campaigns on different intervals were conducted table a1 both surface 0 1 m and bottom samples about 0 1 m above the bottom sediment were taken in situ data including temperature depth salinity dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a were acquired by a calibrated ysi 6600 v2 data sonde ph and dissolved inorganic carbon dic total organic carbon toc ca2 and salinity were analyzed in the lab see detailed analytical methods in table a2 all ph measurements were conducted at 25 0 1 c and the lab measured ph values were converted to the total scale at in situ temperature using co2sys with dic and lab measured ph as the input variables following the method in yao and hu 2017 to assess the estuarine carbon budget variability we categorized the wide hydrologic range into four study periods drought d and flood relaxation fr that both were under dry condition flooding f and post hurricane h that both were under wet condition hydrologic definitions were based on the quartiles of mean salinities more details in table a3 the only exception was the hurricane period which included the post storm surge period from september to early october 2017 walker et al 2021 2 3 carbon mass balance the major carbon fluxes in an estuary

crosswell et al 2017 maher and eyre 2012 tanner and eyre 2020 a steady state assumption was made for the nwgom estuaries the steady state mass balance equation for estuarine dic can be written as 1 f

for the lateral exchange ones which were calculated as the residuals from the two mass balance equations 2 4 riverine input frv riverine carbon fluxes frv µmol c d 1 were estimated from riverine dic

average atmospheric doc 440 μmol c l 1 mitra et al 2017 and dic 17 μmol c l 1 willey et al 2000 concentrations were used in conjunction with monthly precipitation rate texas water development board or twdb http www twdb texas gov to estimate rainfall input of carbon to these estuaries 2 6 air water co2 flux fco2 the net co2 flux f c o 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 at each station was calculated using eq 4 see

0004 or 0 01 depending on the analytical method used as the input variables and the program co2sys calculated pco2 water values were in good agreement with in situ monitored pco2 water measurements 20 µatm mccutcheon et al 2021 2 7 net ecosystem metabolism fnem because mixed layer benthic and pelagic metabolic processes would generate consume co2 and influence fco2 directly nem was estimated using a linear regression equation eq 5 derived by maher and eyre 2012 they found a significant inverse relationship r2 0 898 p 0 001 between fco2 and fnem based on data from 12 estuaries worldwide laruelle et al 2013 further applied this equation to estimate fco2 in another 68 lagoonal estuaries worldwide and suggested a 26 8 difference between directly calculated co2 flux and nem derived estimates here we calculated daily nem at each station following the same equation 5 f c o 2 0 4236 f n e m 11 991 2 8 sediment deposition fd sediment deposition flux f d mmol c m 2 d 1 was determined by sedimentation rates s a cm yr 1 sedimentary toc concentrations csed mg c kg 1 and averaged dry bulk sediment density 0 88 g cm 3 in nwgom estuaries calculated the linear sediment accumulation rates table 1 6 f d s a c s e d ρ s due to the invariant 210pb profiles in the well mixed upper layer of these shallow estuaries 20 cm cores from our campaigns d hammond pers comm we chose to use the average sediment accumulation rates in lavaca bay upper lce and ne to represent those in ge and mae respectively bronikowski 2004 yeager et al 2006 table 1 in addition historical surface sedimentary toc data were obtained from tceq and averaged for dry and wet conditions table 1 with slight mismatch due to sampling time inconsistencies between tceq surveys and our study thus averaged sedimentation rates under dry and wet conditions were applied to corresponding upper and lower estuarine systems 2 9 oceanic export fex due to shallow and windy conditions the estuarine water was assumed to be well mixed little stratification was observed during our study period a box modeling approach was then introduced to estimate the fex the steady state net daily average fex was

estuarine area normalized annual fluxes finally the annual fluxes of different carbon budget terms were averaged by the sum of all campaigns and then normalized to corresponding estuarine areas for

107 9 19 7 m3 s 1 hereafter the uncertainties were all standard errors in northern estuary lce to 8 6 2 4 m3 s 1 in southern estuary ne consistent with the declining trend of inflow table 1 distinct seasonality was observed with high river discharge in spring and summer in response to storm driven flooding in 2015 2016 and 2017 but fall and winter had much less discharge as a result frv dic and frv toc had similar seasonal patterns but different magnitudes fig 2 a and d during the spring to summer flooding period maximum frv dic in lce and ge reached 84 4 and 59 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively while those in mae and ne were substantially lower 27 8 and 16 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively similarly maximum frv toc were 8 6 and 14 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 for lce and ge respectively compared to 7 4 and 2 3 mmol c m 2 d 1 for mae and ne respectively 3 2 air water co2 flux all four estuaries were net co2 sources to the atmosphere fig 3 with distinct spatiotemporal patterns fig 2g fco2 ranged 15 120 mmol c m 2 d 1 in spring and summer these estuaries had higher co2 emission up to 120 mmol c m 2 d 1 as a result of flooding yao and hu 2017 yao et al 2020 the peak of co2 efflux values in lce and ge 100 mmol c m 2 d 1 were five times of those in mae and ne 20 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 2g the maximum co2 efflux occurred when the first major storm struck at the end april 2015 after a four year extreme drought yao and hu 2017 in comparison fco2 decreased and even changed sign 15 35 mmol c m 2 d 1 in fall and winter nevertheless average co2 flux in lce and ge 10 mmol c m 2 d 1 under this low freshwater conditions was ten times of mae and ne average 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 overall annual average fco2 in lce and ge was an order of magnitude higher than those in mae and ne fig 3 3 3 nem derived from fco2 empirically the fnem variations were anticorrelated with the fco2 pattern the fnem values were lowest in spring and summer 0 5 5 6 and 27 7 10 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively indicating the seasonal heterotrophy increasing nem in fall 7 5 7 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 and winter 35 5 3 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 showed switching to autotrophic conditions annual fnem values suggested heterotrophic dominance in the northern estuaries i e lce and ge whereas yearly autotrophy was found in the southern estuaries mae and ne fig 3 3 4 sediment deposition annual average sediment organic carbon deposition flux fd was 2 3 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 in lce with 1 9 0 2 and 3 1 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 in dry and wet conditions respectively fd was the highest in ge at 4 7 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 4 8 0 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 in dry and 5 7 0 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 in wet conditions then fd declined toward the south averaged 1 7 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 with 1 2 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 in dry and 4 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in wet conditions in mae and averaged 0 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 with 0 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in dry and 0 7 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in wet conditions in ne figs 2i and 3 3 5 export to the coastal ocean area normalized fex dic was between 24 109 mmol c m 2 d 1 and fex toc was 103 132 mmol c m 2 d 1 in all estuaries combined fig 2c and f the highest monthly fex dic and fex toc were found in ge february 2017 and in lce april 2016 respectively occasional negative fex dic in mae and ne indicated a possible oceanic water supply under drought conditions when riverine inputs were low to compensate for evaporative water loss consistent with river inflows these estuaries exported most dic and toc to the gom in winter and spring 38 6 4 1 and 19 2 3 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively coastwide minimum fex dic occurred in summer 20 6 2 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 and minimum fex toc in fall 11 3 2 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 during which time the minimum fex dic ranged from 2 4 1 3 ne to 32 4 6 0 ge mmol c m 2 d 1 and the minimum fex toc fluctuated between 2 8 5 6 ne and 16 9 5 9 ge mmol c m 2 d 1 among the annual fex values dic export from the southern estuary ne 3 5 0 5 mol c m 2 yr 1 was found to be only 1 5 of that from the northern estuary ge 17 5 1 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 similarly the lowest annual toc export was found in ne 0 6 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 fig 3 3 6 lateral exchange although average dic and doc fluxes due to sgd in upper ne 4050 and 840 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively were estimated from a previous study murgulet et al 2018 these overwhelmingly high carbon inflows should diminish toward lower estuary so that can be balanced by much lower estuarine carbon export sections 3 2 3 4 and 3 5 due to possible error amplification from limited data coverage lateral exchanges were calculated as the residual term from the mass balance models eqs 1 and 2 rather than the sgd study directly area normalized fl dic ranged from 173 1 96 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 and fl toc ranged from 96 2 301 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 2b e the southern estuaries mae and ne had the higher annual fl dic while larger annual fl toc were found in the northern estuaries lce and ge respectively fig 3 the averaged fl dic of all four estuaries reached the maximum 48 0 3 8 mmol c m 2 d 1 and minimum 0 6 5 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 values in winter and summer respectively although fl toc varied in the opposite direction maximum 39 8 12 8 mmol c m 2 d 1 in summer and minimum 20 2 4 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 in winter fig 2b e 3 7 carbon budget the annual carbon budget in each estuary was calculated by the area integrated dic and toc fluxes fig 3 the largest dic input was fl dic in particular fl dic in ne was estimated to be almost ten times of frv dic on the other hand fco2 and fex dic were the two major dic loss pathways from nwgom estuaries in addition autotrophic activities appeared to be another important dic loss term in southern estuaries mae and ne on the organic carbon side the averaged fl toc of all four estuaries was the major total toc input term which was almost seven times of frv toc in this region in addition annual nem revealed varying trophic status from heterotrophy to autotrophy when moving southward fex toc contributed 75 of total toc outflow although it behaved differently among these four subsystems fd was another important toc loss term which was estimated to account for the remaining 25 of total toc outflow compared to the above fluxes fp and fca were small enough so that they were omitted in the overall budget fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic controls on estuarine carbon budgets during our study period the nwgom coast experienced extreme hydrologic changes between dry and wet conditions including the end of extreme drought prior to april 2015 and a category 4 storm hurricane harvey in fall 2017 both flooding and flood relaxation occurred at multiple periods over time fl toc fco2 and fnem experienced the largest changes across different periods fig 4 fco2 indicates large estuarine co2 emission rates 5 3 2 7 44 3 25 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 across all conditions flooding from hurricane harvey increased fco2 by 2 10 times compared to the baseline values with most pronounced increase in lce 4 5 10 9 to 40 7 4 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 and ge 9 6 6 7 to 96 7 72 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 compared to mae 7 3 1 3 to 15 4 2 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 and ne 3 8 2 7 to 11 0 8 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 that had smaller increases two estuaries mae and ne were on the dry side of the storm and riverine input did not substantially increase as shown by their lower frv dic and frv toc fig 2a and d this co2 flux increase in lce and ge was consistent with other studies that also found 5 10 times elevation of estuarine co2 efflux due to either storms or storm induced flooding crosswell et al 2014 van dam et al 2018 hu et al 2020 such increase could be attributed to enhanced heterotrophy in response to discharge events russell et al 2006 as well as riverine co2 ventilation yao et al 2020 walker et al 2021 also found bottom hypoxia in ge after hurricane harvey in 2017 similarly fex dic and frv dic followed the fco2 pattern fig 4 our study assessed the hydrologic effect on lateral carbon exchange in nwgom estuaries as expected storm and hurricane driven flooding increased fl toc from 3 5 4 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 drought to 72 6 37 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 hurricane fig 4d to h this enhanced exchange was most likely caused by large surface runoff walker et al 2021 because residence time is a key control on estuarine organic carbon degradation hopkinson 1988 the moderate to long residence time in these four estuaries 39 360 d table 1 particularly in mae and ne was likely responsible for organic carbon processing hence related carbon fluxes these values indicate that storm flushed organic matter from tidal wetlands supported large estuarine heterotrophy and co2 emission in wet condition which further confirmed the crucial role of lateral exchange in contrast fl dic was found to decrease from 28 9 3 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 drought to 20 2 31 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 hurricane fig 4d to h this indicates increased dic uptake at tidal wetland side under wet condition russell et al 2006 concluded that heterotrophic nem in this region would not exceed 5 mg o2 l 1 d 1 or 312 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 based on the average depth of 1 m by integrating open water and benthic chamber results annually aggregated nem 1 7 3 5 mol c m 2 yr 1 indicates a balance between primary production and remineralization coastwide yet with a large range from heterotrophic northern estuaries to autotrophic southern estuaries fig 3 however the coastwide autotrophy during drought 11 8 3 3 mmol c m 2 d 1 and flood relaxation 15 1 5 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 periods could be attributed to benthic activities once dic became more available while toc decreased in the water column for example model simulation in galveston bay about 200 km north of the study area illustrates that oxygen concentration could quickly decrease to zero from ambient concentration in one hour without benthic photosynthesis an and joye 2001 the nearly balanced nem was comparable to other lagoonal estuaries in new river estuary of north carolina nem was between 3 0 1 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 crosswell et al 2017 however its annual fco2 0 2 2 0 mol c m 2 yr 1 was only half of what we found in the nwgom estuaries it is notable that similar magnitude of carbon budgets had been observed between flooding and hurricane periods fig 4f and h the comparable frv dic frv toc and fl toc were indicative of analogous terrestrial runoff this similarity could be reflected by the comparable salinities during these two periods table a3 likely the storm pulses were followed by maximum discharge to estuary paerl et al 2018 such discharge should depend on the varying hydrology in each estuarine system and the connected watershed 4 2 importance of lateral exchange from tidal wetlands saltmarsh and mangroves tidal saltmarsh and mangrove systems are among the most productive ecosystems on earth bouillon et al 2008 cai 2011 in general the major mechanisms that drive fl between saltmarshes mangroves and estuaries should include tidal exchange sgd eddy diffusion and rain maher et al 2018 santos et al 2019 however their role in estuarine carbon cycle remains largely unsolved because of difficulties in making direct measurements previous studies showed wide ranges between 3 4 102 2 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 for fl toc and 11 9 177 0 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 for fl dic respectively table 2 in the current study annual frv introduced only a small portion of total inputs 13 5 for toc and 37 3 for dic in contrast fl toc was more than 6 times of frv toc and fl dic was almost double of frv dic given that the nwgom coastline has an extensive distribution of saltmarshes and mangroves nearly half of the entire u s east coast table 2 previously overlooked tidal wetland systems may serve as an important carbon source to coastal waters in this semiarid area if converted to tidal wetland yields annual fluxes normalized to wetland area fl toc and fl dic could reach 16 7 21 4 and 33 5 5 1 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 these values coincided with those from u s east coast and australia east coast table 2 where riverine carbon is the dominant carbon source 67 8 in u s east coast najjar et al 2018 note that in river dominated ge 70 of total dic inputs were transported by river discharge consequently carbon exchange in tidal wetlands should be a focus of ocean dominated estuary carbon budget studies consistent with earlier studies wang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 fl toc and fl dic in nwgom estuaries also exhibited seasonal patterns fig 2b and e i e high fl toc but low fl dic in spring and summer as compared to low fl toc but high fl dic in winter one explanation was high dic uptake due to the maximum plant growth rate in spring and summer for wetland system wang et al 2016 additionally concurrent floods flushed more surface organic carbon from wetlands to estuaries walker et al 2021 whereas high dic doc ratio sgd in winter favored high fl dic murgulet et al 2018 however given its large spatiotemporal variability more detailed quantification of the lateral exchange is desired for future estuarine carbon budget studies fco2 in these estuaries may be largely dependent on fl p 0 001 for both fl toc and fl dic in fig 5 a and b while fl toc contributed significantly to fco2 change coastwide fig 5a the effect of fl dic on fco2 varied from one estuary to another this variation can be attributed to varying primary production in different estuaries as river input decreased to the southwest this is indicated by the declining co2 emission or even occasional co2 uptake figs 2g and 3 and relatively stronger autotrophy in the southern estuaries mae and ne was largely due to the limited riverine organic matter supply therefore the significant inverse relationship between fl dic and fco2 in mae and ne both p 0 001 fig 5b also indicates the potentially greater contribution on estuarine autotrophic activities from lateral exchange nevertheless the close relationship between fl toc and fnem across the four estuaries r 0 924 n 140 p 0 001 fig 5c highlights the significant support of tidal wetlands on estuarine nem as frv toc was generally small overall fig 3 4 3 integrated carbon budget in nwgom coast the area normalized annual estuarine co2 emission of the nwgom coast was 4 0 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 within the range of the area normalized values from the atlantic coast 4 6 1 9 mol c m 2 yr 1 najjar et al 2018 but almost two times of the value from the entire north america coast 2 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 chen et al 2013 moreover area normalized co2 emission in all gom estuaries could reach 4 3 4 8 mol c m 2 yr 1 by integrating our observations and those in the literature table a6 this value was almost half of the arithmetic mean in windham myers et al 2018 who found gom estuarine co2 flux at an above average level 8 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 among the north american coasts in addition based on the arithmetic mean of our findings and existing observation based fco2 the updated average of all north america estuarine co2 emission could reach 5 8 9 0 mol c m 2 yr 1 table a6 note that tidal rivers were counted in those high estuarine co2 efflux regions e g 36 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in shark river estuary florida ho et al 2016 25 3 mol c m 2 yr 1 in altamaha sound georgia coast jiang et al 2008 fig 6 nevertheless given that previous syntheses of co2 fluxes were heavily skewed towards the atlantic coastal estuaries chen et al 2013 najjar et al 2018 our findings highlight the diverse set of responses in different estuaries and the current lack of spatial coverage in estuarine co2 flux studies in general fig 6 based on the current study and the literature the relatively high estuarine co2 emissions are mostly in shallow 5 m subtropical regions surrounded by extensive tidal wetlands nwgom florida and southern atlantic bight fig 6 table a6 one important reason for the high co2 flux was due to high riverine co2 in the southern u s a pco2 ranged 4000 6000 μatm butman and raymond 2011 or high wind speeds yao and hu 2017 although the lateral carbon exchange from saltmarshes and mangroves have not been adequately accounted for in explaining estuarine co2 flux windham myers et al 2018 estimated a carbon sequestration rate of 24 4 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 in the nwgom wetlands which is about 6 times of the global average 4 8 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 chmura et al 2003 this together with estimated estuarine carbon deposition rate found in the current study could make nwgom coast an important carbon storage region also known as the blue carbon 32 4 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 normalized to wetland area nevertheless an improved re evaluation of coastal carbon deposition is required particularly with respect to future estuarine sedimentary carbon flux research to better constrain the rate of blue carbon conservation fl dic and fl toc contributed 62 7 and 86 5 of dic and toc inputs to nwgom estuaries respectively fig 7 as a whole 36 5 of the dic input contributed to co2 emission and nem the remaining counted toward oceanic export yet on the toc side sediment deposition only accounted for about one third of the total input leaving 70 for estuarine export therefore carbon fluxes from nwgom estuaries appear to largely depend on its extensive tidal wetlands 4 4 uncertainties integrating process based fluxes could easily propagate the uncertainties uncertainty from each term was analyzed in table a7 note that we claimed a 100 uncertainty for both sedimentation rates and sgd due to their high variabilities based on literature data regardless the carbon budget components showed a good agreement between total carbon loading and export fig 7 our estimated nem from co2 flux displayed a range between 312 5 145 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 similar to the finding in russell and montagna 2007 who estimated a nem range of 250 187 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 based on in situ open water monitoring however even the direct nem observations may suffer uncertainties from different methodologies gazeau et al 2005 in addition aggregated fl toc and fl dic were estimated at 4 5 5 7 and 8 9 1 4 mol c m 2 yr 1 the fluxes could be further converted to wetland yields as 16 7 21 4 and 33 5 5 1 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 respectively these values agreed with other tidal saltmarsh and mangrove systems as well table 2 however direct measurements with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution are strongly recommended due to the highly dynamic tidal and sgd movements 5 conclusions the coastal carbon budget is important and highly dynamic our mass balance model indicates that lateral exchange from saltmarsh and mangrove habitats was a key driver to carbon budget in subtropical nwgom lagoonal estuaries for example lateral toc exchange could explain almost 86 5 of total toc input into the estuary on the other hand the entire region served as an important co2 source to the atmosphere and at same time preserved considerable amount of blue carbon the relatively high estuarine air water co2 fluxes demonstrated the need for more extensive studies focusing on carbon cycling along the gom coast to better constrain the north american coastal carbon budget which is currently skewed toward the east coast attempts to assess coastal carbon budget variability requires incorporation of estuarine hydrology our four year dataset over various hydrologic conditions revealed as much as 2 10 times increase in estuarine co2 flux driven by floods compared with non flooding or dry periods however the magnitude of change depended on estuarine residence time and the amount of freshwater inflow that each estuary received therefore these estimates highlight the necessity of long term regional focus to predict the future coastal carbon budget trajectories under changing hydrological conditions as a result of climate

16065,as coastal areas become more vulnerable to climatic impacts the need for understanding estuarine carbon budgets with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution arises under various hydrologic extremes ranging from drought to hurricane induced flooding a mass balance model was constructed for carbon fluxes and their variabilities in four estuaries along the northwestern gulf of mexico nwgom coast over a four year period 2014 2018 loading of total organic carbon toc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic to estuaries included riverine discharge and lateral exchange from tidal wetlands the lateral exchanges of toc and dic reached 4 5 5 7 and 8 9 1 4 mol c m 2 yr 1 accounting for 86 5 and 62 7 of total toc and dic inputs into these estuaries respectively a relatively high regional co2 efflux 4 0 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 was found which was two times the average value in north american coastal estuaries reported in the literature oceanic export was the major pathway for losses of toc 5 6 1 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 81 2 of total and dic 9 9 2 9 mol c m 2 yr 1 69 7 of total the carbon budget exhibited high variability in response to hydrologic changes for example storm or hurricane induced flooding elevated co2 efflux by 2 10 times in short periods of time flood following a drought also increased lateral toc exchange from 3 5 4 7 to 67 8 17 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 but decreased lateral dic exchange from 28 9 3 5 to 7 1 7 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 the large variability of carbon budgets highlights the importance of high resolution spatiotemporal coverage under different hydrologic conditions and the importance of carbon contribution from tidal wetlands to coastal carbon cycling keywords estuarine carbon budget air water co2 flux lateral exchange hydrologic changes 1 introduction coastal areas consisting of tidal wetlands and estuaries play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle attempts to synthesize estuarine carbon budgets must deal with its high spatiotemporal heterogeneity that is due to geomorphological climatic and hydrologic differences bauer et al 2013 more importantly the lack of direct observations creates challenges with identifying exchange between tidal wetlands and estuarine waters najjar et al 2018 even though a broad consensus regarding tidal wetlands significance on estuarine carbon processing has recently emerged maher et al 2018 santos et al 2021 generally tidal wetlands transport carbon through lateral exchange including tidal activities and submarine groundwater discharge santos et al 2021 thus a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution is needed to constrain these non point source driven exchanges santos et al 2019 tamborski et al 2021 however comprehensive budgets that combine organic and inorganic carbon fluxes over annual or longer timescales have been scarce bogard et al 2020 although wet dry climatic cycles have been reported to alternate estuarine systems between heterotrophy and autotrophy yao et al 2020 the variability of the coastal carbon cycle in response to hydrologic change remains understudied all climate models predict the high possibility of hydrologic extremes e g drought and flooding in tropical and subtropical estuaries liu et al 2019 sherwood and fu 2014 therefore elucidating carbon budget variability spanning a full hydrologic spectrum is important to improve our knowledge and predict responses to future climate change carbon fluxes can be estimated in several different ways process based models that couple estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry can link organic and inorganic carbon cycles gordon et al 1996 however detailed information at fine spatial and temporal scales is required to constrain potential errors in these models bauer et al 2013 kemp et al 1997 on the other hand mass balance approaches based on observations and stoichiometric relationships may amplify uncertainties because of the propagation of errors smith et al 1991 nevertheless models based on the latter approach can sepaprate individual processes that significantly influence the regional carbon cycle and errors could be constrained or at least recognized if temporal and spatial patterns are chosen carefully maher and eyre 2012 there are few carbon budget estimates in subtropical estuaries worldwide crosswell et al 2017 maher and eyre 2012 tanner and eyre 2020 the northwestern gulf of mexico nwgom has the world s largest lagoonal estuary laguna madre of both texas u s a and tamaulipas mexico and many other smaller lagoonal estuaries dürr et al 2011 i e estuaries that are separated from the coastal ocean by barrier islands through which channels and waterways connect the water bodies on the nwgom coast river discharge or inflow decreases sharply southward which is one of the most distinctive hydrologic features in this area montagna et al 2013 climate fluctuations between drought and flood periods further alter and drive the hydrologic conditions of this coastal region yao and hu 2017 yao et al 2020 moreover nwgom coast has a long history of hurricane landfalls roth 2010 through studying these estuarine systems that share geomorphological similarities it is possible to assess the effects of hydrologic variations on the coastal carbon cycle and provide useful information for future climate change related investigations the objectives of this study were to 1 construct comprehensive carbon budgets for nwgom estuaries using a mass balance model based on bi weekly i e twice a month to quarterly observations 2 examine different biogeochemical drivers for processes including riverine inflow lateral exchange burial air water co2 flux net ecosystem metabolism nem and oceanic export and 3 assess the climatic impact on the estuarine carbon budget including alternating between drought and flood conditions 2 methods 2 1 study sites four nwgom estuaries fig 1 a lavaca colorado estuary lce guadalupe estuary ge mission aransas estuary mae and nueces estuary ne were investigated from april 2014 to april 2018 average depth of these microtidal estuaries is approximately 1 m table 1 and these estuaries have restricted connections to the nwgom due to the presence of a series of barrier islands fig 1 each estuary receives input from one or two rivers we designated the upper estuary as the area subject to more freshwater influence from rivers whereas the lower estuary represents the area connected with the nwgom through a tidal inlet the only exception was ge which is river inflow dominated due to its limited tidal exchange fig 1 montagna and kalke 1992 hurricane harvey a category 4 storm made landfall near the southern end of this coastal area on 25 august 2017 walker et al 2021 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analyses field campaigns on different intervals were

ph measurements were conducted at 25 0 1 c and the lab measured ph values were converted to the total scale at in situ temperature using co2sys with dic and lab measured ph as the input variables following the method in yao and hu 2017 to assess the estuarine carbon budget variability we categorized the wide hydrologic range into four study periods drought d and flood relaxation fr that both were under dry condition flooding f and post hurricane h that both were under wet condition hydrologic definitions were based on the quartiles of mean salinities more details in table a3 the only

crosswell et al 2017 maher and eyre 2012 tanner and eyre 2020 a steady state assumption was made for the nwgom estuaries the steady state mass balance equation for estuarine dic can be written as 1 f

µatm mccutcheon et al 2021 2 7 net ecosystem metabolism fnem because mixed layer benthic and pelagic metabolic processes would generate consume co2 and influence fco2 directly nem was estimated using

seasonality was observed with high river discharge in spring and summer in response to storm driven flooding in 2015 2016 and 2017 but fall and winter had much less discharge as a result frv dic and frv toc had similar seasonal patterns but different magnitudes fig 2 a and d during the spring to summer flooding period maximum frv dic in lce and ge reached 84 4 and 59 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively while those in mae and ne were substantially lower 27 8 and 16 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively similarly maximum frv toc were 8 6 and 14 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 for lce and ge respectively compared to 7 4 and 2 3 mmol c m 2 d 1 for mae and ne respectively 3 2 air water co2 flux all four estuaries were net co2 sources to the atmosphere fig 3 with distinct spatiotemporal patterns fig 2g fco2 ranged 15 120 mmol c m 2 d 1 in spring and summer these estuaries had higher co2 emission up to 120 mmol c m 2 d 1 as a result of flooding yao and hu 2017 yao et al 2020 the peak of co2 efflux values in lce and ge 100 mmol c m 2 d 1 were five times of those in mae and ne 20 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 2g the maximum co2 efflux occurred when the first major storm struck at the end april 2015 after a four year extreme drought yao and hu 2017 in comparison fco2 decreased and even changed sign 15 35 mmol c m 2 d 1 in fall and winter nevertheless average co2 flux in lce and ge 10 mmol c m 2 d 1 under this low freshwater conditions was ten times of mae and ne average 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 overall annual average fco2 in lce and ge was an order of magnitude higher than those in mae and ne fig 3 3 3 nem derived from fco2 empirically the fnem variations were anticorrelated with the fco2 pattern the fnem values were lowest in spring and summer 0 5 5 6 and 27 7 10 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively indicating the seasonal heterotrophy increasing nem in fall 7 5 7 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 and winter 35 5 3 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 showed switching to autotrophic conditions annual fnem values suggested heterotrophic dominance in the northern estuaries i e lce and ge whereas yearly autotrophy was found in the southern estuaries mae and ne fig 3 3 4 sediment deposition annual average sediment organic carbon deposition flux fd was 2 3 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 in lce with 1 9 0 2 and 3 1 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 in dry and wet conditions respectively fd was the highest in ge at 4 7 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 4 8 0 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 in dry and 5 7 0 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 in wet conditions then fd declined toward the south averaged 1 7 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 with 1 2 0 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 in dry and 4 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in wet conditions in mae and averaged 0 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 with 0 6 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in dry and 0 7 0 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in wet conditions in ne figs 2i and 3 3 5 export to the coastal ocean area normalized fex dic was between 24 109 mmol c m 2 d 1 and fex toc was 103 132 mmol c m 2 d 1 in all estuaries combined fig 2c and f the highest monthly fex dic and fex toc were found in ge february 2017 and in lce april 2016 respectively occasional negative fex dic in mae and ne indicated a possible oceanic water supply under drought conditions when riverine inputs were low to compensate for evaporative water loss consistent with river inflows these estuaries exported most dic and toc to the gom in winter and spring 38 6 4 1 and 19 2 3 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively coastwide minimum fex dic occurred in summer 20 6 2 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 and minimum fex toc in fall 11 3 2 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 during which time the minimum fex dic ranged from 2 4 1 3 ne to 32 4 6 0 ge mmol c m 2 d 1 and the minimum fex toc fluctuated between 2 8 5 6 ne and 16 9 5 9 ge mmol c m 2 d 1 among the annual fex values dic export from the southern estuary ne 3 5 0 5 mol c m 2 yr 1 was found to be only 1 5 of that from the northern estuary ge 17 5 1 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 similarly the lowest annual toc export was found in ne 0 6 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 fig 3 3 6 lateral exchange although average dic and doc fluxes due to sgd in upper ne 4050 and 840 mmol c m 2 d 1 respectively were estimated from a previous study murgulet et al 2018 these overwhelmingly high carbon inflows should diminish toward lower estuary so that can be balanced by much lower estuarine carbon export sections 3 2 3 4 and 3 5 due to possible error amplification from limited data coverage lateral exchanges were calculated as the residual term from the mass balance models eqs 1 and 2 rather than the sgd study directly area normalized fl dic ranged from 173 1 96 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 and fl toc ranged from 96 2 301 6 mmol c m 2 d 1 fig 2b e the southern estuaries mae and ne had the higher annual fl dic while larger annual fl toc were found in the northern estuaries lce and ge respectively fig 3 the averaged fl dic of all four estuaries reached the maximum 48 0 3 8 mmol c m 2 d 1 and minimum 0 6 5 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 values in winter and summer respectively although fl toc varied in the opposite direction maximum 39 8 12 8 mmol c m 2 d 1 in summer and minimum 20 2 4 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 in winter fig 2b e 3 7 carbon budget the annual carbon budget in each estuary was calculated by the area integrated dic and toc fluxes fig 3 the largest dic input was fl dic in particular fl dic in ne was estimated to be almost ten times of frv dic on the other hand fco2 and fex dic were the two major dic loss pathways from nwgom estuaries in addition autotrophic activities appeared to be another important dic loss term in southern estuaries mae and ne on the organic carbon side the averaged fl toc of all four estuaries was the major total toc input term which was almost seven times of frv toc in this region in addition annual nem revealed varying trophic status from heterotrophy to autotrophy when moving southward fex toc contributed 75 of total toc outflow although it behaved differently among these four subsystems fd was another important toc loss term which was estimated to account for the remaining 25 of total toc outflow compared to the above fluxes fp and fca were small enough so that they were omitted in the overall budget fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 hydrologic controls on estuarine carbon budgets during our study period the nwgom coast experienced extreme hydrologic changes between dry and wet conditions including the end of extreme drought prior to april 2015 and a category 4 storm hurricane harvey in fall 2017 both flooding and flood relaxation occurred at multiple periods over time fl toc fco2 and fnem experienced the largest changes across different periods fig 4 fco2 indicates large estuarine co2 emission rates 5 3 2 7 44 3 25 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 across all conditions flooding from hurricane harvey increased fco2 by 2 10 times compared to the baseline values with most pronounced increase in lce 4 5 10 9 to 40 7 4 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 and ge 9 6 6 7 to 96 7 72 0 mmol c m 2 d 1 compared to mae 7 3 1 3 to 15 4 2 9 mmol c m 2 d 1 and ne 3 8 2 7 to 11 0 8 2 mmol c m 2 d 1 that had smaller increases two estuaries mae and ne were on the dry side of the storm and riverine input did not substantially increase as shown by their lower frv dic and frv toc fig 2a and d this co2 flux increase in lce and ge was consistent with other studies that also found 5 10 times elevation of estuarine co2 efflux due to either storms or storm induced flooding crosswell et al 2014 van dam et al 2018 hu et al 2020 such increase could be attributed to enhanced heterotrophy in response to discharge events russell et al 2006 as well as riverine co2 ventilation yao et al 2020 walker et al 2021 also found bottom hypoxia in ge after hurricane harvey in 2017 similarly fex dic and frv dic followed the fco2 pattern fig 4 our study assessed the hydrologic effect on lateral carbon exchange in nwgom estuaries as expected storm and hurricane driven flooding increased fl toc from 3 5 4 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 drought to 72 6 37 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 hurricane fig 4d to h this enhanced exchange was most likely caused by large surface runoff walker et al 2021 because residence time is a key control on estuarine organic carbon degradation hopkinson 1988 the moderate to long residence time in these four estuaries 39 360 d table 1 particularly in mae and ne was likely responsible for organic carbon processing hence related carbon fluxes these values indicate that storm flushed organic matter from tidal wetlands supported large estuarine heterotrophy and co2 emission in wet condition which further confirmed the crucial role of lateral exchange in contrast fl dic was found to decrease from 28 9 3 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 drought to 20 2 31 1 mmol c m 2 d 1 hurricane fig 4d to h this indicates increased dic uptake at tidal wetland side under wet condition russell et al 2006 concluded that heterotrophic nem in this region would not exceed 5 mg o2 l 1 d 1 or 312 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 based on the average depth of 1 m by integrating open water and benthic chamber results annually aggregated nem 1 7 3 5 mol c m 2 yr 1 indicates a balance between primary production and remineralization coastwide yet with a large range from heterotrophic northern estuaries to autotrophic southern estuaries fig 3 however the coastwide autotrophy during drought 11 8 3 3 mmol c m 2 d 1 and flood relaxation 15 1 5 4 mmol c m 2 d 1 periods could be attributed to benthic activities once dic became more available while toc decreased in the water column for example model simulation in galveston bay about 200 km north of the study area illustrates that oxygen concentration could quickly decrease to zero from ambient concentration in one hour without benthic photosynthesis an and joye 2001 the nearly balanced nem was comparable to other lagoonal estuaries in new river estuary of north carolina nem was between 3 0 1 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 crosswell et al 2017 however its annual fco2 0 2 2 0 mol c m 2 yr 1 was only half of what we found in the nwgom estuaries it is notable that similar magnitude of carbon budgets had been observed between flooding and hurricane periods fig 4f and h the comparable frv dic frv toc and fl toc were indicative of analogous terrestrial runoff this similarity could be reflected by the comparable salinities during these two periods table a3 likely the storm pulses were followed by maximum discharge to estuary paerl et al 2018 such discharge should depend on the varying hydrology in each estuarine system and the connected watershed 4 2 importance of lateral exchange from tidal wetlands saltmarsh and mangroves tidal saltmarsh and mangrove systems are among the most productive ecosystems on earth bouillon et al 2008 cai 2011 in general the major mechanisms that drive fl between saltmarshes mangroves and estuaries should include tidal exchange sgd eddy diffusion and rain maher et al 2018 santos et al 2019 however their role in estuarine carbon cycle remains largely unsolved because of difficulties in making direct measurements previous studies showed wide ranges between 3 4 102 2 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 for fl toc and 11 9 177 0 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 for fl dic respectively table 2 in the current study annual frv introduced only a small portion of total inputs 13 5 for toc and 37 3 for dic in contrast fl toc was more than 6 times of frv toc and fl dic was almost double of frv dic given that the nwgom coastline has an extensive distribution of saltmarshes and mangroves nearly half of the entire u s east coast table 2 previously overlooked tidal wetland systems may serve as an important carbon source to coastal waters in this semiarid area if converted to tidal wetland yields annual fluxes normalized to wetland area fl toc and fl dic could reach 16 7 21 4 and 33 5 5 1 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 these values coincided with those from u s east coast and australia east coast table 2 where riverine carbon is the dominant carbon source 67 8 in u s east coast najjar et al 2018 note that in river dominated ge 70 of total dic inputs were transported by river discharge consequently carbon exchange in tidal wetlands should be a focus of ocean dominated estuary carbon budget studies consistent with earlier studies wang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 fl toc and fl dic in nwgom estuaries also exhibited seasonal patterns fig 2b and e i e high fl toc but low fl dic in spring and summer as compared to low fl toc but high fl dic in winter one explanation was high dic uptake due to the maximum plant growth rate in spring and summer for wetland system wang et al 2016 additionally concurrent floods flushed more surface organic carbon from wetlands to estuaries walker et al 2021 whereas high dic doc ratio sgd in winter favored high fl dic murgulet et al 2018 however given its large spatiotemporal variability more detailed quantification of the lateral exchange is desired for future estuarine carbon budget studies fco2 in these estuaries may be largely dependent on fl p 0 001 for both fl toc and fl dic in fig 5 a and b while fl toc contributed significantly to fco2 change coastwide fig 5a the effect of fl dic on fco2 varied from one estuary to another this variation can be attributed to varying primary production in different estuaries as river input decreased to the southwest this is indicated by the declining co2 emission or even occasional co2 uptake figs 2g and 3 and relatively stronger autotrophy in the southern estuaries mae and ne was largely due to the limited riverine organic matter supply therefore the significant inverse relationship between fl dic and fco2 in mae and ne both p 0 001 fig 5b also indicates the potentially greater contribution on estuarine autotrophic activities from lateral exchange nevertheless the close relationship between fl toc and fnem across the four estuaries r 0 924 n 140 p 0 001 fig 5c highlights the significant support of tidal wetlands on estuarine nem as frv toc was generally small overall fig 3 4 3 integrated carbon budget in nwgom coast the area normalized annual estuarine co2 emission of the nwgom coast was 4 0 0 7 mol c m 2 yr 1 within the range of the area normalized values from the atlantic coast 4 6 1 9 mol c m 2 yr 1 najjar et al 2018 but almost two times of the value from the entire north america coast 2 2 mol c m 2 yr 1 chen et al 2013 moreover area normalized co2 emission in all gom estuaries could reach 4 3 4 8 mol c m 2 yr 1 by integrating our observations and those in the literature table a6 this value was almost half of the arithmetic mean in windham myers et al 2018 who found gom estuarine co2 flux at an above average level 8 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 among the north american coasts in addition based on the arithmetic mean of our findings and existing observation based fco2 the updated average of all north america estuarine co2 emission could reach 5 8 9 0 mol c m 2 yr 1 table a6 note that tidal rivers were counted in those high estuarine co2 efflux regions e g 36 1 mol c m 2 yr 1 in shark river estuary florida ho et al 2016 25 3 mol c m 2 yr 1 in altamaha sound georgia coast jiang et al 2008 fig 6 nevertheless given that previous syntheses of co2 fluxes were heavily skewed towards the atlantic coastal estuaries chen et al 2013 najjar et al 2018 our findings highlight the diverse set of responses in different estuaries and the current lack of spatial coverage in estuarine co2 flux studies in general fig 6 based on the current study and the literature the relatively high estuarine co2 emissions are mostly in shallow 5 m subtropical regions surrounded by extensive tidal wetlands nwgom florida and southern atlantic bight fig 6 table a6 one important reason for the high co2 flux was due to high riverine co2 in the southern u s a pco2 ranged 4000 6000 μatm butman and raymond 2011 or high wind speeds yao and hu 2017 although the lateral carbon exchange from saltmarshes and mangroves have not been adequately accounted for in explaining estuarine co2 flux windham myers et al 2018 estimated a carbon sequestration rate of 24 4 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 in the nwgom wetlands which is about 6 times of the global average 4 8 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 chmura et al 2003 this together with estimated estuarine carbon deposition rate found in the current study could make nwgom coast an important carbon storage region also known as the blue carbon 32 4 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 normalized to wetland area nevertheless an improved re evaluation of coastal carbon deposition is required particularly with respect to future estuarine sedimentary carbon flux research to better constrain the rate of blue carbon conservation fl dic and fl toc contributed 62 7 and 86 5 of dic and toc inputs to nwgom estuaries respectively fig 7 as a whole 36 5 of the dic input contributed to co2 emission and nem the remaining counted toward oceanic export yet on the toc side sediment deposition only accounted for about one third of the total input leaving 70 for estuarine export therefore carbon fluxes from nwgom estuaries appear to largely depend on its extensive tidal wetlands 4 4 uncertainties integrating process based fluxes could easily propagate the uncertainties uncertainty from each term was analyzed in table a7 note that we claimed a 100 uncertainty for both sedimentation rates and sgd due to their high variabilities based on literature data regardless the carbon budget components showed a good agreement between total carbon loading and export fig 7 our estimated nem from co2 flux displayed a range between 312 5 145 7 mmol c m 2 d 1 similar to the finding in russell and montagna 2007 who estimated a nem range of 250 187 5 mmol c m 2 d 1 based on in situ open water monitoring however even the direct nem observations may suffer uncertainties from different methodologies gazeau et al 2005 in addition aggregated fl toc and fl dic were estimated at 4 5 5 7 and 8 9 1 4 mol c m 2 yr 1 the fluxes could be further converted to wetland yields as 16 7 21 4 and 33 5 5 1 mol c m 2 wetland yr 1 respectively these values agreed with other tidal saltmarsh and mangrove systems as well table 2 however direct measurements with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution are strongly recommended due to the highly dynamic tidal and sgd movements 5 conclusions the coastal carbon budget is important and highly dynamic our mass balance model indicates that lateral exchange from saltmarsh and mangrove habitats was a key driver to carbon budget in subtropical nwgom lagoonal estuaries for example lateral toc exchange could explain almost 86 5 of total toc input into the estuary on the other hand the entire region served as an important co2 source to the atmosphere and at same time preserved considerable amount of blue carbon the relatively high estuarine air water co2 fluxes demonstrated the need for more extensive studies focusing on carbon cycling along the gom coast to better constrain the north american coastal carbon budget which is currently skewed toward the east coast attempts to assess coastal carbon budget variability requires incorporation of estuarine hydrology our four year dataset over various hydrologic conditions revealed as much as 2 10 times increase in estuarine co2 flux driven by floods compared with non flooding or dry periods however the magnitude of change depended on estuarine residence time and the amount of freshwater inflow that each estuary received therefore these estimates highlight the necessity of long term regional focus to predict the future coastal carbon budget trajectories under changing hydrological conditions as a result of climate

wilfert et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the hypothesis of our study was that iron can be recovered from groundwater as vivianite when phosphate is dosed anaerobically vivianite can form from fe2 with either

strategy for groundwater is strictly abiotic which makes the process conditions unique compared to previous research on vivianite formation consequently known factors to influence vivianite formation such as co occurring constituents or solution ph might be different the main objective of this research was therefore to investigate abiotic precipitation of vivianite from anaerobic groundwater with a particular focus on iron removal efficiencies kinetics and sludge volumes to do so experiments were conducted with natural and synthetic groundwater under strictly anaerobic conditions produced solids were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd to determine presence of vivianite 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic and natural groundwater the experiments were conducted with two types of water i a synthetic iron solution where 50 ml of a 0 018 m fecl2 4 h2o sigma aldrich stock solution was added to 400 ml demineralised deoxygenated water flushed with n2 impurity 200 vpm for at least 45 min in advance and ii natural groundwater collected at a groundwater treatment plant in loosdrecht the netherlands in synthetic water the iron removal efficiency was measured for initial concentrations of 1 10 25 50 and 100 mg fe l in groundwater experiments were executed with the background iron concentration around 3 8 mg fe l see table 1 to ensure enough precipitate would form for further analysis groundwater was also spiked with fecl2 to reach an elevated concentration of 100 mg fe l to prevent air contamination of the natural groundwater samples 1 l glass bottles schott duran were filled with a tube at the bottom and the water volume was replaced ten times before closing them with bromobutyl rubber stoppers secured with an open topped cap after transportation the bottles were stored in an anaerobic environment prior to the experiment the natural groundwater was vacuum filtered with a 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane pall supor in the anaerobic environment the average composition and ph of the natural groundwater are presented in table 1 the phosphate and carbonate stock solutions used were prepared in the anaerobic environment by dissolving respectively na2hpo4 and na2co3 to obtain a 0 018 m po4 co3 solution in oxygen free water all chemicals met or exceeded acs reagent grade 2 2 experimental setup a vinyl pvc anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products usa filled with a gas mixture of 5 hydrogen and 95 argon gas impurity 200 vpm was used for the anaerobic experiments the chamber had an airlock and weekly regenerated palladium catalysts to secure anaerobic conditions water vapour was entrapped by silica beads to keep the humidity 70 measured by a hygrometer all experiments were performed at room temperature of approximately 21 c the approach of the experiments is presented in fig 1 a glass reactor with 450 ml of either the synthetic or natural groundwater was placed on a magnetic stirrer while stirring continuously 50 ml of the phosphate stock solution was added to achieve a 1 1 molar ratio phosphate iron after which the solutions could react anaerobically to track reaction kinetics water samples were taken during the reaction and when no additional iron removal was observed solids were collected for xrd all water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 µm non sterile millex syringe filter with durapore membrane and acidified with hcl to bring the ph below 4 to prevent further reaction an aeration step was added fig 1 right after the anaerobic reaction the reactor was removed from the anaerobic chamber and flushed with compressed air for 10 min after a 50 min period the suspension was transferred to a plastic imhoff cone of 1 l the volume of the liquid and sludge was measured after one day of settling and solids were collected for xrd a set of reference experiments simulated the conventional treatment of oxidation and filtration in which no phosphate was dosed for anaerobic iron precipitation to compare sludge volumes a set of experiments was conducted following the same procedure in which carbonate was anaerobically dosed instead of phosphate 2 3 analysis during the experiments the ph

absorbence and automatically calculated concentrations in the experiments in which natural groundwater was used total iron and phosphorus concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the samples for icp ms analysis were acidified by adding 65 ultrapure hno3 to 1 vol xrd was applied to characterize the precipitates the suspension was vacuum filtered with a 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane pall supor for the anaerobic samples the filter was covered in aluminium foil to prevent photo oxidation and dried inside the anaerobic chamber for a day afterwards the filter was covered with a layer of glycerol to minimise oxidation during xrd analysis open to the atmosphere a bruker d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation was used for the xrd analysis with coupled µ 2µ scan 10 120 step size 0 030 2µ counting time per step 2 s bruker software diffracsuite eva vs 5 2 was used for the data evaluation 2 4 geochemical model the saturation index of vivianite was calculated using the program spec8 of the geochemist s workbench gwb model and the standard database the input was the measured iron and phosphate concentrations ph and temperature 3 results 3 1 vivianite precipitation in synthetic water at initial iron concentrations above 25 mg l phosphate addition to the synthetic anaerobic solution removed iron from the water with a maximum recovery of approximately 79 fig 2 a xrd analysis of the generated solid phases showed that only vivianite crystallised in the samples fig 2b at the lower initial concentration of 10 mg fe l iron recovery remained below 35 and for 1 mg fe l no iron removal was observed the ph of the system depended on the concentration of iron and phosphate for 1 mg fe l the ph was around 7 7 while it was 6 9 for an initial concentration of 100 mg fe l 3 2 vivianite precipitation in natural groundwater anaerobic phosphate addition to natural groundwater also resulted in iron removal by vivianite crystallisation with the background iron concentration of around 3 8 mg l the anaerobic removal was 16 9 for the spiked groundwater with an elevated iron concentration of 100 mg l 93 7 of iron was recovered via vivianite crystallisation fig 3 a an additional oxidation step after the anaerobic reaction increased iron removal to 98 2 and 99 9 for the background and elevated iron concentrations respectively in both waters the efficiencies were approximately 3 5 higher than in the reference experiment of oxidation only the addition of an anaerobic removal step improved the removal efficiencies vivianite was the only solid phase detected by xrd in this experiment also after oxidation fig 3b pictures of the blue precipitate on the filter are presented in fig 3c and 3d the mass of anaerobic precipitate formed with the background iron concentration was too low to detect by xrd it is worth noting that to protect the samples from oxidation during xrd analysis the anaerobic precipitates were covered with glycerol see section 2 3 the background signal in fig 2b and in the lower diffractogram of fig 3b are probably caused by the glycerol the glycerol was not added to the aerobic vivianite sample shown in the upper diffractogram of fig 3b rouzies and millet 1993 specified that vivianite alters to metavivianite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o at 50 iron oxidation in vivianite which can be distinguished via its altered xrd spectrum rothe et al 2014 no metavivianite is detected in the solids formed during the executed experiments of iron removal in groundwater it is therefore concluded that the iron in the formed crystals were mainly present in its reduced fe ii form even when an additional oxidation step was applied 3 3 kinetics and si in fig 4 the removal kinetics black circles and calculated si blue squares are depicted for the experiments with synthetic and natural groundwater containing an elevated initial iron concentration of 100 mg fe l iron removal stopped after 10 min in the synthetic solution while in natural groundwater the removal continued for 60 min a second order removal rate was found for both the iron removal in synthetic and natural groundwater black lines the rate constants were found to be 2 7 m 1s 1 95 confidence interval 1 7 3 6 and 2 3 m 1s 1 95 confidence interval 1 9 2 7 for synthetic and natural groundwater respectively the half life of iron when removed via vivianite precipitation in both synthetic and natural groundwater is approximately 4 min for an initial concentration of 100 mg fe l from fig 4 it is apparent that the vivianite precipitation reaction stopped after reaching the approximate si of 4 blue dotted line in fig 4 in the synthetic solution an si 4 is reached sooner at minute 10 than in natural water at minute 60 caused by stronger ph changes in the system a ph drop from 6 9 to 5 8 occurred during the experiment with synthetic water which was not observed in the natural groundwater due its higher alkalinity graph in supplementary information figure s 2 the calculated kinetics of both homogeneous iron oxidation with oxygen and anaerobic removal via vivianite formation are plotted in fig 5 the kinetics of homogeneous iron oxidation follows first order removal with respect to fe2 at constant ph and do the rate law used in fig 5 was determined by sung and morgan 1980 with a rate constant of k 2 1 1013 m 2 min 1 as published by schenk and weber 1968 the rate of iron oxidation strongly depends on ph fig 5 provides the rate at groundwater relevant ph s of 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 the rate of vivianite precipitation is determined at ph 7 at which the half life of iron is four times shorter than in iron oxidation at ph 7 this implies that iron recovery via vivianite precipitation has the potential to make the groundwater treatment system more efficient 3 4 ph and iron concentration the removal kinetics for the experiment with natural groundwater background iron concentration of 3 8 mg fe l are shown in fig 6 as also seen in fig 4 no additional removal is obtained when the si dropped below the value of 4 the si dropped below 4 in the first minute while the ph of the system was around 7 7 which was higher than in the two experiments with elevated iron concentrations see section 3 3 it demonstrates that both the ph and the initial iron concentration influence the si of vivianite since the ph was not controlled during the experiments the relation between si and ph was modelled for different initial iron concentrations fig 7 in synthetic water the boundary for vivianite crystallisation was found to be at a si of 4 for a low iron concentration of 1 mg l the model implies that vivianite crystallisation will only occur at a ph of 8 5 the higher iron removal in natural groundwater compared to the synthetic water can also be explained by this relationship the alkalinity of the natural groundwater avoided a strong ph drop during vivianite formation maintaining a higher si 3 5 sludge volume fig 8 a shows that anaerobic precipitation of ferrous iron with phosphate reduces the sludge volume to a third compared to the conventional iron oxidation method this considerable reduction was both obtained in the synthetic as in the spiked natural groundwater solution the sludge volume formed in the groundwater without iron spiked was too small to measure as a comparison anaerobic carbonate addition was also tested which increased the sludge volume approx 6 times compared to the oxidation method the difference in appearance and volume of the formed sludge is visible in fig 8b which also illustrates that vivianite settled better than the products of iron oxidation or carbonate addition 4 discussion 4 1 conditions for abiotic vivianite crystallisation the anaerobic groundwater conditions were shown to be feasible for abiotic vivianite crystallisation the removal efficiencies of iron in the experiments with anaerobic treatment followed by oxidation were approximately 3 5 higher compared to iron oxidation only the kinetics at neutral ph are faster the half time of iron with anaerobic precipitation is 4 times shorter compared to iron oxidation however this is only applicable to conditions where the si of vivianite crystallisation exceeds 4 this finding is in line with the outcome of liu et al 2018 who determined that the supersaturation level at which efficient crystallisation can take place is between 4 and 11 with the geochemical model it is shown that the si values of vivianite in the executed experiments were within this range in which heterogeneous crystallisation is expected to take place li and sheng 2021 in groundwater with low to moderate iron concentrations 25 mg l exceeding si 4 might be particularly challenging a possible solution to increase the si of vivianite is to elevate the ph which is a common procedure in groundwater treatment a base can be dosed alongside the phosphate or the ph can be increased by stripping co2 with a vacuum degasser oh ions can however trap the free fe2 which makes the iron unavailable for vivianite precipitation liu et al 2018 a more attractive method might be to lower the supersaturation demand by the addition of a seeding material such as quartz grains liu et al 2018 or sponge iron wu et al 2021 quartz is already a commonly used seeding material in groundwater treatment e g in anaerobic pellet softening harms and bruce robinson 1992 the addition of quartz in an anaerobic reactor before the oxidation step to offer a seeding material might therefore be a straightforward solution an alternative approach to increase the si is to concentrate the iron in groundwater prior to the addition of phosphate anaerobic nano filtration and reverse osmosis are becoming competitive options to the conventional groundwater treatment technologies since the quality of the produced water is high the processes are easy to operate and a small footprint is required chelme ayala et al 2009 however the disposal of the concentrate is an important issue regarding membrane processes van der bruggen et al 2003 which is expected to become more difficult in the future because of stricter european legislation nederlof et al 2005 anti scalants containing phosphate are often dosed during membrane filtration which can cause eutrophication in the receiving waterbodies jong et al 2013 controlled vivianite formation might be a suitable alternative to remove both the iron and phosphate in the anaerobic concentrate while the resources are recovered the concentration of iron depends on the inlet concentration and the water recovery but the concentrate typically contains 4 to 10 times higher concentrations than the feedwater chelme ayala et al 2009 making it suitable for vivianite precipitation 4 2 vivianite recovery scope for application although vivianite is known to have a market value its end use will depend on the grade of the vivianite obtained prot et al 2019 a knowledge gap in literature can be identified on the properties of the formed vivianite in waste water systems wu et al 2019 to investigate this will be a logical and valuable next step which can give clarity about the value of the recovered vivianite versus the costs of the phosphate dosage and benefits of compact iron sludge recovery of vivianite from the water can be achieved by conventional granular filtration and periodically backwashing the filter bed vivianite is a paramagnetic mineral which makes magnetic separation an alternative recovery option prot et al 2019 important to acknowledge is that phosphate is a limited resource making recovery of phosphate a key aspect of the approach in the conducted experiments phosphate was always slightly overdosed p fe ratio of 1 while theoretical ratio is 0 67 in practice residual phosphate in the produced drinking water is not desired identification of the optimal phosphate dosage for scaling up is therefore required which depends on the ph and si of the groundwater an alternative to phosphate dosage might be anaerobic iron precipitation by the addition of another anion for example fe2 can react with carbonate log k 10 59 at 25 c and sulphide log k 3 6 at 25 c liu et al 2018 which can control fe2 concentrations in anaerobic aquifers van beek et al 2021 we demonstrated that for anaerobic iron removal carbonate addition is possible but this resulted in a significant increase in sludge volume the iron carbonate interaction might also impact iron recovery via vivianite precipitation in groundwater systems that contain high inorganic carbon concentrations however both wu et al 2019 and liu et al 2018 showed that iron precipitation with phosphate favours over carbonate for alkalinity up to 1000 mg l for sulphide competition becomes significant at concentrations of 1 5 mm and the effect is neglectable up to 0 5 mm liu et al 2018 concentrations of sulphide in groundwater are not common to transcend this value thermal waters rich in h2s have a concentrations of around 0 5 mm the production of vivianite and the corresponding reduction in sludge volume can reduce the costs of water treatment the treatment of backwash water is currently a major contributor to the total cost of drinking water production turner et al 2019 additionally the production of compacter sludge reduces the transport and processing costs of the sludge vivianite also has an economic value in chemical and agricultural industries it can be used as a pigment figueiredo et al 2010 in lithium ion batteries raghupati rao and varadaraju 2015 as a slow p release fertilizer yaya et al 2015 and to replenish fe poor soils rombolà et al 2007 the above discussed advantages and possibilities make iron removal and recovery via vivianite crystallisation an interesting approach for application in groundwater treatment plants to increase the environmental and economical sustainability of the industry the concept is so far only tested in small batches given the promising results scaling up this technology will be tested in continuous flow by the addition of an anaerobic reactor prior to the existing treatment system 5 conclusion the current research successfully demonstrated the recovery of iron from anaerobic groundwater via vivianite precipitation no longer considering iron sludge a waste but rather a new resource our study offers a new approach in the drinking water industry a follow up question is how the vivianite can be recovered and reused from the stream which can make groundwater treatment a more sustainable industry our novel technique reduces the volume of iron sludge produced to a third compared to the conventional technique of iron oxidation while reaching similar or higher removal efficiencies the 4 times shorter halftime found for anaerobic iron removal at ph 7 can lead to filters with a higher throughput rate and requires less backwashing this can

anaerobic and contain reduced iron fe2 the world health organization who recommends a maximum iron concentration of 0 3 mg l in drinking water world health organization 2017 while concentrations in raw groundwater of 15 mg l are not exceptional ellis et al 2000 kortatsi et al 2007 iron removal is one of the major challenges in drinking water production from anaerobic groundwater chaturvedi and dave 2012 the conventional method of iron oxidation followed by granular filtration removes iron from the water extensively discussed by chaturvedi and dave 2012 van beek et al 2012 and others this produces large volumes of watery iron iii hydr oxide sludge with little value currently an inescapable by product of the groundwater treatment backwashing the filter and disposing the sludge are cost intensive steps in the production of potable water sharma et al 2001 turner et al 2019 in water treatment plants around the globe 10 000 tons of sludge are estimated to be produced per day dharmappa et al 1997 the reuse of waterworks sludge has been reported a key step in increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of the industry albrektiene et al 2019 babatunde and zhao 2007 although some reuse opportunities of the currently produced sludge e g as coagulant in wastewater treatment are discussed by e g ahmad et al 2016 they come with several disadvantages and the pressure to find more sustainable solutions to avoid landfill disposal increases turner et al 2019 the stringent regulations for waste disposal together with an ever increasing demand for clean and safe drinking water are the drivers to find a more efficient approach to handle the iron sludge this research proposes a novel concept to remove iron from groundwater anaerobic precipitation with phosphate to form the mineral vivianite vivianite fe3 po4 2 8 h2o is an iron ii phosphate mineral commonly found in reducing environments rich in iron and phosphate such as sediments of lakes swamps waterlogged soils wastewater sludge etc rothe et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the colourless mineral turns blue upon gradual oxidation of fe ii crystal growth can occur when the mineral saturation state is above the solubility equilibrium value the solubility product constant ksp of vivianite is reported to be 10 36 nriagu 1972 al borno and tomson 1994 found that the temperature has very little effect on the ksp of vivianite iron recovery from groundwater via vivianite crystallisation could create a compact end product instead of the watery and voluminous iron sludge the removal of iron in the reduced state contrasts the widely applied method of oxidation recently the value of vivianite precipitation has been recognized in wastewater treatment to recover phosphate po4 from the water by dosing iron wilfert et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the hypothesis of our study was that iron can be recovered from groundwater as vivianite when phosphate is dosed anaerobically vivianite can form from fe2 with either free wu et al 2019 or protonated phosphate liu et al 2018 1 1 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o 1 2 3 f e 2 2 h p o 4 2 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o 2 h 1 3 3 f e 2 2 h 2 p o 4 8 h 2 o

formation pathways where microorganisms play a direct or indirect role e g in sediments rothe et al 2016 or wastewater treatment cao et al 2019 wang et al 2018 however the proposed iron removal strategy for groundwater is strictly abiotic which makes the process conditions unique compared to previous research on vivianite formation consequently known factors to influence vivianite formation such as co occurring constituents or solution ph might be different the main objective of this research was therefore to investigate abiotic precipitation of vivianite from anaerobic groundwater with a particular focus on iron removal efficiencies kinetics and sludge volumes to do so experiments were conducted with natural and synthetic groundwater under strictly anaerobic conditions produced solids were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd to determine presence of vivianite 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic and natural groundwater the experiments were conducted with two types of water i a synthetic iron solution where 50 ml of a 0 018 m fecl2 4 h2o sigma aldrich stock solution was added to 400 ml demineralised deoxygenated water flushed with n2 impurity 200 vpm for at least 45 min in advance and ii natural groundwater collected at a groundwater treatment plant in loosdrecht the netherlands in synthetic water the iron removal efficiency was measured for initial concentrations of 1 10 25 50 and 100 mg fe l in groundwater experiments were executed with the background iron concentration around 3 8 mg fe l see table 1 to ensure enough precipitate would form for further analysis groundwater was also spiked with fecl2 to reach an elevated concentration of 100 mg fe l to prevent air contamination of the natural groundwater samples 1 l glass bottles schott duran were filled with a tube at the bottom and the water volume was replaced ten times before closing them with bromobutyl rubber stoppers secured with an open topped cap after transportation the bottles were stored in an anaerobic environment prior to the experiment the natural groundwater was vacuum filtered with a 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane pall supor in the anaerobic environment the average composition and ph of the natural groundwater are presented in table 1 the phosphate and carbonate stock solutions used were prepared in the anaerobic environment by dissolving respectively na2hpo4 and na2co3 to obtain a 0 018 m po4 co3 solution in oxygen free water all chemicals met or exceeded acs reagent grade 2 2 experimental setup a vinyl pvc anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products usa filled with a gas mixture of 5 hydrogen and 95 argon gas impurity 200 vpm was used for the anaerobic experiments the chamber had an airlock and weekly regenerated palladium catalysts to secure anaerobic conditions water vapour was entrapped by silica beads to keep the humidity 70 measured by a hygrometer all experiments were performed at room temperature of approximately 21 c the approach of the experiments is presented in fig 1 a glass reactor with 450 ml of either the synthetic or natural groundwater was placed on a magnetic stirrer while stirring continuously 50 ml of the phosphate stock solution was added to achieve a 1 1 molar ratio phosphate iron after which the solutions could react anaerobically to track reaction kinetics water samples were taken during the reaction and when no additional iron removal was observed solids were collected for xrd all water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 µm non sterile millex syringe filter with durapore membrane and acidified with hcl to bring the ph below 4 to prevent further reaction an aeration step was added fig 1 right after the anaerobic reaction the reactor was removed from the anaerobic chamber and flushed with compressed air for 10 min after a 50 min period the suspension was transferred to a plastic imhoff cone of 1 l the volume of the liquid and sludge was measured after one day of settling and solids were collected for xrd a set of reference experiments simulated the conventional treatment of oxidation and filtration in which no phosphate was dosed for anaerobic iron precipitation to compare sludge volumes a set of experiments was conducted following the same procedure in which carbonate was anaerobically dosed instead of phosphate 2 3 analysis during the experiments the ph oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and temperature were measured with a multi parameter electrode sension 5048 with mm150 multimeter hach and the dissolved oxygen do concentration with an optical do sensor wtw fdo 925 the concentration of do stayed below 0 05 mg o2 l during all experiments iron concentrations and phosphate concentrations were measured with the standard phenantroline method lck 320 kits hach for iron ii and total iron and standard molybdenum blue method lck 348 kits hach respectively a hach dr 3900 vis spectrophotometer measured the absorbence and automatically calculated concentrations in the experiments in which natural groundwater was used total iron and phosphorus concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the samples for icp ms analysis were acidified by adding 65 ultrapure hno3 to 1 vol xrd was applied to characterize the precipitates the suspension was vacuum filtered with a 0 45 µm polyethersulfone membrane pall supor for the anaerobic samples the filter was covered in aluminium foil to prevent photo oxidation and dried inside the anaerobic chamber for a day afterwards the filter was covered with a layer of glycerol to minimise oxidation during xrd analysis open to the atmosphere a bruker d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation was used for the xrd analysis with coupled µ 2µ scan 10 120 step size 0 030 2µ counting time per step 2 s bruker software diffracsuite eva vs 5 2 was used for the data evaluation 2 4 geochemical model the saturation index of vivianite was calculated using the program spec8 of the geochemist s workbench gwb model and the standard database the input was the measured iron and phosphate concentrations ph and temperature 3 results 3 1 vivianite precipitation in synthetic water at initial iron concentrations above 25 mg l phosphate addition to the synthetic anaerobic solution removed iron from the water with a maximum recovery of approximately 79 fig 2 a xrd analysis of the generated solid phases showed that only vivianite crystallised in the samples fig 2b at the lower initial concentration of 10 mg fe l iron recovery remained below 35 and for 1 mg fe l no iron removal was observed the ph of the system depended on the concentration of iron and phosphate for 1 mg fe l the ph was around 7 7 while it was 6 9 for an initial concentration of 100 mg fe l 3 2 vivianite precipitation in natural groundwater anaerobic phosphate addition to natural groundwater also resulted in iron removal by vivianite crystallisation with the background iron concentration of around 3 8 mg l the anaerobic removal was 16 9 for the spiked groundwater with an elevated iron concentration of 100 mg l 93 7 of iron was recovered via vivianite crystallisation fig 3 a an additional oxidation step after the anaerobic reaction increased iron removal to 98 2 and 99 9 for the background and elevated iron concentrations respectively in both waters the efficiencies were approximately 3 5 higher than in the reference experiment of oxidation only the addition of an anaerobic removal step improved the removal efficiencies vivianite was the only solid phase detected by xrd in this experiment also after oxidation fig 3b pictures of the blue precipitate on the filter are presented in fig 3c and 3d the mass of anaerobic precipitate formed with the background iron concentration was too low to detect by xrd it is worth noting that to protect the samples from oxidation during xrd analysis the anaerobic precipitates were covered with glycerol see section 2 3 the background signal in fig 2b and in the lower diffractogram of fig 3b are probably caused by the glycerol the glycerol was not added to the aerobic vivianite sample shown in the upper diffractogram of fig 3b rouzies and millet 1993 specified that vivianite alters to metavivianite fe2 fe2 3 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o at 50 iron oxidation in vivianite which can be distinguished via its altered xrd spectrum rothe et al 2014 no metavivianite is detected in the solids formed during the executed experiments of iron removal in groundwater it is therefore concluded that the iron in the formed crystals were mainly present in its reduced fe ii form even when an additional oxidation step was applied 3 3 kinetics and si in fig 4 the removal kinetics black circles and calculated si blue squares are depicted for the experiments with synthetic and natural groundwater containing an elevated initial iron concentration of 100 mg fe l iron removal stopped after 10 min in the synthetic solution while in natural groundwater the removal continued for 60 min a second order removal rate was found for both the iron removal in synthetic and natural groundwater black lines the rate constants were found to be 2 7 m 1s 1 95 confidence interval 1 7 3 6 and 2 3 m 1s 1 95 confidence interval 1 9 2 7 for synthetic and natural groundwater respectively the half life of iron when removed via vivianite precipitation in both synthetic and natural groundwater is approximately 4 min for an initial concentration of 100 mg fe l from fig 4 it is apparent that the vivianite precipitation reaction stopped after reaching the approximate si of 4 blue dotted line in fig 4 in the synthetic solution an si 4 is reached sooner at minute 10 than in natural water at minute 60 caused by stronger ph changes in the system a ph drop from 6 9 to 5 8 occurred during the experiment with synthetic water which was not observed in the natural groundwater due its higher alkalinity graph in supplementary information figure s 2 the calculated kinetics of both homogeneous iron oxidation with oxygen and anaerobic removal via vivianite formation are plotted in fig 5 the kinetics of homogeneous iron oxidation follows first order removal with respect to fe2 at constant ph and do the rate law used in fig 5 was determined by sung and morgan 1980 with a rate constant of k 2 1 1013 m 2 min 1 as published by schenk and weber 1968 the rate of iron oxidation strongly depends on ph fig 5 provides the rate at groundwater relevant ph s of 6 5 7 0 and 7 5 the rate of vivianite precipitation is determined at ph 7 at which the half life of iron is four times shorter than in iron oxidation at ph 7 this implies that iron recovery via vivianite precipitation has the potential to make the groundwater treatment system more efficient 3 4 ph and iron concentration the removal kinetics for the experiment with natural groundwater background iron concentration of 3 8 mg fe l are shown in fig 6 as also seen in fig 4 no additional removal is obtained when the si dropped below the value of 4 the si dropped below 4 in the first minute while the ph of the system was around 7 7 which was higher than in the two experiments with elevated iron concentrations see section 3 3 it demonstrates that both the ph and the initial iron concentration influence the si of vivianite since the ph was not controlled during the experiments the relation between si and ph was modelled for different initial iron concentrations fig 7 in synthetic water the boundary for vivianite crystallisation was found to be at a si of 4 for a low iron concentration of 1 mg l the model implies that vivianite crystallisation will only occur at a ph of 8 5 the higher iron removal in natural groundwater compared to the synthetic water can also be explained by this relationship the alkalinity of the natural groundwater avoided a strong ph drop during vivianite formation maintaining a higher si 3 5 sludge volume fig 8 a shows that anaerobic precipitation of ferrous iron with phosphate reduces the sludge volume to a third compared to the conventional iron oxidation method this considerable reduction was both obtained in the synthetic as in the spiked natural groundwater solution the sludge volume formed in the groundwater without iron spiked was too small to measure as a comparison anaerobic carbonate addition was also tested which increased the sludge volume approx 6 times compared to the oxidation method the difference in appearance and volume of the formed sludge is visible in fig 8b which also illustrates that vivianite settled better than the products of iron oxidation or carbonate addition 4 discussion 4 1 conditions for abiotic vivianite crystallisation the anaerobic groundwater conditions were shown to be feasible for abiotic vivianite crystallisation the removal efficiencies of iron in the experiments with anaerobic treatment followed by oxidation were approximately 3 5 higher compared to iron oxidation only the kinetics at neutral ph are faster the half time of iron with anaerobic precipitation is 4 times shorter compared to iron oxidation however this is only applicable to conditions where the si of vivianite crystallisation exceeds 4 this finding is in line with the outcome of liu et al 2018 who determined that the supersaturation level at which efficient crystallisation can take place is between 4 and 11 with the geochemical model it is shown that the si values of vivianite in the executed experiments were within this range in which heterogeneous crystallisation is expected to take place li and sheng 2021 in groundwater with low to moderate iron concentrations 25 mg l exceeding si 4 might be particularly challenging a possible solution to increase the si of vivianite is to elevate the ph which is a common procedure in groundwater treatment a base can be dosed alongside the phosphate or the ph can be increased by stripping co2 with a vacuum degasser oh ions can however trap the free fe2 which makes the iron unavailable for vivianite precipitation liu et al 2018 a more attractive method might be to lower the supersaturation demand by the addition of a seeding material such as quartz grains liu et al 2018 or sponge iron wu et al 2021 quartz is already a commonly used seeding material in groundwater treatment e g in anaerobic pellet softening harms and bruce robinson 1992 the addition of quartz in an anaerobic reactor before the oxidation step to offer a seeding material might therefore be a straightforward solution an alternative approach to increase the si is to concentrate the iron in groundwater prior to the addition of phosphate anaerobic nano filtration and reverse osmosis are becoming competitive options to the conventional groundwater treatment technologies since the quality of the produced water is high the processes are easy to operate and a small footprint is required chelme ayala et al 2009 however the disposal of the concentrate is an important issue regarding membrane processes van der bruggen et al 2003 which is expected to become more difficult in the future because of stricter european legislation nederlof et al 2005 anti scalants containing phosphate are often dosed during membrane filtration which can cause eutrophication in the receiving waterbodies jong et al 2013 controlled vivianite formation might be a suitable alternative to remove both the iron and phosphate in the anaerobic concentrate while the resources are recovered the concentration of iron depends on the inlet concentration and the water recovery but the concentrate typically contains 4 to 10 times higher concentrations than the feedwater chelme ayala et al 2009 making it suitable for vivianite precipitation 4 2 vivianite recovery scope for application although vivianite is known to have a market value its end use will depend on the grade of the vivianite obtained prot et al 2019 a knowledge gap in literature can be identified on the properties of the formed vivianite in waste water systems wu et al 2019 to investigate this will be a logical and valuable next step which can give clarity about the value of the recovered vivianite versus the costs of the phosphate dosage and benefits of compact iron sludge recovery of vivianite from the water can be achieved by conventional granular filtration and periodically backwashing the filter bed vivianite is a paramagnetic mineral which makes magnetic separation an alternative recovery option prot et al 2019 important to acknowledge is that phosphate is a limited resource making recovery of phosphate a key aspect of the approach in the conducted experiments phosphate was always slightly overdosed p fe ratio of 1 while theoretical ratio is 0 67 in practice residual phosphate in the produced drinking water is not desired identification of the optimal phosphate dosage for scaling up is therefore required which depends on the ph and si of the groundwater an alternative to phosphate dosage might be anaerobic iron precipitation by the addition of another anion for example fe2 can react with carbonate log k 10 59 at 25 c and sulphide log k 3 6 at 25 c liu et al 2018 which can control fe2 concentrations in anaerobic aquifers van beek et al 2021 we demonstrated that for anaerobic iron removal carbonate addition is possible but this resulted in a significant increase in sludge volume the iron carbonate interaction might also impact iron recovery via vivianite precipitation in groundwater systems that contain high inorganic carbon concentrations however both wu et al 2019 and liu et al 2018 showed that iron precipitation with phosphate favours over carbonate for alkalinity up to 1000 mg l for sulphide competition becomes significant at concentrations of 1 5 mm and the effect is neglectable up to 0 5 mm liu et al 2018 concentrations of sulphide in groundwater are not common to transcend this value thermal waters rich in h2s have a concentrations of around 0 5 mm the production of vivianite and the corresponding reduction in sludge volume can reduce the costs of water treatment the treatment of backwash water is currently a major contributor to the total cost of drinking water production turner et al 2019 additionally the production of compacter sludge reduces the transport and processing costs of the sludge vivianite also has an economic value in chemical and agricultural industries it can be used as a pigment figueiredo et al 2010 in lithium ion batteries raghupati rao and varadaraju 2015 as a slow p release fertilizer yaya et al 2015 and to replenish fe poor soils rombolà et al 2007 the above discussed advantages and possibilities make iron removal and recovery via vivianite crystallisation an interesting approach for application in groundwater treatment plants to increase the environmental and economical sustainability of the industry the concept is so far only tested in small batches given the promising results scaling up this technology will be tested in continuous flow by the addition of an anaerobic reactor prior to the existing treatment system 5 conclusion the current research successfully demonstrated the recovery of iron from anaerobic groundwater via vivianite precipitation no longer considering iron sludge a waste but rather a new resource our study offers a new approach in the drinking water industry a follow up question is how the vivianite can be recovered and reused from the stream which can make groundwater treatment a more sustainable industry our novel technique reduces the volume of iron sludge produced to a third compared to the conventional technique of iron oxidation while reaching similar or higher removal efficiencies the 4 times shorter halftime found for anaerobic iron removal at ph 7 can lead to filters with a higher throughput rate and requires less backwashing this can contribute to the design of efficient systems while gaining economic savings declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16067,the present study investigated the deviations of operational parameters of a large scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp from design basis through combining dedicated batch experiments with full scale dynamic modeling results the long term process performance of a full scale biological nutrient removal bnr plant equipped with anaerobic sludge digestion system was monitored to evaluate the process kinetics of both carbon and nutrient removal and anaerobic sludge digestion in this respect plant specific characterization chemical oxygen demand cod fractionation batch kinetic studies and sludge settling velocity tests were performed together with plant wide sumo model simulation results showed that nitrification and anaerobic hydrolysis were found to be 30 and 70 lower than literature values respectively the anaerobic digestion test coupled with plant wide model calibration showed that anaerobic hydrolysis was the bottleneck in biogas production correspondingly performance of the anaerobic digestion in the full scale plant was poor as low biogas production yields were observed in addition the degradation rate via anaerobic hydrolysis of primary sludge was found to be higher 2 2 5 compared to anaerobic hydrolysis of biological sludge the results of this study provide insight into model based experimental characterization as well as plant wide modeling approach coupling model based batch experiments with full scale modeling enabled to reduce the number of kinetic parameters to be fine tuned moreover the information gathered from kinetic batch tests to the simulation platform yielded a satisfying prediction of long term performance of the plant operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic hydrolysis lysis rate nitrification dynamic simulation biogas yield full scale wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction a sustainable environment is protectively guarded by wastewater treatment plants requiring intelligent planning and designs compatible with the local requirements and conditions the wastewater composition and attributes of the sewer system influence the process scheme selection design and the configuration of process units the safety factors assumed in the design of wwtps often fail to get over during the operation of a full scale plant from an engineering point of view the design parameters should be selected carefully considering effluent quality requirements together with energy issues ensured by the contractors insel et al 2020 however stereotype engineering practice referring to conservative design prescriptions often ends up in design pitfalls jeopardizing the expected success of those heavy cost projects in bnr nitrification is the limiting step for design and operation of a wwtp considering the temperature dependent growth rate of nitrifying bacteria the accurate estimation of the aerobic sludge age hence the design of the reactor is of great importance for nitrogen removal impairment in nitrification rate due to several reasons inhibition low dissolved oxygen etc results in effluent ammonia leakage from the system siripong and rittmann 2007 lower nitrification rates inherently require much higher solids retention times srts in turn higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations in the bioreactors the separation of mlss from treated effluent would then be critical challenge for the operation of final clarifiers henze et al 2008 the biodegradation characteristics and amount of influent organic carbon especially the slowly biodegradable cod fraction plays a critical role in biogas production during anaerobic digestion eskicioglu et al 2006 yuan et al 2019 therefore plant specific kinetic characterization and evaluation are essential for reliable decision making on treatment processes under dynamic conditions the process performances become more sensitive and the appropriate operation becomes a burden for the plant operators the difficulty of understanding important deviations in process performance requires a holistic and rapid approach to provide bottle neck analysis through following real time process charts in the last decade multi component process models have been used to understand the delicate interaction between process networks and to make the right decision for design operation engineers modeling approaches in wastewater treatment are more promising if they are considered at the plant wide scale rather than single separate unit approaches plant wide modeling approaches provide opportunities to evaluate the current performance to optimize the system and to design through the dynamics and interactions of different transformations in water and sludge streams kazadi mbamba et al 2016 thus plant wide process simulators became indispensable tools to study the effect of long term influent dynamics on treatment plant performance in wwtps complex interactions between effluent quality and process performances require advanced evaluation strategies and plant wide modeling nguyen et al 2020 the simulation results obtained by considering the variable environmental conditions reveal serious deficiencies of conservative plant designs jenkins et al 2014 process models perform relationships between the components according to aerobic anoxic anaerobic conditions and mass balance calculations in units during 1980s multi component process model for wastewater treatment were introduced dold et al 1980 ekama et al 1986 in addition to organic carbon removal nutrient removal processes were developed to simulate wastewater treatment processes wentzel et al 1992 henze et al 2000 the anaerobic sludge digestion model adm was built by adding more components compared to activated sludge models batstone et al 2002 siegrist et al 2002 lately the plant wide simulation approach has become attractive since single model could be rapidly solved by eliminating the uncertainties between interrelated processes in other words plant wide models gained incomparable advantages over specific models in evaluating the general performance of the system the integrated view plant wide simulation is required for the new challenges of the wwtps including resource recovery energy minimization and environmental impact assessment hvala et al 2018 in the last decade plant wide modeling is utilized in different fields such as estimating greenhouse emissions strategy evaluation for iron dosing for chemical phosphorus removal etc ekama 2009 kazadi mbamba et al 2016 kazadi mbamba et al 2019 lizarralde et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2019

leading to severe parameter identifiability problems there are limited number of plant wide evaluation studies reported in the literature so far however the majority of the works on the model based analysis have been focused on model validation by using most common default values from the literature grau et al 2007 solon et al 2017 or by using data obtained from laboratory scale studies barat et al 2013 lizarralde et al 2015 additional detailed off line experiments become decisive in order to extract critical information regarding the sensitive model parameters affecting the fate of model output in turn the treatment system efficiency for a bnr plant with biogas facility influent wastewater characterization nitrate utilization rate nur and biodegradation pattern of influent organics together with biomass activity became important to elucidate plant wide process bottlenecks the aim of this study was to demonstrate the importance of plant wide model based experimental characterization including plant specific influent cod fractionation and biomass specific kinetic parameter determination for the evaluation of wwtp operation and upgrade options the main novelty of this study is to resolve the whole biological processes in terms of actual process kinetics for a better understanding for plant design and operation thus it is possible to evaluate the process performance under the deviating nitrification and anaerobic hydrolysis rates with the aid of intrinsic parameters identified for the local conditions in this context this study evaluated the process performance of a large scale bnr plant equipped with an anaerobic sludge digestion system underlining the importance of nitrification rate settling property and biogas production capability of the plant additionally plant wide process analyses were carried out by comparing the real conditions of the full scale treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the treatment plant the

were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu prominence lc 20a equipped with an organic acid analysis column scr 101h shimadzu japan and a uv detector at 210 nm wavelength 2 7 plantwide simulation study the wwtp configuration introduced to sumo21 www dynamita com program is illustrated in fig 1 the plant has primary sedimentation followed by an a2o type configuration with final clarifiers the primary sedimentation has a by pass system that allows operator to channel the influent wastewater directly to activated sludge system the biological excess sludge is thickened by mechanical thickeners and then homogenized with primary sludge prior to mesophilic anaerobic digestion similar to process design the reject waters generated from sludge processing units are recycled back to the inlet of the biological treatment the return activated sludge ras rate has a proportional controller linked to the influent wastewater flowrate after obtaining steady state simulation using flux based average influent wastewater characterization dynamic simulation results were obtained covering 10 months the influent wastewater flowrate and characterization sludge flowrates airflow rates were introduced on a daily average basis a whole plant model sumo1 was used to simulate the effluent quality cod tn tp together with daily biogas flowrates plant wide sumo21 model has 72 state variables and 82 dynamic processes covering hydrolysis fermentation one step nitrification denitrification cod removal enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion the model has temperature sensitivity with arrhenius type equations the biological model was built in death regeneration concept where the active biomass is converted to slowly biodegradable cod xb under anaerobic conditions xb is again subjected to hydrolysis process with a reduction factor of ηhyd ana the influent oriented and biomass associated xb are accepted as the same parameter in addition the model can be integrated with precipitation chemical p removal processes optionally the original model can be downloaded from sumo www dynamita com 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization and kinetic evaluation it is crucial to determine the process kinetics to obtain most accurate modeling and design calculations for aerobic anoxic and anaerobic processes in this respect aerobic cod conversion nitrification denitrification and anaerobic cod conversion kinetics were determined cod fractionation and biodegradation kinetics were determined with the aid of lab scale respirometric batch experiments with composite wastewater samples taken from the treatment plant similarly nitrification kinetics nur and methanogenic activity experiments were carried out in batch tests for winter and summer conditions the net growth rate of nitrifying bacteria was calculated according to melcer et al 2003 by evaluating the obtained nitrate production profile using the least squares method simplex algorithm was preferred by using ms excel program as iteration method modeling studies were also carried out to evaluate the cod fractionation and the related biodegradation kinetics as well as nitrification and denitrification kinetics for the studied wastewater ekama et al 1986 sözen et al 1998 spanjers and vanrolleghem 1995 ubay cokgör et al 1998 the respirometric determination of heterotrophic growth and hydrolysis kinetics was conducted according to estimation method proposed by insel et al 2003 3 1 1 cod fractionation and aerobic cod conversion kinetics respirograms obtained from the our analyses with influent wastewater for both winter and summer conditions are presented in fig 2 a the influent cod fraction is composed of five model components namely readily biodegradable cod ss rapidly hydrolysable cod sh slowly biodegradable cod xs the soluble inert cod si and particulate inert cod xi the influent cod fractionations for both winter and summer conditions is given in table 1 the fractions indicate that the wastewater exhibited a medium strength municipal wastewater character henze et al 2008 and all results are compatible with literature the influent cod consisted of slowly biodegradable cod with around 57 of total cod which is compatible with its counterparts in the literature the model kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients for heterotrophs obtained from the our tests are summarized in table 2 for both winter and summer conditions the maximum specific growth rates 4 and 5 day 1 and half saturation constants 5 and 10 mg cod l are compatible with literature values henze et al 2000 henze et al 2008 rieger et al 2012 ubay cokgör et al 1998 experimentally determined maximum hydrolysis rates qhyd 1 0 and 1 2 day 1 are significantly lower when compared to the literature value of 1 5 3 0 day 1 reported for domestic wastewater henze et al 2008 okutman tas et al 2009 orhon et al 1998 either measured by similar respirometric techniques or adopted for model simulation henze et al 2008 orhon et al 2009 giving a clear indication that qhyd is site specific that may be affected by the possible industrial wastewater contribution to the sewer system or slowly biodegradable nature of wastewater low hydrolysis rate is a limiting factor for aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conversion of organic matter which significantly influences process design and operation especially for denitrification and sludge digestion processes 3 1 2 nitrification kinetics high f m nitrification tests were applied for the determination of nitrification kinetics fig 2b presents the experimentally obtained nitrate profile and model calibration which corresponds to a maximum specific nitrifier growth rate of μnito of 0 65 day 1 and endogenous decay rate bnito of 0 20 day 1 for 20 c one should consider that high f m nitrification test reveals the net autotrophic growth rate μnito bnito the nitrifier decay rate which is an uncertain parameter indeed governs the resulting maximum specific nitrifier growth rate therefore accurate estimation of bnito is utmost important although the reported values exhibit considerable variation the aerobic decay rate of 0 20 day 1 as obtained in this study is recommended for simulations of single sludge activated sludge systems salem et al 2006 obviously calculated nitrification rates are quite low compared to the counterparts given in the literature a wide range of nitrifier growth rates for 20 c 0 34 2 2 day 1 were reported henze et al 2000 su et al 2008 koch et al 2000 wichern et al 2003 reported a μnito in the range of 1 0 1 6 day 1 based on the modeling studies conducted for one pilot and five full scale wwtps in germany wichern et al 2003 however obtained a growth rate of 1 6 day 1 by assuming an oxygen half saturation constant of 0 13 g o2 m3 which is much lower than the well accepted default range of 0 25 0 5 g m3 therefore accurate estimation of ko2 inito value in modeling is very important since estimation of μnito directly influenced by calibration of bnito and ko2 inito instead the μnito value of 0 9 day 1 reported by melcer et al 2003 is widely accepted and validated by several authors jones et al 2005 su et al 2008 as well besides barker and dold 1997 reported a wide range for μnito 0 2 1 0 day 1 with an indicative note that it is not possible to supply an accurate prediction for maximum specific growth rate of nitrifiers that can be used for all wwtps because possible differences in characteristics of municipal wastewaters correlated with the extent of the industrial contribution barker and dold 1997 although melcer et al 2003 postulated in werf scientific and technical report that nitrifier growth kinetics will be in consistency from plant to plant they also underline the fact that nitrifiers are susceptible to inhibition and toxicity particularly with industrial wastewater contribution therefore melcer et al 2003 strongly recommends specific tests for μnito determination for each plant individually in consequence this study showed that nitrification kinetics obtained for the studied wwtp in istanbul is found to be 30 lower for 20 c than the suggested values given in the literature possibly due to the significant industrial wastewater contribution to the sewer system 3 1 3 denitrification kinetics specific nitrate utilization rate nur can be obtained by anoxic batch tests through monitoring nitrate and nitrite nox profiles the nur profile portrays gradually decreasing sequential phases considering the growth mechanism the first phase slope defines the period in which readily biodegradable substrate ss is consumed and maximum growth occurs therefore the first phase corresponds to the maximum denitrification rate k1 the second phase is the period in which ss is absent and the slowly biodegradable substrate xs is consumed k2 and the third phase defines the period in which the endogenous decay products are used as electron donor k3 in the second phase hydrolysis is the rate limiting step therefore the rate of hydrolysis and related kinetic parameters are important for the determination of anoxic retention time vd v and the nitrate load flow rate to be recycled the nur profile fig 2c was evaluated together with our profile fig 2a to identify the correction factor for anoxic growth ηoho anox 0 6 and anoxic hydrolysis parameters ηoho hyd 0 5 according to the method described by sözen et al 1998 batch anoxic tests showed that the maximum denitrification rate k1 was 7 0 12 0 gn gvss h in the growth phase which is quite low in comparison to the literature values 34 0 gn gvss h reported by van haandel et al 1981 and 29 0 gn gvss h reported by sözen and orhon 1999 a reduced denitrification rate can be attributed to the wastewater composition where readily biodegradable cod fraction was quite low barnard and meiring 1977 also experimented k1 value as low as 15 0 gn gvss h similarly k2 values characterizing the secondary slope of nur profile were quite low 1 54 2 00 gn gvss h compared to the suggested values of 4 30 gn gvss h reported by van haandel et al 1981 denoting considerably low anoxic hydrolysis rate for the wastewater studied 3 1 4 anaerobic digestion kinetics batch anaerobic tests were carried out in the laboratory to determine the activity of acetoclastic methanogenic archaea together with the biogas potential of wwtp sludges fig 3 showed that the maximum acetoclastic methanogenic activity of the digester sludge reached to 70 lch4 kgvss d active methanogenic biomass xameto concentration obtained from full scale plant simulation of mad was introduced to batch simulation conditions 35 c which is presented in plant wide simulation results as a result the maximum growth rate µameto and the substrate half saturation constant kameto were estimated as 0 8 day 1 and 300 mg vfacod l respectively fig 3a these values fall within the ranges given in the literature adm1 batstone et al 2002 for µameto 0 100 1 406 day 1 and kameto 28 930 mg vfacod l fig 3b reflects the profile for biogas production of sludge mixed with anaerobic sludge sampled from full scale wastewater treatment in this study the sampling day corresponds to day 105 as shown in fig 5c where primary clarifiers were active in that period experimental data shows that the sludge had a low biodegradation rate compared to the guide trends suggested by rosenthal 2020 fig 3b the value indicated with 550 l ch4 kg vss as max on fig 3b reflects the theoretical maximum methane production rate experienced with acetate fed anaerobic sludge at mesophilic conditions 3 2 settling velocity characterization of sludge the settling velocity test results on activated sludge during winter and summer periods are shown in fig 4 a the settling experiments showed that there was no considerable difference between winter and summer periods the average maximum settling velocity vmax and hindered settling kh parameters were calculated to be 230 m day and 0 24 l g respectively the maximum settling velocity was found to be 15 lower than the default value of 270 m day suggested in sumo21 similarly a lower kh value was obtained compared to sumo21 default value of 0 4 l g which can be attributed to the high operational srt 23 days of the wwtp fig 4b illustrates the profile of critical solids loading rates derived from settling velocity tests in comparison with different settling characteristics the red dot given in fig 4b illustrates the state point where the activated sludge tank could be operated with the mlss concentration of around 8300 mg l according to the state point analysis it is not possible to operate the activated sludge system if the sludge would have the hindered settling parameter above 0 30 l g the settling property of the sludge with the current settling parameters the final clarifiers can be operated with the overflow rate qa and solids loading rate qs of 0 71 m3 m2 h and 10 kg m2 h without thickening failure having a better hindered settling parameter provided an advantage to increase the mlss concentration in the aeration tank 3 3 process performance and plantwide dynamic modeling long term performance data year 2019 summarizing the effluent conventional parameters together with simulation results are illustrated in fig 5 a d where cod tn and tp removal performances were reported as 95 86 and 85 respectively the average effluent cod and tss concentrations were 40 and 17 mg l respectively fig 5a obviously the cod fractions given in table 1 well reflects the effluent cod level of the wwtp however instant cod peaks were recorded due to tss escape within the clarifier effluent the activated sludge system exhibits nearly full nitrification performance except for the days from 205 to 213 due to an aeration problem fig 5b it should be noted that an effective nitrification was achieved in the plant all year around total srt of 23 days securing the effluent nh4 n concentration below 1 5 mg n l and an average effluent tn of 5 8 mg n l which was below the discharge limit of 10 mg n l considering the vd v ratio of 50 an aerobic srt of 12 days can be calculated which is higher than the minimum srt of 9 days required for nitrification supplementary materials s1 observed high tp concentrations in the effluent can be attributed to the corresponding effluent tss concentrations fig 5c the phosphorus content of the sludge was measured as 1 9 in this respect the average effluent tss concentration of 17 mg l is equivalent to 0 33 mgp l which contributes to the effluent tp profile moreover the effluent tp concentration increases gradually during summer period probably due to the increasing process temperature sarioglu et al 2017 for dynamic simulation study the data obtained from batch experiments influent cod fractions table 1 process kinetics nitrification denitrification aerobic and anaerobic carbon conversion together with reactor configuration were introduced to sumo21 simulation platform after one year steady state simulation of the plant a dynamic simulation showing 300 day performance was carried out for effluent nutrients sludge production and daily biogas production table 2 summarizes the model kinetic parameters used in plant wide modeling by sumo21 firstly the parameters obtained from offline experiments were directly introduced to the simulator in order to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated secondly the remaining parameters were manually calibrated according to the model outputs shown in fig 5 it was assumed that the temperature correction factors were kept as their default values so the annual performance of the facility was well reflected by fine tuning the kinetic parameters ko2 nito ko2 oho and ηhyd ana in dynamic simulation study the oxygen half saturation constant for nitrifiers ko2 nito was used as 0 5 go2 m3 considering mass transfer limitations due to the observed average mlss concentrations around 8000 mg l sarioglu et al 2017 although ammonia and nitrite oxidizers have different affinity to do ko2 nito values are mostly accepted in a range of 0 25 0 5 g o2 m3 for the models considering one step nitrification www dynamita com sumo21 henze et al 2000 the daily biogas flowrate data obtained from the scada system fig 5d showed that the biogas yield was 30 of the design value of 60 460 m3 day design report 2017 the reduction factor for anaerobic hydrolysis ηhyd ana for wwtp was calibrated to be 0 15 table 2 to fit biogas flowrate data the primary sedimentation unit was active only from day 30 to 120 during that period ηhyd ana had to be increased from 0 15 to 0 23 in order to fit the model results on daily biogas dynamics this indicates that slowly biodegradable cod xs in raw sewage has faster anaerobic degradation rate than the xs turned over from heterotrophic decay process according to death regeneration concept a detailed calibration protocol for the anaerobic hydrolysis reduction factor is provided in supplementary materials s2 according to the model slowly biodegradable cod is converted to readily biodegradable cod that can be utilized by heterotrophic activity the slowly biodegradable cod undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis process by the heterotrophic activity ekama and wentzel 1999 underlined the importance of low anaerobic hydrolysis rate of slowly biodegradable organics in activated sludge systems as a result the contribution of slowly biodegradable cod to bnr is expected to be very limited another consequence of having such low anaerobic hydrolysis rate is somehow producing low readily biodegradable cod pool in fermentation and methanogenic activity for biogas production in this study the plant wide simulation supported by batch tests fig 3a highlighted the inverse effect of distressed anaerobic hydrolysis on low biogas production during anaerobic sludge digestion in order to consider the masking effect of acetoclastic methanogens on biogas production specific methanogenic activity test were applied on sludge sampled from mad the activity was found to be comparable with the results obtained from the literature consequently it was shown that lower biogas yield was mainly due to low anaerobic hydrolysis rate not due to methanogenic activity this could be attributed to high industrial contribution to the sewer network connected to the wwtp under study 3 4 simulation based scenario analysis for plantwide process performance in this section steady state performance of the wwtp was evaluated by means of simulation using the default and local model parameters so the design basis was compared to the process simulations with a design srt local model parameters and b operational srt local model parameters and c optimized srt local model parameters with respect to effluent quality and biogas production table 3 a set of steady state simulations were performed to highlight the differences in process design and actual process conditions during simulation cod tn and tp loads were assumed as 240 ton day 36 ton day and 3 2 ton day considering design report 2017 the cod removal efficiency of primary sedimentation tank is accepted as 27 at 0 5 hour of hydraulic retention time the effluent quality mlss concentration average airflow rate and biogas production were simulated at a design temperature of 15 c the simulation conducted for design srt column a resulted in nh4 n leakage from the system because nitrification could not be secured at aerobic srt of 5 days as selected in original process design this result agrees with the nitrification experiments conducted for other large scale activated sludge plants in the region gunes et al 2019 expectedly the air requirement has reduced by the factor of 50 due to the loss of nitrification activity where oxygen consumption was only due to organic carbon removal the results listed in column b represent the real operational conditions of the wwtp operated with a total srt of 23 days in this case effluent nh4 n concentration can be reduced to 1 2 mg n l steady state simulations showed that total airflow requirement reaches to 2150 nm3 min with the activation of the nitrification process which matches with log records of the plant under study data not shown higher aerobic srt around 12 days required for nitrification can be maintained by increasing the bioreactor mlss up to 8 3 kg m3 if sludge separation in final clarifiers is not limiting fig 4 reveals that the final clarifiers can handle solids loads up to 12 kg m2 hour at an mlss concentration of 8 5 kg m3 which was a relatively higher level compared to its counterparts given in the literature henze et al 2008 on the other hand reducing the mlss concentration to 6 5 kg m3 is more advantageous since clarifiers critical solids loading rate will be 25 higher max 15 kg m2 h during peak loading conditions fig 4b respectively good sludge settling characteristics obtained in this study secure the operation of aeration tanks with higher mlss concentrations fig 4b however the biomass separation in final clarifier would not be possible if sumo21 default settling parameters were valid fig 4b compares the settling curves calculated using the default and local parameters based on the settling test results the location of state point shows that final clarifiers can be operated at high mlss concentrations without having a sludge thickening problem in the last step the simulation study was devoted for the minimum aerobic sludge age of 9 days as shown in column c the plant could easily comply with effluent requirements together with a 9 of reduction in total airflow rate that would be an advantage in operational cost reduction the effluent cod concentrations for all runs were simulated to be around 45 mg l fig 5a in design report 2017 biogas flowrate of 60 460 m3 day was calculated by assuming biogas production per organic sludge as 0 45 m3 kg ds dried solids as referred in atv 1996 handbook first column in table 3 this correspond to 50 volatile solids vs destruction in mesophilic anaerobic digester however sludge digestion test and full scale simulation study revealed that the anaerobic hydrolysis rate limits the vs destruction around 28 in turn lower daily biogas yields correspondingly biogas production was considerably reduced by the factor of 60 due to the reduction in anaerobic hydrolysis rate table 3 the results of the scenarios given in column a b and c also reflects the effect of biological sludge age on total biogas production obviously higher operational sludge ages yielded lower biogas flowrate which can be attributed to the stabilization of biological sludge in aerobic reactor the simulation performed at optimized srt column c provided 13 higher biogas flowrate compared to operational conditions referenced as column b in this study the effect of important processes parameters such as nitrification hydrolysis rate and settling characteristics were highlighted with goal oriented experimental characterization and integrated dynamic simulation study the variations in systems performance was also attributed to critical model parameters that altered the system performance from design basis in this respect effective and sustainable engineering solutions could only be obtained with the use of information reflecting the local conditions 4 conclusions the practice of wwtp design has moved away from standard based design and towards an experimental based design approach which consolidates chemistry microbiology bioprocess and control engineering practices in this concept the wastewater and biomass characterization methods are extensively utilized not only by gathering data for local conditions but also by providing reliable decisions to keep engineers in safe limits moreover model based experimental characterization is crucial in defining the boundary conditions of plant operation as well as evaluation of plant upgrade options plant specific influent cod fractionation and biomass specific kinetic parameters play a critical role in selecting appropriate wastewater and sludge treatment processes therefore conducting experiments coupled with full scale plant wide modeling tools serve as an excellent tool for appropriate system selection and relevant process calculations in the current study three important kinetics namely the nitrification hydrolysis and settling kinetics were found to be out of well accepted literature values demonstrating the importance of knowledge on individual process kinetics which may lead to consequential design failures hence this study provides an invaluable contribution with key database of information on full scale plant specific process kinetics and presents conclusive evidence that plant specific kinetic characterization is essential for more accurate full scale

16067,the present study investigated the deviations of operational parameters of a large scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp from design basis through combining dedicated batch experiments with full scale dynamic modeling results the long term process performance of a full scale biological nutrient removal bnr plant equipped with anaerobic sludge digestion system was monitored to evaluate the process kinetics of both carbon and nutrient removal and anaerobic sludge digestion in this respect plant specific characterization chemical oxygen demand cod fractionation batch kinetic studies and sludge settling velocity tests were performed together with plant wide sumo model simulation results showed that nitrification and anaerobic hydrolysis were found to be 30 and 70 lower than literature values respectively the anaerobic digestion test coupled with plant wide model calibration showed that anaerobic hydrolysis was the bottleneck in biogas production correspondingly performance of the anaerobic digestion in the full scale plant was poor as low biogas production yields were observed in addition the degradation rate via anaerobic hydrolysis of primary sludge was found to be higher 2 2 5 compared to anaerobic hydrolysis of biological sludge the results of this study provide insight into model based experimental characterization as well as plant wide modeling approach coupling model based batch experiments with full scale modeling enabled to reduce the number of kinetic parameters to be fine tuned moreover the information gathered from kinetic batch tests to the simulation platform yielded a satisfying prediction of long term performance of the plant operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic hydrolysis lysis rate nitrification dynamic simulation biogas yield full scale wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction a sustainable environment is protectively guarded by wastewater treatment plants requiring intelligent planning and designs compatible with the local requirements and conditions the wastewater composition and attributes of the sewer system influence the process scheme selection design and the configuration of process units the safety factors assumed in the design of wwtps often fail to get over during the operation of a full scale plant from an engineering point of view the design parameters should be selected carefully considering effluent quality requirements together with energy issues ensured by the contractors insel et al 2020 however stereotype engineering practice referring to conservative design prescriptions often ends up in design pitfalls jeopardizing the expected success of those heavy cost projects in bnr nitrification is the limiting step for design and operation of a wwtp considering the temperature dependent growth rate of nitrifying bacteria the accurate estimation of the aerobic sludge age hence the design of the reactor is of great importance for nitrogen removal impairment in nitrification rate due to several reasons inhibition low dissolved oxygen etc results in effluent ammonia leakage from the system siripong and rittmann 2007 lower nitrification rates inherently require much higher solids retention times srts in turn higher mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations in the bioreactors the separation of mlss from treated effluent would then be critical challenge for the operation of final clarifiers henze et al 2008 the biodegradation characteristics and amount of influent organic carbon especially the slowly biodegradable cod fraction plays a critical role in biogas production during anaerobic digestion eskicioglu et al 2006 yuan et al 2019 therefore plant specific kinetic characterization and evaluation are essential for reliable decision making on treatment processes under dynamic conditions the process performances become more sensitive and the appropriate operation becomes a burden for the plant operators the difficulty of understanding important deviations in process performance requires a holistic and rapid approach to provide bottle neck analysis through following real time process charts in the last decade multi component process models have been used to understand the delicate interaction between process networks and to make the right decision for design operation engineers modeling approaches in wastewater treatment are more promising if they are considered at the plant wide scale rather than single separate unit approaches plant wide modeling approaches provide opportunities to evaluate the current performance to optimize the system and to design through the dynamics and interactions of different transformations in water and sludge streams kazadi mbamba et al 2016 thus plant wide process simulators became indispensable tools to study the effect of long term influent dynamics on treatment plant performance in wwtps complex interactions between effluent quality and process performances require advanced evaluation strategies and plant wide modeling nguyen et al 2020 the simulation results obtained by considering the variable environmental conditions reveal serious deficiencies of conservative plant designs jenkins et al 2014 process models perform relationships between the components according to aerobic anoxic anaerobic conditions and mass balance calculations in units during 1980s multi component process model for wastewater treatment were introduced dold et al 1980 ekama et al 1986 in addition to organic carbon removal nutrient removal processes were developed to simulate wastewater treatment processes wentzel et al 1992 henze et al 2000 the anaerobic sludge digestion model adm was built by adding more components compared to activated sludge models batstone et al 2002 siegrist et al 2002 lately the plant wide simulation approach has become attractive since single model could be rapidly solved by eliminating the uncertainties between interrelated processes in other words plant wide models gained incomparable advantages over specific models in evaluating the general performance of the system the integrated view plant wide simulation is required for the new challenges of the wwtps including resource recovery energy minimization and environmental impact assessment hvala et al 2018 in the last decade plant wide modeling is utilized in different fields such as estimating greenhouse emissions strategy evaluation for iron dosing for chemical phosphorus removal etc ekama 2009 kazadi mbamba et al 2016 kazadi mbamba et al 2019 lizarralde et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2019 ikumi and harding 2020 nguyen et al 2020 on the other hand increase in model complexity and process interactions convert simple models to over parametrized structures brun et al 2001 brun et al 2002 leading to severe parameter identifiability problems there are limited number of plant wide evaluation studies reported in the literature so far however the majority of the works on the model based analysis have been focused on model validation by using most common default values from the literature grau et al 2007 solon et al 2017 or by using data obtained from laboratory scale studies barat et al 2013 lizarralde et al 2015 additional detailed off line experiments become decisive in order to extract critical information regarding the sensitive model parameters affecting the fate of model output in turn the treatment system efficiency for a bnr plant with biogas facility influent wastewater characterization nitrate utilization rate nur and biodegradation pattern of influent organics together with biomass activity became important to elucidate plant wide process bottlenecks the aim of this study was to demonstrate the importance of plant wide model based experimental characterization including plant specific influent cod fractionation and biomass specific kinetic parameter determination for the evaluation of wwtp operation and upgrade options the main novelty of this study is to resolve the whole biological processes in terms of actual process kinetics for a better understanding for plant design and operation thus it is possible to evaluate the process performance under the deviating nitrification and anaerobic hydrolysis rates with the aid of intrinsic parameters identified for the local conditions in this context this study evaluated the process performance of a large scale bnr plant equipped with an anaerobic sludge digestion system underlining the importance of nitrification rate settling property and biogas production capability of the plant additionally plant wide process analyses were carried out by comparing the real conditions of the full scale treatment plant 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the treatment plant the large scale biological nutrient removal bnr a2o plant under study is located in the european side of istanbul serving a population of 1 600 000 the wwtp was designed according to atv standards atv 131

concentrations in aerobic tanks were kept in the range of 2 3 mg o2 l the internal recirculation pumps were run according to the internal recirculation rate of 4 0 the anoxic to total volume ratio vd v was fixed at 50 2 2 respirometric analyses and modeling the respirometric tests were devoted to the estimation of influent biodegradable cod fractions together with heterotrophic growth hydrolysis kinetics according to ekama et al 1986 oxygen uptake rate our measurements were performed using an applitek ra combo 1000 respirometer aquasim reichert 1998 was used for the determination of kinetic parameters according to the method proposed by insel et al 2003 all respirometric experiments were conducted at 20 c a nitrification inhibitor formula 2533 hach company usa was used to suppress possible nitrification interference on the our measurements 2 3 nitrification and denitrification batch tests the autotrophic and heterotrophic activated sludge kinetics were determined through aerobic and anoxic batch tests high f m nitrification test was conducted on sludge samples obtained from the full scale wwtp during winter and summer period as prescribed in melcer et al 2003 dissolved oxygen concentration in the reactor was not continuously controlled but measured in certain time intervals to ensure a minimum of 5 0 mg l that does not limit nitrification rate nitrification batch tests were conducted for the temperatures controlled at 15 c and 25 c the denitrification batch tests were performed to determine anoxic reduction factors for growth and hydrolysis through assessing nur profiles as mentioned by melcer et al 2003 and sözen et al 1998 2 4 anaerobic sludge digestion test anaerobic batch tests were performed to assess the methanogenic activity and biogas potential of the sludge owen et al 1979 speece 1988 batch tests were conducted with n2 gas flushed 3 450 ml of flask reactors capped with a rubber stopper in a constant temperature room at 35 1 c batch reactors were inoculated with the seed sludge obtained from the mesophilic anaerobic digestion unit of the wwtp gas production was assessed through a manometer lutron pm 9107 lutron electronic enterprise taiwan and methane and carbon dioxide were analyzed by a gas chromatography unit agilent technologies model 7890a equipped with two columns and two thermal conductivity detectors methane was separated with a 25 m agilent molsieve fused silica 0 53 mm i d column and carbon dioxide were separated with a 25 m hp plot q fused silica 0 53 mm i d column both columns were operated with helium as carrier gas with a constant flow of 5 ml min the 10 1 split injector was maintained at 150 c and the detector temperature was set at 150 c 2 5 zone settling velocity tests the assessment of zone settling velocity was performed according to standard methods protocol no 2710e apha 2012 the concentrated activated sludge samples obtained from the return activated sludge were diluted with the effluent to obtain different initial mlss concentrations the samples were added to the settling column which is gently stirred at 1 rpm and the sludge blanket height was measured at different time intervals for each dilution a batch settling curve was obtained by measuring the initial settling velocity of each mixture then the data was calibrated with the double exponential settling function suggested by takács et al 1991 further the critical solids loading profile was obtained according to modeled settling function 2 6 analytical work chemical oxygen demand cod suspended solids ss

7 plantwide simulation study the wwtp configuration introduced to sumo21 www dynamita com program is illustrated in fig 1 the plant has primary sedimentation followed by an a2o type configuration with final clarifiers the primary sedimentation has a by pass system that allows operator to channel the influent wastewater directly to activated sludge system the biological excess sludge is thickened by mechanical thickeners and then homogenized with primary sludge prior to mesophilic anaerobic digestion similar to process design the reject waters generated from sludge processing units are recycled back to the inlet of the biological treatment the return activated sludge ras rate has a proportional controller linked to the influent wastewater flowrate after obtaining steady state simulation using flux based average influent wastewater characterization dynamic simulation results were obtained covering 10 months the influent wastewater flowrate and characterization sludge flowrates airflow rates were introduced on a daily average basis a whole plant model sumo1 was used to simulate the effluent quality cod tn tp together with daily biogas flowrates plant wide sumo21 model has 72 state variables and 82 dynamic processes covering hydrolysis fermentation one step nitrification denitrification cod removal enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic digestion the model has temperature sensitivity with arrhenius type equations the biological model was built in death regeneration concept where the active biomass is converted to slowly biodegradable cod xb under anaerobic conditions xb is again subjected to hydrolysis process with a reduction factor of ηhyd ana the influent oriented and biomass associated xb are accepted as the same parameter in addition the model can be integrated with precipitation chemical p removal processes optionally the original model can be downloaded from sumo www dynamita com 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characterization and kinetic evaluation it is crucial to determine the process kinetics to obtain most accurate modeling and design calculations for aerobic anoxic and anaerobic processes in this respect aerobic cod conversion nitrification denitrification and anaerobic cod conversion kinetics were determined cod fractionation and biodegradation kinetics were determined with the aid of lab scale respirometric batch experiments with composite wastewater samples taken from the treatment plant similarly nitrification kinetics nur and methanogenic activity experiments were carried out in batch tests for winter and summer conditions the net growth rate of nitrifying bacteria was calculated according to melcer et al 2003 by evaluating the obtained nitrate production profile using the least squares method simplex algorithm was preferred by using ms excel program as iteration method modeling studies were also carried out to evaluate the cod fractionation and the related biodegradation kinetics as well as nitrification and denitrification kinetics for the studied wastewater ekama et al 1986 sözen et al 1998 spanjers and vanrolleghem 1995 ubay cokgör et al 1998 the respirometric determination of heterotrophic growth and hydrolysis kinetics was conducted according to estimation method proposed by insel et al 2003 3 1 1 cod fractionation and aerobic cod conversion kinetics respirograms obtained from the our analyses with influent wastewater for both winter and summer conditions are presented in fig 2 a the influent cod fraction is composed of five model components namely readily biodegradable cod ss rapidly hydrolysable cod sh slowly biodegradable cod xs the soluble inert cod si and particulate inert cod xi the influent cod fractionations for both winter and summer conditions is given in table 1 the fractions indicate that the wastewater exhibited a medium strength municipal wastewater character henze et al 2008 and all results are compatible with literature the influent cod consisted of slowly biodegradable cod with around 57 of total cod which is compatible with its counterparts in the literature the model kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients for heterotrophs obtained from the our tests are summarized in table 2 for both winter and summer conditions the maximum specific growth rates 4 and 5 day 1 and half saturation constants 5 and 10 mg cod l are compatible with literature values henze et al 2000 henze et al 2008 rieger et al 2012 ubay cokgör et al 1998 experimentally determined maximum hydrolysis rates qhyd 1 0 and 1 2 day 1 are significantly lower when compared to the literature value of 1 5 3 0 day 1 reported for domestic wastewater henze et al 2008 okutman tas et al 2009 orhon et al 1998 either measured by similar respirometric techniques or adopted for model simulation henze et al 2008 orhon et al 2009 giving a clear indication that qhyd is site specific that may be affected by the possible industrial wastewater contribution to the sewer system or slowly biodegradable nature of wastewater low hydrolysis rate is a limiting factor for aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conversion of organic matter which significantly influences process design and operation especially for denitrification and sludge digestion processes 3 1 2 nitrification kinetics high f m nitrification tests were applied for the determination of nitrification kinetics fig 2b presents the experimentally obtained nitrate profile and model calibration which corresponds to a maximum specific nitrifier growth rate of μnito of 0 65 day 1 and endogenous decay rate bnito of 0 20 day 1 for 20 c one should consider that high f m nitrification test reveals the net autotrophic growth rate μnito bnito the nitrifier decay rate which is an uncertain parameter indeed governs the resulting maximum specific nitrifier growth rate therefore accurate estimation of bnito is utmost important although the reported values exhibit considerable variation the aerobic decay rate of 0 20 day 1 as obtained in this study is recommended for simulations of single sludge activated sludge systems salem et al 2006 obviously calculated nitrification rates are quite low compared to the counterparts given in the literature a wide range of nitrifier growth rates for 20 c 0 34 2 2 day 1 were reported henze et al 2000 su et al 2008 koch et al 2000 wichern et al 2003 reported a μnito in the range of 1 0 1 6 day 1 based on the modeling studies conducted for one pilot and five full scale wwtps in germany wichern et al 2003 however obtained a growth rate of 1 6 day 1 by assuming an oxygen half saturation constant of 0 13 g o2 m3 which is much lower than the well accepted default range of 0 25 0 5 g m3 therefore accurate estimation of ko2 inito value in modeling is very important since estimation of μnito directly influenced by calibration of bnito and ko2 inito instead the μnito value of 0 9 day 1 reported by melcer et al 2003 is widely accepted and validated by several authors jones et al 2005 su et al 2008 as well besides barker and dold 1997 reported a wide range for μnito 0 2 1 0 day 1 with an indicative note that it is not possible to supply an accurate prediction for maximum specific growth rate of nitrifiers that can be used for all wwtps because possible differences in characteristics of municipal wastewaters correlated with the extent of the industrial contribution barker and dold 1997 although melcer et al 2003 postulated in werf scientific and technical report that nitrifier growth kinetics will be in consistency from plant to plant they also underline the fact that nitrifiers are susceptible to inhibition and toxicity particularly with industrial wastewater contribution therefore melcer et al 2003 strongly recommends specific tests for μnito determination for each plant individually in consequence this study showed that nitrification kinetics obtained for the studied wwtp in istanbul is found to be 30 lower for 20 c than the suggested values given in the literature possibly due to the significant industrial wastewater contribution to the sewer system 3 1 3 denitrification kinetics specific nitrate utilization rate nur can be obtained by anoxic batch tests through monitoring nitrate and nitrite nox profiles the nur profile portrays gradually decreasing sequential phases considering the growth mechanism the first phase slope defines the period in which readily biodegradable substrate ss is consumed and maximum growth occurs therefore the first phase corresponds to the maximum denitrification rate k1 the second phase is the period in which ss is absent and the slowly biodegradable substrate xs is consumed k2 and the third phase defines the period in which the endogenous decay products are used as electron donor k3 in the second phase hydrolysis is the rate limiting step therefore the rate of hydrolysis and related kinetic parameters are important for the determination of anoxic retention time vd v and the nitrate load flow rate to be recycled the nur profile fig 2c was evaluated together with our profile fig 2a to identify the correction factor for anoxic growth ηoho anox 0 6 and anoxic hydrolysis parameters ηoho hyd 0 5 according to the method described by sözen et al 1998 batch anoxic tests showed that the maximum denitrification rate k1 was 7 0 12 0 gn gvss h in the growth phase which is quite low in comparison to the literature values 34 0 gn gvss h reported by van haandel et al 1981 and 29 0 gn gvss h reported by sözen and orhon 1999 a reduced denitrification rate can be attributed to the wastewater composition where readily biodegradable cod fraction was quite low barnard and meiring 1977 also experimented k1 value as low as 15 0 gn gvss h similarly k2 values characterizing the secondary slope of nur profile were quite low 1 54 2 00 gn gvss h compared to the suggested values of 4 30 gn gvss h reported by van haandel et al 1981 denoting considerably low anoxic hydrolysis rate for the wastewater studied 3 1 4 anaerobic digestion kinetics batch anaerobic tests were carried out in the laboratory to determine the activity of acetoclastic methanogenic archaea together with the biogas potential of wwtp sludges fig 3 showed that the maximum acetoclastic methanogenic activity of the digester sludge reached to 70 lch4 kgvss d active methanogenic biomass xameto concentration obtained from full scale plant simulation of mad was introduced to batch simulation conditions 35 c which is presented in plant wide simulation results as a result the maximum growth rate µameto and the substrate half saturation constant kameto were estimated as 0 8 day 1 and 300 mg vfacod l respectively fig 3a these values fall within the ranges given in the literature adm1 batstone et al 2002 for µameto 0 100 1 406 day 1 and kameto 28 930 mg vfacod l fig 3b reflects the profile for biogas production of sludge mixed with anaerobic sludge sampled from full scale wastewater treatment in this study the sampling day corresponds to day 105 as shown in fig 5c where primary clarifiers were active in that period experimental data shows that the sludge had a low biodegradation rate compared to the guide trends suggested by rosenthal 2020 fig 3b the value indicated with 550 l ch4 kg vss as max on fig 3b reflects the theoretical maximum methane production rate experienced with acetate fed anaerobic sludge at mesophilic conditions 3 2 settling velocity characterization of sludge the settling velocity test results on activated sludge during winter and summer periods are shown in fig 4 a the settling experiments showed that there was no considerable difference between winter and summer periods the average maximum settling velocity vmax and hindered settling kh parameters were calculated to be 230 m day and 0 24 l g respectively the maximum settling velocity was found to be 15 lower than the default value of 270 m day suggested in sumo21 similarly a lower kh value was obtained compared to sumo21 default value of 0 4 l g which can be attributed to the high operational srt 23 days of the wwtp fig 4b illustrates the profile of critical solids loading rates derived from settling velocity tests in comparison with different settling characteristics the red dot given in fig 4b illustrates the state point where the activated sludge tank could be operated with the mlss concentration of around 8300 mg l according to the state point analysis it is not possible to operate the activated sludge system if the sludge would have the hindered settling parameter above 0 30 l g the settling property of the sludge with the current settling parameters the final clarifiers can be operated with the overflow rate qa and solids loading rate qs of 0 71 m3 m2 h and 10 kg m2 h without thickening failure having a better hindered settling parameter provided an advantage to increase the mlss concentration in the aeration tank 3 3 process performance and plantwide dynamic modeling long term performance data year 2019 summarizing the effluent conventional parameters together with simulation results are illustrated in fig 5 a d where cod tn and tp removal performances were reported as 95 86 and 85 respectively the average effluent cod and tss concentrations were 40 and 17 mg l respectively fig 5a obviously the cod fractions given in table 1 well reflects the effluent cod level of the wwtp however instant cod peaks were recorded due to tss escape within the clarifier effluent the activated sludge system exhibits nearly full nitrification performance except for the days from 205 to 213 due to an aeration problem fig 5b it should be noted that an effective nitrification was achieved in the plant all year around total srt of 23 days securing the effluent nh4 n concentration below 1 5 mg n l and an average effluent tn of 5 8 mg n l which was below the discharge limit of 10 mg n l considering the vd v ratio of 50 an aerobic srt of 12 days can be calculated which is higher than the minimum srt of 9 days required for nitrification supplementary materials s1 observed high tp concentrations in the effluent can be attributed to the corresponding effluent tss concentrations fig 5c the phosphorus content of the sludge was measured as 1 9 in this respect the average effluent tss concentration of 17 mg l is equivalent to 0 33 mgp l which contributes to the effluent tp profile moreover the effluent tp concentration increases gradually during summer period probably due to the increasing process temperature sarioglu et al 2017 for dynamic simulation study the data obtained from batch experiments influent cod fractions table 1 process kinetics nitrification denitrification aerobic and anaerobic carbon conversion together with reactor configuration were introduced to sumo21 simulation platform after one year steady state simulation of the plant a dynamic simulation showing 300 day performance was carried out for effluent nutrients sludge production and daily biogas production table 2 summarizes the model kinetic parameters used in plant wide modeling by sumo21 firstly the parameters obtained from offline experiments were directly introduced to the simulator in order to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated secondly the remaining parameters were manually calibrated according to the model outputs shown in fig 5 it was assumed that the temperature correction factors were kept as their default values so the annual performance of the facility was well reflected by fine tuning the kinetic parameters ko2 nito ko2 oho and ηhyd ana in dynamic simulation study the oxygen half saturation constant for nitrifiers ko2 nito was used as 0 5 go2 m3 considering mass transfer limitations due to the observed average mlss concentrations around 8000 mg l sarioglu et al 2017 although ammonia and nitrite oxidizers have different affinity to do ko2 nito values are mostly accepted in a range of 0 25 0 5 g o2 m3 for the models considering one step nitrification www dynamita com sumo21 henze et al 2000 the daily biogas flowrate data obtained from the scada system fig 5d showed that the biogas yield was 30 of the design value of 60 460 m3 day design report 2017 the reduction factor for anaerobic hydrolysis ηhyd ana for wwtp was calibrated to be 0 15 table 2 to fit biogas flowrate data the primary sedimentation unit was active only from day 30 to 120 during that period ηhyd ana had to be increased from 0 15 to 0 23 in order to fit the model results on daily biogas dynamics this indicates that slowly biodegradable cod xs in raw sewage has faster anaerobic degradation rate than the xs turned over from heterotrophic decay process according to death regeneration concept a detailed calibration protocol for the anaerobic hydrolysis reduction factor is provided in supplementary materials s2 according to the model slowly biodegradable cod is converted to readily biodegradable cod that can be utilized by heterotrophic activity the slowly biodegradable cod undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis process by the heterotrophic activity ekama and wentzel 1999 underlined the importance of low anaerobic hydrolysis rate of slowly biodegradable organics in activated sludge systems as a result the contribution of slowly biodegradable cod to bnr is expected to be very limited another consequence of having such low anaerobic hydrolysis rate is somehow producing low readily biodegradable cod pool in fermentation and methanogenic activity for biogas production in this study the plant wide simulation supported by batch tests fig 3a highlighted the inverse effect of distressed anaerobic hydrolysis on low biogas production during anaerobic sludge digestion in order to consider the masking effect of acetoclastic methanogens on biogas production specific methanogenic activity test were applied on sludge sampled from mad the activity was found to be comparable with the results obtained from the literature consequently it was shown that lower biogas yield was mainly due to low anaerobic hydrolysis rate not due to methanogenic activity this could be attributed to high industrial contribution to the sewer network connected to the wwtp under study 3 4 simulation based scenario analysis for plantwide process performance in this section steady state performance of the wwtp was evaluated by means of simulation using the default and local model parameters so the design basis was compared to the process simulations with a design srt local model parameters and b operational srt local model parameters and c optimized srt local model parameters with respect to effluent quality and biogas production table 3 a set of steady state simulations were performed to highlight the differences in process design and actual process conditions during simulation cod tn and tp loads were assumed as 240 ton day 36 ton day and 3 2 ton day considering design report 2017 the cod removal efficiency of primary sedimentation tank is accepted as 27 at 0 5 hour of hydraulic retention time the effluent quality mlss concentration average airflow rate and biogas production were simulated at a design temperature of 15 c the simulation conducted for design srt column a resulted in nh4 n leakage from the system because nitrification could not be secured at aerobic srt of 5 days as selected in original process design this result agrees with the nitrification experiments conducted for other large scale activated sludge plants in the region gunes et al 2019 expectedly the air requirement has reduced by the factor of 50 due to the loss of nitrification activity where oxygen consumption was only due to organic carbon removal the results listed in column b represent the real operational conditions of the wwtp operated with a total srt of 23 days in this case effluent nh4 n concentration can be reduced to 1 2 mg n l steady state simulations showed that total airflow requirement reaches to 2150 nm3 min with the activation of the nitrification process which matches with log records of the plant under study data not shown higher aerobic srt around 12 days required for nitrification can be maintained by increasing the bioreactor mlss up to 8 3 kg m3 if sludge separation in final clarifiers is not limiting fig 4 reveals that the final clarifiers can handle solids loads up to 12 kg m2 hour at an mlss concentration of 8 5 kg m3 which was a relatively higher level compared to its counterparts given in the literature henze et al 2008 on the other hand reducing the mlss concentration to 6 5 kg m3 is more advantageous since clarifiers critical solids loading rate will be 25 higher max 15 kg m2 h during peak loading conditions fig 4b respectively good sludge settling characteristics obtained in this study secure the operation of aeration tanks with higher mlss concentrations fig 4b however the biomass separation in final clarifier would not be possible if sumo21 default settling parameters were valid fig 4b compares the settling curves calculated using the default and local parameters based on the settling test results the location of state point shows that final clarifiers can be operated at high mlss concentrations without having a sludge thickening problem in the last step the simulation study was devoted for the minimum aerobic sludge age of 9 days as shown in column c the plant could easily comply with effluent requirements together with a 9 of reduction in total airflow rate that would be an advantage in operational cost reduction the effluent cod concentrations for all runs were simulated to be around 45 mg l fig 5a in design report 2017 biogas flowrate of 60 460 m3 day was calculated by assuming biogas production per organic sludge as 0 45 m3 kg ds dried solids as referred in atv 1996 handbook first column in table 3 this correspond to 50 volatile solids vs destruction in mesophilic anaerobic digester however sludge digestion test and full scale simulation study revealed that the anaerobic hydrolysis rate limits the vs destruction around 28 in turn lower daily biogas yields correspondingly biogas production was considerably reduced by the factor of 60 due to the reduction in anaerobic hydrolysis rate table 3 the results of the scenarios given in column a b and c also reflects the effect of biological sludge age on total biogas production obviously higher operational sludge ages yielded lower biogas flowrate which can be attributed to the stabilization of biological sludge in aerobic reactor the simulation performed at optimized srt column c provided 13 higher biogas flowrate compared to operational conditions referenced as column b in this study the effect of important processes parameters such as nitrification hydrolysis rate and settling characteristics were highlighted with goal oriented experimental characterization and integrated dynamic simulation study the variations in systems performance was also attributed to critical model parameters that altered the system performance from design basis in this respect effective and sustainable engineering solutions could only be obtained with the use of information reflecting the local conditions 4 conclusions the practice of wwtp design has moved away from standard based design and towards an experimental based design approach which consolidates chemistry microbiology bioprocess and control engineering practices in this concept the wastewater and biomass characterization methods are extensively utilized not only by gathering data for local conditions but also by providing reliable decisions to keep engineers in safe limits moreover model based experimental characterization is crucial in defining the boundary conditions of plant operation as well as evaluation of plant upgrade options plant specific influent cod fractionation and biomass specific kinetic parameters play a critical role in selecting appropriate wastewater and sludge treatment processes therefore conducting experiments coupled with full scale plant wide modeling tools serve as an excellent tool for appropriate system selection and relevant process calculations in the current study three important kinetics namely the nitrification hydrolysis and settling kinetics were found to be out of well accepted literature values demonstrating the importance of knowledge on individual process kinetics which may lead to consequential design failures hence this study provides an invaluable contribution with key database of information on full scale plant specific process kinetics and presents conclusive evidence that plant specific kinetic characterization is essential for more accurate full scale

16068,wastewater treatment plants have been highlighted as a potential hotspot for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance although antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater present a public health threat it is also possible that these bacteria play an important role in the bioremediation through the metabolism of antibiotics before they reach the wider environment here we address this possibility with a particular emphasis on stereochemistry using a combination of microbiology and analytical chemistry tools including the use of supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for chiral analysis and high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate metabolites due to the complexities around chiral analysis the antibiotic chloramphenicol was used as a proof of concept to demonstrate stereoselective metabolism due to its relatively simple chemical structure and availability over the counter in the u k the results presented here demonstrate the chloramphenicol can be stereoselectively transformed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme with the orientation around the first stereocentre being key for this process meaning that accumulation of two isomers may occur within the environment with potential impacts on ecotoxicity and emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance within the environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics stereochemistry chirality transformation amr environment wastewater 1 introduction antibiotics abs have revolutionised healthcare animal husbandry agriculture and aquaculture since their discovery over a hundred years ago over the 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in the reporting of antibiotic resistance bacteria abr leading the world health organisation to recognise abr as a global health threat the focus on the therapeutic role of abs and the clinical implications of antibiotic resistance abr has led us to often overlook the fact that antibiotic biosynthetic genes and antibiotic resistance genes args have co evolved over millennia leading to a reservoir of args within the environment gonzález zorn and escudero 2012 this linked with the increasing presence of antibiotics within the environment due to poor stewardship has led to the increasing need to understand the role different environmental compartments play in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance manaia et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 it is also important to understand the fate of antibiotics within the environment including how abs are degraded or metabolised by micro organisms here we focus on the microbial transformation of the antibiotic chloramphenicol with specific focus on the role of stereochemistry and chirality stereochemistry is the study of the 3 dimensional shape of molecules through the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule whilst chirality refers to the cases whereby a molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image helmchen 2016 pure enantiomers of chiral compounds exhibit the same physiochemical properties but due to their difference in 3 dimensional shape their behaviour within biochemical processes can be strikingly different this is because the biological world is 3 dimensional and therefore fundamentally chiral the fact that the living world is fundamentally chiral has been exploited in the production of enantiomerically pure drugs honma et al 1979 koeller and wong 2001 fessner et al 2015 and environmental bacterial metabolism of pharmaceuticals including fluoxetine ephedrine and amphetamines has been shown to be stereoselective bagnall et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2013 evans bagnall and kasprzyk hordern 2016 andrés costa et al 2017 rice et al 2018 the enantiomeric composition of ofloxacin in the aqueous environment was investigated by castringnano et al castrignanò et al 2018 where it was shown that there was an enrichment of s ofloxacin within the receiving waters of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp indicating potential stereoselective degradation of ofloxacin by bacteria within the wwtp this possible role of environmental bacteria in enantiomeric enrichment has also been shown through the enantioselective degradation of ofloxacin and levofloxacin by two strains of environmental bacteria maia tiritan and castro 2018 the potential role of stereochemistry in the fate of antibiotics within the environment has been discussed elsewhere elder et al 2020 there is however very little known experimentally about the stereoselectivity of metabolism of antibiotics by bacteria in relation to abr and its potential impact on the fate of antibiotics within the environment in this manuscript chloramphenicol is used as a proof of concept to test the hypothesis that enzymatic antibiotic resistance mechanisms that have the potential to play a role in the fate of antibiotics within the environment are stereoselective in nature chloramphenicol contains two asymmetric carbons chloramphenicol can exist as one of four stereoisomers or a member of two enantiomeric pairs figure 1 the r r chloramphenicol is the naturally produced stereoisomer and active isomer that is sold within the u k whilst all the others have been synthesised brock 1961 chloramphenicol its synthesis mode of action and resistance mechanisms in relation to stereochemistry have been reviewed elsewhere elder et al 2020 this manuscript focusses on understanding the role stereochemistry plays in the fate of chloramphenicol within the environment through investigating the stereoselectivity of a key bacterial resistance mechanism to chloramphenicol chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat cap is metabolised and deactivated by cat through the addition of two acetyl groups figure 2 which prevent cap binding to its rrna 16s target both cap and cat have been reported in many different environmental compartments lu dang and yang 2009 szczepanowski et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 le et al 2018 including within a wwtp catchment in the uk where it was demonstrated that anthropogenic sources of args and abs are key in driving the presence of abs and args within aquatic environments elder et al 2021 here through utilisation of the stereoselective antimicrobial metabolism sam assay developed by elder et al f c elder et al 2020 we investigated the stereoselective metabolism of chloramphenicol by bacterial strains containing cata gene entering wwtps this study has increased our understanding of how stereoselective metabolism of antibiotics by anthropogenic bacteria influence the fate of chloramphenicol within a wwtp and its release into the environment 2 experimental section 2 1 materials hplc grade

was tested against the four p cap isomers rr ss rs and sr 100µl of 2mg l chloramphenicol single isomer and 100µl of 1 5 106 cfu of an individual bacterial strain were added to individual wells of 96 wells of thermofisher clear bottom microplate to give a final concentration of 1mg l chloramphenicol figure 3 then incubated in a plate reader at 37 c with shaking for abiotic controls 100µl of tsb replaced the addition of bacteria and for growth controls 100µl of tsb replaced the addition of the antibiotic bacteria growth at 37 c was then measured by a molecular devices spectramax3 plate reader at 600nm every minute over a 24 hour period the nanocosms for rr p cap and ss p cap were sampled at four time points t0h t5h t12h and t24h samples were diluted 1 10 in methanol with chloramphenicol d4

2020 with visualisation with pymol schrodinger llc software flexome for this constraint analysis is available from the university of bath wells 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation identification and minimum inhibitory concentrations bacteria strains were isolated from influent wastewater from two wwtps within a river catchment in the south west of england wwtp a serving 109 543 inhabitants and wwtp b serving 867 244 inhabitants based on the knowledge that both chloramphenicol and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene have been detected in the influent wastewater from these sites previously elder et al 2021 19 strains were isolated across the two wwtps and given an initial identification on brilliance uti chromogenic agar the species identified were enterococcus spp 6 escherichia coli 4 proetus spp 4 pseudomonas spp 2 and gram negative coliforms 3 mics for the four chloramphenicol enantiomers were then performed for all 19 strains isolated alongside the control strains nctc 12241 and nctc 775 see table 2 table 2 clearly shows that mics for individual cap isomers are isomer and isolated bacteria strain dependent the lowest mics were recorded for rr p cap which indicates that this cap isomer has the highest potency against selected bacteria whole genome sequencing was carried out for the 6 strains that had a brilliance uti agar identification of enterococcus spp three of the strains were identified as enterococcus spp while the other three were identified as serratia spp identification and resistance mechanisms can be found in table 3 it is interesting to note that the cat gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was only identified in enterococcus spp a common fecal bacteria but not in with serratia spp 3 2 stereoselective transformation of chloramphenicol the stereoselective metabolism of the rr p and ss p cap enantiomers by the strains 105 111 and 112 that carry the cata gene was investigated in nanocosm experiments using sam strains 100 101 244 with no cata gene present were used as negative controls the sam workflow was subsequently used to investigate the stereoselective metabolism of the other two chloramphenicol isomers rs p cap and sr p cap in the strains carrying the cata gene 105 111 112 3 2 1 strain 105 cata carrying the bacterial strain 105 which was confirmed to contain the cata gene was run through the sam workflow in order to determine if the cat enzyme present was stereoselective in its transformation of the rr p cap and ss p cap isomers figure 4 the chiral qqq analysis over a 24 hour period showed a significant reduction of the rr p cap isomer with no reduction of the ss p cap isomer investigation of metabolite formation via uplc qtof analysis after exposure of strain 105 to the rr p cap and ss p cap showed formation of the metabolite chloramphenicol acetate when the strain was exposed to the rr enantiomer and not the s s p enantiomer which clearly shows stereoselective metabolism of rr p cap over ss p cap p 7 77e 6 further investigations were then carried out focussed on the metabolism of the remaining two chloramphenicol isomers rs p cap and sr p cap here stereoselective metabolism of rs p cap was seen alongside formation of the chloramphenicol acetate metabolite no change in sr p cap concentration and no formation of the metabolite was observed indicating that cat is able to transform only rr p cap and rs p cap 3 2 2 strain 111 cata carrying strain 111 was isolated from influent wastewater and full genome sequencing confirmed chloramphenicol resistance was achieved through the presence of a cata gene using the sam workflow this strain was exposed to all 4 isomers of chloramphenicol figure 5 the analysis for the r r p and the s s p isomers were performed using chiral qqq and showed clear stereoselective metabolism of r r p cap p 3 96e 5 alongside formation of the metabolite cap acetate when the strain was exposed to the r r p isomer with no formation when exposed to the s s p isomer further investigations into the metabolism of r s and s r p cap where then carried out using chiral qqq here stereoselective metabolism of r s p cap was seen alongside formation of the chloramphenicol acetate metabolite when full chemical profiling using uplc qtof was performed 3 2 3 strain 112 cata carrying through utilising the sam workflow strain 112 isolated from influent wastewater and confirmed to carry the cata gene was exposed to all four isomers of chloramphenicol table 5 the chiral analyses for the rr p cap and the ss p cap isomers were performed using chiral qqq and showed stereoselective metabolism of rr p cap but not ss p cap p 0 013878 aleading to the formation of the metabolite cap acetate when the strain was exposed to the r r p isomer with no formation when exposed to the ss p isomer further investigations into the metabolism of rs p cap and sr p cap where then carried out using chiral qqq here there appeared to be preference for the metabolism of the rs p isomer the investigation of metabolites formed after exposure to the rs p cap and the sr p cap isomers showed that after 24hrs there was formation of cap acetate for only the rs p isomer 3 2 4 strain 100 101 244 other chloramphenicol resistance mechancisms than cat nanocosm experiments were performed for strain 100 101 244 for the investigation of the stereoselective metabolism of the rr p cap and ss p cap isomers no significant metabolism of either isomer was demonstrated which was to be expected as full genome sequencing did not show the presence of an enzymatic resistance mechanism to cap due to there being no significant loss of chloramphenicol during chiral analysis metabolite investigation using uplc qtof was not carried out results from abiotic controls can be seen in figure s4 3 3 computational analysis of cap bound to cat to gain a greater understanding around the role stereochemistry plays in the interaction between cat and cap computational analysis of cat bound to different isomers of cap was performed hydrophobic and polar interactions were detected based on interatomic distances and the polar interaction strength estimated based on the donor hydrogen acceptor distances and angles mcmanus wells and walker 2020 the crystal structures of 3u9f e coli type 1 cat complexed with cap and of 3cla e coli type iii cat complexed with cap were chosen for this study as other crystal structures found for cat variants did not have cap present figures 8 and 9 show the lodging of cap into the active sites of the two types of cat the type i and the type iii cat display the same geometry of cap in the binding site with the no2 group directed outwards towards the solvent not forming any interactions with the protein and the c c12 group folded back over the aromatic ring the consistent features of the interaction between cap and cat are that i the aromatic ring of cap interacts with hydrophobic residues from below i e on the side opposite to the chloro group of cap and that ii the cap o4 h forms a hydrogen bond with a neighbouring his residue this visualisation of the binding of cap to cat corresponds with the metabolism studies from the sam assay rr p cap and rs p cap metabolised while ss p cap and sr p cap are not this suggests that the stereochemistry around the first centre is key for cap to be complexed into the cat binding site figure 10 if this stereochemistry is wrong it is not possible to pose cap within the binding site so as to form the hydrogen bond between o4 h and the his acceptor alongside fitting the c c12 group into an appropriate position 3 4 environmental impact previous work by the authors had shown cata genes to be present in the influent of both wwtps while the achiral analysis for cap showed its presence in the influent wastewater of wwtp b elder et al water research submitted 2021 figure 11 in the same work the authors showed cap and cata to be present in the effluent of both wwtps figure 11 the presence of cap in the effluent of wwtp a but not in the influent can be explained through cleavage of parent compound from glucuronide metabolite in wwtpb positive removal of cap is seen with an average of 54 5 removal over the week and alongside the presence of cata in both influent and effluent wastewater this points towards bacterial metabolism playing a role in its removal the presence of cat and the fact it has been shown to be stereoselective has potential implications of enantiomeric enrichment within wastewater if multiple cap isomers are present this in turn could have implications on ecotoxicity if one isomer is more toxic than another while the active antibacterial potent isomer rr p cap is likely to select for the cat arg both wwtps released cap and bacterial carrying cata genes into the environment environmental risk assessments are required for antibiotics under current ema guidelines 2006 when the predicted environmental concentration exceeds 10 ngl 1 for all chemicals entering the environment the standardised approach for calculating the risk quotient is to divide the measured environmental concentrations mec by the predicted no effect concentration pnec where the pnec is determined through a range of standardized tests based on oecd guidelines oecd guidelines for antibiotics include a range of ecotoxicity tests including on aquatic organisms and an activated sludge respiration inhibition test asrit while asrit assesses the impact abs may have on the ability of the biological fraction including bacteria of a wwtp to treat wastewater none of the oecd guidelines address the impact abs have on the development and spread of amr this regulatory and knowledge gap in relation to the impact abs in the environment have on the development and spread of amr needs to be addressed and it has been proposed that a combination of pnecenviro and pnecmic are applied to the era for antibiotics tell et al 2019 in this approach the pnecenviro is generated from the standardised ecotoxicology tests whereas the pnecmic is derived from eucast breakpoint data for antibiotics bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 with the lowest of the two pnecs being used to regulate ab levels tell et al tell et al 2019 suggested applying the relevant pnec to the receiving streams while this approach goes someway to addressing eras for abs that are fit for purpose where these pnecmics are applied within the wastewater system also needs to be addressed as both args and abs are present in influent wastewater stereochemistry of cap and other abs as most abs have multiple chiral centres also requires urgent attention and it has not been considered so far in the context of era for antibiotics fig 6 7 table 1 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to undertake a series of assays to characterise the stereoselective metabolism of chloramphenicol by bacterial strains isolated from influent wastewater containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene 1 the common chloramphenicol resistance mechanism cat was shown to stereoselectively transform rr p cap and rs p cap into the inactive chloramphenicol acetate 2 metabolism of the ss p cap and sr p cap isomers by cat was not shown indicating the stereochemistry around the first stereocentre is key for the recognition and transformation of cap by cat 3 computational analysis of cap bound to cat was performed enabling the visualisation of how the stereochemistry of cap impacts on the ability of cat to bind it this confirmed the metabolism assays findings that the stereochemistry around the first stereocentre is key for recognition of the cat enzyme 4 analysis of influent and effluent wastewater for the presence of the cata gene and cap confirmed their presence in wastewater and subsequent release into the receiving environment giving the potential for stereoselective transformation to be taking place during wastewater treatment and in the environment further work is needed to fully understand 1 the enantiomeric fraction of chloramphenicol within wastewater 2 if enzymatic recognition of ss p cap or sr p cap can be induced and 3 the ecotoxicity of different chloramphenicol isomers in order to design an effective era for chloramphenicol and other antibiotics funding engineering and physical

16068,wastewater treatment plants have been highlighted as a potential hotspot for the development and spread of antibiotic resistance although antibiotic resistant bacteria in wastewater present a public health threat it is also possible that these bacteria play an important role in the bioremediation through the metabolism of antibiotics before they reach the wider environment here we address this possibility with a particular emphasis on stereochemistry using a combination of microbiology and analytical chemistry tools including the use of supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for chiral analysis and high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate metabolites due to the complexities around chiral analysis the antibiotic chloramphenicol was used as a proof of concept to demonstrate stereoselective metabolism due to its relatively simple chemical structure and availability over the counter in the u k the results presented here demonstrate the chloramphenicol can be stereoselectively transformed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme with the orientation around the first stereocentre being key for this process meaning that accumulation of two isomers may occur within the environment with potential impacts on ecotoxicity and emergence of bacterial antibiotic resistance within the environment graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics stereochemistry chirality transformation amr environment wastewater 1 introduction antibiotics abs have revolutionised healthcare animal husbandry agriculture and aquaculture since their discovery over a hundred years ago over the 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in the reporting of antibiotic resistance bacteria abr leading the world health organisation to recognise abr as a global health threat the focus on the therapeutic role of abs and the clinical implications of antibiotic resistance abr has led us to often overlook the fact that antibiotic biosynthetic genes and antibiotic resistance genes args have co evolved over millennia leading to a reservoir of args within the environment gonzález zorn and escudero 2012 this linked with the increasing presence of antibiotics within the environment due to poor stewardship has led to the increasing need to understand the role different environmental compartments play in the development and spread of antibiotic resistance manaia et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 it is also important to understand the fate of antibiotics within the environment including how abs are degraded or metabolised by micro organisms here we focus on the microbial transformation of the antibiotic chloramphenicol with specific focus on the role of stereochemistry and chirality stereochemistry is the study of the 3 dimensional shape of molecules through the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms within the molecule whilst chirality refers to the cases whereby a molecule is not superimposable on its mirror image helmchen 2016 pure enantiomers of chiral compounds exhibit the same physiochemical properties but due to their difference in 3 dimensional shape their behaviour within biochemical processes can be strikingly different this is because the biological world is 3 dimensional and therefore fundamentally chiral the fact that the living world is fundamentally chiral has been exploited in the production of enantiomerically pure drugs honma et al 1979 koeller and wong 2001 fessner et al 2015 and environmental bacterial metabolism of pharmaceuticals including fluoxetine ephedrine and amphetamines has been shown to be stereoselective bagnall et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2013 evans bagnall and kasprzyk hordern 2016 andrés costa et al 2017 rice et al 2018 the enantiomeric composition of ofloxacin in the aqueous environment was investigated by castringnano et al castrignanò et al 2018 where it was shown that there was an enrichment of s ofloxacin within the receiving waters of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp indicating potential stereoselective degradation of ofloxacin by bacteria within the wwtp this possible role of environmental bacteria in enantiomeric enrichment has also been shown through the enantioselective degradation of ofloxacin and levofloxacin by two strains of environmental bacteria maia tiritan and castro 2018 the potential role of stereochemistry in the fate of antibiotics within the environment has been discussed elsewhere elder et al 2020 there is however very little known experimentally about the stereoselectivity of metabolism of antibiotics by bacteria in relation to abr and its potential impact on the fate of antibiotics within the environment in this manuscript chloramphenicol is used as a proof of concept to test the hypothesis that enzymatic antibiotic resistance mechanisms that have the potential to play a role in the fate of antibiotics within the environment are stereoselective in nature chloramphenicol contains two asymmetric carbons chloramphenicol can exist as one of four stereoisomers or a member of two enantiomeric pairs figure 1 the r r chloramphenicol is the naturally produced stereoisomer and active isomer that is sold within the u k whilst all the others have been synthesised brock 1961 chloramphenicol its synthesis mode of action and resistance mechanisms in relation to stereochemistry have been reviewed elsewhere elder et al 2020 this manuscript focusses on understanding the role stereochemistry plays in the fate of chloramphenicol within the environment through investigating the stereoselectivity of a key bacterial resistance mechanism to chloramphenicol chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat cap is metabolised and deactivated by cat through the addition of two acetyl groups figure 2 which prevent cap binding to its rrna 16s target both cap and cat have been reported in many different environmental compartments lu dang and yang 2009 szczepanowski et al 2009 jiang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 le et al 2018 including within a wwtp catchment in the uk where it was demonstrated that anthropogenic sources of args and abs are key in driving the presence of abs and args within aquatic environments elder et al 2021 here through utilisation of the stereoselective antimicrobial metabolism sam assay developed by elder et al f c elder et al 2020 we investigated the stereoselective metabolism of chloramphenicol by bacterial strains containing cata gene entering wwtps this study has increased our understanding of how stereoselective metabolism of antibiotics by anthropogenic bacteria influence the fate of chloramphenicol within a wwtp and its release into the environment 2 experimental section 2 1 materials hplc grade

at 600nm every minute over a 24 hour period the nanocosms for rr p cap and ss p cap were sampled at four time points t0h t5h t12h and t24h samples were diluted 1 10 in methanol with chloramphenicol d4 as an internal standard 100 ng l chilled overnight at 5 c and centrifuged for 5 mins at 13000 rpm the supernatant was aspirated and placed into 500 µl plastic lc vials for analysis by sfc qqq the nanocosm for rs p cap and sr p cap were sampled at 3 time points t0 t5 and t24 samples were diluted 1 10 in methanol with chloramphenicol d5 as an internal standard 100 ng l chilled overnight at 5 c and centrifuged for 5 mins at 13000 rpm after aspiration of supernatant the supernatant was then evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in mobile phase 10mm ammonium acetate 90 10 dh2o acn before being analysed within 24hrs by chiral uplc qqq as described by camacho muñoz et al camacho muñoz and kasprzyk hordern 2015 statistical analysis was performed for each isomer using student t test two sample assuming equal variances two tailed 2 2 7 computational analysis of cap and cat interactions to enable visualisation of the binding of different chloramphenicol isomers to chloramphenicol acetate structures were downloaded from rscb protein data base pdb 10 2210 3cla pdb no date 10 2210 pbd3u9 pdb no date homotrimers were formed from the symmetry heteroatoms other than cap were eliminated hydrogens were added using molprobity web server at duke university williams et al 2018 hydrophobic and polar constraints were identified using the sbfirst protocol mcmanus wells and walker 2020 with visualisation with pymol schrodinger llc software flexome for this constraint analysis is available from the university of bath wells 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation identification and minimum inhibitory concentrations bacteria strains were isolated from influent wastewater from two wwtps within a river catchment in the south west of england wwtp a serving 109 543 inhabitants and wwtp b serving 867 244 inhabitants based on the knowledge that both chloramphenicol and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene have been detected in the influent wastewater from these sites previously elder et al 2021 19 strains were isolated across the two wwtps and given an initial identification on brilliance uti chromogenic agar the species identified were enterococcus spp 6 escherichia coli 4 proetus spp 4 pseudomonas spp 2 and gram negative coliforms 3 mics for the four chloramphenicol enantiomers were then performed for all 19 strains isolated alongside the control strains nctc 12241 and nctc 775 see table 2 table 2 clearly shows that mics for individual cap isomers are isomer and isolated bacteria strain dependent the lowest mics were recorded for rr p cap which indicates that this cap isomer has the highest potency against selected bacteria whole genome sequencing was carried out for the 6 strains that had a brilliance uti agar identification of enterococcus spp three of the strains were identified as enterococcus spp while the other three were identified as serratia spp identification and resistance mechanisms can be found in table 3 it is interesting to note that the cat gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was only identified in enterococcus spp a common fecal bacteria but not in with serratia spp 3 2 stereoselective transformation of chloramphenicol the stereoselective metabolism of the rr p and ss p cap enantiomers by the strains 105 111 and 112 that carry the cata gene was investigated in nanocosm experiments using sam strains 100 101 244 with no cata gene present were used as negative controls the sam workflow was subsequently used to investigate the stereoselective metabolism of the other two chloramphenicol isomers rs p cap and sr p cap in the strains carrying the cata gene 105 111 112 3 2 1 strain 105 cata carrying the bacterial strain 105 which was confirmed to contain the cata gene was run through the sam workflow in order to determine if the cat enzyme present was stereoselective in its transformation of the rr p cap and ss p cap isomers figure 4 the chiral qqq analysis over a 24 hour period showed a significant reduction of the rr p cap isomer with no reduction of the ss p cap isomer investigation of metabolite formation via uplc qtof analysis after exposure of strain 105 to the rr p cap and ss p cap showed formation of the metabolite chloramphenicol acetate when the strain was exposed to the rr enantiomer and not the s s p enantiomer which clearly shows stereoselective metabolism of rr p cap over ss p cap p 7 77e 6 further investigations were then carried out focussed on the metabolism of the remaining two chloramphenicol isomers rs p cap and sr p cap here stereoselective metabolism of rs p cap was seen alongside formation of the chloramphenicol acetate metabolite no change in sr p cap concentration and no formation of the metabolite was observed indicating that cat is able to transform only rr p cap and rs p cap 3 2 2 strain 111 cata carrying strain 111 was isolated from influent wastewater and full genome sequencing confirmed chloramphenicol resistance was achieved through the presence of a cata gene using the sam workflow this strain was exposed to all 4 isomers of chloramphenicol figure 5 the analysis for the r r p and the s s p isomers were performed using chiral qqq and showed clear stereoselective metabolism of r r p cap p 3 96e 5 alongside formation of the metabolite cap acetate when the strain was exposed to the r r p isomer with no formation when exposed to the s s p isomer further investigations into the metabolism of r s and s r p cap where then carried out using chiral qqq here stereoselective metabolism of r s p cap was seen alongside formation of the chloramphenicol acetate metabolite when full chemical profiling using uplc qtof was performed 3 2 3 strain 112 cata carrying through utilising the sam workflow strain 112 isolated from influent wastewater and confirmed to carry the cata gene was exposed to all four isomers of chloramphenicol table 5 the chiral analyses for the rr p cap and the ss p cap isomers were performed using chiral qqq and showed stereoselective metabolism of rr p cap but not ss p cap p 0 013878 aleading to the formation of the metabolite cap acetate when the strain was exposed to the r r p isomer with no formation when exposed to the ss p isomer further investigations into the metabolism of rs p cap and sr p cap where then carried out using chiral qqq here there appeared to be preference for the metabolism of the rs p isomer the investigation of metabolites formed after exposure to the rs p cap and the sr p cap isomers showed that after 24hrs there was formation of cap acetate for only the rs p isomer 3 2 4 strain 100 101 244 other chloramphenicol resistance mechancisms than cat nanocosm experiments were performed for strain 100 101 244 for the investigation of the stereoselective metabolism of the rr p cap and ss p cap isomers no significant metabolism of either isomer was demonstrated which was to be expected as full genome sequencing did not show the presence of an enzymatic resistance mechanism to cap due to there being no significant loss of chloramphenicol during chiral analysis metabolite investigation using uplc qtof was not carried out results from abiotic controls can be seen in figure s4 3 3 computational analysis of cap bound to cat to gain a greater understanding around the role stereochemistry plays in the interaction between cat and cap computational analysis of cat bound to different isomers of cap was performed hydrophobic and polar interactions were detected based on interatomic distances and the polar interaction strength estimated based on the donor hydrogen acceptor distances and angles mcmanus wells and walker 2020 the crystal structures of 3u9f e coli type 1 cat complexed with cap and of 3cla e coli type iii cat complexed with cap were chosen for this study as other crystal structures found for cat variants did not have cap present figures 8 and 9 show the lodging of cap into the active sites of the two types of cat the type i and the type iii cat display the same geometry of cap in the binding site with the no2 group directed outwards towards the solvent not forming any interactions with the protein and the c c12 group folded back over the aromatic ring the consistent features of the interaction between cap and cat are that i the aromatic ring of cap interacts with hydrophobic residues from below i e on the side opposite to the chloro group of cap and that ii the cap o4 h forms a hydrogen bond with a neighbouring his residue this visualisation of the binding of cap to cat corresponds with the metabolism studies from the sam assay rr p cap and rs p cap metabolised while ss p cap and sr p cap are not this suggests that the stereochemistry around the first centre is key for cap to be complexed into the cat binding site figure 10 if this stereochemistry is wrong it is not possible to pose cap within the binding site so as to form the hydrogen bond between o4 h and the his acceptor alongside fitting the c c12 group into an appropriate position 3 4 environmental impact previous work by the authors had shown cata genes to be present in the influent of both wwtps while the achiral analysis for cap showed its presence in the influent wastewater of wwtp b elder et al water research submitted 2021 figure 11 in the same work the authors showed cap and cata to be present in the effluent of both wwtps figure 11 the presence of cap in the effluent of wwtp a but not in the influent can be explained through cleavage of parent compound from glucuronide metabolite in wwtpb positive removal of cap is seen with an average of 54 5 removal over the week and alongside the presence of cata in both influent and effluent wastewater this points towards bacterial metabolism playing a role in its removal the presence of cat and the fact it has been shown to be stereoselective has potential implications of enantiomeric enrichment within wastewater if multiple cap isomers are present this in turn could have implications on ecotoxicity if one isomer is more toxic than another while the active antibacterial potent isomer rr p cap is likely to select for the cat arg both wwtps released cap and bacterial carrying cata genes into the environment environmental risk assessments are required for antibiotics under current ema guidelines 2006 when the predicted environmental concentration exceeds 10 ngl 1 for all chemicals entering the environment the standardised approach for calculating the risk quotient is to divide the measured environmental concentrations mec by the predicted no effect concentration pnec where the pnec is determined through a range of standardized tests based on oecd guidelines oecd guidelines for antibiotics include a range of ecotoxicity tests including on aquatic organisms and an activated sludge respiration inhibition test asrit while asrit assesses the impact abs may have on the ability of the biological fraction including bacteria of a wwtp to treat wastewater none of the oecd guidelines address the impact abs have on the development and spread of amr this regulatory and knowledge gap in relation to the impact abs in the environment have on the development and spread of amr needs to be addressed and it has been proposed that a combination of pnecenviro and pnecmic are applied to the era for antibiotics tell et al 2019 in this approach the pnecenviro is generated from the standardised ecotoxicology tests whereas the pnecmic is derived from eucast breakpoint data for antibiotics bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 with the lowest of the two pnecs being used to regulate ab levels tell et al tell et al 2019 suggested applying the relevant pnec to the receiving streams while this approach goes someway to addressing eras for abs that are fit for purpose where these pnecmics are applied within the wastewater system also needs to be addressed as both args and abs are present in influent wastewater stereochemistry of cap and other abs as most abs have multiple chiral centres also requires urgent attention and it has not been considered so far in the context of era for antibiotics fig 6 7 table 1 4 conclusions the main aim of this paper was to undertake a series of assays to characterise the stereoselective metabolism of chloramphenicol by bacterial strains isolated from influent wastewater containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene 1 the common chloramphenicol resistance mechanism cat was shown to stereoselectively transform rr p cap and rs p cap into the inactive chloramphenicol acetate 2 metabolism of the ss p cap and sr p cap isomers by cat was not shown indicating the stereochemistry around the first stereocentre is key for the recognition and transformation of cap by cat 3 computational analysis of cap bound to cat was performed enabling the visualisation of how the stereochemistry of cap impacts on the ability of cat to bind it this confirmed the metabolism assays findings that the stereochemistry around the first stereocentre is key for recognition of the cat enzyme 4 analysis of influent and effluent wastewater for the presence of the cata gene and cap confirmed their presence in wastewater and subsequent release into the receiving environment giving the potential for stereoselective transformation to be taking place during wastewater treatment and in the environment further work is needed to fully understand 1 the enantiomeric fraction of chloramphenicol within wastewater 2 if enzymatic recognition of ss p cap or sr p cap can be induced and 3 the ecotoxicity of different chloramphenicol isomers in order to design an effective era for chloramphenicol and other antibiotics funding engineering and physical

16069,pollution levels in stormwater vary significantly during rain events with pollutant flushes carrying a major fraction of an event pollutant load in a short period understanding these flushes is thus essential for stormwater management however current studies mainly focus on describing the first flush or are limited by predetermined flush categories this study provides a new perspective on the topic by applying data driven approaches to categorise mass volume mv curves for tss into distinct classes of flush tailored to specific monitoring location functional data analysis fda was used to investigate the dynamics of mv curves in two large data sets consisting of 343 measured events and 915 modelled events respectively potential links between classes of mv curves and combinations of rain characteristics were explored through a priori clustering this yielded correct class assignments for 23 63 of the events using different combinations of mv curve clustering and rainfall characteristics this suggests that while global rainfall characteristics influence flush they are not sufficient as sole explanatory variables of different flush phenomena and additional explanatory variables are needed to assign mv curves into classes with a predictive power that is suitable for e g design of stormwater control measures our results highlight the great potential of the fda methodology as a new approach for classifying describing and understanding pollutant flush signals in stormwater keywords pollutant flush separate sewer systems mv curves clustering urban stormwater management 1 introduction pollutants carried by urban runoff in separate sewer systems pose an environmental threat to the natural receiving water bodies brudler et al 2019 eriksson et al 2011 göbel et al 2007 koziel et al 2019 walsh et al 2005 zgheib et al 2011 as well as to human health if e g runoff is used as source of potable water kus et al 2010 ma et al 2019 to enable management actions aiming to reduce and mitigate this threat it is thus critical to gain knowledge of expected pollutant levels and of their spatial and temporal variations pollutants in stormwater runoff stem from multiple release processes in the catchment dry and wet atmospheric deposition surface weathering leaching from building materials and release from anthropogenic sources such as the use of specific chemicals pesticides spills etc or vehicular activity deletic and orr 2005 eriksson et al 2005 göbel et al 2007 müller et al 2020 during rain events these pollutants are washed off and transported away by rainfall and by the generated runoff the resulting runoff quality thus depends on the factors driving the pollutant accumulation the mobilisation and the transport mechanisms resulting in large inter and intra events variations in both concentrations and loads bertrand krajewski et al 1998 lee et al 2002 qin et al 2016 historically there has been a vast interest in describing pollutant flushes during a rain event with great emphasis often being put on the first flush i e pollutant flushes carrying out the majority of the event load during the first part of the event the occurrence of first flush have been studied by a great number of studies proposing different definition schemes and developing different classification to describe this phenomenon jensen 2022 the increasing amount of available data on stormwater runoff quality has enabled the application of data driven and statistical methods for exploring these datasets and gaining knowledge on pollutant flushes for example deletic 1998 applied linear multi regression analysis to search for correlations between the flush in the first 20 of the runoff and combinations of rainfall and runoff characteristics both bach et al 2010 and sun et al 2015 used the wilcoxon rank sum test to group pieces of runoff events with similar concentration levels to determine the catchment specific volume carrying the first flush li et al 2012 applied redundancy analysis to quantify the influence of rain and catchment characteristics on the variation in the strength of the first flush li et al 2015 used pearson correlation analysis to connect event mean concentrations emcs and the strength of flush in the first 40 of the runoff to catchment and rain characteristics finally perera et al 2019 applied a random forest tree based method in order to identify nonlinear relationships between rain and catchment characteristics and first flush however a common denominator in studies of flush dynamics including the data driven studies mentioned above is their sole focus on describing the first flush or their limitation to predetermined flush categories jensen 2022 this exclusive focus might neglect other site specific and perhaps more relevant tendencies and patterns disregarding the span of variation in inter and intra event pollutant distributions that deviate from the general behaviour defined in literature indeed there is a gap in the use of more exploratory approaches with a broader scope than and not limited to the first flush such approaches can support stormwater planners in developing robust practices for managing pollutants in urban runoff by considering all possible flush patterns in a site and their impacts on the planned stormwater control measure functional data analysis fda is a strong tool for revealing dynamics of underlying processes in repeated observations wang et al 2016 and it has the added benefit of not relying on approximations to a specific curve shape as such fda has been employed for different purposes within the field of water management e g for analysing spatial and temporal variabilities of rainfall data in order to identify basis functions of rainfall pattern at different stations or seasons suhaila and yusop 2017 for detecting anomalies in flow within water supply networks millán roures et al 2018 or classifying streamflow hydrographs ternynck et al 2016 these examples show how fda was applied for classifying functional data determining main trends or detecting outliers to the best of our knowledge this methodology has never been applied for analysing stormwater pollutant flush dynamics possibly because it requires the availability of rather large data sets this study aims to provide a better understanding of pollutant flushes in separate sewer systems by using unsupervised analysis tools based on fda to i explore and categorise distinct mass volume mv curve shapes and ii describe their frequency of occurrence furthermore we iii assess the potential for linking the resulting flush classes to combinations of rain variables the study is undertaken using large data sets of events from both monitored and modelled case studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 theory of mv curves and flush drivers a widely applied approach to describe pollutant flushes during an event is based on mv curves which have been extensively investigated in scientific literature e g bertrand krajewski et al 1998 chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 kong et al 2021 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 perera et al 2021 mv curves present the relative cumulative mass m as a function of the relative cumulative volume v enabling the analysis of flush signals see fig 1 the first flush takes place if the majority of the mass is carried in the prophase of the runoff volume and its strength is described by the convexity of the superior mv curve no flush occurs if the mv curve follows the bisector while a second flush or middle flush occurs when the mv curve follows an s shape with the majority of the mass discharged in the metaphase if the mv curve is concave inferior it indicates that the majority of the mass is discharged in the anaphase resulting in third flush or late flush the mv curve approach thus enables the comparison of flush signals across events with different mass volume and duration however several flushes may occur during a single event resulting in a large variety of possible mv curve shapes mv curves are often fit to polynomial approximations in order to conduct data analysis e g métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 this may be a good approximation for superior and inferior curves but it is a poor estimation for s curves or reverse s curves while the event normalisation allows a comparison of dynamics across events that may otherwise be hard to compare other relevant event characteristics magnitude duration return period etc are lost therefore if relevant for e g design purpose events should be pre selected based on these characteristics before the mv curve normalisation and analysis although several studies investigating the drivers of flush signals are based on mv curves it is often hard to compare their results due to the use of different flush definitions focus on different pollutants and different local conditions indeed deletic 1998 noticed that the influential rainfall and runoff characteristics might differ for catchments of very similar characteristics perera et al 2019 found that rain related variables were ranked highest in terms of influence on first flush and suggested that their combination might yield better results while the occurrence of first flush has been found to be affected by the type of pollutant particulate or dissolved the system combined or separate the catchment characteristics land use slope size etc the sampling technique and the flush definition jensen 2022 rain characteristics are among the most typically explored drivers in part as they are more frequently accessible one explanation could be that rain characteristics are assumed to be the major driver of inter event variability while other drivers are often assumed to be constant or to have little influence at the temporal scale a great disagreement is found in literature on the influence of the antecedent dry weather period adwp also called antecedent dry weather days adwd or antecedent dry days add e g chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 li et al 2012 schriewer et al 2008 this is notable as this variable constitutes the backbone of build up modules in several accumulation washoff models several studies stressed the influence of rain intensity e g chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 li et al 2012 however athanasiadis et al 2010 found that intensity did not affect first flush effects of cu in roof runoff and schriewer et al 2008 found that zn in roof runoff is correlated with lower rain intensities furthermore kong et al 2021 found that first flush effect depended on the timing on the maximum intensity and similarly mixed interpretations can be found for the influence of total rain depth of an event and its duration athanasiadis et al 2010 chow and yusop 2014 kang et al 2008 li et al 2015 perera et al 2019 as studies on influential flush factors often point in different directions it is likely that the governing explanatory variables are case specific this stresses the need for approaches capable of evaluating flush signals systematically rather than general definitions that may not apply under local conditions 2 2 case studies in order to capture several different flush signals it is necessary to utilise an extensive data set from a specific location therefore the analysis was carried out on a large data set of monitored total suspended solids tss data from chassieu france as large data sets of tss data are seldom available with chassieu being one of the few examples worldwide these were supplemented by a set of modelled data from albertslund denmark obtained using a state of the art accumulation washoff model while inherently uncertain due to the model simplification of reality the modelled data have the additional benefit of being less affected by measurements noise and they are thereby assumed easier to analyse for both data sets tss concentration time series are used as indicator for pollutant levels 2 2 1 chassieu data set monitored the chassieu catchment covers an industrial area in the outskirts of lyon france drained by a separate sewer system continuous monitoring of rain 6 minute time steps flow and turbidity 2 minute time steps was carried out from 2004 to 2011 the data set is described in métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 and sun et al 2015 while the conversion from turbidity to tss is reported in métadier and bertrand krajewski 2011 the data set includes 716 events but not all of these contain complete measurement series see table 1 for further details we refer to the previous works conducted on this data set e g métadier and bertrand krajewski 2011 2012 sandoval et al 2018 sun et al 2015 2 2 2 albertslund data set modelled the albertslund catchment covers a residential industrial area in the outskirts of copenhagen denmark drained by a separate sewer system continuous monitoring of rain flow and turbidity was carried out in 2010 2011 these measurements were used to calibrate a dynamic stormwater pollution model based on the state of the art accumulation washoff process vezzaro et al 2015 the model parameters were estimated by using the pseudo bayesian uncertainty based methodology described in vezzaro et al 2013 to propagate model uncertainties a total of 1 000 parameter sets were sampled from the behavioural parameters identified in vezzaro et al 2015 these were used to simulate a 10 year period using rainfall data covering the period 1994 2004 resulting in a total of 1 094 discharge events the characteristics of each event volume load etc were calculated on the median of the 1 000 simulations see table 1 2 3 data analysis this study utilises a data driven and exploratory approach based on techniques from functional data analysis fda which allow for the identification of multiple categories and types of flush signals without relying on predetermined definition schemes an overview of the performed steps for both case studies is given in fig 2 and further elaborated in the following subsections 1 data preparation a validation of the events was carried out selecting those to be analysed preparing mv curves and extracting rain characteristics for the further steps 2 mv curve analysis this step explored the dynamics of mv curves and divided them into classes based on their shape 3 rain variables analysis non essential variables were eliminated before the combined analysis 4 combined analysis this step explored the direct relationship between mv classes and rain variables and indirect relationships between mv classes and combinations of rain variables 2 3 1 data preparation events in the monitored data set chassieu that contained missing values of runoff flow or tss concentration for more than 10 continuous minutes were discarded missing values for less than 10 continuous minutes were linearly interpolated the modelled data set albertslund included small rainfall events that did not generate runoff therefore events with a rain duration of shorter than 10 minutes were eliminated as generally these events had very low rain depth for each event in the data set mv curves were generated using tss and flow data to ensure that all mv curves had equal discretisation a prerequisite for the used fda algorithms they were rescaled using interpolation to ensure a discretisation of 101 steps per curve corresponding to a value of 0 1 100 of the duration of the runoff event an overview of the investigated rain characteristics is provided in table 2 which includes both variables found to be significant by previous studies and additional new variables for the chassieu data set rain data was only available for the events in the database i e there were no data for the periods between the recorded events so the adwp was estimated based on the 716 available events also for both the chassieu and the albertslund data sets there was no information about rain preceding the first event in the database so adwp and values of antecedent rain in the last 2 14 days ar2 14 were set to zero 2 3 2 mv curve analysis a functional principal components analysis fpca was run to explore the shape and dynamics of the mv curves followed by functional clustering to divide the mv curves into classes fpca is the most common first step of any fda as it reduces the dimensionality of the longitudinal data and creates a foundation for many other fda methods chen et al 2017 in addition to offering insight in itself it is based on an eigenvalue analysis of the underlying covariance operators of the observed process fpca was used to generate eigenfunctions for the functional data until a high percentage of the variance 99 9 was described each eigenfunction has a corresponding list of eigenvalues with length matching the number of events in the data set this resembles the principal component pc scores for that particular pc index both the fpca and the functional clustering were carried out using the fdapace package carroll et al 2020 which is an open source r package for fda and empirical dynamics an equivalent pace package is also available for matlab http www stat ucdavis edu pace the functional clustering was carried out to identify natural mv profile classes in an unsupervised manner through strict partitioning clustering meaning that each object belongs to exactly one cluster the fdapace package offers two options for functional clustering the expectation maximization cluster emcluster algorithm and the k centers functional clustering kcfc algorithm emcluster uses the fpc scores previously calculated through fdapace carroll et al 2020 and creates multivariate gaussian distributions for each cluster chen and maitra 2015 kcfc looks at both the mean and modes of the variation differentials between clusters by predicting the cluster membership through an iterative covariance updating scheme here local linear smoothing is applied covariance for each curve is calculated separately and aggregated to estimate the smoothed covariance followed by eigenanalysis and calculation of fpc scores using conditional expectation chiou and li 2007 both algorithms were tested to find the best way to divide the data set into a natural number of clusters a comparison was made through visual inspection of the resulting clusters and by looking at the sum of squared errors sse i e the summed and squared mean distance from each fpc score across all dimensions needed to reach 99 9 explained variance to the centre of its associated cluster 2 3 3 rain variables analysis in order to prepare the rain variables for the pca and cluster analysis they were first checked for collinearity i e whether any of the variables were linear predictors of each other while pca can in itself remove collinearity pc scores will be affected by the redundant features included in the analysis through collinear variables clustering collinear variables can indeed place additional weight on a feature because it is represented in multiple variables although removing collinear variables is usually considered not to affect k means clustering it has the extra benefit of speeding up calculations and achieving a more parsimonious model the collinearity was evaluated by looking at correlation plots of all the rain variables multivariate collinearity was evaluated by running a linear regression with the fpc scores as response variables and rain variables as explanatory variables and evaluating the variance inflation factor vif of the resulting regression 2 3 4 combined analysis firstly a direct comparison of the mv curves and rain variables was conducted by looking at box plots of rain variable values for each cluster from the functional clustering analysis furthermore a kruskal wallis test was carried out to ascertain if significant difference had been obtained between the clusters for each rain variable kruskal and wallis 1952 it is a nonparametric global test across all classes at once consistent with the data driven approach to cluster analysis followed in this paper the test uses a null hypothesis that the median for each rain variable is comparable across groupings mv classes which is rejected if any of the classes stand out with a significantly different value if the test shows that some of the mv classes provide values of rain characteristics significantly different from the rest this indicates a potential for using rain variables as explanatory factors of the mv classes secondly a clustering scheme was set up to combine the rain variables investigating if their joint variation can be linked to the mv categories the analysis first looked at using a single rain variable and then an increasing number of variables were combined before clustering the variables were standardised and ran through a pca to reduce dimensionality and increase the efficiency of the analysis clustering was carried out using a standard k means approach the mv categories were used as an a priori classification for the clustering of the rain variables and a contingency table as shown in table 3 was produced for each combination of rain variables to evaluate the performance we used the two indicators applied by chiou and li 2007 for comparison of two partitionings crate and arand crate the maximal possible ratio of correctly classified objects bounded by 0 and 1 calculated as the sum of the diagonal in the contingency matrix see table 3 divided by the total number of events as the diagonal represents events placed in the same cluster by both partitions arand a corrected version of the rand index rand 1971 proposed by hubert and arabie 1985 which describes the agreement between two partitions of objects events in this study by looking at the number of paired objects that are in the same or different groups in both partitions it is calculated as in eq 1 with nomenclature referring to the contingency table in table 3 here a comparison is made between clusters of partitions x and y with a i as the total amount of events placed in the i th cluster in x b j as the total amount of events placed in the j th cluster in y n i j as the amount of events from cluster i in the x partition placed in cluster j in the y partition and n as the total number of events arand has an upper bound of 1 and an expected value of 0 although negative values may occur if the degree of similarity between the two partitions is less than what would be expected in the case of two random

discarding step led to a reduction in the number of events in each data set from 716 to 343 events for the monitored data set chassieu and from 1094 to 915 events for the modelled data albertslund a summary of the validated events is given in table 1 the mv curves for the chassieu and albertslund sites are shown in fig 3 both plots show a wide span of mv curves on both sides of the bisector rather than any single general trend in curve profile interestingly the accumulation washoff model does not produce evident first flush signals see fig 3b suggesting that differences in input rainfall dynamics between events are a major driver behind inter and intra event variation in mv curves as expected the mv curves show a greater variability in the measured chassieu data set compared to the modelled albertslund data the simplification and structural limitations of the model structure accumulation washoff clearly lumped the variety of processes taking place in the natural system although accumulation washoff processes are often used to support the theory behind first flush hypothesis the simulation results display that the dynamic behaviour of rainfall plays a major role in the pollutant mobilisation in the catchment and transport in the drainage system and thereby in the presence of flush signals the mean of the mv curves shows a slight tendency of a middle flush in chassieu while the mean in albertslund is closer to the bisector the extraction of rain characteristics from the data set resulted in seventeen different rain variables see table 2 3 2 mv curve analysis more than 96 of the chassieu variability and more than 99 of the albertslund variability is summarised in the first 3 principal components of the fpca see fig 4 a and 4 b the large amount of information included in such few components shows a high level of structure in the data set i e the curves share many similarities the first three eigenfunctions for the two case studies are shown in fig 4c 4 e each eigenfunction represents a component of the basis on which mv curves are rebuilt while the eigenvalue gives information on the importance of the associated eigenfunction in this reconstruction interestingly an additional inflection point appears for each new eigenfunction for both data sets and this trend continues beyond the first three eigenfunctions shown in fig 4c this shows that the majority of the mv curves represented by the first eigenfunction have only one inflection point followed by curves with two inflection points etc using approximations with a single inflection point such as the polynomial approximation x b e g used by métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 would thus only describe the fraction of the mv curves corresponding to the variance explained by first eigenfunction the first bar of the scree plots i e 76 95 for chassieu and 89 92 for albertslund the eigenfunction plots fig 4c 4d show how the considered functions the mv curves differ from the mean similarly to the analysed mv curves all the eigenfunctions have an initial value of 0 and an end value of 1 this demonstrates how the eigenfunctions can be used to highlight similarities across the data set although this particular similarity is apparent without the aid of eigenfunctions the plots show that the functions for chassieu are less symmetrical than for the albertslund case with the first eigenfunction skewing left and the first modes of the following eigenfunctions having larger amplitudes than the following modes this shift comes from the displacement of the mean from the bisector as seen in fig 3a there seems to be a larger mass fraction in the metaphase and a smaller in the anaphase but the mean does not show an s shape form crossing the bisector if the mean mv curve moves from a convex to a s shape it will result in a displacement of the eigenfunctions culminating with the introduction of a second inflection point already in the first eigenfunction in terms of relevance to stormwater planners the eigenfunctions and the scree plot provide an estimate of i the fraction of events with none or one consistent flush effect the first bar and first eigenfunction and ii the fraction of events that exhibit multiple flush effects and cross the bisector the rest the first information is relevant to time the capture of pollutant flushes by stormwater control measures scms and the latter provides a quantification of the events with multiple flushes indicating the fraction of events where traditional pollution management approaches focusing solely on first flush jensen 2022 are likely to fail or to provide a lower efficacy than originally planned regarding the functional clustering fig 5 shows the development in sse as a function of the number of clusters for both case studies using both emcluster and kcfc the sse was calculated using a number of fpca components explaining more than 99 99 of the variance 26 iterations for chassieu and 14 for albertslund the sse was calculated on the fpc scores from the fpca since these scores are used directly for clustering by the emcluster algorithm it is no surprise that the emcluster approach performs better lower sse than the kcfc algorithm the latter method in fact calculates its own fpc scores as part of the clustering process both methods obtained a lower sse in albertslund compared to chassieu explained by the smaller variability shown by the modelled mv curves both the emcluster and the kcfc algorithms recognised principal curve profiles however the emcluster seemed to create clusters with less overlap and it also ran considerably faster the analysis of the mv curves classified according to cluster memberships reveals that the local peaks in the sse plot arise when a cluster includes events from both sides of the bisector see supplementary material for plots of the classified mv curves this is sufficient if one is only interested in the degree of flush and not in its type by applying the elbow criterion to the sse plot the optimal number of cluster was 10 for the chassieu data and 8 for albertslund however the use of such a great number of classes of mv curves might not be recommended for practical applications i e in a planning situation where decision makers need to assess a limited number of events or response options and it might be difficult to maintain an overview or differentiating responses if too many classes are used therefore it was chosen to perform the analysis both with the optimal number of clusters 10 for chassieu and 8 for albertslund respectively and with a reduced number of clusters 4 for chassieu and 3 for albertslund respectively assumed to be more manageable by decision makers in a planning situation these clusters represent an advancement compared to the use of predefined flush categories which might not reflect the characteristics of the catchment under study figs 6 9 display the mv curves grouped for the different number of clusters when a smaller number of clusters was used a great number of classes tend to cross the bisector showing how these clusters are suited for describing the magnitude of flush but not its type a greater number of clusters resulted in a clearer more distinct classification of mv curves where patters in terms of flush type s shape inferior or superior and the magnitude of flush amplitude of concavity or convexity can be identified overall the fpca and the functional clustering approach provided useful insights into the data sets the widespread binary tendency to sort pollutant patterns into either fist flush or not first flush means that we lose the opportunity for tailoring the appropriate management response to the actual degree of flush as the fda approach is not limited by such predetermined classes it is a much more feasible approach to categorise flushes also it analyses the mv curves directly i e without making polynomial approximations to extract curve shape features and it is thus better suited for representing the actual flush patterns furthermore the fpca methodology proved to contribute insights into the governing mv curve shapes e g in terms of number of inflection points which is important to evaluate the implications of multiple flushes the clustering can be coupled in the future with the identification of generalised curves for different flush patterns which can be used in planning situation as flush scenarios limited to the number of cluster that are deemed as manageable by decision makers e g 4 clusters for the chassieu case few studies have addressed the uncertainty related to pollutant flushes some examples can be seen in the work by sharifi et al 2011 and perera et al 2021 but these both used an exponential approximation and focused solely on the first flush considering the benefits of the fda methodology applied in this study it would be interesting to also apply fda to describe flush uncertainties 3 3 rain variables analysis the qualitative analysis of inter correlation plots between the variables led to the elimination of six variables showing a high degree of collinearity with other variables see supplementary material the 11 remaining variables are highlighted in bold table 2 for the estimation of multicollinearity between the variables all vif values for both the chassieu and the albertslund data set proved to be less than 5 see supplementary material which is not considered problematic craney and surles 2002 and did not give rise to further variable elimination therefore multicollinearity should not affect the results when combining several rain variables to match the mv clusters methodology step 4 3 4 combined analysis regarding the direct comparison between rain variables and mv classes box plots for chassieu 4 and 10 clusters and for albertslund 3 and 8 clusters are enclosed in the supplementary material table 4 summarises the p values from the kruskal wallis test for each rain variable as the 44 tests were carried out simultaneously the bonferroni correction was applied to ensure adequate significance before rejecting the null hypothesis which is why p values 0 001 p n 0 05 44 are highlighted in the table regarding the a priori classification table 5 6 shows the best performing combination measured by crate for each number of variables included in the clustering it should be noted that the highest arand values were not always achieved by the same combination of variables that yielded the highest crate 3 4 1 chassieu the box plots of rain variable distributions across the mv classes see supplementary material showed a visible difference for the no rain variable in both the 4 and the 10 mv cluster scenario in the latter scenario cluster 8 stands out the mv curves from this cluster figure are in fact mostly s shaped curves it is worth highlighting this result as this group of mv curves cannot be approximated using the traditional x b formula and it seems to have a clear predictor variable the kruskal wallis test summarised in table 4 also had low p values for the no rain variable only for 4 clusters as well as for several of the other rain variables this indicates that the applied mv classes manage to divide the rain variables into groups so that at least one group is significantly different from the rest considering the a priori classification table 5 then the maximum rate of correct fda class assignment of mv curves based on rain characteristics was 45 for the 4 mv classes scenario and 23 for the 10 mv classes scenario it is expected that it will be harder to achieve a high rate of correct assignment when more mv classes are involved in both cases there was no increase in performance when including more rain variables in combination the calculations that relied on only a single variable resulted in the following ranking of the rain ordered by crate 4 mv classes ar2 0 45 max int last 0 41 depth 0 40 adwp 0 39 ar7 0 38 max step rel 0 37 dur 0 35 max int 0 35 max int 50rel 0 33 month 0 31 and no rain 0 30 10 mv classes ar2 0 23 max int 0 20 ar7 0 20 max int last 0 19 max step rel 0 18 adwp 0 18 depth 0 18 no rain 0 17 dur 0 17 max int 50rel 0 17 and month 0 17 all the best performing combinations from both mv class scenarios except one included the variable ar2 indicating that the very recent antecedent rainfall is influential to the mv curve shape this supports that the mv curve shape is susceptible to the applied event definition as different event definitions might have included or excluded more of the rain close to the event the arand values generally indicated that the model performance was close to that of random assignment 0 3 4 2 albertslund the box plots of rain variables distributions across the mv classes see supplementary material showed a visible difference for max step rel max int 50rel no rain and dur in both the 3 and the 8 mv cluster scenario for no rain the cluster that stands out the most in both scenarios includes the mv curves that are closest to the bisector see figures and and which seem to have had a continuous rain pattern without breaks low values of no rain for max step rel and max int 50rel the cluster that stands out the most in the 8 mv cluster scenario is the one including extremely concave curves see figure because the maximum intensity of the rain has taken place late in the event resulting in a high max step rel and a low max int 50rel in the 3 cluster scenario these curves have been mixed with the extremely convex curves see causing a larger span in the max step rel and max int 50rel values regarding dur both the very concave and convex curves see and had long durations there is a possible bias as events with long duration will have more monitoring points or data extraction points in the case of modelled data meaning that they are more likely to display higher amplitudes while events with shorter duration will have fewer monitoring points and therefore concentration variations might be missed the kruskal wallis test summarised in table 4 revealed several cases of low p value including max step rel only for 3 clusters max int 50rel only for 3 clusters no rain and dur regarding the a priori classification table 6 there seems to be a slight trade off between the increase in crate and arand the maximum rate of correct assignment was 63 for the 3 mv classes scenario and 32 for the 8 classes scenario and in general the arand values suggest a performance that is marginally better than random assignment the calculations that relied on only a single variable resulted in the following ranking of the rain ordered by crate 3 mv classes adwp 0 52 no rain 0 50 depth 0 48 dur 0 47 ar2 0 46 max int 0 44 max int last 0 43 max step rel 0 33 max int 50rel 0 33 ar7 0 30 and month 0 27 8 mv classes depth 0 30 no rain 0 30 dur 0 30 max int 0 27 adwp 0 25 ar2 0 23 max int last 0 23 max int 50rel 0 23 max step rel 0 21 ar7 0 19 and month 0 18 the variable depth is included in all the best performing combinations of variables closely followed by no rain adwp was expected to be influential as the pollutant build up in the model directly depends on this variable however it is not included in the best performing combinations until 7 8 variables are combined instead variables related to the washoff process such as the max int proved more influential 3 4 3 joint reflections overall better mv class prediction was achieved with the modelled data set compared to the monitored a direct consequence of the simplification of reality behind the used model other than measurement uncertainty the long period covered by the chassieu data might be affected by changes in the pollutant sources across the catchment which considering the industrial characteristics of the chassieu catchment cannot be excluded conversely given the shorter monitoring period pollutant sources were considered constant in the model of the albertslund catchment both data sets are however influenced by the dynamics and non linearities of the drainage systems which was not taken into account for either data set when using only rain variables the kruskal wallis test illustrated how the rain variables had easier discrimination of clusters for the cases with fewer mv classes and similarly the degree of correct cluster assignment crate approximately doubled in the cases of fewer mv classes however arand values did not improve for fewer mv classes and in fact decreased for the albertslund data set which underlines how fewer classes also mean higher chance of correct assignment by a random grouping when looking at both data sets the gain in crate from including multiple rain variables in combination as predictors seems almost negligible as approximately the same accuracy is achieved from using only a single rain characteristic while it was possible to recognise connections between the classes of mv curves and the individual rain variables a satisfactory mv curve class assignment could not be reached purely based on rain characteristics for either of the data sets this study included rain characteristics that were identified as relevant by other flush studies which represent conditions linked to both each individual event preceding events and seasonality and which are expressed in both relative e g no rain and absolute terms e g depth it should be underlined that most of the variables listed in table 2 are lumped variables i e they considerably simplify the representation of rainfall events in particular they neglect the dynamics within each event i e the variation of the rainfall intensity at short time step pollutographs and the resulting mv curves depend on variations in the hyetograph in addition to other causes different from the rainfall events consequently it is not surprising that simple global indicators even combined or aggregated are not fully relevant to predict mv curves and it seems unlikely that any additional rain characteristics could significantly improve the mv class assignment ultimately it must be concluded that rain characteristics seem to influence the flush signal but that clusters of rain variables alone are not sufficient as explanatory variables for the classes of mv curves created by the fda approach 3 5 future research areas the results of this study represent only a first step into the application of new methods to describe the behaviour of stormwater pollution during rain event as such new opportunities and research areas are now outlined multi catchment comparison the chassieu data set represent so far one of the largest available tss data sets but it can be expected that new monitoring campaigns will provide new data that will increase the applicability of fda based approaches and will allow to investigate the presence of site specific and or more general patterns identification of new explanatory variables capable of describing and understanding the drivers behind the inter and intra event variability strengthening the predictive power of water quality models this would require the analysis of additional data sets from other study areas to identify variables linked to the catchment spatial characteristics e g land usage climatic regime formalised description of clusters i e describing general curves for each cluster corresponding to different flush behaviours these can eventually be used to assess the performance of pollution control strategies under different flush scenarios this approach resembles the one increasingly applied in stormwater quantity management where scms are evaluated under different rain domains 3 points approach fratini et al 2012 use of fda to quantify the uncertainties related to pollutant level variations indeed fda was successfully able to extract information on typical mv curve shapes and their frequency of occurrence a better quantification and communication of the uncertainties connected to flush and pollutant concentrations will enable stormwater managers to assess the risk of exceedance of water quality standards caused by these pollutant flux variations development of pollution control strategies based on the identified drivers which can help stormwater managers to minimise pollution load and or maximise their interception e g source control actions targeting identified drivers development of model based assessment of dynamic control actions aiming at maximising the pollutant load intercepted and treated by scms building e g upon the approach presented in ly et al 2019 4 conclusion the analysis and categorisation of flush effects in urban runoff from separate sewer systems showed how unsupervised methods functional data analysis fda including functional principal components analysis fpca and functional clustering using the emcluster and kcfc algorithms were able to identify different flush patterns emerging from the analysed data since this novel approach is not limited by any predetermined flush definition scheme it is thus more suitable for identifying specific characteristics from a specific monitored site specifically the fda approach showed its capacity to analyse tss mv curves from the chassieu measured data and albertslund modelled data describing and classifying different types of mv curve shapes including those crossing the bisector which cannot be described by the polynomial approximations used in earlier studies a kruskal wallis test showed that the mv classed defined by fda divided several of the recorded rain variables into groups with significantly different values when using a different number of clusters the a priori clustering of rain characteristics obtained a correct class assignment of only 23 for chassieu and 32 for albertslund with an optimal number of classes 10 and 8 respectively and 45 and 63 with a number of classes that is judged as feasible by decision makers and stormwater planners 4 and 3 respectively the analysis of the modelled data corroborated the analysis of the measured data showing how even in data characterised by a lower variability than measured data consequence of the model simplification of the processes taking place in the real system along with its sole dependency on the rainfall input the fda approach did not identify a clear influence of the rainfall variables all these results suggest that additional variables not related to rainfall characteristics should be investigated as explanatory variables for flush phenomena the application of fda to mv curves opens for a variety of different research areas building upon the proposed curve clustering on the long term the investigated methodology will provide decision makers in urban stormwater management with vital knowledge to understand the current system and plan robust management pollution control

16069,pollution levels in stormwater vary significantly during rain events with pollutant flushes carrying a major fraction of an event pollutant load in a short period understanding these flushes is thus essential for stormwater management however current studies mainly focus on describing the first flush or are limited by predetermined flush categories this study provides a new perspective on the topic by applying data driven approaches to categorise mass volume mv curves for tss into distinct classes of flush tailored to specific monitoring location functional data analysis fda was used to investigate the dynamics of mv curves in two large data sets consisting of 343 measured events and 915 modelled events respectively potential links between classes of mv curves and combinations of rain characteristics were explored through a priori clustering this yielded correct class assignments for 23 63 of the events using different combinations of mv curve clustering and rainfall characteristics this suggests that while global rainfall characteristics influence flush they are not sufficient as sole explanatory variables of different flush phenomena and additional explanatory variables are needed to assign mv curves into classes with a predictive power that is suitable for e g design of stormwater control measures our results highlight the great potential of the fda methodology as a new approach for classifying describing and understanding pollutant flush signals in stormwater keywords pollutant flush separate sewer systems mv curves clustering urban stormwater management 1 introduction pollutants carried by urban runoff in separate sewer systems pose an environmental threat to the natural receiving water bodies brudler et al 2019 eriksson et al 2011 göbel et al 2007 koziel et al 2019 walsh et al 2005 zgheib et al 2011 as well as to human health if e g runoff is used as source of potable water kus et al 2010 ma et al 2019 to enable management actions aiming to reduce and mitigate this threat it is thus critical to gain knowledge of expected pollutant levels and of their spatial and temporal variations pollutants in stormwater runoff stem from multiple release processes in the catchment dry and wet atmospheric deposition surface weathering leaching from building materials and release from anthropogenic sources such as the use of specific chemicals pesticides spills etc or vehicular activity deletic and orr 2005 eriksson et al 2005 göbel et al 2007 müller et al 2020 during rain events these pollutants are washed off and transported away by rainfall and by the generated runoff the resulting runoff quality thus depends on the factors driving the pollutant accumulation the mobilisation and the transport mechanisms resulting in large inter and intra events variations in both concentrations and loads bertrand krajewski et al 1998 lee et al 2002 qin et al 2016 historically there has been a vast interest in describing pollutant flushes during a rain event with great emphasis often being put on the first flush i e pollutant flushes carrying out the majority of the event load during the first part of the event the occurrence of first flush have been studied by a great number of studies proposing different definition schemes and developing different classification to describe this phenomenon jensen 2022 the increasing amount of available data on stormwater runoff quality has enabled the application of data driven and statistical methods for exploring these datasets and gaining knowledge on pollutant flushes for example deletic 1998 applied linear multi regression analysis to search for correlations between the flush in the first 20 of the runoff and combinations of rainfall and runoff characteristics both bach et al 2010 and sun et al 2015 used the wilcoxon rank sum test to group pieces of runoff events with similar concentration levels to determine the catchment specific volume carrying the first flush li et al 2012 applied redundancy analysis to quantify the influence of rain and catchment characteristics on the variation in the strength of the first flush li et al 2015 used pearson correlation analysis to connect event mean concentrations emcs and the strength of flush in the first 40 of the runoff to catchment and rain characteristics finally perera et al 2019 applied a random forest tree based method in order to identify nonlinear relationships between rain and catchment characteristics and first flush however a common denominator in studies of flush dynamics including the data driven studies mentioned above is their sole focus on describing the first flush or their limitation to predetermined flush categories jensen 2022 this exclusive focus might neglect other site specific and perhaps more relevant tendencies and patterns disregarding the span of variation in inter and intra event pollutant distributions that deviate from the general behaviour defined in literature indeed there is a gap in the use of more exploratory approaches with a broader scope than and not limited to the first flush such approaches can support stormwater planners in developing robust practices for managing pollutants in urban runoff by considering all possible flush patterns in a site and their impacts on the planned stormwater control measure functional data analysis fda is a strong tool for revealing dynamics of underlying processes in repeated observations wang et al 2016 and it has the added benefit of not relying on approximations to a specific curve shape as such fda has been employed for different purposes within the field of water management e g for analysing spatial and temporal variabilities of rainfall data in order to identify basis functions of rainfall pattern at different stations or seasons suhaila and yusop 2017 for detecting anomalies in flow within water supply networks millán roures et al 2018 or classifying streamflow hydrographs ternynck et al 2016 these examples show how fda was applied for classifying functional data determining main trends or detecting outliers to the best of our knowledge this methodology has never been applied for analysing stormwater pollutant flush dynamics possibly because it requires the availability of rather large data sets this study aims to provide a better understanding of pollutant flushes in separate sewer systems by using unsupervised analysis tools based on fda to i explore and categorise distinct mass volume mv curve shapes and ii describe their frequency of occurrence furthermore we iii assess the potential for linking the resulting flush classes to combinations of rain variables the study is undertaken using large data sets of events from both monitored and modelled case studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 theory of mv curves and flush drivers a widely applied approach to describe pollutant flushes during an event is based on mv curves which have been extensively investigated in scientific literature e g bertrand krajewski et al 1998 chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 kong et al 2021 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 perera et al 2021 mv curves present the relative cumulative mass m as a function of the relative cumulative volume v enabling the analysis of flush signals see fig 1 the first flush takes place if the majority of the mass is carried in the prophase of the runoff volume and its strength is described by the convexity of the superior mv curve no flush occurs if the mv curve follows the bisector while a second flush or middle flush occurs when the mv curve follows an s shape with the majority of the mass discharged in the metaphase if the mv curve is concave inferior it indicates that the majority of the mass is discharged in the anaphase resulting in third flush or late flush the mv curve approach thus enables the comparison of flush signals across events with different mass volume and duration however several flushes may occur during a single event resulting in a large variety of possible mv curve shapes mv curves are often fit to polynomial approximations in order to conduct data analysis e g métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 this may be a good approximation for superior and inferior curves but it is a poor estimation for s curves or reverse s curves while the event normalisation allows a comparison of dynamics across events that may otherwise be hard to compare other relevant event characteristics magnitude duration return period etc are lost therefore if relevant for e g design purpose events should be pre selected based on these characteristics before the mv curve normalisation and analysis although several studies investigating the drivers of flush signals are based on mv curves it is often hard to compare their results due to the use of different flush definitions focus on different pollutants and different local conditions indeed deletic 1998 noticed that the influential rainfall and runoff characteristics might differ for catchments of very similar characteristics perera et al 2019 found that rain related variables were ranked highest in terms of influence on first flush and suggested that their combination might yield better results while the occurrence of first flush has been found to be affected by the type of pollutant particulate or dissolved the system combined or separate the catchment characteristics land use slope size etc the sampling technique and the flush definition jensen 2022 rain characteristics are among the most typically explored drivers in part as they are more frequently accessible one explanation could be that rain characteristics are assumed to be the major driver of inter event variability while other drivers are often assumed to be constant or to have little influence at the temporal scale a great disagreement is found in literature on the influence of the antecedent dry weather period adwp also called antecedent dry weather days adwd or antecedent dry days add e g chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 li et al 2012 schriewer et al 2008 this is notable as this variable constitutes the backbone of build up modules in several accumulation washoff models several studies stressed the influence of rain intensity e g chow and yusop 2014 deletic and maksimovic 1998 li et al 2012 however athanasiadis et al 2010 found that intensity did not affect first flush effects of cu in roof runoff and schriewer et al 2008 found that zn in roof runoff is correlated with lower rain intensities furthermore kong et al 2021 found that first flush effect depended on the timing on the maximum intensity and similarly mixed interpretations can be found for the influence of total rain depth of an event and its duration athanasiadis et al 2010 chow and yusop 2014 kang et al 2008 li et al 2015 perera et al 2019 as studies on influential flush factors often point in different directions it is likely that the governing explanatory variables are case specific this stresses the need for approaches capable of evaluating flush signals systematically rather than general definitions that may not apply under local conditions 2 2 case studies in order to capture several different flush signals it is necessary to utilise an extensive data set from a specific location therefore the analysis was carried out on a large data set of monitored total suspended solids tss data from chassieu france as large data sets of tss data are seldom available with chassieu being one of the few examples worldwide these were supplemented by a set of modelled data from albertslund denmark obtained using a state of the art accumulation washoff model while inherently uncertain due to the model simplification of reality the modelled data have the additional benefit of being less affected by measurements noise and they are thereby assumed easier to analyse for both data sets tss concentration time series are used as indicator for pollutant levels 2 2 1 chassieu data set monitored the chassieu catchment covers an industrial area in the outskirts of lyon france drained by a separate sewer system continuous monitoring of rain 6 minute time steps flow and turbidity 2 minute time steps was carried out from 2004 to 2011 the data set is described in métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 and sun et al 2015 while the conversion from turbidity to tss is reported in métadier and bertrand krajewski 2011 the data set includes 716 events but not all of these contain complete measurement series see table 1 for further details we refer to the previous works conducted on this data set e g métadier and bertrand krajewski 2011 2012 sandoval et al 2018 sun et al 2015 2 2 2 albertslund data set modelled the albertslund catchment covers a residential industrial area in the outskirts of copenhagen denmark drained by a separate sewer system continuous monitoring of rain flow and turbidity was carried out in 2010 2011 these measurements were used to calibrate a dynamic stormwater pollution model based on the state of the art accumulation washoff process vezzaro et al 2015 the model parameters were estimated by using the pseudo bayesian uncertainty based methodology described in vezzaro et al 2013 to propagate model uncertainties a total of 1 000 parameter sets were sampled from the behavioural parameters identified in vezzaro et al 2015 these were used to simulate a 10 year period using rainfall data covering the period 1994 2004 resulting in a total of 1 094 discharge events the characteristics of each event volume load etc were calculated on the median of the 1 000 simulations see table 1 2 3 data analysis this study utilises a data driven and exploratory approach based on techniques from functional data analysis fda which allow for the identification of multiple categories and types of flush signals without relying on predetermined definition schemes an overview of the performed steps for both case studies is given in fig 2 and further elaborated in the following subsections 1 data preparation a validation of the events was carried out selecting those to be analysed preparing mv curves and extracting rain characteristics for the further steps 2 mv curve analysis this step explored the dynamics of mv curves and divided them into classes based on their shape 3 rain variables analysis non essential variables were eliminated before the combined analysis 4 combined analysis this step explored the direct relationship between mv classes and rain variables and indirect relationships between mv classes and combinations of rain variables 2 3 1 data preparation events in the monitored data set chassieu that contained missing values of runoff flow or tss concentration for more than 10 continuous minutes were discarded missing values for less than 10 continuous minutes were linearly interpolated the modelled data set albertslund included small rainfall events that did not generate runoff therefore events with a rain duration of shorter than 10 minutes were eliminated as generally these events had very low rain depth for each event in the data set mv curves were generated using tss and flow data to ensure that all mv curves had equal discretisation a prerequisite for the used fda algorithms they were rescaled using interpolation to ensure a discretisation of 101 steps per curve corresponding to a value of 0 1 100 of the duration of the runoff event an overview of the investigated rain characteristics is provided in table 2 which includes both variables found to be significant by previous studies and additional new variables for the chassieu data set rain data was only available for the events in the database i e there were no data for the periods between the recorded events so the adwp was estimated based on the 716 available events also for both the chassieu and the albertslund data sets there was no information about rain preceding the first event in the database so adwp and values of antecedent rain in the last 2 14 days ar2 14 were set to zero 2 3 2 mv curve analysis a functional principal components analysis fpca was run to explore the shape and dynamics of the mv curves followed by functional clustering to divide the mv curves into classes fpca is the most common first step of any fda as it reduces the dimensionality of the longitudinal data and creates a foundation for many other fda methods chen et al 2017 in addition to offering insight in itself it is based on an eigenvalue analysis of the underlying covariance operators of the observed process fpca was used to generate eigenfunctions for the functional data until a high percentage of the variance 99 9 was described each eigenfunction has a corresponding list of eigenvalues with length matching the number of events in the data set this resembles the principal component pc scores for that particular pc index both the fpca and the functional clustering were carried out using the fdapace package carroll et al 2020 which is an open source r package for fda and empirical dynamics an equivalent pace package is also available for matlab http www stat ucdavis edu pace the functional clustering was carried out to identify natural mv profile classes in an unsupervised manner through strict partitioning clustering meaning that each object belongs to exactly one cluster the fdapace package offers two options for functional clustering the expectation maximization cluster emcluster algorithm and the k centers functional clustering kcfc algorithm emcluster uses the fpc scores previously calculated through fdapace carroll et al 2020 and creates multivariate gaussian distributions for each cluster chen and maitra 2015 kcfc looks at both the mean and modes of the variation differentials between clusters by predicting the cluster membership through an iterative covariance updating scheme here local linear smoothing is applied covariance for each curve is calculated separately and aggregated to estimate the smoothed covariance followed by eigenanalysis and calculation of fpc scores using conditional expectation chiou and li 2007 both algorithms were tested to find the best way to divide the data set into a natural number of clusters a comparison was made through visual inspection of the resulting clusters and by looking at the sum of squared errors sse i e the summed and squared mean distance from each fpc score across all dimensions needed to reach 99 9 explained variance to the centre of its associated cluster 2 3 3 rain variables analysis in order to prepare the rain variables for the pca and cluster analysis they were first checked for collinearity i e whether any of the variables were linear predictors of each other while pca can in itself remove collinearity pc scores will be affected by the redundant features included in the analysis through collinear variables clustering collinear variables can indeed place additional weight on a feature because it is represented in multiple variables although removing collinear variables is usually considered not to affect k means clustering it has the extra benefit of speeding up calculations and achieving a more parsimonious model the collinearity was evaluated by looking at correlation plots of all the rain variables multivariate collinearity was evaluated by running a linear regression with the fpc scores as response variables and rain variables as explanatory variables and evaluating the variance inflation factor vif of the resulting regression 2 3 4 combined analysis firstly a direct comparison of the mv curves and rain variables was conducted by looking at box plots of rain variable values for each cluster from the functional clustering analysis furthermore a kruskal wallis test was carried out to ascertain if significant difference had been obtained between the clusters for each rain variable kruskal and wallis 1952 it is a nonparametric global test across all classes at once consistent with the data driven approach to cluster analysis followed in this paper the test uses a null hypothesis that the median for each rain variable is comparable across groupings mv classes which is rejected if any of the classes stand out with a significantly different value if the test shows that some of the mv classes provide values of rain characteristics significantly different from the rest this indicates a potential for using rain variables as explanatory factors of the mv classes secondly a clustering scheme was set up to combine the rain variables investigating if their joint variation can be linked to the mv categories the analysis first looked at using a single rain variable and then an increasing number of variables were combined before clustering the variables were standardised and ran through a pca to reduce dimensionality and increase the efficiency of the analysis clustering was carried out using a standard k means approach the mv categories were used as an a priori classification for the clustering of the rain variables and a contingency table as shown in table 3 was produced for each combination of rain variables to evaluate the performance we used the two indicators applied by chiou and li 2007 for comparison of two partitionings crate and arand crate the maximal possible ratio of correctly classified objects bounded by 0 and 1 calculated as the sum of the diagonal in the contingency matrix see table 3 divided by the total number of events as the diagonal represents events placed in the same cluster by both partitions arand a corrected version of the rand index rand 1971 proposed by hubert and arabie 1985 which describes the agreement between two partitions of objects events in this study by looking at the number of paired objects that are in the same or different groups in both partitions it is calculated as in eq 1 with nomenclature referring to the contingency table in table 3 here a comparison is made between clusters of partitions x and y with a i as the total amount of events placed in the i th cluster in x b j as the total amount of events placed in the j th cluster in y n i j as the amount of events from cluster i in the x partition placed in cluster j in the y partition and n as the total number of events arand has an upper bound of 1 and an expected value of 0 although negative values may occur if the degree of similarity between the two partitions is less than what would be expected in the case of two random partitionings 1 arand index expected index maximum index expected index i j n i j 2 i a i 2 j b j 2 n 2 1 2 i a i 2 j b j 2 i a i 2 j b j 2 n 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preparation the event discarding step led to a reduction in the number of events in each data set from 716 to 343 events for the monitored data set chassieu and from 1094 to 915 events for the modelled data albertslund a summary of the validated events is given in table 1 the mv curves for the chassieu and albertslund sites are shown in fig 3 both plots show a wide span of mv curves on both sides of the bisector rather than any single general trend in curve profile interestingly the accumulation washoff model does not produce evident first flush signals see fig 3b suggesting that differences in input rainfall dynamics between events are a major driver behind inter and intra event variation in mv curves as expected the mv curves show a greater variability in the measured chassieu data set compared to the modelled albertslund data the simplification and structural limitations of the model structure accumulation washoff clearly lumped the variety of processes taking place in the natural system although accumulation washoff processes are often used to support the theory behind first flush hypothesis the simulation results display that the dynamic behaviour of rainfall plays a major role in the pollutant mobilisation in the catchment and transport in the drainage system and thereby in the presence of flush signals the mean of the mv curves shows a slight tendency of a middle flush in chassieu while the mean in albertslund is closer to the bisector the extraction of rain characteristics from the data set resulted in seventeen different rain variables see table 2 3 2 mv curve analysis more than 96 of the chassieu variability and more than 99 of the albertslund variability is summarised in the first 3 principal components of the fpca see fig 4 a and 4 b the large amount of information included in such few components shows a high level of structure in the data set i e the curves share many similarities the first three eigenfunctions for the two case studies are shown in fig 4c 4 e each eigenfunction represents a component of the basis on which mv curves are rebuilt while the eigenvalue gives information on the importance of the associated eigenfunction in this reconstruction interestingly an additional inflection point appears for each new eigenfunction for both data sets and this trend continues beyond the first three eigenfunctions shown in fig 4c this shows that the majority of the mv curves represented by the first eigenfunction have only one inflection point followed by curves with two inflection points etc using approximations with a single inflection point such as the polynomial approximation x b e g used by métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 would thus only describe the fraction of the mv curves corresponding to the variance explained by first eigenfunction the first bar of the scree plots i e 76 95 for chassieu and 89 92 for albertslund the eigenfunction plots fig 4c 4d show how the considered functions the mv curves differ from the mean similarly to the analysed mv curves all the eigenfunctions have an initial value of 0 and an end value of 1 this demonstrates how the eigenfunctions can be used to highlight similarities across the data set although this particular similarity is apparent without the aid of eigenfunctions the plots show that the functions for chassieu are less symmetrical than for the albertslund case with the first eigenfunction skewing left and the first modes of the following eigenfunctions having larger amplitudes than the following modes this shift comes from the displacement of the mean from the bisector as seen in fig 3a there seems to be a larger mass fraction in the metaphase and a smaller in the anaphase but the mean does not show an s shape form crossing the bisector if the mean mv curve moves from a convex to a s shape it will result in a displacement of the eigenfunctions culminating with the introduction of a second inflection point already in the first eigenfunction in terms of relevance to stormwater planners the eigenfunctions and the scree plot provide an estimate of i the fraction of events with none or one consistent flush effect the first bar and first eigenfunction and ii the fraction of events that exhibit multiple flush effects and cross the bisector the rest the first information is relevant to time the capture of pollutant flushes by stormwater control measures scms and the latter provides a quantification of the events with multiple flushes indicating the fraction of events where traditional pollution management approaches focusing solely on first flush jensen 2022 are likely to fail or to provide a lower efficacy than originally planned regarding the functional clustering fig 5 shows the development in sse as a function of the number of clusters for both case studies using both emcluster and kcfc the sse was calculated using a number of fpca components explaining more than 99 99 of the variance 26 iterations for chassieu and 14 for albertslund the sse was calculated on the fpc scores from the fpca since these scores are used directly for clustering by the emcluster algorithm it is no surprise that the emcluster approach performs better lower sse than the kcfc algorithm the latter method in fact calculates its own fpc scores as part of the clustering process both methods obtained a lower sse in albertslund compared to chassieu explained by the smaller variability shown by the modelled mv curves both the emcluster and the kcfc algorithms recognised principal curve profiles however the emcluster seemed to create clusters with less overlap and it also ran considerably faster the analysis of the mv curves classified according to cluster memberships reveals that the local peaks in the sse plot arise when a cluster includes events from both sides of the bisector see supplementary material for plots of the classified mv curves this is sufficient if one is only interested in the degree of flush and not in its type by applying the elbow criterion to the sse plot the optimal number of cluster was 10 for the chassieu data and 8 for albertslund however the use of such a great number of classes of mv curves might not be recommended for practical applications i e in a planning situation where decision makers need to assess a limited number of events or response options and it might be difficult to maintain an overview or differentiating responses if too many classes are used therefore it was chosen to perform the analysis both with the optimal number of clusters 10 for chassieu and 8 for albertslund respectively and with a reduced number of clusters 4 for chassieu and 3 for albertslund respectively assumed to be more manageable by decision makers in a planning situation these clusters represent an advancement compared to the use of predefined flush categories which might not reflect the characteristics of the catchment under study figs 6 9 display the mv curves grouped for the different number of clusters when a smaller number of clusters was used a great number of classes tend to cross the bisector showing how these clusters are suited for describing the magnitude of flush but not its type a greater number of clusters resulted in a clearer more distinct classification of mv curves where patters in terms of flush type s shape inferior or superior and the magnitude of flush amplitude of concavity or convexity can be identified overall the fpca and the functional clustering approach provided useful insights into the data sets the widespread binary tendency to sort pollutant patterns into either fist flush or not first flush means that we lose the opportunity for tailoring the appropriate management response to the actual degree of flush as the fda approach is not limited by such predetermined classes it is a much more feasible approach to categorise flushes also it analyses the mv curves directly i e without making polynomial approximations to extract curve shape features and it is thus better suited for representing the actual flush patterns furthermore the fpca methodology proved to contribute insights into the governing mv curve shapes e g in terms of number of inflection points which is important to evaluate the implications of multiple flushes the clustering can be coupled in the future with the identification of generalised curves for different flush patterns which can be used in planning situation as flush scenarios limited to the number of cluster that are deemed as manageable by decision makers e g 4 clusters for the chassieu case few studies have addressed the uncertainty related to pollutant flushes some examples can be seen in the work by sharifi et al 2011 and perera et al 2021 but these both used an exponential approximation and focused solely on the first flush considering the benefits of the fda methodology applied in this study it would be interesting to also apply fda to describe flush uncertainties 3 3 rain variables analysis the qualitative analysis of inter correlation plots between the variables led to the elimination of six variables showing a high degree of collinearity with other variables see supplementary material the 11 remaining variables are highlighted in bold table 2 for the estimation of multicollinearity between the variables all vif values for both the chassieu and the albertslund data set proved to be less than 5 see supplementary material which is not considered problematic craney and surles 2002 and did not give rise to further variable elimination therefore multicollinearity should not affect the results when combining several rain variables to match the mv clusters methodology step 4 3 4 combined analysis regarding the direct comparison between rain variables and mv classes box plots for chassieu 4 and 10 clusters and for albertslund 3 and 8 clusters are enclosed in the supplementary material table 4 summarises the p values from the kruskal wallis test for each rain variable as the 44 tests were carried out simultaneously the bonferroni correction was applied to ensure adequate significance before rejecting the null hypothesis which is why p values 0 001 p n 0 05 44 are highlighted in the table regarding the a priori classification table 5 6 shows the best performing combination measured by crate for each number of variables included in the clustering it should be noted that the highest arand values were not always achieved by the same combination of variables that yielded the highest crate 3 4 1 chassieu the box plots of rain variable distributions across the mv classes see supplementary material showed a visible difference for the no rain variable in both the 4 and the 10 mv cluster scenario in the latter scenario cluster 8 stands out the mv curves from this cluster figure are in fact mostly s shaped curves it is worth highlighting this result as this group of mv curves cannot be approximated using the traditional x b formula and it seems to have a clear predictor variable the kruskal wallis test summarised in table 4 also had low p values for the no rain variable only for 4 clusters as well as for several of the other rain variables this indicates that the applied mv classes manage to divide the rain variables into groups so that at least one group is significantly different from the rest considering the a priori classification table 5 then the maximum rate of correct fda class assignment of mv curves based on rain characteristics was 45 for the 4 mv classes scenario and 23 for the 10 mv classes scenario it is expected that it will be harder to achieve a high rate of correct assignment when more mv classes are involved in both cases there was no increase in performance when including more rain variables in combination the calculations that relied on only a single variable resulted in the following ranking of the rain ordered by crate 4 mv classes ar2 0 45 max int last 0 41 depth 0 40 adwp 0 39 ar7 0 38 max step rel 0 37 dur 0 35 max int 0 35 max int 50rel 0 33 month 0 31 and no rain 0 30 10 mv classes ar2 0 23 max int 0 20 ar7 0 20 max int last 0 19 max step rel 0 18 adwp 0 18 depth 0 18 no rain 0 17 dur 0 17 max int 50rel 0 17 and month 0 17 all the best performing combinations from both mv class scenarios except one included the variable ar2 indicating that the very recent antecedent rainfall is influential to the mv curve shape this supports that the mv curve shape is susceptible to the applied event definition as different event definitions might have included or excluded more of the rain close to the event the arand values generally indicated that the model performance was close to that of random assignment 0 3 4 2 albertslund the box plots of rain variables distributions across the mv classes see supplementary material showed a visible difference for max step rel max int 50rel no rain and dur in both the 3 and the 8 mv cluster scenario for no rain the cluster that stands out the most in both scenarios includes the mv curves that are closest to the bisector see figures and and which seem to have had a continuous rain pattern without breaks low values of no rain for max step rel and max int 50rel the cluster that stands out the most in the 8 mv cluster scenario is the one including extremely concave curves see figure because the maximum intensity of the rain has taken place late in the event resulting in a high max step rel and a low max int 50rel in the 3 cluster scenario these curves have been mixed with the extremely convex curves see causing a larger span in the max step rel and max int 50rel values regarding dur both the very concave and convex curves see and had long durations there is a possible bias as events with long duration will have more monitoring points or data extraction points in the case of modelled data meaning that they are more likely to display higher amplitudes while events with shorter duration will have fewer monitoring points and therefore concentration variations might be missed the kruskal wallis test summarised in table 4 revealed several cases of low p value including max step rel only for 3 clusters max int 50rel only for 3 clusters no rain and dur regarding the a priori classification table 6 there seems to be a slight trade off between the increase in crate and arand the maximum rate of correct assignment was 63 for the 3 mv classes scenario and 32 for the 8 classes scenario and in general the arand values suggest a performance that is marginally better than random assignment the calculations that relied on only a single variable resulted in the following ranking of the rain ordered by crate 3 mv classes adwp 0 52 no rain 0 50 depth 0 48 dur 0 47 ar2 0 46 max int 0 44 max int last 0 43 max step rel 0 33 max int 50rel 0 33 ar7 0 30 and month 0 27 8 mv classes depth 0 30 no rain 0 30 dur 0 30 max int 0 27 adwp 0 25 ar2 0 23 max int last 0 23 max int 50rel 0 23 max step rel 0 21 ar7 0 19 and month 0 18 the variable depth is included in all the best performing combinations of variables closely followed by no rain adwp was expected to be influential as the pollutant build up in the model directly depends on this variable however it is not included in the best performing combinations until 7 8 variables are combined instead variables related to the washoff process such as the max int proved more influential 3 4 3 joint reflections overall better mv class prediction was achieved with the modelled data set compared to the monitored a direct consequence of the simplification of reality behind the used model other than measurement uncertainty the long period covered by the chassieu data might be affected by changes in the pollutant sources across the catchment which considering the industrial characteristics of the chassieu catchment cannot be excluded conversely given the shorter monitoring period pollutant sources were considered constant in the model of the albertslund catchment both data sets are however influenced by the dynamics and non linearities of the drainage systems which was not taken into account for either data set when using only rain variables the kruskal wallis test illustrated how the rain variables had easier discrimination of clusters for the cases with fewer mv classes and similarly the degree of correct cluster assignment crate approximately doubled in the cases of fewer mv classes however arand values did not improve for fewer mv classes and in fact decreased for the albertslund data set which underlines how fewer classes also mean higher chance of correct assignment by a random grouping when looking at both data sets the gain in crate from including multiple rain variables in combination as predictors seems almost negligible as approximately the same accuracy is achieved from using only a single rain characteristic while it was possible to recognise connections between the classes of mv curves and the individual rain variables a satisfactory mv curve class assignment could not be reached purely based on rain characteristics for either of the data sets this study included rain characteristics that were identified as relevant by other flush studies which represent conditions linked to both each individual event preceding events and seasonality and which are expressed in both relative e g no rain and absolute terms e g depth it should be underlined that most of the variables listed in table 2 are lumped variables i e they considerably simplify the representation of rainfall events in particular they neglect the dynamics within each event i e the variation of the rainfall intensity at short time step pollutographs and the resulting mv curves depend on variations in the hyetograph in addition to other causes different from the rainfall events consequently it is not surprising that simple global indicators even combined or aggregated are not fully relevant to predict mv curves and it seems unlikely that any additional rain characteristics could significantly improve the mv class assignment ultimately it must be concluded that rain characteristics seem to influence the flush signal but that clusters of rain variables alone are not sufficient as explanatory variables for the classes of mv curves created by the fda approach 3 5 future research areas the results of this study represent only a first step into the application of new methods to describe the behaviour of stormwater pollution during rain event as such new opportunities and research areas are now outlined multi catchment comparison the chassieu data set represent so far one of the largest available tss data sets but it can be expected that new monitoring campaigns will provide new data that will increase the applicability of fda based approaches and will allow to investigate the presence of site specific and or more general patterns identification of new explanatory variables capable of describing and understanding the drivers behind the inter and intra event variability strengthening the predictive power of water quality models this would require the analysis of additional data sets from other study areas to identify variables linked to the catchment spatial characteristics e g land usage climatic regime formalised description of clusters i e describing general curves for each cluster corresponding to different flush behaviours these can eventually be used to assess the performance of pollution control strategies under different flush scenarios this approach resembles the one increasingly applied in stormwater quantity management where scms are evaluated under different rain domains 3 points approach fratini et al 2012 use of fda to quantify the uncertainties related to pollutant level variations indeed fda was successfully able to extract information on typical mv curve shapes and their frequency of occurrence a better quantification and communication of the uncertainties connected to flush and pollutant concentrations will enable stormwater managers to assess the risk of exceedance of water quality standards caused by these pollutant flux variations development of pollution control strategies based on the identified drivers which can help stormwater managers to minimise pollution load and or maximise their interception e g source control actions targeting identified drivers development of model based assessment of dynamic control actions aiming at maximising the pollutant load intercepted and treated by scms building e g upon the approach presented in ly et al 2019 4 conclusion the analysis and categorisation of flush effects in urban runoff from separate sewer systems showed how unsupervised methods functional data analysis fda including functional principal components analysis fpca and functional clustering using the emcluster and kcfc algorithms were able to identify different flush patterns emerging from the analysed data since this novel approach is not limited by any predetermined flush definition scheme it is thus more suitable for identifying specific characteristics from a specific monitored site specifically the fda approach showed its capacity to analyse tss mv curves from the chassieu measured data and albertslund modelled data describing and classifying different types of mv curve shapes including those crossing the bisector which cannot be described by the polynomial approximations used in earlier studies a kruskal wallis test showed that the mv classed defined by fda divided several of the recorded rain variables into groups with significantly different values when using a different number of clusters the a priori clustering of rain characteristics obtained a correct class assignment of only 23 for chassieu and 32 for albertslund with an optimal number of classes 10 and 8 respectively and 45 and 63 with a number of classes that is judged as feasible by decision makers and stormwater planners 4 and 3 respectively the analysis of the modelled data corroborated the analysis of the measured data showing how even in data characterised by a lower variability than measured data consequence of the model simplification of the processes taking place in the real system along with its sole dependency on the rainfall input the fda approach did not identify a clear influence of the rainfall variables all these results suggest that additional variables not related to rainfall characteristics should be investigated as explanatory variables for flush phenomena the application of fda to mv curves opens for a variety of different research areas building upon the proposed curve clustering on the long term the investigated methodology will provide decision makers in urban stormwater management with vital knowledge to understand the current system and plan robust management pollution control
