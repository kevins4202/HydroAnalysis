8645,achieving equal access to drinkable water whilst guaranteeing no discrimination constitutes a priority goal and an acquired compromise for the international agenda however achieving this goal has become challenging especially in megacities mexico city registers 94 coverage of water supply according to the 2020 population and housing census in 2019 per capita water consumption was 123 l day a supply reasonable as it is above the 100 l day recommended by the world health organization to guarantee optimal access to water however water consumption among households is characterized by a heterogeneous spatial distribution that denotes a great inequity the objective of this research is to evaluate the configuration of the spatial patterns that define the differences in water consumption in mexico city s households as well as their association with possible causal factors this task was carried out through the spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems the water consumption records correspond to the year 2019 and were provided by the city s operating utility results confirmed the existence of two clusters of households whose location highlight areas where inequality in water consumption is present the clusters are explained by the interaction of four factors in order of importance discontinuous water supply dependence on external water sources altitude and the socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods the results provide a fundamental basis for the development of water policies to mitigate inequality also a methodological approach is provided to investigate water problems in large cities in developing countries where the available literature is scarce keywords water spatial inequality domestic water consumption spatial analysis mexico city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction universal and equitable access to drinking water without discrimination is a priority sustainability goal and commitment that has been set in the 2030 sustainable development agenda 1 2 however achieving this goal has become a challenging task in large cities where rapid population growth and demand for water have outpaced the availability of water resources and the response capacity of service providers 3 4 in this context identifying areas where the right to safe drinking water is not yet guaranteed is an essential task in urban settings although in general cities present high rates of coverage in water services which implies the compliance with sustainable development goal 6 related to equitable access to drinking water inequalities and deficiencies in the supply within these regions still remain entailing the violation of the right to water 5 7 in urban areas residential water consumption represents a significant percentage of demand therefore it also represents the most vulnerable sector to shortages 8 the world health organization who defines residential water as the amount of water used to meet basic household needs which includes water for drinking bathing and preparing food 9 10 household water demand is estimated at the level of total or per capita consumption because of the pressure it puts on urban water systems it has been used in various investigations as an indicator of the efficiency of service provision and the degree of accessibility to drinking water 4 8 11 16 according to who a minimum consumption of 100 l inhab day guarantees the satisfaction of the basic needs of health and household and thus constitutes adequate access to drinking water 17 18 however the level of household consumption varies significantly from one place to another as a function of the particular conditions and level of development of each region 19 therefore to successfully adequately plan urban water policies identifying the patterns of water consumption in households and the factors that influence their variability has become a key priority 20 21 various studies have shown that the main factors that influence the heterogeneity of consumption are the price of water 22 24 socioeconomic status family income 4 10 25 26 climatological variables such as precipitation and temperature 11 27 28 and the size of the household number of people in it 29 31 other studies have shown that there is a relationship between water consumption and the characteristics of the home number of rooms bathrooms and external elements such as gardens and swimming pools 12 14 29 the age of its residents 32 and their level of education 30 moreover population density 31 33 physical variables such as terrain altitude 34 and supply capacity which includes the supply source and hydraulic infrastructure also play an important role 4 35 the selection of the variables to analyze and their degree of incidence depends on the particular conditions of each place and the amount of information available 35 36 although the results of these investigations provide vital information on the drivers that originate the differences in water consumption in the domestic sector few studies consider an important factor the implications of spatial distribution 37 according to bonnette and house peters and chang 38 39 due to its eminently spatial nature household water consumption cannot be explained only by socioeconomic climatological or physical variables but also by its geographical location and its relationship with neighboring regions this spatial dependence is because the variables that determine consumption levels typically tend to present distribution patterns therefore these variables influence water consumption not only due to their direct effect but also indirectly through the effect of spatial association patterns 40 similarly chang et al y lee et al 33 41 demonstrated that differences in household water consumption are closely linked to urban structures shaped by the interaction of physical social economic and infrastructural characteristics therefore understanding the spatial distribution of water consumption and its relationship with the urban components that contribute to its variability is necessary for the development of efficient policies that consider the challenges of spatial heterogeneity voskamp et al and shi et al 37 42 indicate that there are three fundamental aspects that need to be understood to guarantee that policies and programs focused on ensuring equity of drinking water supply are successful the variation of consumption patterns in space and time the location of areas with critical water consumptions and how socio structural factors of cities influence consumption level differentiation since it is difficult to solve the complexity of supply problems in large cities using the criteria of a single water policy on the other hand research by refs 16 26 39 has demonstrated the impact of local spatial proximity on household water consumptions the research argues that water consumption patterns are influenced by different neighborhood characteristics such as local climate socioeconomic and cultural conditions and various water supply conditions such as infrastructure and maintenance the incorporation of the spatial approach in this research makes the provision of more precise explanations concerning the variations in water consumption in households and its causal factors becoming a valuable tool for decision makers the assumption of the spatial dependence that exists between water consumption and the structure of cities is based on tobler s law which specifies that all things are related to each other but things closer in space have a greater relationship than distant things 43 the most commonly used methods to determine this spatial association include moran s global spatial autocorrelation index gmi 16 26 33 the latter determines the degree and intensity of spatial dependence of the variable under analysis statistical indicators of local clustering such as the lisa local indicator spatial association index and the gi statistic by which clusters with similar values and groups with critical values with respect to the mean are identified respectively 39 44 45 to determine the spatial association between the dependent variable under analysis and the possible factors determining its variability methods such as the bivariate moran index bmi the bivariate lisa index bli 39 46 47 and in more complex investigations the use of spatial regressions such as spatial error regression spatial lag and geographically weighted regression gwr 33 38 41 have been used although the influence of the spatial factor on variations in household drinking water consumption has been recognized to date few investigations have included the spatial approach in their analyses 42 this happens especially in developing countries such as mexico where this type of research has been scarcely explored 48 in order to take advantage of the potential of spatial analysis mexico city cdmx was selected as the target of this research hence the objective of this research will be to identify the spatial patterns of water consumption in the city s households the concept that underlies the research is that the differences in the levels of water consumption mexico city s households are mainly due to the influence of socioeconomic demographic geographic and drinking water supply capacity factors all interrelated in a spatial environment the research is carried out through the implementation of spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems gis results indicate the specific areas of the city where it is necessary to implement measures and public policies to guarantee equity in access to drinking water the importance of the work lies in its contribution to the development of studies related to water consumption in the domestic sector of the country to date there has been no research in which the geospatial approach has been applied to identify patterns and causal factors of disparities in water consumption in homes in large cities such as cdmx 2 study area mexico city is the capital of the country it is located in the central area of the united mexican states and has an approximate area of 1485 km2 which represents only 0 1 of the surface of the national territory this area is home to one of the poles with the greatest economic development and population growth with a total of 9 2 million inhabitants of which 99 4 are located within the urban areas 49 currently cdmx is considered an area of great water stress in the country due to its growing demand for water and its location within the hydrological administrative region of the valley of mexico the region with the smallest territorial extension and availability of water 50 51 the city has a per capita availability of renewable water from its own sources of 73m3 inhabitant year which classifies it as an area of absolute water scarcity 52 according to the falkenmark index this volume is mainly for public urban industrial and service use this estimate does not consider the losses that occur in the potable water distribution network roughly 40 of the water lost due to leaks which considerably reduce the per capita availability of water 53 the mexico city water system sacmex is the operating utility in charge of supplying water to city sacmex currently supplies a total volume of 983 92 hm3 year through its own sources mainly of underground origin wells and springs from the local aquifer and a complex transfer system table 1 54 its import includes sources of surface origin such as the cutzamala system located 124 km from the city and underground originating from the battery of wells of the lerma system located to the west of the city and from the neighboring aquifers of the valley of mexico cuautitlán pachuca and texcoco fig 1 together the lerma and cutzamala systems contribute 46 8 of the potable water available in cdmx 141 91 and 318 51 hm3 year respectively making it the most important external supply source meanwhile the neighboring aquifers of the valley of mexico contribute a volume of 113 53 hm3 year which represents 11 5 of the total water 54 moreover of the total volume of water franchised for cdmx 97 is destined for urban public use additionally according to data from the population and housing census of 2020 the city registers a supply coverage to the homes of 94 a lower coverage than that recorded in 2015 98 which indicates an increase in the number of households without connection to drinking water services 49 50 despite its high level of coverage which is higher than the national average the city faces serious water shortage problems and supply deficiencies due to intermittencies in the system recurrent supply cuts due to variability in the water availability of external sources mainly the cutzamala system and social conflicts due to inequality in the distribution of drinking water 53 3 materials and methods the current methodological research process consists of four phases i data collection and mapping of variables ii exploratory analysis of water consumption data iii identification of spatial association patterns iv bivariate association analysis and v confirmatory analysis fig 2 3 1 data collection and variables considering the explanatory variables of household water consumption in recent studies the particular characteristics of cdmx and the availability of information five explanatory variables were selected to determine the differences in water consumption in the cdmx socioeconomic status population density terrain elevation and two variables associated with the capacity to supply water to households the data were obtained from official sites at the neighborhood level neighborhoods are made up of a group of dwellings built in areas of human settlement with similar characteristics they represent one of the units of greater territorial disaggregation of the electoral geographic framework of the national electoral institute ine these are delimited to capture in greater detail the conditions of the country s population the urban area of cdmx is made up of a total of approximately 1647 neighborhoods it should be noted that these neighborhoods constitute a smaller administrative subdivision than the census units called urban basic geostatistical areas agebs conformed by a group of blocks established by inegi thus the most detailed spatial scale available in the country was obtained which has a spatial coverage of 100 of the city allowing to capture the heterogeneity of the urban structure and the real variations in household consumption the information on consumption and explanatory variables correspond to the year 2019 and 2020 and represent the current conditions of cdmx it should be noted that the data available at this scale are limited and have not been used in other research due to the complexity of the process a per capita water consumption water consumption data were obtained from the only operating agency in the city the mexico city water system sacmex and correspond to the year 2019 the database includes 6 bimonthly bills for metered consumption service and a fixed fee for the concept of water supply in m3 at the neighborhood level corresponding to domestic use in this research it is assumed that the supplied water is equal to the household consumption since effective information on the households net consumption is not available based on this information the average water consumption in homes for each neighborhood measured in liters day was estimated at a total of 1635 neighborhoods that define the city per capita consumption for each neighborhood was obtained through the association between average water consumption in liters day and the number of household members at the neighborhood level the latter were obtained from the 2020 population and housing census of the national institute of statistics and geography of mexico inegi 49 the georeferencing of consumption was carried out using vector information of the neighborhoods of cdmx for the year 2019 available in shapefile format in the open data portal of the city s government 57 using arcgis 10 3 software 58 b exploratory variables the exploratory variables selected to determine variations in water consumption are socioeconomic status population density terrain elevation and two variables associated with the capacity to supply water to households the supply from the lerma cutzamala system and the discontinuous supply also known as shift system figs 3 and 4 socioeconomic status the indicator that reflects the socioeconomic conditions of households is the urban marginalization index umi estimated by the national population council conapo in the year 2020 59 the index was generated for the first time in mexico at the neighborhood level with microdata from the 2020 population and housing census the index reports the households standard of living and their degree of social exclusion it is constructed based on eleven socio economic indicators that reflect the intensity of deprivation in four dimensions level of education access to health housing conditions and availability of goods 59 umi were classified into five categories that define areas in different socioeconomic status very high high medium low and very low levels of marginalization the index was obtained in shapefile format from the official conapo website and was processed using arcgis 10 3 software based on the umi categories the neighborhoods were classified with a range of 1 5 where 1 represents the neighborhoods with the lowest degree of marginalization and 5 corresponds to the neighborhoods with a high degree of socioeconomic exclusion fig 3a shows the areas of the city with a low socioeconomic level these are defined by a very high and high marginalization degree and are located in the southern southeastern and northern periphery of the city specifically in the southern portion of the iztapalapa xochimilco tláhuac milpa alta and tlalpan municipalities in these areas there are several elements of socioeconomic exclusion such as low levels of education precarious housing conditions low purchasing power and deprivation of basic services such as access to health care drainage and piped water in homes conversely in the central and western areas of the city there is a low and very low degree of marginalization the municipalities of miguel hidalgo benito juárez cuauhtémoc and coyoacán constitute the areas with the highest purchasing power and socioeconomic status in the country s capital population density population density was estimated based on the relationship between the number of inhabitants and the area in hectares of each neighborhood population data were obtained from microdata of the 2020 population and housing census available in the conapo marginalization database of the same year 60 and from the vector information of the cdmx neighborhoods 57 density data were processed and later classified into four ranges using the statistical technique of natural cuts jenks 61 of the arcgis program as in the marginalization variable the density was categorized using a classification ranging from 1 to 4 where 1 corresponds to areas of low density and 4 corresponds to areas with a very high density the spatial distribution of population density is displayed in fig 3b it describes areas with very high high moderate and low density high density areas are located in the eastern central and northern regions of the city mainly in the municipalities of iztapalapa iztacalco benito juárez and the southern area of gustavo a madero where values from 145 92 to 587 30 inhabitants per hectare are registered the southern and western areas have the lowest density with a maximum concentration of 66 40 inhabitants per hectare terrain elevation the terrain elevation data for cdmx were obtained from the digital elevation model dem of the mexican continuum of elevation cem version 3 0 elaborated by inegi in 2012 62 the dem was obtained in raster format with a spatial resolution of 15 m the elevation data were processed and classified using arcgis 10 3 spatial analysis tools into seven ranges showing the topographic contrasts of the city fig 3c based on their geographic location within the different elevation ranges the neighborhoods were categorized with a score from 1 to 7 where 1 corresponds to the neighborhoods located in lower topographic elevation zones of the city and 7 corresponds to those neighborhoods located in higher elevation sites mexico city is made up of an extensive valley surrounded on the west by the sierra de las cruces mountain range and to the south by an imposing mountain range elevations range from 2206 to 3932 m above sea level the lowest elevations are found in the center north and east of the city where the valley and most of the urban area are located while the altitudes in the west and south of the city vary from 2700 to 3932 m above sea level supply capacity water supply from the lerma cutzamala system and the discontinuous service system by turns that supplies some areas of the city were the variables considered to evaluate the influence of the supply capacity to households the areas supplied in their totality or partially with water from the lerma and cutzamala systems were obtained from the technical report carried out by sacmex in 2018 55 these areas were georeferenced and digitized with the help of geographic information systems gis to evaluate the influence of the supply of the lerma cutzamala system in households the neighborhoods were classified according to their distance from said source with a score of 0 3 neighborhoods that due to their proximity to the distribution network depend mainly on this source of supply are represented with a score of 3 colonies that partially depend on the lerma cutzamala system are given a score of 2 and the neighborhoods that receive little water from the cutzamala due to their remoteness from the system are given a 1 and colonies that do not receive water from this source are given a zero according to sacmex 45 of the city s inhabitants depend totally or partially on the supply of the lerma and cutzamala system 55 the areas that receive water from this supply source are shown in fig 4a where the coverage of the western area of the city stands out in the neighborhoods of the miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and northern magdalena contreras municipalities these municipalities receive the highest percentage due to its proximity to the aforementioned hydraulic infrastructure the central zone is supplied by the cutzamala system to a lesser extent while and the less favored region is in the southeast of the city although households in the iztapalapa municipality located in the latter region receive water from cutzamala it is marginal quantities due to its remoteness from the distribution network discontinuous supply neighborhoods of the city in which the discontinuous water service or system by shifts are present were obtained from the official gazette of mexico city published on april 4 2020 63 and from the study developed by ref 64 the mapping of the colonies was carried out based on the vector data of the same information source and they were classified with a score of 0 and 1 where 1 corresponds to those that present a discontinuous service and 0 to those that register a continuous supply the areas of the city that present an intermittent water supply are located mainly in the neighborhoods of the southeastern and southwestern periphery in the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac xochimilco cuajimalpa magdalena contreras and tlalpan to a lesser extent there is a discontinuous service in the north and south central areas namely the coyoacán municipality fig 4b 3 2 identification of spatial association patterns to assess whether water consumption in the city s households presents a spatial association pattern three spatial autocorrelation measures were applied i the global moran index gmi ii the lisa index and iii the local statistics gi of getis and ord using geoda 1 18 software the gmi is a measure of autocorrelation that allows the determination of the degree and intensity of the spatial dependence of the analyzed variable 65 the gmi is estimated in the entire data set based on the following expression eq 1 eq 1 g m i n i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j in this case n corresponds to the number of spatial units while xi xj denote water consumption in spatial units i e j while x expresses the average water consumption and wij stands for each of the elements of the spatial weight matrix that captures the spatial structure of the study area the gmi registers values ranging from 1 to 1 where 1 means that there is a perfect positive spatial autocorrelation 1 suggests a perfect negative spatial autocorrelation while 0 denotes the absence of a spatial autocorrelation the gmi was estimated with a first order queen type contiguity matrix used in various research studies to establish the spatial proximity criterion between units n 33 38 in this matrix the spatial units that share a common border or vertex are considered as neighbors if colonies i and j are adjacent neighbors wij 1 otherwise wij 0 the significance of the parameter is evaluated by means of a random test of 999 permutations with a level of significance p 0 05 to identify the areas with critical water consumption in the city local indicators of spatial association lisa and gi were estimated the lisa statistic is derived from a global autocorrelation indicator that breaks down the local contribution of each observation into four categories each corresponding to a quadrant on the moran scatter plot 66 the purpose of lisa is to identify spatial clusters and outliers using the following expression eq 2 eq 2 i i y i y j w i j y j y i y i y 2 n in eq 2 n is the number of observations while y i represents the observation of the variable studied in region i y j expresses the observation of the variable studied in region j y corresponds to the mean of the variable studied and w i j represents each of the elements of the spatial weight matrix that captures the spatial structure of the study area for each observation y i and neighboring observations yj the equation for the local moran s i incorporates deviations from the mean to measure the similarity of variables quantifying how similar or different the values of the variables are for each observation and its neighbors compared to the global average 67 the local gi statistic identifies areas where high or low values are clustered in space gi is high when the sum of values within a neighborhood of a given radius or configuration is high relative to the global average and low where the sum of values within a neighborhood is small relative to the global average and approaches 0 at intermediate values 66 the getis ord local statistic is given as eq 3 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where x j is the attribute value for feature j w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total number of features and x j 1 n x j n s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 unlike the lisa index it does not consider spatial outliers the estimation produces a gi statistic for each observation and the corresponding statistical significance of 90 95 or 99 confidence in contrast the calculation of the local moran s i identifies more restrictive groups and spatial outliers with only a significance level α 0 05 which is important when establishing the inclusion of priority regions for the implementation of water management policies the lisa index and the gi statistic have been used jointly to identify differentiated clusters in water consumption 33 39 in both indicators a first order queen contiguity weight matrix was used 3 3 analysis of bivariate association between water consumption and exploratory variables to determine whether or not there is a spatial association between the levels of per capita water consumption and the exploratory variables selected in the research the bivariate moran s index bmi and the bivariate lisa index bli were used the bivariate analysis estimates the variation of the dependent variable through space considering the changes in a second variable the exploratory variable 68 in both cases the queen contiguity weights matrix was used and the statistical significance of the parameters was performed in a 999 permutations approach with a p value 0 05 3 4 confirmatory analysis in order to confirm the results of the previous stage a spatial error regression model was applied equation 4 using the geoda regression tool the selection of this type of regression obeys the recommendations of chang et al 69 and the results obtained from the spatial dependence test of the study variables performed in the geoda space software 70 per capita water consumption was considered as the dependent variable and as independent variables the explanatory variables of marginalization population density terrain elevation supply from the cutzamala lerma system and discontinuous supply a queen based weight matrix was used for its execution eq 4 y i x i β i ε ε λ w ε ξ where y i is the dependent variable water consumption of spatial unit i x i is the independent variable in i β i regression coefficient while ε incorporates the interaction effects through the error term w ε and the ξ correspond to the homocedastic and independent error term 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variation of water consumption in cdmx households the spatial location of households according to their per capita consumption of water in the city is asymmetric with consumptions ranging from 6 75 to 671 86 l inhab day fig 5 the average consumption in a household is 123 l inhab day however this is not the predominant consumption in the city fig 5 shows the box plot and map in which the ranges of consumption are represented in quartiles and defined according to the median the color variation in fig 5 indicates that household water consumption is characterized by a heterogeneous spatial distribution i e it is uneven the box plot on the left of fig 5 indicates that more than 40 of households have a consumption level below the average and that more than 75 of neighborhoods have a household consumption of less than 250 l inhab day corresponding to the average consumption estimated for the domestic sector at the national level by the national water commission conagua 71 in the periphery of the south southwest and southeast of the city there are below average household consumptions with minimum values of 6 76 and up to 75 l inhab day orange range the consumption of households located in the southwestern and southern region on the slopes of the sierra de las cruces and sierra de ajusco chichinautzin south of the municipalities of cuajimalpa álvaro obregón magdalena contreras and tlalpan stands out due to their remoteness from the infrastructure network a basic service is provided through the supply of water in pipes that does not exceed 50 l inhab day similar conditions are found in the central and southern areas of iztapalapa located in the southeast of the city where consumption ranges from 6 76 to 75 l inhab day on the other hand in the western part of the city there are higher than average household consumptions with consumptions greater than 155 71 and up to 670 l inhab day blue and navy blue ranges registered in the neighborhoods of the municipalities of miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and the northern part of magdalena contreras in the central area of the city there are households with consumption close to the average and with higher values 126 19 155 71 l inhab day indicated in the light blue range 4 2 patterns of spatial association and critical areas of water consumption in cdmx 4 2 1 spatial association patterns the gmi of water consumption registers a value of 0 62 which indicates that there is a strong spatial autocorrelation between neighboring households on this variable in the city fig 6 the scatter plot indicates a positive autocorrelation defined by the predominance of consumption in the first and third quadrants where neighborhoods with high water consumption values are grouped surrounded by neighbors with high consumption and low consumption neighborhoods surrounded by neighbors with similar consumption levels respectively according to the results of the reliability test there is a p value close to 0 which means that the results obtained with the moran s i have a reliability of 99 and a significance of 1 the values of the random simulation are far from the value estimated by the moran s i and the value of z of 34 70 the result is far from the theoretical value of 1 96 estimated for a significance threshold of 5 therefore it can be concluded that the spatial association patterns of per capita water consumption are statistically significant and tend to cluster in space fig 7 shows the spatial association patterns of household water consumption fig 7a presents the results of the lisa statistics four types of spatial association were found regarding consumption high high low low high low and low high the high high clusters red color show the neighborhoods of the city where households have high consumption levels surrounded by other neighborhoods characterized with the same level of consumption these areas are defined by 341 neighborhoods located in the western region of the city mainly in miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and benito juárez municipalities the low low clusters royal blue color identify neighborhoods whose households register low water consumption surrounded by neighborhoods with the same water consumption these clusters are located in 386 neighborhoods that to a large extent belong to the municipality of iztapalapa followed by the municipality tláhuac xochimilco milpa alta tlalpan y zona sur de la magdalena contreras located in the south and southeastern area of cdmx the high low pink color and low high light blue clusters are not significant since they represent outliers of consumption and are distributed in an isolated manner in the city in the first case households with high water consumption are registered in areas where it was expected to find a low level of consumption located in the southeast portion in the second case there are low water consumptions where high values were expected these areas are located in the western portion of the study area the atypical behavior of these clusters is probably due on the one hand to the high heterogeneity of the distribution of the population s economic income on the other hand due to the high population density and demand for urban land that has forced residents with higher socioeconomic status to reside in the peripheral areas of the city fig 7b shows the neighborhoods with the highest statistical significance in the lisa index confirming that the clusters identified in the lisa statistics are not random associations the reliability ranges of 95 and up to 99 9 are shown in light green and bright green respectively 4 2 2 critical water consumption areas in cdmx according to the estimates of the gi statistic there are two clusters with extreme consumption in cdmx fig 8 the first group shown in red depicts the neighborhoods where the highest consumption values are registered in relation to the global average hotspots in contrast the second group shown in blue represents the households with the lowest water consumption values in the city coldspots the results show a spatial configuration similar to the lisa index however unlike the lisa index the gi statistic shows clusters made up of a larger number of neighborhoods both indicators pursue the same objective however the precision of the statistical significance of gi provides greater flexibility for the inclusion of priority neighborhoods for the implementation of policies and measures to reduce inequalities in the supply of drinking water to households in city the areas with critically low access to drinking water consumption blue color are located on the periphery of the southern and southeastern region of the city encompassing a total of 415 neighborhoods distributed in large proportion in the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac xochimilco milpa alta magadalena contreras and tlalpan the area with the most critical conditions corresponds to households located in the foothills of the sierra de las cruces and ajusco chichinautzin southwest and south of the city most households do not have water supply service from the water distribution network and where basic access to drinking water results in minimum consumption of 20 and in some cases a maximum of 50 l inhab day it is worth highlighting the case of the municipalities iztapalapa tláhuac and milpa alta in which more than 80 of their neighborhoods register per capita water consumption of less than the 100 l inhab day 6 7 y 75 l hab día recommended by the who to guarantee the satisfaction of the basic needs of the home adequate access to water and not adversely affecting health the blue region of the city does not meet the minimum requirements established by the who so it is clear that the universal and equitable right to drinking water without any discrimination and the integrity of the health of its household members is not guaranteed therefore the southwest and southeastern areas of the city corresponding to the peripheral areas demand the implementation of water policies that reduce inequality in water consumption the areas with high household water consumption red area in fig 8 are located in the west of the city defined by 390 neighborhoods located mainly in the miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón y benito juárez municipalities where consumption levels are higher than 250 and up to 671 85 l inhab day 4 3 determinants of the level of water consumption in cdmx households the intense urbanization process that was implemented in cdmx from the 1950s defined a high heterogeneity in its internal structure with marked socioeconomic and territorial contrasts 72 this reality is evidenced in the spatial configuration of the five explanatory variables considered in the research as influencing factors in household water consumption figs 3 and 4 the influence of exploratory variables on consumption was estimated based on bivariate moran s index bmi while the local patterns of spatial association between each of the variables and consumptions were assessed by bivariate lisa analysis the degree of correlation and areas of pattern association are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively 4 3 1 the marginalization index and its degree of association with per capita water consumption as discussed in the variables section above the urban marginalization index is adopted as an indicator of the socioeconomic status of households the bmi between water consumption and the socioeconomic situation of households reports an overall correlation value of 0 36 which shows an inverse correlation between these variables fig 9a in other words water consumption decreases as the degree of marginalization increases and vice versa the bivariate lisa index for these variables indicates that this association is not widespread in all regions of the city but mainly in households of the central west and south southeast areas of the city pink and purple respectively fig 9a in the central west zone households with high per capita water consumption are located in the regions of the city characterized with a very low level of marginalization following the same spatial pattern the opposite situation occurs in the south and southeast area there is a low consumption of water in households that are located in regions with a high level of marginalization the reliability test shows that the results of the association between water consumption and the poverty situation of households are statistically significant by showing a value of p close to 0 which represents a reliability in the results of 99 values of random simulation far from the value estimated by the bivariate moran s i and a z value of 25 24 far from the theoretical value of 1 96 estimated for a significance threshold of 5 4 3 2 population density and its degree of association with per capita water consumption population density is another variable that shown to have an influence on household water consumption levels in the case of cdmx the bmi estimates a coefficient of correlation between these variables of 0 14 fig 8b this result indicates a level of association that is not very significant and contrary to what is recorded in other studies at the international level where density generally presents a negative correlation this peculiar association is due to the high population density that is generally registered in the city and because the households with the lowest levels of per capita consumption are located in the periphery of the city where there is a low population density and where poverty levels exert a high influence fig 9b however the bivariate lisa statistic shows an inverse correlation focused on the southern zone of the iztapala municipality in the southeastern region of the city where there is low consumption in households located in regions of higher density similarly a local correlation is observed in the western zone where households with higher consumption are located in regions of lower population density the reliability test of the bmi p value close to 0 and a z value of 10 47 and of the bivariate lisa confirms that the local correlation that occurs in the southern region of iztapala and in the western part of the city is not a product of chance but obeys a pattern of spatial association 4 3 3 terrain elevation and its degree of association with per capita water consumption due to the topographic contrasts and the important mountain ranges located in the city such as the sierra de las cruces and the sierra ajusco chichinautzin located to the west and south of the city terrain elevation was included among the exploratory variables according to the bmi results terrain elevation presents an inverse correlation with the level of household water consumption with a coefficient of 0 20 fig 9c this indicates that water consumption decreases with increasing terrain elevation and vice versa even though the value of the correlation coefficient appears low overall reliability tests indicate that the correlation is statistically significant with a p value close to zero and a z value of 14 65 on the other hand the lisa statistic shows that the spatial association between these two variables is significantly present in households in the western and southern periphery of the city where the highest land elevations and lowest levels of drinking water consumption are recorded fig 10c an atypical behavior is shown in the western zone where households have high water consumption despite the topographic elevations this behavior is associated with the proximity of these households to the aqueduct that distributes water from the lerma cutzamala system 4 3 4 water supply and its degree of association with per capita water consumption the bmi registers a value of 0 47 that indicates a strong direct association between the water supply of the lerma and cutzamala system variable and the level of water consumption fig 9d the bivariate lisa index for the same variables indicates that this association is present with intensity in the west east and south of the city fig 10d in the west which is closer to the supply system consumptions are favored by its proximity with higher water consumptions in the neighborhoods that are supplied in greater proportion from this supply source fig 9c while in the eastern and south region there is a general decrease in household consumption since they receive practically no water from this supply outliers are found in the northern part of the city in the municipalities of gustavo a madero and venustiano carranza where consumption is above average despite having no supply from the lerma cutzamala system however it is possible that this behavior is associated with the supply from external sources in this area from the set of wells of the cuautitlán pachuca aquifer however the location of the benefited neighborhoods is unknown the reliability test of the correlation between water supply from the lerma cutzamala system and water consumption levels shows a p value close to zero and a z value of 31 94 which is far from the theoretical value of 1 96 considered for a significance threshold of 5 which shows that the spatial correlation between these variables is not a product of chance but obeys a spatial pattern 4 3 5 discontinuous supply of drinking water and its degree of association with per capita water consumption the results of the bmi report a correlation coefficient of practically 0 29 which indicates the existence of an inverse correlation between intermittent service and water consumption fig 9e the bivariate lisa index for the same variables indicates that this association is present with intensity in the north and south of the city fig 10d this figure highlights the negative influence of the discontinuous supply of water in the homes at the periphery of the southwest and southeast zones that influence their low consumption mainly in the neighborhoods of the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac tlalpan magdalena contreras and the western zone of cuajimalpa the latter three located in the foothills of the sierra de las cruces and ajusco chichinautzin while in areas where there is a continuous water supply higher levels of household water consumption are observed pink cluster the reliability test shows a p value close to 0 which indicates a reliability of 99 and a z value of 20 87 far from the theoretical value for a significance threshold of 5 the results of the bivariate analysis show that the water consumption of households in the city is explained by the influence of four variables that interact jointly and simultaneously in a spatial environment the supply of water from the lerma and cutzamala systems the socioeconomic status of the households terrain elevation and discontinuous supply of water it should be noted that although the elevation of the terrain presents a lower correlation value its influence on households located in the periphery of the southwest and south region of the city is decisive due to the high elevations of the terrain most households do not have access to the potable water distribution network and the water supply is carried out discontinuously through piped water service causing very low levels of per capita water consumption the correlations of these four factors stand out at the periphery of the southwest and southeast areas of the city where the mix of unfavorable socioeconomic factors poor water supply la terrain elevation and a shift system policy have repercussions on the low levels of household water consumption 4 4 confirmatory analysis the spatial regression model evaluates the simultaneous action of the variables on water consumption its r2 value of 0 57 shows their explanatory power table 2 the similarity of this result with the spatial autocorrelation coefficient of the igm 0 61 confirms that the explanatory variables are determinant in the shape of the spatial pattern of the city in addition the coefficients of the regression confirm the influence of each variable previously estimated with the bivariate analysis the inverse relationship that exists between socioeconomic status discontinuous supply and terrain elevation with the levels of water consumption in the city s households as well as the positive correlation that exists between water supply from external sources and household water consumption levels however the simultaneous action of the variables alters the explanatory importance of the variables in the spatial pattern with respect to the bivariate lisa model table 3 shows the change in their relative importance in the two scenarios considered the results of the spatial regression indicates that the decisive variable on the spatial pattern is the discontinuous supply of water service followed by households dependence on the supply from external sources the altitudinal characteristics of the neighborhoods and their socioeconomic condition both models confirm the low importance of the population density in the water household spatial pattern 5 conclusions despite the fact that mexico city has an overall coverage of 94 access to drinking water higher than the national average there are serious inequalities within the city that violate the equitable and universal right to drinking water water supply to households is provided by a public water utility called sacmex based on information from the utility it is estimated that in 2019 the water consumption per person is 123 l day a supply considered reasonable as it is above the 100 l day recommended by the who however a detailed review of the data reveals that water consumption is inequitable among households in the city a quarter of the neighborhoods register consumption per person within a range of 6 75 l day in contrast another quartile registers consumption per person in the range of 155 277 l day this last quartile consumes up to 25 times more than households in the first quartile considering the lower value of both ranges and 2 5 times more considering the upper value of the ranges the spatial analysis of daily per capita water consumption at the neighborhood level in the city confirms the existence of a spatial distribution pattern of households the degree of correlation between the water consumptions of households and their neighbors is 0 6 igm denoting the significant spatial similarity in household consumptions the positive value of the igm reveals that the spatial pattern is formed by neighborhoods with high water consumption surrounded by neighborhoods with similar consumptions and by neighborhoods with low consumptions that register equivalent behavior in other words the spatial pattern is potentially located within the set of neighborhoods that meet these characteristics and defines two regions clusters that we denominate as high and low consumption to spatially locate both regions two indicators of local spatial association lisa and gi are applied both indicators within the groups of high and low consumption neighborhoods select those with the highest spatial correlation these areas host neighborhoods with extreme consumption i e very high hotspot or very low coldspot the lisa statistic reports a high consumption cluster of 341 neighborhoods located in the western part of the city namely in miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and benito juárez the low consumption cluster is larger and includes 386 neighborhoods located in the south and southeast of the city comprising four entire municipalities iztapalapa tlahuac milpa alta tlalpan and the southern part of magdalena contreras the results provided by the gi index shows a spatial configuration of the clusters in the same regions as lisa but with a larger number of neighborhoods the high consumption region expands its size by including 59 new neighborhoods in its delimitation while the low consumption region increases by 29 this result highlights the importance of the indicator of local spatial association applied both from the perspective of academic rigor and in the instances that participate in public policy decisions on water supply in the city the research selected five factors that it considers important in shaping the spatial pattern based on a review of the state of the art on the causes that influence inequality in household water consumption to evaluate them in a spatial framework these factors are recorded as attributes of the city s neighborhoods and are namely marginalization index population density altitude dependence on external sources of supply and whether or not they have a discontinuous water supply the application of spatial analysis allows to affirm that the explanatory power of the selected variables is very high practically covering the total spatial correlation captured by the spatial autocorrelation coefficient of the igm 0 61 the spatial regression model that evaluates the simultaneous action of the variables on water consumption registers a correlation slightly lower than the one indicated r2 of 0 57 this result confirms the importance of discovering the explanatory variables since changes in these variables imply changes in the situation of inequality in which a large number of households in the city find themselves in addition the bivariate and regression models confirm the inverse relationship between socioeconomic status discontinuous supply and land elevation with household water consumption levels in the city additionally they explain the direct relationship between water supply from external sources and household water consumption levels the weight of the variables is differentiated the decisive variable is the discontinuous supply of water service followed by the dependence on the supply from external sources the altitude of the neighborhood and the socioeconomic condition of the neighborhood the population density of the neighborhoods registers the lowest incidence in the pattern which is in contrast with the findings of other researches finally the three most important findings of the research are highlighted the first is the confirmation of the spatial autocorrelation of water consumption in the city the second is the delimitation of the cluster of low consumption coldspot at the neighborhood level and the third is the identification of the causes of its conformation the conglomerate of households with low water consumption is located on the periphery of the southwest south and southeast of the city this coldspot is characterizaded by socioeconomic lag and topographic conditions limit access to the drinking water network and hinder continuity in the water service to households considerably impacting the levels of water consumption of households these levels are far from reaching the minimum standard established by the who to guarantee the basic needs and the non affectation to the health of the household members the results offer fundamental bases for the development of policies adapted to the specific needs of the regions with the greatest water consumption conflicts in the city and therefore the establishment of efficient measures to counteract the water and social inequality that occurs in the city s peripheries on the other hand the spatial approach and the use of geo referenced information provide a methodology for the analysis of water problems in large cities in developing countries where the

8645,achieving equal access to drinkable water whilst guaranteeing no discrimination constitutes a priority goal and an acquired compromise for the international agenda however achieving this goal has become challenging especially in megacities mexico city registers 94 coverage of water supply according to the 2020 population and housing census in 2019 per capita water consumption was 123 l day a supply reasonable as it is above the 100 l day recommended by the world health organization to guarantee optimal access to water however water consumption among households is characterized by a heterogeneous spatial distribution that denotes a great inequity the objective of this research is to evaluate the configuration of the spatial patterns that define the differences in water consumption in mexico city s households as well as their association with possible causal factors this task was carried out through the spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems the water consumption records correspond to the year 2019 and were provided by the city s operating utility results confirmed the existence of two clusters of households whose location highlight areas where inequality in water consumption is present the clusters are explained by the interaction of four factors in order of importance discontinuous water supply dependence on external water sources altitude and the socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods the results provide a fundamental basis for the development of water policies to mitigate inequality also a methodological approach is provided to investigate water problems in large cities in developing countries where the available literature is scarce keywords water spatial inequality domestic water consumption spatial analysis mexico city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction universal and equitable access to drinking water without discrimination is a priority sustainability goal and commitment that has been set in the 2030 sustainable development agenda 1 2 however achieving this goal has become a challenging task in large cities where rapid population growth and demand for water have outpaced the availability of water resources and the response capacity of service providers 3 4 in this context identifying areas where the right to safe drinking water is not yet guaranteed is an essential task in urban settings although in general cities present high rates of coverage in water services which implies the compliance with sustainable development goal 6 related to equitable access to drinking water inequalities and deficiencies in the supply within these regions still remain entailing the violation of the right to water 5 7 in urban areas residential water consumption represents a significant percentage of demand therefore it also represents the most vulnerable sector to shortages 8 the world health organization who defines residential water as the amount of water used to meet basic household needs which includes water for drinking bathing and preparing food 9 10 household water demand is estimated at the level of total or per capita consumption because of the pressure it puts on urban water systems it has been used in various investigations as an indicator of the efficiency of service provision and the degree of accessibility to drinking water 4 8 11 16 according to who a minimum consumption of 100 l inhab day guarantees the satisfaction of the basic needs of health and household and thus constitutes adequate access to drinking water 17 18 however the level of household consumption varies significantly from one place to another as a function of the particular conditions and level of development of each region 19 therefore to successfully adequately plan urban water policies identifying the patterns of water consumption in households and the factors that influence their variability has become a key priority 20 21 various studies have shown that the main factors that influence the heterogeneity of consumption are the price of water 22 24 socioeconomic status family income 4 10 25 26 climatological variables such as precipitation and temperature 11 27 28 and the size of the household number of people in it 29 31 other studies have shown that there is a relationship between water consumption and the characteristics of the home number of rooms bathrooms and external elements such as gardens and swimming pools 12 14 29 the age of its residents 32 and their level of education 30 moreover population density 31 33 physical variables such as terrain altitude 34 and supply capacity which includes the supply source and hydraulic infrastructure also play an important role 4 35 the selection of the variables to analyze and their degree of incidence depends on the particular conditions of each place and the amount of information available 35 36 although the results of these investigations provide vital information on the drivers that originate the differences in water consumption in the domestic sector few studies consider an important factor the implications of spatial distribution 37 according to bonnette and house peters and chang 38 39 due to its eminently spatial nature household water consumption cannot be explained only by socioeconomic climatological or physical variables but also by its geographical location and its relationship with neighboring regions this spatial dependence is because the variables that determine consumption levels typically tend to present distribution patterns therefore these variables influence water consumption not only due to their direct effect but also indirectly through the effect of spatial association patterns 40 similarly chang et al y lee et al 33 41 demonstrated that differences in household water consumption are closely linked to urban structures shaped by the interaction of physical social economic and infrastructural characteristics therefore understanding the spatial distribution of water consumption and its relationship with the urban components that contribute to its variability is necessary for the development of efficient policies that consider the challenges of spatial heterogeneity voskamp et al and shi et al 37 42 indicate that there are three fundamental aspects that need to be understood to guarantee that policies and programs focused on ensuring equity of drinking water supply are successful the variation of consumption patterns in space and time the location of areas with critical water consumptions and how socio structural factors of cities influence consumption level differentiation since it is difficult to solve the complexity of supply problems in large cities using the criteria of a single water policy on the other hand research by refs 16 26 39 has demonstrated the impact of local spatial proximity on household water consumptions the research argues that water consumption patterns are influenced by different neighborhood characteristics such as local climate socioeconomic and cultural conditions and various water supply conditions such as infrastructure and maintenance the incorporation of the spatial approach in this research makes the provision of more precise explanations concerning the variations in water consumption in households and its causal factors becoming a valuable tool for decision makers the assumption of the spatial dependence that exists between water consumption and the structure of cities is based on tobler s law which specifies that all things are related to each other but things closer in space have a greater relationship than distant things 43 the most commonly used methods to determine this spatial association include moran s global spatial autocorrelation index gmi 16 26 33 the latter determines the degree and intensity of spatial dependence of the variable under analysis statistical indicators of local clustering such as the lisa local indicator spatial association index and the gi statistic by which clusters with similar values and groups with critical values with respect to the mean are identified respectively 39 44 45 to determine the spatial association between the dependent variable under analysis and the possible factors determining its variability methods such as the bivariate moran index bmi the bivariate lisa index bli 39 46 47 and in more complex investigations the use of spatial regressions such as spatial error regression spatial lag and geographically weighted regression gwr 33 38 41 have been used although the influence of the spatial factor on variations in household drinking water consumption has been recognized to date few investigations have included the spatial approach in their analyses 42 this happens especially in developing countries such as mexico where this type of research has been scarcely explored 48 in order to take advantage of the potential of spatial analysis mexico city cdmx was selected as the target of this research hence the objective of this research will be to identify the spatial patterns of water consumption in the city s households the concept that underlies the research is that the differences in the levels of water consumption mexico city s households are mainly due to the influence of socioeconomic demographic geographic and drinking water supply capacity factors all interrelated in a spatial environment the research is carried out through the implementation of spatial analysis and the use of geographic information systems gis results indicate the specific areas of the city where it is necessary to implement measures and public policies to guarantee equity in access to drinking water the importance of the work lies in its contribution to the development of studies related to water consumption in the domestic sector of the country to date there has been no research in which the geospatial approach has been applied to identify patterns and causal factors of disparities in water consumption in homes in large cities such as cdmx 2 study area mexico city is the capital of the country it is located in the central area of the united mexican states and has an approximate area of 1485 km2 which represents only 0 1 of the surface of the national territory this area is home to one of the poles with the greatest economic development and population growth with a total of 9 2 million inhabitants of which 99 4 are located within the urban areas 49 currently cdmx is considered an area of great water stress in the country due to its growing demand for water and its location within the hydrological administrative region of the valley of mexico the region with the smallest territorial extension and availability of water 50 51 the city has a per capita availability of renewable water from its own sources of 73m3 inhabitant year which classifies it as an area of absolute water scarcity 52 according to the falkenmark index this volume is mainly for public urban industrial and service use this estimate does not consider the losses that occur in the potable water distribution network roughly 40 of the water lost due to leaks which considerably reduce the per capita availability of water 53 the mexico city water system sacmex is the operating utility in charge of supplying water to city sacmex currently supplies a total volume of 983 92 hm3 year through its own sources mainly of underground origin wells and springs from the local aquifer and a complex transfer system table 1 54 its import includes sources of surface origin such as the cutzamala system located 124 km from the city and underground originating from the battery of wells of the lerma system located to the west of the city and from the neighboring aquifers of the valley of mexico cuautitlán pachuca and texcoco fig 1 together the lerma and cutzamala systems contribute 46 8 of the potable water available in cdmx 141 91 and 318 51 hm3 year respectively making it the most important external supply source meanwhile the neighboring aquifers of the valley of mexico contribute a volume of 113 53 hm3 year which represents 11 5 of the total water 54 moreover of the total volume of water franchised for cdmx 97 is destined for urban public use additionally according to data from the population and housing census of 2020 the city registers a supply coverage to the homes of 94 a lower coverage than that recorded in 2015 98 which indicates an increase in the number of households without connection to drinking water services 49 50 despite its high level of coverage which is higher than the national average the city faces serious water shortage problems and supply deficiencies due to intermittencies in the system recurrent supply cuts due to variability in the water availability of external sources mainly the cutzamala system and social conflicts due to inequality in the distribution of drinking water 53 3 materials and methods the current methodological research process consists of four phases i data collection and mapping of variables ii exploratory analysis of water consumption data iii identification of spatial association patterns iv bivariate association analysis and v confirmatory analysis fig 2 3 1 data collection and variables considering the explanatory variables of household water consumption in recent studies the particular characteristics of cdmx and the availability of information five explanatory variables were selected to determine the differences in water consumption in the cdmx socioeconomic status population density terrain elevation and two variables associated with the capacity to supply water to households the data were obtained from official sites at the neighborhood level neighborhoods are made up of a group of dwellings built in areas of human settlement with similar characteristics they represent one of the units of greater territorial disaggregation of the electoral geographic framework of the national electoral institute ine these are delimited to capture in greater detail the conditions of the country s population the urban area of cdmx is made up of a total of approximately 1647 neighborhoods it should be noted that these neighborhoods constitute a smaller administrative subdivision than the census units called urban basic geostatistical areas agebs conformed by a group of blocks established by inegi thus the most detailed spatial scale available in the country was obtained which has a spatial coverage of 100 of the city allowing to capture the heterogeneity of the urban structure and the real variations in household consumption the information on consumption and explanatory variables correspond to the year 2019 and 2020 and represent the current conditions of cdmx it should be noted that the data available at this scale are limited and have not been used in other research due to the complexity of the process a per capita water consumption water consumption data were obtained from the only operating agency in the city the mexico city water system sacmex and correspond to the year 2019 the database includes 6 bimonthly bills for metered consumption service and a fixed fee for the concept of water supply in m3 at the neighborhood level corresponding to domestic use in this research it is assumed that the supplied water is equal to the household consumption since effective information on the households net consumption is not available based on this information the average water consumption in homes for each neighborhood measured in liters day was estimated at a total of 1635 neighborhoods that define the city per capita consumption for each neighborhood was obtained through the association between average water consumption in liters day and the number of household members at the neighborhood level the latter were obtained from the 2020 population and housing census of the national institute of statistics and geography of mexico inegi 49 the georeferencing of consumption was carried out using vector information of the neighborhoods of cdmx for the year 2019 available in shapefile format in the open data portal of the city s government 57 using arcgis 10 3 software 58 b exploratory variables the exploratory variables selected to determine variations in water consumption are socioeconomic status population density terrain elevation and two variables associated with the capacity to supply water to households the supply from the lerma cutzamala system and the discontinuous supply also known as shift system figs 3 and 4 socioeconomic status the indicator that reflects the socioeconomic conditions of households is the urban marginalization index umi estimated by the national population council conapo in the year 2020 59 the index was generated for the first time in mexico at the neighborhood level with microdata from the 2020 population and housing census the index reports the households standard of living and their degree of social exclusion it is constructed based on eleven socio economic indicators that reflect the intensity of deprivation in four dimensions level of education access to health housing conditions and availability of goods 59 umi were classified into five categories that define areas in different socioeconomic status very high high medium low and very low levels of marginalization the index was obtained in shapefile format from the official conapo website and was processed using arcgis 10 3 software based on the umi categories the neighborhoods were classified with a range of 1 5 where 1 represents the neighborhoods with the lowest degree of marginalization and 5 corresponds to the neighborhoods with a high degree of socioeconomic exclusion fig 3a shows the areas of the city with a low socioeconomic level these are defined by a very high and high marginalization degree and are located in the southern southeastern and northern periphery of the city specifically in the southern portion of the iztapalapa xochimilco tláhuac milpa alta and tlalpan municipalities in these areas there are several elements of socioeconomic exclusion such as low levels of education precarious housing conditions low purchasing power and deprivation of basic services such as access to health care drainage and piped water in homes conversely in the central and western areas of the city there is a low and very low degree of marginalization the municipalities of miguel hidalgo benito juárez cuauhtémoc and coyoacán constitute the areas with the highest purchasing power and socioeconomic status in the country s capital population density population density was estimated based on the relationship between the number of inhabitants and the area in hectares of each neighborhood population data were obtained from microdata of the 2020 population and housing census available in the conapo marginalization database of the same year 60 and from the vector information of the cdmx neighborhoods 57 density data were processed and later classified into four ranges using the statistical technique of natural cuts jenks 61 of the arcgis program as in the marginalization variable the density was categorized using a classification ranging from 1 to 4 where 1 corresponds to areas of low density and 4 corresponds to areas with a very high density the spatial distribution of population density is displayed in fig 3b it describes areas with very high high moderate and low density high density areas are located in the eastern central and northern regions of the city mainly in the municipalities of iztapalapa iztacalco benito juárez and the southern area of gustavo a madero where values from 145 92 to 587 30 inhabitants per hectare are registered the southern and western areas have the lowest density with a maximum concentration of 66 40 inhabitants per hectare terrain elevation the terrain elevation data for cdmx were obtained from the digital elevation model dem of the mexican continuum of elevation cem version 3 0 elaborated by inegi in 2012 62 the dem was obtained in raster format with a spatial resolution of 15 m the elevation data were processed and classified using arcgis 10 3 spatial analysis tools into seven ranges showing the topographic contrasts of the city fig 3c based on their geographic location within the different elevation ranges the neighborhoods were categorized with a score from 1 to 7 where 1 corresponds to the neighborhoods located in lower topographic elevation zones of the city and 7 corresponds to those neighborhoods located in higher elevation sites mexico city is made up of an extensive valley surrounded on the west by the sierra de las cruces mountain range and to the south by an imposing mountain range elevations range from 2206 to 3932 m above sea level the lowest elevations are found in the center north and east of the city where the valley and most of the urban area are located while the altitudes in the west and south of the city vary from 2700 to 3932 m above sea level supply capacity water supply from the lerma cutzamala system and the discontinuous service system by turns that supplies some areas of the city were the variables considered to evaluate the influence of the supply capacity to households the areas supplied in their totality or partially with water from the lerma and cutzamala systems were obtained from the technical report carried out by sacmex in 2018 55 these areas were georeferenced and digitized with the help of geographic information systems gis to evaluate the influence of the supply of the lerma cutzamala system in households the neighborhoods were classified according to their distance from said source with a score of 0 3 neighborhoods that due to their proximity to the distribution network depend mainly on this source of supply are represented with a score of 3 colonies that partially depend on the lerma cutzamala system are given a score of 2 and the neighborhoods that receive little water from the cutzamala due to their remoteness from the system are given a 1 and colonies that do not receive water from this source are given a zero according to sacmex 45 of the city s inhabitants depend totally or partially on the supply of the lerma and cutzamala system 55 the areas that receive water from this supply source are shown in fig 4a where the coverage of the western area of the city stands out in the neighborhoods of the miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and northern magdalena contreras municipalities these municipalities receive the highest percentage due to its proximity to the aforementioned hydraulic infrastructure the central zone is supplied by the cutzamala system to a lesser extent while and the less favored region is in the southeast of the city although households in the iztapalapa municipality located in the latter region receive water from cutzamala it is marginal quantities due to its remoteness from the distribution network discontinuous supply neighborhoods of the city in which the discontinuous water service or system by shifts are present were obtained from the official gazette of mexico city published on april 4 2020 63 and from the study developed by ref 64 the mapping of the colonies was carried out based on the vector data of the same information source and they were classified with a score of 0 and 1 where 1 corresponds to those that present a discontinuous service and 0 to those that register a continuous supply the areas of the city that present an intermittent water supply are located mainly in the neighborhoods of the southeastern and southwestern periphery in the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac xochimilco cuajimalpa magdalena contreras and tlalpan to a lesser extent there is a discontinuous service in the north and south central areas namely the coyoacán municipality fig 4b 3 2 identification of spatial association patterns to assess whether water consumption in the city s households presents a spatial association pattern three spatial autocorrelation measures were applied i the global moran index gmi ii the lisa index and iii the local statistics gi of getis and ord using geoda 1 18 software the gmi is a measure of autocorrelation that allows the determination of the degree and intensity of the spatial dependence of the analyzed variable 65 the gmi is estimated in the entire data set based on the following expression eq 1 eq 1 g m i n i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j in this case n corresponds to the number of spatial units while xi xj denote water consumption in spatial units i e j while x expresses the average water consumption and wij stands for each of the elements of the spatial weight matrix that captures the spatial structure of the study area the gmi registers values ranging from 1 to 1 where 1 means that there is a perfect positive spatial autocorrelation 1 suggests a perfect negative spatial autocorrelation while 0 denotes the absence of a spatial autocorrelation the gmi was estimated with a first order queen type contiguity matrix used in various research studies to establish the spatial proximity criterion between units n 33 38 in this matrix the spatial units that share a common border or vertex are considered as neighbors if colonies i and j are adjacent neighbors wij 1 otherwise wij 0 the significance of the parameter is evaluated by means of a random test of 999 permutations with a level of significance p 0 05 to identify the areas with critical water consumption in the city local indicators of spatial association lisa and gi were estimated the lisa statistic is derived from a global autocorrelation indicator that breaks down the local contribution of each observation into four categories each corresponding to a quadrant on the moran scatter plot 66 the purpose of lisa is to identify spatial clusters and outliers using the following expression eq 2 eq 2 i i y i y j w i j y j y i y i y 2 n in eq 2 n is the number of observations while y i represents the observation of the variable studied in region i y j expresses the observation of the variable studied in region j y corresponds to the mean of the variable studied and w i j represents each of the elements of the spatial weight matrix that captures the spatial structure of the study area for each observation y i and neighboring observations yj the equation for the local moran s i incorporates deviations from the mean to measure the similarity of variables quantifying how similar or different the values of the variables are for each observation and its neighbors compared to the global average 67 the local gi statistic identifies areas where high or low values are clustered in space gi is high when the sum of values within a neighborhood of a given radius or configuration is high relative to the global average and low where the sum of values within a neighborhood is small relative to the global average and approaches 0 at intermediate values 66 the getis ord local statistic is given as eq 3 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where x j is the attribute value for feature j w i j is the spatial weight between feature i and j n is equal to the total number of features and x j 1 n x j n s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 unlike the lisa index it does not consider spatial outliers the estimation produces a gi statistic for each observation and the corresponding statistical significance of 90 95 or 99 confidence in contrast the calculation of the local moran s i identifies more restrictive groups and spatial outliers with only a significance level α 0 05 which is important when establishing the inclusion of priority regions for the implementation of water management policies the lisa index and the gi statistic have been used jointly to identify differentiated clusters in water consumption 33 39 in both indicators a first order queen contiguity weight matrix was used 3 3 analysis of bivariate association between water consumption and exploratory variables to determine whether or not there is a spatial association between the levels of per capita water consumption and the exploratory variables selected in the research the bivariate moran s index bmi and the bivariate lisa index bli were used the bivariate analysis estimates the variation of the dependent variable through space considering the changes in a second variable the exploratory variable 68 in both cases the queen contiguity weights matrix was used and the statistical significance of the parameters was performed in a 999 permutations approach with a p value 0 05 3 4 confirmatory analysis in order to confirm the results of the previous stage a spatial error regression model was applied equation 4 using the geoda regression tool the selection of this type of regression obeys the recommendations of chang et al 69 and the results obtained from the spatial dependence test of the study variables performed in the geoda space software 70 per capita water consumption was considered as the dependent variable and as independent variables the explanatory variables of marginalization population density terrain elevation supply from the cutzamala lerma system and discontinuous supply a queen based weight matrix was used for its execution eq 4 y i x i β i ε ε λ w ε ξ where y i is the dependent variable water consumption of spatial unit i x i is the independent variable in i β i regression coefficient while ε incorporates the interaction effects through the error term w ε and the ξ correspond to the homocedastic and independent error term 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variation of water consumption in cdmx households the spatial location of households according to their per capita consumption of water in the city is asymmetric with consumptions ranging from 6 75 to 671 86 l inhab day fig 5 the average consumption in a household is 123 l inhab day however this is not the predominant consumption in the city fig 5 shows the box plot and map in which the ranges of consumption are represented in quartiles and defined according to the median the color variation in fig 5 indicates that household water consumption is characterized by a heterogeneous spatial distribution i e it is uneven the box plot on the left of fig 5 indicates that more than 40 of households have a consumption level below the average and that more than 75 of neighborhoods have a household consumption of less than 250 l inhab day corresponding to the average consumption estimated for the domestic sector at the national level by the national water commission conagua 71 in the periphery of the south southwest and southeast of the city there are below average household consumptions with minimum values of 6 76 and up to 75 l inhab day orange range the consumption of households located in the southwestern and southern region on the slopes of the sierra de las cruces and sierra de ajusco chichinautzin south of the municipalities of cuajimalpa álvaro obregón magdalena contreras and tlalpan stands out due to their remoteness from the infrastructure network a basic service is provided through the supply of water in pipes that does not exceed 50 l inhab day similar conditions are found in the central and southern areas of iztapalapa located in the southeast of the city where consumption ranges from 6 76 to 75 l inhab day on the other hand in the western part of the city there are higher than average household consumptions with consumptions greater than 155 71 and up to 670 l inhab day blue and navy blue ranges registered in the neighborhoods of the municipalities of miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and the northern part of magdalena contreras in the central area of the city there are households with consumption close to the average and with higher values 126 19 155 71 l inhab day indicated in the light blue range 4 2 patterns of spatial association and critical areas of water consumption in cdmx 4 2 1 spatial association patterns the gmi of water consumption registers a value of 0 62 which indicates that there is a strong spatial autocorrelation between neighboring households on this variable in the city fig 6 the scatter plot indicates a positive autocorrelation defined by the predominance of consumption in the first and third quadrants where neighborhoods with high water consumption values are grouped surrounded by neighbors with high consumption and low consumption neighborhoods surrounded by neighbors with similar consumption levels respectively according to the results of the reliability test there is a p value close to 0 which means that the results obtained with the moran s i have a reliability of 99 and a significance of 1 the values of the random simulation are far from the value estimated by the moran s i and the value of z of 34 70 the result is far from the theoretical value of 1 96 estimated for a significance threshold of 5 therefore it can be concluded that the spatial association patterns of per capita water consumption are statistically significant and tend to cluster in space fig 7 shows the spatial association patterns of household water consumption fig 7a presents the results of the lisa statistics four types of spatial association were found regarding consumption high high low low high low and low high the high high clusters red color show the neighborhoods of the city where households have high consumption levels surrounded by other neighborhoods characterized with the same level of consumption these areas are defined by 341 neighborhoods located in the western region of the city mainly in miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and benito juárez municipalities the low low clusters royal blue color identify neighborhoods whose households register low water consumption surrounded by neighborhoods with the same water consumption these clusters are located in 386 neighborhoods that to a large extent belong to the municipality of iztapalapa followed by the municipality tláhuac xochimilco milpa alta tlalpan y zona sur de la magdalena contreras located in the south and southeastern area of cdmx the high low pink color and low high light blue clusters are not significant since they represent outliers of consumption and are distributed in an isolated manner in the city in the first case households with high water consumption are registered in areas where it was expected to find a low level of consumption located in the southeast portion in the second case there are low water consumptions where high values were expected these areas are located in the western portion of the study area the atypical behavior of these clusters is probably due on the one hand to the high heterogeneity of the distribution of the population s economic income on the other hand due to the high population density and demand for urban land that has forced residents with higher socioeconomic status to reside in the peripheral areas of the city fig 7b shows the neighborhoods with the highest statistical significance in the lisa index confirming that the clusters identified in the lisa statistics are not random associations the reliability ranges of 95 and up to 99 9 are shown in light green and bright green respectively 4 2 2 critical water consumption areas in cdmx according to the estimates of the gi statistic there are two clusters with extreme consumption in cdmx fig 8 the first group shown in red depicts the neighborhoods where the highest consumption values are registered in relation to the global average hotspots in contrast the second group shown in blue represents the households with the lowest water consumption values in the city coldspots the results show a spatial configuration similar to the lisa index however unlike the lisa index the gi statistic shows clusters made up of a larger number of neighborhoods both indicators pursue the same objective however the precision of the statistical significance of gi provides greater flexibility for the inclusion of priority neighborhoods for the implementation of policies and measures to reduce inequalities in the supply of drinking water to households in city the areas with critically low access to drinking water consumption blue color are located on the periphery of the southern and southeastern region of the city encompassing a total of 415 neighborhoods distributed in large proportion in the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac xochimilco milpa alta magadalena contreras and tlalpan the area with the most critical conditions corresponds to households located in the foothills of the sierra de las cruces and ajusco chichinautzin southwest and south of the city most households do not have water supply service from the water distribution network and where basic access to drinking water results in minimum consumption of 20 and in some cases a maximum of 50 l inhab day it is worth highlighting the case of the municipalities iztapalapa tláhuac and milpa alta in which more than 80 of their neighborhoods register per capita water consumption of less than the 100 l inhab day 6 7 y 75 l hab día recommended by the who to guarantee the satisfaction of the basic needs of the home adequate access to water and not adversely affecting health the blue region of the city does not meet the minimum requirements established by the who so it is clear that the universal and equitable right to drinking water without any discrimination and the integrity of the health of its household members is not guaranteed therefore the southwest and southeastern areas of the city corresponding to the peripheral areas demand the implementation of water policies that reduce inequality in water consumption the areas with high household water consumption red area in fig 8 are located in the west of the city defined by 390 neighborhoods located mainly in the miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón y benito juárez municipalities where consumption levels are higher than 250 and up to 671 85 l inhab day 4 3 determinants of the level of water consumption in cdmx households the intense urbanization process that was implemented in cdmx from the 1950s defined a high heterogeneity in its internal structure with marked socioeconomic and territorial contrasts 72 this reality is evidenced in the spatial configuration of the five explanatory variables considered in the research as influencing factors in household water consumption figs 3 and 4 the influence of exploratory variables on consumption was estimated based on bivariate moran s index bmi while the local patterns of spatial association between each of the variables and consumptions were assessed by bivariate lisa analysis the degree of correlation and areas of pattern association are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively 4 3 1 the marginalization index and its degree of association with per capita water consumption as discussed in the variables section above the urban marginalization index is adopted as an indicator of the socioeconomic status of households the bmi between water consumption and the socioeconomic situation of households reports an overall correlation value of 0 36 which shows an inverse correlation between these variables fig 9a in other words water consumption decreases as the degree of marginalization increases and vice versa the bivariate lisa index for these variables indicates that this association is not widespread in all regions of the city but mainly in households of the central west and south southeast areas of the city pink and purple respectively fig 9a in the central west zone households with high per capita water consumption are located in the regions of the city characterized with a very low level of marginalization following the same spatial pattern the opposite situation occurs in the south and southeast area there is a low consumption of water in households that are located in regions with a high level of marginalization the reliability test shows that the results of the association between water consumption and the poverty situation of households are statistically significant by showing a value of p close to 0 which represents a reliability in the results of 99 values of random simulation far from the value estimated by the bivariate moran s i and a z value of 25 24 far from the theoretical value of 1 96 estimated for a significance threshold of 5 4 3 2 population density and its degree of association with per capita water consumption population density is another variable that shown to have an influence on household water consumption levels in the case of cdmx the bmi estimates a coefficient of correlation between these variables of 0 14 fig 8b this result indicates a level of association that is not very significant and contrary to what is recorded in other studies at the international level where density generally presents a negative correlation this peculiar association is due to the high population density that is generally registered in the city and because the households with the lowest levels of per capita consumption are located in the periphery of the city where there is a low population density and where poverty levels exert a high influence fig 9b however the bivariate lisa statistic shows an inverse correlation focused on the southern zone of the iztapala municipality in the southeastern region of the city where there is low consumption in households located in regions of higher density similarly a local correlation is observed in the western zone where households with higher consumption are located in regions of lower population density the reliability test of the bmi p value close to 0 and a z value of 10 47 and of the bivariate lisa confirms that the local correlation that occurs in the southern region of iztapala and in the western part of the city is not a product of chance but obeys a pattern of spatial association 4 3 3 terrain elevation and its degree of association with per capita water consumption due to the topographic contrasts and the important mountain ranges located in the city such as the sierra de las cruces and the sierra ajusco chichinautzin located to the west and south of the city terrain elevation was included among the exploratory variables according to the bmi results terrain elevation presents an inverse correlation with the level of household water consumption with a coefficient of 0 20 fig 9c this indicates that water consumption decreases with increasing terrain elevation and vice versa even though the value of the correlation coefficient appears low overall reliability tests indicate that the correlation is statistically significant with a p value close to zero and a z value of 14 65 on the other hand the lisa statistic shows that the spatial association between these two variables is significantly present in households in the western and southern periphery of the city where the highest land elevations and lowest levels of drinking water consumption are recorded fig 10c an atypical behavior is shown in the western zone where households have high water consumption despite the topographic elevations this behavior is associated with the proximity of these households to the aqueduct that distributes water from the lerma cutzamala system 4 3 4 water supply and its degree of association with per capita water consumption the bmi registers a value of 0 47 that indicates a strong direct association between the water supply of the lerma and cutzamala system variable and the level of water consumption fig 9d the bivariate lisa index for the same variables indicates that this association is present with intensity in the west east and south of the city fig 10d in the west which is closer to the supply system consumptions are favored by its proximity with higher water consumptions in the neighborhoods that are supplied in greater proportion from this supply source fig 9c while in the eastern and south region there is a general decrease in household consumption since they receive practically no water from this supply outliers are found in the northern part of the city in the municipalities of gustavo a madero and venustiano carranza where consumption is above average despite having no supply from the lerma cutzamala system however it is possible that this behavior is associated with the supply from external sources in this area from the set of wells of the cuautitlán pachuca aquifer however the location of the benefited neighborhoods is unknown the reliability test of the correlation between water supply from the lerma cutzamala system and water consumption levels shows a p value close to zero and a z value of 31 94 which is far from the theoretical value of 1 96 considered for a significance threshold of 5 which shows that the spatial correlation between these variables is not a product of chance but obeys a spatial pattern 4 3 5 discontinuous supply of drinking water and its degree of association with per capita water consumption the results of the bmi report a correlation coefficient of practically 0 29 which indicates the existence of an inverse correlation between intermittent service and water consumption fig 9e the bivariate lisa index for the same variables indicates that this association is present with intensity in the north and south of the city fig 10d this figure highlights the negative influence of the discontinuous supply of water in the homes at the periphery of the southwest and southeast zones that influence their low consumption mainly in the neighborhoods of the municipalities of iztapalapa tláhuac tlalpan magdalena contreras and the western zone of cuajimalpa the latter three located in the foothills of the sierra de las cruces and ajusco chichinautzin while in areas where there is a continuous water supply higher levels of household water consumption are observed pink cluster the reliability test shows a p value close to 0 which indicates a reliability of 99 and a z value of 20 87 far from the theoretical value for a significance threshold of 5 the results of the bivariate analysis show that the water consumption of households in the city is explained by the influence of four variables that interact jointly and simultaneously in a spatial environment the supply of water from the lerma and cutzamala systems the socioeconomic status of the households terrain elevation and discontinuous supply of water it should be noted that although the elevation of the terrain presents a lower correlation value its influence on households located in the periphery of the southwest and south region of the city is decisive due to the high elevations of the terrain most households do not have access to the potable water distribution network and the water supply is carried out discontinuously through piped water service causing very low levels of per capita water consumption the correlations of these four factors stand out at the periphery of the southwest and southeast areas of the city where the mix of unfavorable socioeconomic factors poor water supply la terrain elevation and a shift system policy have repercussions on the low levels of household water consumption 4 4 confirmatory analysis the spatial regression model evaluates the simultaneous action of the variables on water consumption its r2 value of 0 57 shows their explanatory power table 2 the similarity of this result with the spatial autocorrelation coefficient of the igm 0 61 confirms that the explanatory variables are determinant in the shape of the spatial pattern of the city in addition the coefficients of the regression confirm the influence of each variable previously estimated with the bivariate analysis the inverse relationship that exists between socioeconomic status discontinuous supply and terrain elevation with the levels of water consumption in the city s households as well as the positive correlation that exists between water supply from external sources and household water consumption levels however the simultaneous action of the variables alters the explanatory importance of the variables in the spatial pattern with respect to the bivariate lisa model table 3 shows the change in their relative importance in the two scenarios considered the results of the spatial regression indicates that the decisive variable on the spatial pattern is the discontinuous supply of water service followed by households dependence on the supply from external sources the altitudinal characteristics of the neighborhoods and their socioeconomic condition both models confirm the low importance of the population density in the water household spatial pattern 5 conclusions despite the fact that mexico city has an overall coverage of 94 access to drinking water higher than the national average there are serious inequalities within the city that violate the equitable and universal right to drinking water water supply to households is provided by a public water utility called sacmex based on information from the utility it is estimated that in 2019 the water consumption per person is 123 l day a supply considered reasonable as it is above the 100 l day recommended by the who however a detailed review of the data reveals that water consumption is inequitable among households in the city a quarter of the neighborhoods register consumption per person within a range of 6 75 l day in contrast another quartile registers consumption per person in the range of 155 277 l day this last quartile consumes up to 25 times more than households in the first quartile considering the lower value of both ranges and 2 5 times more considering the upper value of the ranges the spatial analysis of daily per capita water consumption at the neighborhood level in the city confirms the existence of a spatial distribution pattern of households the degree of correlation between the water consumptions of households and their neighbors is 0 6 igm denoting the significant spatial similarity in household consumptions the positive value of the igm reveals that the spatial pattern is formed by neighborhoods with high water consumption surrounded by neighborhoods with similar consumptions and by neighborhoods with low consumptions that register equivalent behavior in other words the spatial pattern is potentially located within the set of neighborhoods that meet these characteristics and defines two regions clusters that we denominate as high and low consumption to spatially locate both regions two indicators of local spatial association lisa and gi are applied both indicators within the groups of high and low consumption neighborhoods select those with the highest spatial correlation these areas host neighborhoods with extreme consumption i e very high hotspot or very low coldspot the lisa statistic reports a high consumption cluster of 341 neighborhoods located in the western part of the city namely in miguel hidalgo cuajimalpa álvaro obregón and benito juárez the low consumption cluster is larger and includes 386 neighborhoods located in the south and southeast of the city comprising four entire municipalities iztapalapa tlahuac milpa alta tlalpan and the southern part of magdalena contreras the results provided by the gi index shows a spatial configuration of the clusters in the same regions as lisa but with a larger number of neighborhoods the high consumption region expands its size by including 59 new neighborhoods in its delimitation while the low consumption region increases by 29 this result highlights the importance of the indicator of local spatial association applied both from the perspective of academic rigor and in the instances that participate in public policy decisions on water supply in the city the research selected five factors that it considers important in shaping the spatial pattern based on a review of the state of the art on the causes that influence inequality in household water consumption to evaluate them in a spatial framework these factors are recorded as attributes of the city s neighborhoods and are namely marginalization index population density altitude dependence on external sources of supply and whether or not they have a discontinuous water supply the application of spatial analysis allows to affirm that the explanatory power of the selected variables is very high practically covering the total spatial correlation captured by the spatial autocorrelation coefficient of the igm 0 61 the spatial regression model that evaluates the simultaneous action of the variables on water consumption registers a correlation slightly lower than the one indicated r2 of 0 57 this result confirms the importance of discovering the explanatory variables since changes in these variables imply changes in the situation of inequality in which a large number of households in the city find themselves in addition the bivariate and regression models confirm the inverse relationship between socioeconomic status discontinuous supply and land elevation with household water consumption levels in the city additionally they explain the direct relationship between water supply from external sources and household water consumption levels the weight of the variables is differentiated the decisive variable is the discontinuous supply of water service followed by the dependence on the supply from external sources the altitude of the neighborhood and the socioeconomic condition of the neighborhood the population density of the neighborhoods registers the lowest incidence in the pattern which is in contrast with the findings of other researches finally the three most important findings of the research are highlighted the first is the confirmation of the spatial autocorrelation of water consumption in the city the second is the delimitation of the cluster of low consumption coldspot at the neighborhood level and the third is the identification of the causes of its conformation the conglomerate of households with low water consumption is located on the periphery of the southwest south and southeast of the city this coldspot is characterizaded by socioeconomic lag and topographic conditions limit access to the drinking water network and hinder continuity in the water service to households considerably impacting the levels of water consumption of households these levels are far from reaching the minimum standard established by the who to guarantee the basic needs and the non affectation to the health of the household members the results offer fundamental bases for the development of policies adapted to the specific needs of the regions with the greatest water consumption conflicts in the city and therefore the establishment of efficient measures to counteract the water and social inequality that occurs in the city s peripheries on the other hand the spatial approach and the use of geo referenced information provide a methodology for the analysis of water problems in large cities in developing countries where the

8646,as farmers in semiarid climates seek new ways of adding value to their operations those with irrigation water rights are increasingly receptive to payments or credits for water sharing yet past research on the economic feasibility of limited irrigation strategies for consumptive use cu savings seldom considers production risk using stochastic dominance we compare the effect of three limited irrigation practices deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity on the returns to corn production for sprinkler and subsurface technology field level simulations show that the practices reduce returns and increase risk but credits for cu savings could make them economically viable for farmers larger credits more money incentivize limited irrigation at greater levels less yield and more risk but fully compensating farmers for risk bearing will be costly with sprinkler technology root zone drying becomes risk efficient at lower credit values than deficit irrigation deficit irrigation along with root zone drying become risk efficient at the lowest credit values for subsurface technology thus risk aversion could explain why some farmers choose not to share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for differences in expected returns improved knowledge about the profitability and risk of limited irrigation practices can increase the joint sustainability of irrigated agriculture and other societal water uses keywords consumptive use corn deficit irrigation risk aversion stochastic dominance water sharing jel classification q12 q15 q25 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as world populations contend with future water challenges agricultural water management in arid and semiarid areas consistently ranks as a top policy concern 1 2 in particular water transfers between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors are expected to play a central role in meeting future demand 3 4 historically transfers between these sectors were permanent and relied on buy and dry practices that decoupled water rights from the land for conveyance elsewhere 5 6 more recently water stakeholders have proposed novel solutions called collaborative water sharing agreements 1 1 collaborative water sharing agreements are also referred to as alternative transfer methods but the former term is now preferred 8 that enable temporary transfers while ensuring that the water right stays attached to the original land parcel 7 the importance of this approach is frequently highlighted for example the state of colorado s forthcoming 2023 water plan update calls for expanding these collaborative agreements 8 since agriculture has been and will continue to be the largest water user in many regions agricultural managers face increased pressure to embrace flexible on farm water management systems 9 10 such systems seek to modernize irrigation technology and could facilitate the broader adoption of limited irrigation practices by offering greater control monitoring and efficiency over crop water delivery limited irrigation practices achieve on farm consumptive use cu savings by reducing actual crop evapotranspiration e t a below potential crop evapotranspiration e t c where e t c is the amount of water to satisfy expected plant needs they can benefit farmers and society in several ways first they can enable the diversion of cu savings to alternative societal water uses under planned scenarios like collaborative water sharing agreements 11 12 2 2 on farm irrigation efficiency gains alone however are insufficient to ensure increased overall water availability improvements in efficiency must also be accompanied by basin wide water accounting and measurement systems and caps on total extraction 10 second they can aid producers and other stakeholders in responding to unplanned scenarios like water shortages due to drought 13 14 as farmers in arid and semiarid regions search for new ways to add value to their operations they are increasingly receptive to financial credits for water sharing 15 16 credits could be manifested through direct or indirect payments cost savings or kept for future water use our focus is on credit values that make limited irrigation practices attractive to farmers not on how those credits might be paid in semiarid regions where soil water and precipitation are insufficient to meet e t c limited irrigation practices often involve irrigation reductions however more efficient irrigation technology like subsurface drip 17 18 irrigation scheduling modifications like root zone drying i e wait to start summer irrigations until soil moisture drops below a given threshold 19 20 or early maturing varieties 21 are other strategies farmers may consider using to limit irrigation deficit irrigation is one practice under evaluation for water savings 22 23 it achieves cu savings by applying less irrigation water than is required for 100 e t c when other sources of moisture are limiting e g precipitation soil water 24 25 deficit irrigation reduces yields but credits could offset the forgone returns 26 less well understood is how deficit irrigation affects yield variability and how this variability interacts with other factors that influence cu and profitability like irrigation technology crop maturity and irrigation scheduling 27 we examine the question when are credits for on farm water savings from limited irrigation practices profitable for farmers there are many studies about the economics of deficit irrigation for example 28 estimates the functional relationship between e t a and corn yields and determines the relative water price at which deficit irrigation becomes feasible 29 examines how water leasing and deficit irrigation contribute to improved streamflow most of these studies do not explicitly consider changes in yield variability or other forms of risk yet the importance of risk in decision making has been extensively proven in the literature e g 30 and an expansive cadre of risk management methods to examine agricultural systems like deficit irrigation have been developed e g 31 a risk neutral farmer would evaluate the simple breakeven condition and require a credit that is at least equal to the difference in expected returns between full and limited irrigation methods however if limited irrigation increases production risk a risk averse farmer will require a premium that is in addition to the simple breakeven value conceptually risk analyses compare risk and returns simultaneously for different alternatives and assign preferences for tradeoffs between those attributes to individuals or groups for example 32 link an agro hydrological model with an economic risk model to look at efficient preseason management strategies 33 examine uncertainty in water supply and risk preferences three studies conduct farmer level risk analyses related to irrigation but not in the context of limited irrigation and water sharing 34 36 methodologically risk analyses differ based on risk preference assumptions some approaches like stochastic efficiency with respect to a function assign utility functions that impose structure on risk preferences 37 other approaches like stochastic dominance sd do not impose structure and are flexible for evaluating potentially important features like downside risk 38 here we apply sd to look at the risk and returns of limited irrigation practices compared to full irrigation sd was chosen because it works well both functionally and conceptually with the concept of payments or credits 39 and because it can be used without a priori knowledge about farmers risk preferences the objectives of this study are to i analyze the effect of limited irrigation practices on the distribution of net returns to crop production and ii use sd to determine the value of water savings credits that jointly considering risk and returns would provide financial incentive for a farmer to switch to limited irrigation for this research we refer to the limited irrigation practice with the lowest credit value smallest cost incentive the risk efficient practice rep the practices that we consider for both sprinkler and subsurface irrigation technology include irrigation level root zone drying and early maturing crop varieties empirical cumulative distribution functions edfs are simulated for corn production using weather and climate conditions representative of the south platte basin using aquacrop os 40 and then used in the sd analysis to determine breakeven credit values for a farmer with risk neutral and risk averse preferences respectively this research contributes to literature on the economic feasibility of on farm limited irrigation practices in three ways first we did not identify previous studies of deficit irrigation that assign economic values to production risk in the context of water savings we develop a sd framework that links deficit irrigation production risk and water savings to limited irrigation practices this permits the definition of risk efficient credits that compensate farmers for risk bearing in addition to changes in expected returns second integrating economic principles and methods with outputs from crop growth models is an active area of research this enables the investigation of economic hypotheses that would otherwise be time or cost prohibitive to test using field trials we demonstrate the approach using a leading model to identify economic values associated with corn variability and cu savings from deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity last we provide empirical evidence for the effect of limited irrigation on economic risk and returns by undertaking an sd risk analysis of the simulation results we find that full irrigation maximizes returns minimizes risk and dominates limited irrigation in the absence of water credits limited irrigation decreases expected yields and increases yield variability but can become preferred to full irrigation if credits for cu savings are large enough to compensate farmers for risk bearing we compute breakeven risk efficient credit values the size of the credit and associated premiums depend on the risk profile of the irrigation practices and farmer risk preferences the premiums are large which helps to explain why some farmers may not share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for changes in expected income in the next section we present a conceptual framework for the risk analysis including the sd criteria that we employ to determine risk efficient water transfer credit values the third section describes the simulation methods the fourth section presents findings and discussion while the last section concludes the article 2 conceptual framework we consider a farmer in a semiarid environment who can choose to grow a crop under full irrigation f or limited irrigation d water management plans in this setting exogenous sources of moisture e g soil water precipitation are insufficient to achieve 100 e t c in an average rainfall year without supplemental irrigation 2 1 full and limited irrigation plans full irrigation plans f aim for 100 e t c using frequent irrigation applications throughout the growing season while maintaining expected soil moisture levels above a threshold denoted z to avoid water stress in practice the farmer uses an irrigation scheduling tool to determine the timing and depth of irrigation applications 3 3 an example is the water irrigation scheduler for efficient application wise a cloud based tool for irrigation scheduling 58 the tool tracks the expected level of soil moisture daily it considers soil e g fertility water storage capacity crop e g maturity rating days to harvest cultural practices climate and weather e g temperature precipitation and technological e g application efficiency application frequency surface area wetted factors when making irrigation recommendations 4 4 even in years when exogenous moisture occurs in sufficient quantities to meet e t c it may be inadequately timed to avoid periods of water stress and require supplemental irrigation both e t c and e t a will vary annually because the above factors also vary however under f expected actual crop evapotranspiration e e t a f will equal expected potential crop evapotranspiration e e t c f 5 5 see fig s1 in the supplementary materials sm file for an illustration of the soil water balance approach to irrigation scheduling limited irrigation plans d aim for less than 100 e t c this is achieved by intentionally letting expected soil moisture drop below z during the growing season the purposeful introduction of water stress reduces e e t a d below e e t c d but also lowers expected crop yields and can increase expected yield variance i e introduce greater production risk 35 in practice farmers implement d by adopting an agricultural water supply method e g split season irrigation deficit irrigation root zone drying early crop maturity 27 we offer examples of schedules for d in the next section 2 2 water sharing credits water sharing is one way for farmers to generate economic returns or credits for cu savings from switching to d and is the vehicle that we consider here the credits allow farmers to transfer or lease water savings to other water users the water available to share each year is equal to the expected cu savings we define the expected savings as e c u s d e e t c f e e t a d for example conditional on a historic consumptive use baseline a farmer can establish their maximum acreage for a crop under f in a given year using e e t c f and then calculate the expected cu savings from changing to d no cu savings are realized with f because e c u s f e e t c f e e t a f 0 actual irrigation schedules that produce expected cu savings under d will depend on the specific agricultural water supply method used for example a split season irrigation schedule is identical to f early in the season and terminates all future irrigations after a cutoff date deficit irrigation follows f for the whole growing season but reduces the depth of water applied by a factor θ 0 1 during crop growth stages that are tolerant to water stress soil moisture is generally highest in spring and root zone drying delays the start of summer irrigations by letting soil moisture fall below z before scheduled irrigations begin early maturing varieties allow for earlier harvest and can limit e t a relative to late maturing varieties if no evapotranspiration occurs after the harvest date a farmer considering d must consider the expected tradeoffs between reduced yield increased yield variability and cu savings this involves comparing the value of the forgone yield and cost of risk to additional revenue from water savings credits 2 3 stochastic dominance to analyze the role of risk we characterize the net returns to crop production under f and d using the probability distribution functions f y and d y respectively the distributions are unknown but sample information can be obtained from available data stochastic dominance provides a framework rooted in expected utility theory for ranking plans using this data without a priori information about farmer risk preferences as would be possible if their utility function u was known we first establish sd criteria for choosing between f y and d y in the absence of water savings credits first order sd fsd can be used to choose between the alternatives if increasing income makes the farmer better off i e they are insatiable in income u 0 but no other information is known about their risk preferences full irrigation will dominate limited irrigation by fsd if the condition 38 1 d y f y 0 f o r a l l y 0 holds with at least one strict inequality where f y and d y represent cumulative distribution functions cdfs for f y and d y respectively when fsd holds it is sufficient to imply that all farmers who are non satiated in income will at least weakly prefer f to d this criterion is appealing but in practice cdfs often cross in this case fsd cannot discriminate between the alternatives and relatively few plans may be eliminated from the risk efficient choice set second order sd ssd can be used to choose between alternatives if farmers are risk averse u 0 and insatiable in income u 0 under ssd full irrigation will dominate limited irrigation if the condition 38 2 l y d y f y d y 0 f o r a l l y holds with at least one strict inequality where l denotes the lower bound on crop returns when ssd holds it is sufficient to imply that all risk averse and non satiated farmers will at least weakly prefer f to d two alternative distribution functions may intersect but the cumulative difference between them must remain small such that l y d y f y d y stays non negative this criterion can eliminate more alternatives compared to fsd and most decision makers tend to be risk averse especially in agriculture we include fsd values in the results section below for comparison purposes but ssd provides the more useful information 2 4 credit values a non stochastic credit for water savings t will influence farmer irrigation plans if it is large enough to make d preferred to f 39 we evaluate and compare different approaches to determining breakeven values for t we begin by presuming that f is preferred to d without t and that no incentives exist for switching to d in absence of t a risk neutral farmer would switch to d whenever t plus the expected returns to d y just exceeds the expected return to f y in contrast when utility is a function of profit and risk a risk averse farmer would require a larger credit that also compensates for the cost of risk let y d i denote an element i in d y without the credit the credit will shift d y to the right such that the element becomes y d i t with the credit using sd criteria we identify lower t min and upper t max bounds on credit values that render d non dominated by f and weakly preferred to f respectively the value t min is the minimum credit at which d y is not strictly dominated by f y under fsd and ssd this value is 3 f s d t min f s d min i y f i y d i a n d s s d t min s s d min i y f i y d i i where f y and d y contain an identical number of m elements the elements are sorted in ascending order comparisons between distributions are done pairwise based on order statistics and y j i is the j th cumulative sum vector y j i k 1 i y j i for j f d and k order statistics the value t max is the minimum credit required to make d y at least weakly preferred to f y it is also the maximum credit where at least one element in f y is not strictly dominated by d y values for t max f s d and t max s s d are found using the same methods as eq 3 but replacing the min operator with max last a risk neutral rn farmer compares the expected values of the distributions the value t r n therefore represents the simple breakeven credit value it is calculated from the cumulative sum vector for the largest order statistic as 4 r n t r n y f m m y d m m and represents the credit value where the expected or average return for d y with the credit equals the expected return for f y we do not consider negative water savings credits and truncate minimum and maximum credits values at zero 2 5 graphical representation to provide practical insight we depict how the credits can incentivize a farmer to change from d to f fig 1 panel a illustrates hypothetical cdfs for full irrigation grey line and limited irrigation black line plans without credits the figure shows full irrigation with higher expected returns and lower return variability than limited irrigation as a result f y dominates d y under fsd and ssd in the absence of a credit because it lies everywhere to the right 6 6 we chose to illustrate this case because it aligns with our hypothesis that limited irrigation practices exhibit lower expected returns and greater return variability compared to full irrigation however limited irrigation can become preferred if t shifts d y to the right to better compete with f y a credit of t r n would be just sufficient to incentivize a risk neutral farmer to change to d from f because it is enough on average to compensate for the difference in expected returns panel b shows two additional cdfs for d y with water savings credits equal to t min f s d dotted line and t max f s d dashed line respectively the value t min f s d is the maximum credit at which f y remains weakly preferred to d y under fsd credits less than this amount would not incentivize a farmer to change to d from f the value t max f s d is the minimum credit at which d y is at least weakly preferred to f y under fsd and the farmer is indifferent between the plans for credit values between t m i n f s d and t max f s d the cdfs will cross and neither plan will be preferred under fsd credit values at or above t max f s d would incentivize the farmer to switch because it is sufficient to ensure that d y lies at or to the right of f y panel c depicts two more cdfs with water savings credits equal to t min s s d dotted line and t max s s d dashed line respectively the value t min s s d is the maximum credit at which f y remains weakly preferred to d y under ssd it is larger than t min f s d because ssd allows the distributions to cross as long as i f y begins to the right of d y and ii the area between the cdfs where f y is to the right of d y must be larger than the area where f y is to the left of d y credits less than t min s s d are too small to incentivize a risk averse farmer to change to d the value t max s s d is the minimum credit at which d y dominates f y under ssd for credit values between t min s s d and t max s s d neither dominates the other under ssd graphically this occurs where f y begins to the right of d y but they overlap and the area between cdfs where f y is to the right of d y just equals the area where f y is to the left of d y credit values at or above t m a x s s d can incentivize a risk averse farmer change to d from f for the depicted cdfs where d y has both a lower expected return and greater risk compared to f y this value occurs at the minimum pairwise ordered elements this implies t max f s d and t max s s d are identical in this scenario however our framework is robust in the sense that it can allow for a comparison of limited irrigation plans with any risk and return profile when working with edfs constructed from sample data as we do in case study below the pairwise elements at which the minimum and maximum distance between cdfs occur may differ from panel a finally this framework allows for scenarios where multiple limited irrigation alternatives exist for example our empirical application considers different combinations of irrigation technologies scheduling practices and crop maturities to be distinct limited irrigation plans 3 data and methods we illustrate the framework by analyzing water savings credits for limited irrigation corn production practices in a semiarid setting the south platte basin in northeastern colorado 3 1 full and limited irrigation plans we consider 216 water management plans that represent a full factorial design of all possible combinations of five experimental factors two levels of irrigation technology sprinkler irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation three levels of crop maturity early mid late season three levels of soil fertility low medium high three levels of soil water availability 50 60 70 and four levels of supplemental irrigation 40 60 80 and 100 of full irrigation table 1 27 27 41 42 42 describes these factors and defines the outcome variables of interest which are corn yield bushels acre e t a inches and economic returns acre the 216 plans include two full irrigation plans one each for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies and 214 limited irrigation plans 107 each for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies the full irrigation plans have the highest e e t a among all plans for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies respectively they are defined by the factor levels late crop maturity high soil fertility 70 soil moisture threshold and 100 supplemental irrigation the limited irrigation plans have relatively lower e e t a and generate cu savings 3 2 corn production simulations for the outcome variables of interest the data generating process follows three steps and produces 5832 irrigation schedules 216 plans 27 years in the study period first we develop 1458 initial schedules in aquacrop os 40 43 the initial schedules represent a full factorial design with all combinations of factors except irrigation level which is fixed at 100 54 plans 27 years 1458 observations we calibrate the results to climate and weather conditions for 1993 to 2019 at the subsurface irrigation efficiency project siep farm located within the study area near kersey co the location and period are selected based on the availability of colorado agricultural meteorological coagmet network data from the kersey 1 station near the siep farm 44 second for every initial schedule we develop three deficit schedules that use the identical irrigation frequency and timing but adjust the depth of water application by 80 60 and 40 of the full irrigation amounts respectively the deficit schedules only alter the irrigation depth during crop growth stages relatively tolerant to water stress they remain identical to their associated full irrigation schedules during the more sensitive crop growth stages like flowering and early seed set this iterative procedure produces the final dataset with 5832 observations third we import the 5832 irrigation schedules back into aquacrop os and simulate crop production under each plan we calculate the economic returns i e returns above costs that vary as corn yield bushels acre from the simulation multiplied by corn price bushel minus variable harvest bushel bushels acre variable fertilizer lb lbs acre and variable irrigation inch inches acre costs table 1 3 3 stochastic dominance implementation we conduct the sd analysis by comparing edfs that we construct from the simulation results the simulation results provide a discrete distribution for each combination of factor levels that is a time ordered vector of 27 annual return values following 39 45 we sort these original vectors in ascending order and bootstrap over order statistics to obtain smoothed edfs the bootstrapping involves repetitive sampling from the original vector with replacement each annual period is treated as a state of nature that is identically and independently distributed from other periods and equally likely to occur the final edfs in the results section below are smoothed using k 100 order statistics averaged over m 50 random draws from the original distribution vector 7 7 see fig s2 in the sm file for an illustration of the edf bootstrapping procedure given the smoothed edfs we implement the sd analysis as follows 38 for fsd f y is at least as good as d y if d 1 y k 0 for all y k where d 1 y k y d y i f y i y i y k for ssd f y is at least as good as d y if d 2 y k 0 for all y k where d 2 y k y d 1 y i 1 y i y i 1 y i y k 4 results and discussion we present the results in three sections first we summarize the relationship between limited irrigation practices crop yields and water use next we explore the effect of limited irrigation on crop return distributions last we present and discuss the water savings credit values that make each limited irrigation plan a risk efficient practice compared to full irrigation 4 1 crop yield limited irrigation and economic returns table 2 describes the simulation outcomes the primary variables of interest are corn yield e t a and economic returns the outcomes are influenced by two sources of variability the study factors and the climate and weather data when averaged across the study factors the yields and returns for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies appear similar however e t a is 2 4 in ac lower on average for the subsurface technology compared to sprinkler technology the other limited irrigation plans are also successful at reducing e t a for example the 80 60 and 40 irrigation plans achieve average e t a reductions of 0 6 1 4 and 2 4 in ac respectively root zone drying via lower soil moisture thresholds and early maturing crop varieties also reduce e t a by just over two inches per acre on average when comparing across levels within factors tradeoffs arise as these practices also reduce average yields and returns smaller tradeoffs 10 bu ac of yield and less than 50 ac occur when changing the irrigation level from 100 to 80 the soil moisture threshold from 70 to 60 and maturity from late to early larger tradeoffs occur when moving to other levels for those factors with yields falling by an additional 12 bu ac or more and gross margins falling by an additional 67 ac or more note that reducing soil fertility also results in lower e t a but the yield and return tradeoffs are much larger as compared to other factors 4 2 effect of limited irrigation practices on corn return distributions and risk the effect of limited irrigation on the distribution of returns to corn production without water savings credits is illustrated in figs 2 4 the effects are observed by comparing edfs for select limited irrigation plans to edfs for full irrigation in the figures the full irrigation edfs represent the most profitable and least risky combination of factor levels for sprinkler solid black line and subsurface solid grey line technologies respectively that is factor levels for the full irrigation edfs in figs 2 4 are held fixed at 100 irrigation 70 soil moisture full season maturity and high fertility the variation in returns for individual edfs is driven by variability in the weather and climate data in the simulation study visually full irrigation edfs for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies appear similar to one another and dominate the limited irrigation plans dashed black and grey lines for sprinkler and subsurface technologies respectively considered in each of the three figures under fsd and ssd because they lie always to the right without crossing fig 2 confirms our hypothesis that returns with full irrigation are much higher and less variable than returns with 60 irrigation for example full irrigation provides at least 800 acre over 70 of the time 804 acre for sprinkler and 811 acre for subsurface technologies respectively this is illustrated by the vertical line drawn at 800 acre which shows that full irrigation returns are less than 800 acre only 30 of the time i e the edf cumulative probabilities are approximately 0 30 when net returns are 800 at 60 irrigation the sprinkler and subsurface technologies deliver 800 acre only about 10 and 20 of the time respectively we do not show the other deficit factor levels in the figure but they follow a pattern like those shown the better performance of subsurface compared to sprinkler technology when 100 e t c is not met either due to planned deficits or below average precipitation is because no evaporation occurs fig 2 also shows that deficit irrigation introduces significant risk whereas full irrigation returns are always larger than deficit irrigation deficit irrigation performs increasingly worse at the lower tails of the distributions visually the lower end of the limited irrigation edfs appear to fan out away from the full irrigation edfs along the horizontal axis because the variation in returns for individual edfs depend on climate and weather variability return values at the upper tail of the distribution represent years with e t a at or near 100 e t c returns for full and limited irrigation are more similar in the best climate and weather years especially for subsurface technology this occurs because high precipitation compensates for the planned reduction in irrigation maintaining e t a at or near 100 e t c poor climate and weather years appear at the bottom of the distribution when e t a will be lower than e e t a even for full irrigation and returns will likewise be affected this accentuates the reality that deficit irrigation increases risk and downside risk in particular fig 3 compares full irrigation plans to limited irrigation plans that achieve water savings through root zone drying the soil water balance method examined in this research assumes a full soil water profile at the start of the growing season fig s1 in the sm file some irrigation is applied in early spring to help with establishment after that regular irrigations do not begin again for several weeks until the soil moisture levels drop below a threshold which we set at 70 for the full irrigation plans 46 root zone drying introduces water stress by lowering this threshold to 60 or 50 in our study which results in longer periods before the summer irrigations begin in fig 3 lowering the soil moisture threshold shifts the edfs to the left however in contrast to deficit irrigation the shift is larger for subsurface technology than sprinkler technology this result arises because subsurface plans use more frequent irrigation applications but with lower average application depths 47 see table s2 in the sm file root zone drying combined with subsurface technology increases the risk of persistently falling below the targeted soil moisture levels in poor climate and weather years this is explained by the use of more frequent irrigation applications that occur in smaller quantities with subsurface drip table s1 fig 4 compares full irrigation plans to limited irrigation plans that use early maturing crop varieties in this case the edfs for both plans follow a 100 irrigation schedule harvest occurs earlier for the limited irrigation plan with the early maturing variety and later for the full irrigation plan with the late season maturing variety early maturity results in a large shift in the edfs to the left suggesting that the yield penalty for this practice is large unlike deficit irrigation and root zone drying the curves also shift relatively uniformly therefore early maturity does not appear to affect the risk profile of crop return distributions the differences between the return distributions for the full and limited irrigation plans and downside risk in particular observed in figs 2 4 will hold implications for the value of water savings credits that are required to make the limited irrigation practices risk efficient 4 3 minimum and maximum credits for water savings full irrigation dominates limited irrigation under fsd and ssd without water savings credits so we compare and interpret different approaches to calculating credit values that make switching potentially attractive to farmers results are reported in table 3 the top half reports values per acre however because e c u s differs by limited irrigation factor and level we also report credit values per acre foot in the lower half of table 3 table 4 summarizes e c u s for each factor level of the limited irrigation alternatives for example 80 irrigation with sprinkler technology saves about 0 6 in ac per year and goes up to 3 4 in ac per year at 40 irrigation subsurface technology at 100 irrigation saves 2 1 in ac and goes up to 5 4 inches at 40 irrigation soil water threshold and early maturity offer lower savings on a per acre basis this causes some credit values to differ markedly on a per acre and per acre foot basis for example trn at 80 irrigation with sprinkler technology is 74 acre but over 1400 af because one acre foot of savings requires a land area of 20 acres at 0 6 in ac savings several important findings stand out in table 3 first credit values that just make a risk neutral farmer prefer the limited irrigation alternative t rn are nearly identical to credit values that just make a risk averse farmer indifferent t min s s d next for a risk averse farmer to at least weaky prefer limited irrigation credit values must increase to t max s s d which are generally much larger than trn we report a premium which represents the percent increase in t rn that is required to incentivize a risk averse farmer to change to limited irrigation the premiums are smaller for alternatives that have the smallest effect on risk e g 2 58 for the maturity factor and levels and larger for alternatives that most impact risk e g 58 167 for sprinkler technology and 73 307 with subsurface technology for the deficit irrigation factor and levels credits at this value are risk efficient in the sense that the limited irrigation alternatives begin to dominate full irrigation under ssd these findings support the graphical analysis in section 4 2 above which showed that deficit irrigation is more risk increasing for sprinkler technology than root zone drying the limited irrigation practices with the lowest per acre breakeven credit values for a risk averse farmer are switching to subsurface technology 13 ac using a 60 soil moisture threshold for root zone drying with sprinkler technology 51 ac and using a 60 soil moisture threshold for root zone drying or deficit irrigation at an 80 level with subsurface technology 82 83 ac with subsurface technology this leads to root zone drying becoming the rep alternative to full irrigation with sprinkler technology in contrast both deficit irrigation and root zone drying are reps for the subsurface technology when evaluated on a per acre foot of expected water savings basis the results become starker due to differences in the expected levels of water savings granted by each practice table 3 changing from sprinkler to subsurface technology also produces the lowest per acre foot credit value for a risk averse farmer at 74 af two limited irrigation practices with subsurface technology provide the next most risk efficient credit values at 351 af for root zone drying using a 60 soil moisture threshold and 369 af for deficit irrigation at an 80 irrigation level the lowest breakeven credit per acre foot for sprinkler technology is root zone drying with 60 soil moisture threshold at 765 af for comparison the northern colorado water conservancy district which operates in the study area leased 15 000 acre feet of irrigation water to agricultural users in 2020 at prices from 106 to 237 af 48 at the maximum price level of 237 af only water savings from subsurface technology could be viable but not when combined with deficit irrigation root zone drying or early maturity however larger credits could by paid by non agricultural water users e g municipal industrial who have higher water development costs and therefore incentivize farmers to adopt other water saving irrigation practices in the future ultimately the expected market price for water savings credits from limited irrigation would be expected to fall somewhere above the breakeven credit values reported here which set a price floor and below water users costs to develop alternative water supplies which set a price ceiling the results highlight the importance of production risk most notably the credit values required to incentivize limited irrigation for a risk averse farmer are much higher than those calculated under risk neutral preferences the results help explain why some farmers may not choose to share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for expected income changes the credit must provide the farmer with at least as much income as the saved water would provide from farming while also compensating them for production risk a further implication is that more efficient irrigation technologies like subsurface drip may facilitate the adoption of limited irrigation plans like deficit irrigation by making them more feasible to practice through greater control over irrigation water levels placement and monitoring and therefore better management of production risk this study however did not consider the installation cost or other fixed costs associated with changing to more efficient technologies policies that reduce barriers to the adoption of modern irrigation systems through cost share programs or subsidies may also help enable the adoption of broader practices that limited irrigation at more competitive credit values 49 the technical feasibility of modern irrigation technology with respect to issues like soil salinity management is also a concern for farmers and was not addressed in this research 5 summary and conclusions payments or credits for water savings in arid and semi arid climates can incentivize farmers to implement limited irrigation practices that jointly preserve the economic viability of irrigated agriculture and other societal water uses reducing the irrigation efficiency gap to evaluate farmer irrigation decisions and appropriately guide transfer credits it is necessary to understand the role of production risk this research contributes to the economic literature on limited irrigation practices and water transfers by considering increases in production risk we develop an sd framework for determining the credit values that make three limited irrigation practices deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity risk efficient alternatives to full irrigation with sprinkler and subsurface technologies under fsd and ssd criteria an empirical application to corn production in colorado s semi arid south platte basin shows the risk efficient credits required for incentivizing limited irrigation practices are much higher than those calculated under risk neutral assumptions a risk neutral producer would require a credit equal to 74 ac 267 ac and 393 ac to switch from full irrigation to 80 60 and 40 of full irrigation respectively with sprinkler technology and 48 ac 133 ac and 244 ac for those same levels with subsurface technology however a farmer with risk averse preferences under ssd would require credits that are higher by a magnitude of 58 307 depending on the irrigation level and type of technology on a cu savings basis this translates into much larger credit values for sprinkler technology at over 2300 af of cu savings for all levels of deficit irrigation with sprinkler technology however for subsurface the values are lower at 369 af of cu savings at an 80 irrigation level the rep for sprinkler technology was root zone drying however at 765 af with a 60 soil moisture threshold for subsurface technology the reps were root zone drying at 60 soil moisture at 351 af and deficit irrigation at the 80 irrigation level therefore the methodology developed here could be used to help guide policies and cost share programs that reduce barriers to adoption for modern irrigation technologies that may also help enable broader adoption of limited irrigation practices 49 while our empirical results reflect climate and weather conditions in northeastern colorado the methods and findings are highly relevant to other studies on similar topics whereas temporary transfers represent a case of planned deficit irrigation understanding the economics of deficit irrigation can also aid producers and policy makers in cases of unplanned deficit irrigation that arise due to exogenous irrigation restrictions like drought concern about the effects of deficit irrigation on the distribution of crop returns is valid however some level of deficit irrigation can become risk efficient when water credits compensate for forgone yields and changes in risk our empirical application demonstrates this approach but should only be interpreted as illustrative because the data are simulated the risk effects and credit values should be considered as general representations of the actual values that farmers will encounter the simulation also does not account for managerial expertise which could lead to different rankings on individual farms due to differences in irrigation and crop management experience or skill nevertheless the qualitative findings can contribute to ongoing policy discussions in at least two contexts in the state of colorado and semi arid u s west more generally the need to decrease water consumption in the colorado river basin by 2 4 million acre feet 50 and the need for collaborative sharing water agreements in eastern colorado to provide temporary water transfers from agricultural to non agricultural use in support of municipal and industrial uses 51 the results found in this study mirror other research findings on limited irrigation payments to induce water savings from deficit irrigation will need to be large ultimately adopting limited irrigation practices and modern irrigation technology is likely to be slow as long as technology to monitor soil water balances is expensive however technology can facilitate deficit or other limited water practices future research and implementation of practices to monitor soil water levels and irrigation consumption will likely serve as the catalyst for future adoption of limited irrigation methods our study has several limitations that could be addressed in future research first our approach considers a single irrigated crop but most irrigated farms in our study area produce multiple crops and manage multiple enterprises risk efficient responses to irrigation limitations and water sharing at the farm level as opposed to the field or parcel level may differ from the findings reported here the conceptual and methodological frameworks could be extended to consider crop rotations and different enterprises using an sd portfolio approach 39 second the sd methodology is motivated by expected utility theory but these preferences may not always accurately reflect farmer decision making alternative approaches like prospect theory have been recently applied to farm decisions 52 54 and this approach could also be used to analyze water sharing credits and compared to the results in this paper third this research only considers the effects of production risk prices and costs are effectively treated as constants to focus on changes in a narrow set of variables under ceteris paribus type conditions the sd methodology could be extended to consider net return distributions that reflect price and production risk that are present in the study area the same holds true for other risk dimensions that contribute to the economic viability of farmers and farming e g human risk financial risk 55 last there is little agreement about precisely how producers interpret and use information to make irrigation decisions 56 57 and especially risk 36 for example producer adoption of efficient irrigation systems does not appear to result in appreciable overall reduction in water consumption in practice at the basin level a phenomenon known as an irrigation efficiency gap 10 explain that this paradox is partly a problem of insufficient understanding by decision makers about basin wide water accounting validation of tradeoffs risk and uncertainty and understanding producer incentives future research could address the role of modern irrigation technology in the development of water accounting and tracking systems that also address the efficiency gap acknowledgments this work was supported

8646,as farmers in semiarid climates seek new ways of adding value to their operations those with irrigation water rights are increasingly receptive to payments or credits for water sharing yet past research on the economic feasibility of limited irrigation strategies for consumptive use cu savings seldom considers production risk using stochastic dominance we compare the effect of three limited irrigation practices deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity on the returns to corn production for sprinkler and subsurface technology field level simulations show that the practices reduce returns and increase risk but credits for cu savings could make them economically viable for farmers larger credits more money incentivize limited irrigation at greater levels less yield and more risk but fully compensating farmers for risk bearing will be costly with sprinkler technology root zone drying becomes risk efficient at lower credit values than deficit irrigation deficit irrigation along with root zone drying become risk efficient at the lowest credit values for subsurface technology thus risk aversion could explain why some farmers choose not to share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for differences in expected returns improved knowledge about the profitability and risk of limited irrigation practices can increase the joint sustainability of irrigated agriculture and other societal water uses keywords consumptive use corn deficit irrigation risk aversion stochastic dominance water sharing jel classification q12 q15 q25 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as world populations contend with future water challenges agricultural water management in arid and semiarid areas consistently ranks as a top policy concern 1 2 in particular water transfers between the agricultural and non agricultural sectors are expected to play a central role in meeting future demand 3 4 historically transfers between these sectors were permanent and relied on buy and dry practices that decoupled water rights from the land for conveyance elsewhere 5 6 more recently water stakeholders have proposed novel solutions called collaborative water sharing agreements 1 1 collaborative water sharing agreements are also referred to as alternative transfer methods but the former term is now preferred 8 that enable temporary transfers while ensuring that the water right stays attached to the original land parcel 7 the importance of this approach is frequently highlighted for example the state of colorado s forthcoming 2023 water plan update calls for expanding these collaborative agreements 8 since agriculture has been and will continue to be the largest water user in many regions agricultural managers face increased pressure to embrace flexible on farm water management systems 9 10 such systems seek to modernize irrigation technology and could facilitate the broader adoption of limited irrigation practices by offering greater control monitoring and efficiency over crop water delivery limited irrigation practices achieve on farm consumptive use cu savings by reducing actual crop evapotranspiration e t a below potential crop evapotranspiration e t c where e t c is the amount of water to satisfy expected plant needs they can benefit farmers and society in several ways first they can enable the diversion of cu savings to alternative societal water uses under planned scenarios like collaborative water sharing agreements 11 12 2 2 on farm irrigation efficiency gains alone however are insufficient to ensure increased overall water availability improvements in efficiency must also be accompanied by basin wide water accounting and measurement systems and caps on total extraction 10 second they can aid producers and other stakeholders in responding to unplanned scenarios like water shortages due to drought 13 14 as farmers in arid and semiarid regions search for new ways to add value to their operations they are increasingly receptive to financial credits for water sharing 15 16 credits could be manifested through direct or indirect payments cost savings or kept for future water use our focus is on credit values that make limited irrigation practices attractive to farmers not on how those credits might be paid in semiarid regions where soil water and precipitation are insufficient to meet e t c limited irrigation practices often involve irrigation reductions however more efficient irrigation technology like subsurface drip 17 18 irrigation scheduling modifications like root zone drying i e wait to start summer irrigations until soil moisture drops below a given threshold 19 20 or early maturing varieties 21 are other strategies farmers may consider using to limit irrigation deficit irrigation is one practice under evaluation for water savings 22 23 it achieves cu savings by applying less irrigation water than is required for 100 e t c when other sources of moisture are limiting e g precipitation soil water 24 25 deficit irrigation reduces yields but credits could offset the forgone returns 26 less well understood is how deficit irrigation affects yield variability and how this variability interacts with other factors that influence cu and profitability like irrigation technology crop maturity and irrigation scheduling 27 we examine the question when are credits for on farm water savings from limited irrigation practices profitable for farmers there are many studies about the economics of deficit irrigation for example 28 estimates the functional relationship between e t a and corn yields and determines the relative water price at which deficit irrigation becomes feasible 29 examines how water leasing and deficit irrigation contribute to improved streamflow most of these studies do not explicitly consider changes in yield variability or other forms of risk yet the importance of risk in decision making has been extensively proven in the literature e g 30 and an expansive cadre of risk management methods to examine agricultural systems like deficit irrigation have been developed e g 31 a risk neutral farmer would evaluate the simple breakeven condition and require a credit that is at least equal to the difference in expected returns between full and limited irrigation methods however if limited irrigation increases production risk a risk averse farmer will require a premium that is in addition to the simple breakeven value conceptually risk analyses compare risk and returns simultaneously for different alternatives and assign preferences for tradeoffs between those attributes to individuals or groups for example 32 link an agro hydrological model with an economic risk model to look at efficient preseason management strategies 33 examine uncertainty in water supply and risk preferences three studies conduct farmer level risk analyses related to irrigation but not in the context of limited irrigation and water sharing 34 36 methodologically risk analyses differ based on risk preference assumptions some approaches like stochastic efficiency with respect to a function assign utility functions that impose structure on risk preferences 37 other approaches like stochastic dominance sd do not impose structure and are flexible for evaluating potentially important features like downside risk 38 here we apply sd to look at the risk and returns of limited irrigation practices compared to full irrigation sd was chosen because it works well both functionally and conceptually with the concept of payments or credits 39 and because it can be used without a priori knowledge about farmers risk preferences the objectives of this study are to i analyze the effect of limited irrigation practices on the distribution of net returns to crop production and ii use sd to determine the value of water savings credits that jointly considering risk and returns would provide financial incentive for a farmer to switch to limited irrigation for this research we refer to the limited irrigation practice with the lowest credit value smallest cost incentive the risk efficient practice rep the practices that we consider for both sprinkler and subsurface irrigation technology include irrigation level root zone drying and early maturing crop varieties empirical cumulative distribution functions edfs are simulated for corn production using weather and climate conditions representative of the south platte basin using aquacrop os 40 and then used in the sd analysis to determine breakeven credit values for a farmer with risk neutral and risk averse preferences respectively this research contributes to literature on the economic feasibility of on farm limited irrigation practices in three ways first we did not identify previous studies of deficit irrigation that assign economic values to production risk in the context of water savings we develop a sd framework that links deficit irrigation production risk and water savings to limited irrigation practices this permits the definition of risk efficient credits that compensate farmers for risk bearing in addition to changes in expected returns second integrating economic principles and methods with outputs from crop growth models is an active area of research this enables the investigation of economic hypotheses that would otherwise be time or cost prohibitive to test using field trials we demonstrate the approach using a leading model to identify economic values associated with corn variability and cu savings from deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity last we provide empirical evidence for the effect of limited irrigation on economic risk and returns by undertaking an sd risk analysis of the simulation results we find that full irrigation maximizes returns minimizes risk and dominates limited irrigation in the absence of water credits limited irrigation decreases expected yields and increases yield variability but can become preferred to full irrigation if credits for cu savings are large enough to compensate farmers for risk bearing we compute breakeven risk efficient credit values the size of the credit and associated premiums depend on the risk profile of the irrigation practices and farmer risk preferences the premiums are large which helps to explain why some farmers may not share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for changes in expected income in the next section we present a conceptual framework for the risk analysis including the sd criteria that we employ to determine risk efficient water transfer credit values the third section describes the simulation methods the fourth section presents findings and discussion while the last section concludes the article 2 conceptual framework we consider a farmer in a semiarid environment who can choose to grow a crop under full irrigation f or limited irrigation d water management plans in this setting exogenous sources of moisture e g soil water precipitation are insufficient to achieve 100 e t c in an average rainfall year without supplemental irrigation 2 1 full and limited irrigation plans full irrigation plans f aim for 100 e t c using frequent irrigation applications throughout the growing season while maintaining expected soil moisture levels above a threshold denoted z to avoid water stress in practice the farmer uses an irrigation scheduling tool to determine the timing and depth of irrigation applications 3 3 an example is the water irrigation scheduler for efficient application wise a cloud based tool for irrigation scheduling 58 the tool tracks the expected level of soil moisture daily it considers soil e g fertility water storage capacity crop e g maturity rating days to harvest cultural practices climate and weather e g temperature precipitation and technological e g application efficiency application frequency surface area wetted factors when making irrigation recommendations 4 4 even in years when exogenous moisture occurs in sufficient quantities to meet e t c it may be inadequately timed to avoid periods of water stress and require supplemental irrigation both e t c and e t a will vary annually because the above factors also vary however under f expected actual crop evapotranspiration e e t a f will equal expected potential crop evapotranspiration e e t c f 5 5 see fig s1 in the supplementary materials sm file for an illustration of the soil water balance approach to irrigation scheduling limited irrigation plans d aim for less than 100 e t c this is achieved by intentionally letting expected soil moisture drop below z during the growing season the purposeful introduction of water stress reduces e e t a d below e e t c d but also lowers expected crop yields and can increase expected yield variance i e introduce greater production risk 35 in practice farmers implement d by adopting an agricultural water supply method e g split season irrigation deficit irrigation root zone drying early crop maturity 27 we offer examples of schedules for d in the next section 2 2 water sharing credits water sharing is one way for farmers to generate economic returns or credits for cu savings from switching to d and is the vehicle that we consider here the credits allow farmers to transfer or lease water savings to other water users the water available to share each year is equal to the expected cu savings we define the expected savings as e c u s d e e t c f e e t a d for example conditional on a historic consumptive use baseline a farmer can establish their maximum acreage for a crop under f in a given year using e e t c f and then calculate the expected cu savings from changing to d no cu savings are realized with f because e c u s f e e t c f e e t a f 0 actual irrigation schedules that produce expected cu savings under d will depend on the specific agricultural water supply method used for example a split season irrigation schedule is identical to f early in the season and terminates all future irrigations after a cutoff date deficit irrigation follows f for the whole growing season but reduces the depth of water applied by a factor θ 0 1 during crop growth stages that are tolerant to water stress soil moisture is generally highest in spring and root zone drying delays the start of summer irrigations by letting soil moisture fall below z before scheduled irrigations begin early maturing varieties allow for earlier harvest and can limit e t a relative to late maturing varieties if no evapotranspiration occurs after the harvest date a farmer considering d must consider the expected tradeoffs between reduced yield increased yield variability and cu savings this involves comparing the value of the forgone yield and cost of risk to additional revenue from water savings credits 2 3 stochastic dominance to analyze the role of risk we characterize the net returns to crop production under f and d using the probability distribution functions f y and d y respectively the distributions are unknown but sample information can be obtained from available data stochastic dominance provides a framework rooted in expected utility theory for ranking plans using this data without a priori information about farmer risk preferences as would be possible if their utility function u was known we first establish sd criteria for choosing between f y and d y in the absence of water savings credits first order sd fsd can be used to choose between the alternatives if increasing income makes the farmer better off i e they are insatiable in income u 0 but no other information is known about their risk preferences full irrigation will dominate limited irrigation by fsd if the condition 38 1 d y f y 0 f o r a l l y 0 holds with at least one strict inequality where f y and d y represent cumulative distribution functions cdfs for f y and d y respectively when fsd holds it is sufficient to imply that all farmers who are non satiated in income will at least weakly prefer f to d this criterion is appealing but in practice cdfs often cross in this case fsd cannot discriminate between the alternatives and relatively few plans may be eliminated from the risk efficient choice set second order sd ssd can be used to choose between alternatives if farmers are risk averse u 0 and insatiable in income u 0 under ssd full irrigation will dominate limited irrigation if the condition 38 2 l y d y f y d y 0 f o r a l l y holds with at least one strict inequality where l denotes the lower bound on crop returns when ssd holds it is sufficient to imply that all risk averse and non satiated farmers will at least weakly prefer f to d two alternative distribution functions may intersect but the cumulative difference between them must remain small such that l y d y f y d y stays non negative this criterion can eliminate more alternatives compared to fsd and most decision makers tend to be risk averse especially in agriculture we include fsd values in the results section below for comparison purposes but ssd provides the more useful information 2 4 credit values a non stochastic credit for water savings t will influence farmer irrigation plans if it is large enough to make d preferred to f 39 we evaluate and compare different approaches to determining breakeven values for t we begin by presuming that f is preferred to d without t and that no incentives exist for switching to d in absence of t a risk neutral farmer would switch to d whenever t plus the expected returns to d y just exceeds the expected return to f y in contrast when utility is a function of profit and risk a risk averse farmer would require a larger credit that also compensates for the cost of risk let y d i denote an element i in d y without the credit the credit will shift d y to the right such that the element becomes y d i t with the credit using sd criteria we identify lower t min and upper t max bounds on credit values that render d non dominated by f and weakly preferred to f respectively the value t min is the minimum credit at which d y is not strictly dominated by f y under fsd and ssd this value is 3 f s d t min f s d min i y f i y d i a n d s s d t min s s d min i y f i y d i i where f y and d y contain an identical number of m elements the elements are sorted in ascending order comparisons between distributions are done pairwise based on order statistics and y j i is the j th cumulative sum vector y j i k 1 i y j i for j f d and k order statistics the value t max is the minimum credit required to make d y at least weakly preferred to f y it is also the maximum credit where at least one element in f y is not strictly dominated by d y values for t max f s d and t max s s d are found using the same methods as eq 3 but replacing the min operator with max last a risk neutral rn farmer compares the expected values of the distributions the value t r n therefore represents the simple breakeven credit value it is calculated from the cumulative sum vector for the largest order statistic as 4 r n t r n y f m m y d m m and represents the credit value where the expected or average return for d y with the credit equals the expected return for f y we do not consider negative water savings credits and truncate minimum and maximum credits values at zero 2 5 graphical representation to provide practical insight we depict how the credits can incentivize a farmer to change from d to f fig 1 panel a illustrates hypothetical cdfs for full irrigation grey line and limited irrigation black line plans without credits the figure shows full irrigation with higher expected returns and lower return variability than limited irrigation as a result f y dominates d y under fsd and ssd in the absence of a credit because it lies everywhere to the right 6 6 we chose to illustrate this case because it aligns with our hypothesis that limited irrigation practices exhibit lower expected returns and greater return variability compared to full irrigation however limited irrigation can become preferred if t shifts d y to the right to better compete with f y a credit of t r n would be just sufficient to incentivize a risk neutral farmer to change to d from f because it is enough on average to compensate for the difference in expected returns panel b shows two additional cdfs for d y with water savings credits equal to t min f s d dotted line and t max f s d dashed line respectively the value t min f s d is the maximum credit at which f y remains weakly preferred to d y under fsd credits less than this amount would not incentivize a farmer to change to d from f the value t max f s d is the minimum credit at which d y is at least weakly preferred to f y under fsd and the farmer is indifferent between the plans for credit values between t m i n f s d and t max f s d the cdfs will cross and neither plan will be preferred under fsd credit values at or above t max f s d would incentivize the farmer to switch because it is sufficient to ensure that d y lies at or to the right of f y panel c depicts two more cdfs with water savings credits equal to t min s s d dotted line and t max s s d dashed line respectively the value t min s s d is the maximum credit at which f y remains weakly preferred to d y under ssd it is larger than t min f s d because ssd allows the distributions to cross as long as i f y begins to the right of d y and ii the area between the cdfs where f y is to the right of d y must be larger than the area where f y is to the left of d y credits less than t min s s d are too small to incentivize a risk averse farmer to change to d the value t max s s d is the minimum credit at which d y dominates f y under ssd for credit values between t min s s d and t max s s d neither dominates the other under ssd graphically this occurs where f y begins to the right of d y but they overlap and the area between cdfs where f y is to the right of d y just equals the area where f y is to the left of d y credit values at or above t m a x s s d can incentivize a risk averse farmer change to d from f for the depicted cdfs where d y has both a lower expected return and greater risk compared to f y this value occurs at the minimum pairwise ordered elements this implies t max f s d and t max s s d are identical in this scenario however our framework is robust in the sense that it can allow for a comparison of limited irrigation plans with any risk and return profile when working with edfs constructed from sample data as we do in case study below the pairwise elements at which the minimum and maximum distance between cdfs occur may differ from panel a finally this framework allows for scenarios where multiple limited irrigation alternatives exist for example our empirical application considers different combinations of irrigation technologies scheduling practices and crop maturities to be distinct limited irrigation plans 3 data and methods we illustrate the framework by analyzing water savings credits for limited irrigation corn production practices in a semiarid setting the south platte basin in northeastern colorado 3 1 full and limited irrigation plans we consider 216 water management plans that represent a full factorial design of all possible combinations of five experimental factors two levels of irrigation technology sprinkler irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation three levels of crop maturity early mid late season three levels of soil fertility low medium high three levels of soil water availability 50 60 70 and four levels of supplemental irrigation 40 60 80 and 100 of full irrigation table 1 27 27 41 42 42 describes these factors and defines the outcome variables of interest which are corn yield bushels acre e t a inches and economic returns acre the 216 plans include two full irrigation plans one each for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies and 214 limited irrigation plans 107 each for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies the full irrigation plans have the highest e e t a among all plans for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies respectively they are defined by the factor levels late crop maturity high soil fertility 70 soil moisture threshold and 100 supplemental irrigation the limited irrigation plans have relatively lower e e t a and generate cu savings 3 2 corn production simulations for the outcome variables of interest the data generating process follows three steps and produces 5832 irrigation schedules 216 plans 27 years in the study period first we develop 1458 initial schedules in aquacrop os 40 43 the initial schedules represent a full factorial design with all combinations of factors except irrigation level which is fixed at 100 54 plans 27 years 1458 observations we calibrate the results to climate and weather conditions for 1993 to 2019 at the subsurface irrigation efficiency project siep farm located within the study area near kersey co the location and period are selected based on the availability of colorado agricultural meteorological coagmet network data from the kersey 1 station near the siep farm 44 second for every initial schedule we develop three deficit schedules that use the identical irrigation frequency and timing but adjust the depth of water application by 80 60 and 40 of the full irrigation amounts respectively the deficit schedules only alter the irrigation depth during crop growth stages relatively tolerant to water stress they remain identical to their associated full irrigation schedules during the more sensitive crop growth stages like flowering and early seed set this iterative procedure produces the final dataset with 5832 observations third we import the 5832 irrigation schedules back into aquacrop os and simulate crop production under each plan we calculate the economic returns i e returns above costs that vary as corn yield bushels acre from the simulation multiplied by corn price bushel minus variable harvest bushel bushels acre variable fertilizer lb lbs acre and variable irrigation inch inches acre costs table 1 3 3 stochastic dominance implementation we conduct the sd analysis by comparing edfs that we construct from the simulation results the simulation results provide a discrete distribution for each combination of factor levels that is a time ordered vector of 27 annual return values following 39 45 we sort these original vectors in ascending order and bootstrap over order statistics to obtain smoothed edfs the bootstrapping involves repetitive sampling from the original vector with replacement each annual period is treated as a state of nature that is identically and independently distributed from other periods and equally likely to occur the final edfs in the results section below are smoothed using k 100 order statistics averaged over m 50 random draws from the original distribution vector 7 7 see fig s2 in the sm file for an illustration of the edf bootstrapping procedure given the smoothed edfs we implement the sd analysis as follows 38 for fsd f y is at least as good as d y if d 1 y k 0 for all y k where d 1 y k y d y i f y i y i y k for ssd f y is at least as good as d y if d 2 y k 0 for all y k where d 2 y k y d 1 y i 1 y i y i 1 y i y k 4 results and discussion we present the results in three sections first we summarize the relationship between limited irrigation practices crop yields and water use next we explore the effect of limited irrigation on crop return distributions last we present and discuss the water savings credit values that make each limited irrigation plan a risk efficient practice compared to full irrigation 4 1 crop yield limited irrigation and economic returns table 2 describes the simulation outcomes the primary variables of interest are corn yield e t a and economic returns the outcomes are influenced by two sources of variability the study factors and the climate and weather data when averaged across the study factors the yields and returns for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies appear similar however e t a is 2 4 in ac lower on average for the subsurface technology compared to sprinkler technology the other limited irrigation plans are also successful at reducing e t a for example the 80 60 and 40 irrigation plans achieve average e t a reductions of 0 6 1 4 and 2 4 in ac respectively root zone drying via lower soil moisture thresholds and early maturing crop varieties also reduce e t a by just over two inches per acre on average when comparing across levels within factors tradeoffs arise as these practices also reduce average yields and returns smaller tradeoffs 10 bu ac of yield and less than 50 ac occur when changing the irrigation level from 100 to 80 the soil moisture threshold from 70 to 60 and maturity from late to early larger tradeoffs occur when moving to other levels for those factors with yields falling by an additional 12 bu ac or more and gross margins falling by an additional 67 ac or more note that reducing soil fertility also results in lower e t a but the yield and return tradeoffs are much larger as compared to other factors 4 2 effect of limited irrigation practices on corn return distributions and risk the effect of limited irrigation on the distribution of returns to corn production without water savings credits is illustrated in figs 2 4 the effects are observed by comparing edfs for select limited irrigation plans to edfs for full irrigation in the figures the full irrigation edfs represent the most profitable and least risky combination of factor levels for sprinkler solid black line and subsurface solid grey line technologies respectively that is factor levels for the full irrigation edfs in figs 2 4 are held fixed at 100 irrigation 70 soil moisture full season maturity and high fertility the variation in returns for individual edfs is driven by variability in the weather and climate data in the simulation study visually full irrigation edfs for the sprinkler and subsurface technologies appear similar to one another and dominate the limited irrigation plans dashed black and grey lines for sprinkler and subsurface technologies respectively considered in each of the three figures under fsd and ssd because they lie always to the right without crossing fig 2 confirms our hypothesis that returns with full irrigation are much higher and less variable than returns with 60 irrigation for example full irrigation provides at least 800 acre over 70 of the time 804 acre for sprinkler and 811 acre for subsurface technologies respectively this is illustrated by the vertical line drawn at 800 acre which shows that full irrigation returns are less than 800 acre only 30 of the time i e the edf cumulative probabilities are approximately 0 30 when net returns are 800 at 60 irrigation the sprinkler and subsurface technologies deliver 800 acre only about 10 and 20 of the time respectively we do not show the other deficit factor levels in the figure but they follow a pattern like those shown the better performance of subsurface compared to sprinkler technology when 100 e t c is not met either due to planned deficits or below average precipitation is because no evaporation occurs fig 2 also shows that deficit irrigation introduces significant risk whereas full irrigation returns are always larger than deficit irrigation deficit irrigation performs increasingly worse at the lower tails of the distributions visually the lower end of the limited irrigation edfs appear to fan out away from the full irrigation edfs along the horizontal axis because the variation in returns for individual edfs depend on climate and weather variability return values at the upper tail of the distribution represent years with e t a at or near 100 e t c returns for full and limited irrigation are more similar in the best climate and weather years especially for subsurface technology this occurs because high precipitation compensates for the planned reduction in irrigation maintaining e t a at or near 100 e t c poor climate and weather years appear at the bottom of the distribution when e t a will be lower than e e t a even for full irrigation and returns will likewise be affected this accentuates the reality that deficit irrigation increases risk and downside risk in particular fig 3 compares full irrigation plans to limited irrigation plans that achieve water savings through root zone drying the soil water balance method examined in this research assumes a full soil water profile at the start of the growing season fig s1 in the sm file some irrigation is applied in early spring to help with establishment after that regular irrigations do not begin again for several weeks until the soil moisture levels drop below a threshold which we set at 70 for the full irrigation plans 46 root zone drying introduces water stress by lowering this threshold to 60 or 50 in our study which results in longer periods before the summer irrigations begin in fig 3 lowering the soil moisture threshold shifts the edfs to the left however in contrast to deficit irrigation the shift is larger for subsurface technology than sprinkler technology this result arises because subsurface plans use more frequent irrigation applications but with lower average application depths 47 see table s2 in the sm file root zone drying combined with subsurface technology increases the risk of persistently falling below the targeted soil moisture levels in poor climate and weather years this is explained by the use of more frequent irrigation applications that occur in smaller quantities with subsurface drip table s1 fig 4 compares full irrigation plans to limited irrigation plans that use early maturing crop varieties in this case the edfs for both plans follow a 100 irrigation schedule harvest occurs earlier for the limited irrigation plan with the early maturing variety and later for the full irrigation plan with the late season maturing variety early maturity results in a large shift in the edfs to the left suggesting that the yield penalty for this practice is large unlike deficit irrigation and root zone drying the curves also shift relatively uniformly therefore early maturity does not appear to affect the risk profile of crop return distributions the differences between the return distributions for the full and limited irrigation plans and downside risk in particular observed in figs 2 4 will hold implications for the value of water savings credits that are required to make the limited irrigation practices risk efficient 4 3 minimum and maximum credits for water savings full irrigation dominates limited irrigation under fsd and ssd without water savings credits so we compare and interpret different approaches to calculating credit values that make switching potentially attractive to farmers results are reported in table 3 the top half reports values per acre however because e c u s differs by limited irrigation factor and level we also report credit values per acre foot in the lower half of table 3 table 4 summarizes e c u s for each factor level of the limited irrigation alternatives for example 80 irrigation with sprinkler technology saves about 0 6 in ac per year and goes up to 3 4 in ac per year at 40 irrigation subsurface technology at 100 irrigation saves 2 1 in ac and goes up to 5 4 inches at 40 irrigation soil water threshold and early maturity offer lower savings on a per acre basis this causes some credit values to differ markedly on a per acre and per acre foot basis for example trn at 80 irrigation with sprinkler technology is 74 acre but over 1400 af because one acre foot of savings requires a land area of 20 acres at 0 6 in ac savings several important findings stand out in table 3 first credit values that just make a risk neutral farmer prefer the limited irrigation alternative t rn are nearly identical to credit values that just make a risk averse farmer indifferent t min s s d next for a risk averse farmer to at least weaky prefer limited irrigation credit values must increase to t max s s d which are generally much larger than trn we report a premium which represents the percent increase in t rn that is required to incentivize a risk averse farmer to change to limited irrigation the premiums are smaller for alternatives that have the smallest effect on risk e g 2 58 for the maturity factor and levels and larger for alternatives that most impact risk e g 58 167 for sprinkler technology and 73 307 with subsurface technology for the deficit irrigation factor and levels credits at this value are risk efficient in the sense that the limited irrigation alternatives begin to dominate full irrigation under ssd these findings support the graphical analysis in section 4 2 above which showed that deficit irrigation is more risk increasing for sprinkler technology than root zone drying the limited irrigation practices with the lowest per acre breakeven credit values for a risk averse farmer are switching to subsurface technology 13 ac using a 60 soil moisture threshold for root zone drying with sprinkler technology 51 ac and using a 60 soil moisture threshold for root zone drying or deficit irrigation at an 80 level with subsurface technology 82 83 ac with subsurface technology this leads to root zone drying becoming the rep alternative to full irrigation with sprinkler technology in contrast both deficit irrigation and root zone drying are reps for the subsurface technology when evaluated on a per acre foot of expected water savings basis the results become starker due to differences in the expected levels of water savings granted by each practice table 3 changing from sprinkler to subsurface technology also produces the lowest per acre foot credit value for a risk averse farmer at 74 af two limited irrigation practices with subsurface technology provide the next most risk efficient credit values at 351 af for root zone drying using a 60 soil moisture threshold and 369 af for deficit irrigation at an 80 irrigation level the lowest breakeven credit per acre foot for sprinkler technology is root zone drying with 60 soil moisture threshold at 765 af for comparison the northern colorado water conservancy district which operates in the study area leased 15 000 acre feet of irrigation water to agricultural users in 2020 at prices from 106 to 237 af 48 at the maximum price level of 237 af only water savings from subsurface technology could be viable but not when combined with deficit irrigation root zone drying or early maturity however larger credits could by paid by non agricultural water users e g municipal industrial who have higher water development costs and therefore incentivize farmers to adopt other water saving irrigation practices in the future ultimately the expected market price for water savings credits from limited irrigation would be expected to fall somewhere above the breakeven credit values reported here which set a price floor and below water users costs to develop alternative water supplies which set a price ceiling the results highlight the importance of production risk most notably the credit values required to incentivize limited irrigation for a risk averse farmer are much higher than those calculated under risk neutral preferences the results help explain why some farmers may not choose to share water even when credits are large enough on average to compensate for expected income changes the credit must provide the farmer with at least as much income as the saved water would provide from farming while also compensating them for production risk a further implication is that more efficient irrigation technologies like subsurface drip may facilitate the adoption of limited irrigation plans like deficit irrigation by making them more feasible to practice through greater control over irrigation water levels placement and monitoring and therefore better management of production risk this study however did not consider the installation cost or other fixed costs associated with changing to more efficient technologies policies that reduce barriers to the adoption of modern irrigation systems through cost share programs or subsidies may also help enable the adoption of broader practices that limited irrigation at more competitive credit values 49 the technical feasibility of modern irrigation technology with respect to issues like soil salinity management is also a concern for farmers and was not addressed in this research 5 summary and conclusions payments or credits for water savings in arid and semi arid climates can incentivize farmers to implement limited irrigation practices that jointly preserve the economic viability of irrigated agriculture and other societal water uses reducing the irrigation efficiency gap to evaluate farmer irrigation decisions and appropriately guide transfer credits it is necessary to understand the role of production risk this research contributes to the economic literature on limited irrigation practices and water transfers by considering increases in production risk we develop an sd framework for determining the credit values that make three limited irrigation practices deficit irrigation root zone drying and early crop maturity risk efficient alternatives to full irrigation with sprinkler and subsurface technologies under fsd and ssd criteria an empirical application to corn production in colorado s semi arid south platte basin shows the risk efficient credits required for incentivizing limited irrigation practices are much higher than those calculated under risk neutral assumptions a risk neutral producer would require a credit equal to 74 ac 267 ac and 393 ac to switch from full irrigation to 80 60 and 40 of full irrigation respectively with sprinkler technology and 48 ac 133 ac and 244 ac for those same levels with subsurface technology however a farmer with risk averse preferences under ssd would require credits that are higher by a magnitude of 58 307 depending on the irrigation level and type of technology on a cu savings basis this translates into much larger credit values for sprinkler technology at over 2300 af of cu savings for all levels of deficit irrigation with sprinkler technology however for subsurface the values are lower at 369 af of cu savings at an 80 irrigation level the rep for sprinkler technology was root zone drying however at 765 af with a 60 soil moisture threshold for subsurface technology the reps were root zone drying at 60 soil moisture at 351 af and deficit irrigation at the 80 irrigation level therefore the methodology developed here could be used to help guide policies and cost share programs that reduce barriers to adoption for modern irrigation technologies that may also help enable broader adoption of limited irrigation practices 49 while our empirical results reflect climate and weather conditions in northeastern colorado the methods and findings are highly relevant to other studies on similar topics whereas temporary transfers represent a case of planned deficit irrigation understanding the economics of deficit irrigation can also aid producers and policy makers in cases of unplanned deficit irrigation that arise due to exogenous irrigation restrictions like drought concern about the effects of deficit irrigation on the distribution of crop returns is valid however some level of deficit irrigation can become risk efficient when water credits compensate for forgone yields and changes in risk our empirical application demonstrates this approach but should only be interpreted as illustrative because the data are simulated the risk effects and credit values should be considered as general representations of the actual values that farmers will encounter the simulation also does not account for managerial expertise which could lead to different rankings on individual farms due to differences in irrigation and crop management experience or skill nevertheless the qualitative findings can contribute to ongoing policy discussions in at least two contexts in the state of colorado and semi arid u s west more generally the need to decrease water consumption in the colorado river basin by 2 4 million acre feet 50 and the need for collaborative sharing water agreements in eastern colorado to provide temporary water transfers from agricultural to non agricultural use in support of municipal and industrial uses 51 the results found in this study mirror other research findings on limited irrigation payments to induce water savings from deficit irrigation will need to be large ultimately adopting limited irrigation practices and modern irrigation technology is likely to be slow as long as technology to monitor soil water balances is expensive however technology can facilitate deficit or other limited water practices future research and implementation of practices to monitor soil water levels and irrigation consumption will likely serve as the catalyst for future adoption of limited irrigation methods our study has several limitations that could be addressed in future research first our approach considers a single irrigated crop but most irrigated farms in our study area produce multiple crops and manage multiple enterprises risk efficient responses to irrigation limitations and water sharing at the farm level as opposed to the field or parcel level may differ from the findings reported here the conceptual and methodological frameworks could be extended to consider crop rotations and different enterprises using an sd portfolio approach 39 second the sd methodology is motivated by expected utility theory but these preferences may not always accurately reflect farmer decision making alternative approaches like prospect theory have been recently applied to farm decisions 52 54 and this approach could also be used to analyze water sharing credits and compared to the results in this paper third this research only considers the effects of production risk prices and costs are effectively treated as constants to focus on changes in a narrow set of variables under ceteris paribus type conditions the sd methodology could be extended to consider net return distributions that reflect price and production risk that are present in the study area the same holds true for other risk dimensions that contribute to the economic viability of farmers and farming e g human risk financial risk 55 last there is little agreement about precisely how producers interpret and use information to make irrigation decisions 56 57 and especially risk 36 for example producer adoption of efficient irrigation systems does not appear to result in appreciable overall reduction in water consumption in practice at the basin level a phenomenon known as an irrigation efficiency gap 10 explain that this paradox is partly a problem of insufficient understanding by decision makers about basin wide water accounting validation of tradeoffs risk and uncertainty and understanding producer incentives future research could address the role of modern irrigation technology in the development of water accounting and tracking systems that also address the efficiency gap acknowledgments this work was supported

8647,water demand is often found to be relatively price inelastic with substantial percentages of water consumption irresponsive to price changes this does not mean that households are insensitive to price changes or unresponsive to tariff reforms in order to explore the latter and using latent class models we classified households into a series of distinct types according to how they switch between consumption tiers in response to changes in their water tariff we then identified key drivers of this switching behavior proposing that not only tariff related variables but also sociodemographic attitudinal and information conditions define switching profiles our empirical exercise exploits information on water consumption and tariffs from 878 households in granada spain for the years 2010 and 2011 when a new tariff structure was implemented as well as a survey that collected additional information about household characteristics keywords demand management policies latent class model increasing block prices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction for decades water management has represented a key concern for many public authorities around the world demand management policies dmps are potentially useful tools for dealing with issues of water scarcity and quality and rationalizing the use of this vital resource among dmps the effectiveness of pricing tools has been widely discussed and hundreds of studies have concluded that residential water use is relatively unresponsive to price changes adopting a traditional approach based on residential water demand estimation most previous studies estimated price elasticity values below 1 1 4 moreover the scant but growing number of studies that estimate demand functions based on the stone geary utility function 5 9 suggest that a substantial percentage of total water consumption is structural since it cannot be modified using economic tools however that does not necessarily mean that households are completely insensitive to price reforms or increases or that they are all equally sensitive to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have focused on modeling the switching patterns of households between the different blocks or tiers of their tariff schedules this paper s aim is to identify different response types among households and to identify the drivers of this switching behavior guided by the literature we assume that not only the characteristics of the tariff but also sociodemographic attitudinal and information conditions will help identify the different household types however as one of the main policy variables available to water managers we are particularly interested in the role of tariff reforms in the promotion of block switching additionally we test whether the quality of the information households have about water tariffs significantly affects switching behavior residential water tariffs are often complex 10 13 and user misinformation is common 7 14 we propose that this approach could complement the analysis of the effects of pricing policies on household behavior based on the estimation of water demand elasticities by studying water consumption before and after a change in prices and tariff structures this research focuses on finding out whether households respond to the tariff change in a manner consistent with the expectations of classic economic theory or rather the incomplete knowledge about prices tariff structures and one s own water consumption results in unexpected user responses furthermore we exploit a tariff change in january 1 2011 to compare consumption patterns between two years during which the price the number and the size of the consumption blocks in the water tariff are different we thus seek to identify different household behavioral profiles in response to the change in tariff structure and to explain them in terms of user characteristics such as the level of concern about environmental issues ownership of water efficient appliances the level of knowledge about water prices and tariff structures the outline of the paper is as follows first we briefly discuss earlier works that analyze the effects of price reforms section 3 introduces the context the water tariff reform that took place in granada and outlines the database and the key variables used in the empirical analysis in section 4 the main methodological issues and the latent class model lcm are briefly explained next the main results are discussed in section 5 before we conclude with a summary of the main findings and policy implications 2 literature review water tariffs are considered a potentially useful policy tool to meet a combination of objectives such as efficiency sustainability equity and cost recovery 11 13 15 given their multifaceted nature the literature has studied different aspects of tariffs 1 1 for a recent systematic review on the design and evaluation of water tariffs see 16 such as progressivity 17 price escalation 18 20 affordability 21 sustainability 13 equity 22 24 welfare 25 and capacity cost recovery 26 27 price plays a role in managing water demand by negatively influencing water consumption 1 2 28 29 however the complexity of tariffs resulting for example from the combination of fixed quotas and increasing block tariffs ibts tends to distort the ability of domestic consumers to relate the size of their bill to the volume of water purchased 7 30 additionally since users receive their water bills long after the time of consumption it is not straightforward to relate consumption habits to the size of the bill let alone in the case of multiblock tariffs to the relevant marginal price per unit finally water bills tend to represent a relatively minor expense within the budget of the typical users in developed nations so it is not worthwhile for them to put much effort into learning about the details of tariff structures or adapting their behavior accordingly which is often driven largely by habits this section includes a review of previous studies that assess the impact of water tariff reforms some works analyze the effects of changing an existing tariff in terms of price increases under the same tariff structure 26 31 32 while others compare an existing tariff to an alternative tariff structure 22 33 35 additionally some studies conduct price simulations while others take advantage of natural or designed experiments these two dimensions are discussed below 2 1 analyzing water tariff reforms simulations as 16 explains a large proportion of earlier works simulate a change from the existing tariff to a new one 36 38 under more or less simple assumptions studying changes in a single parameter price or estimating price or income elasticities of demand some analyses involve the estimation of residential water demand functions and the use of econometric techniques to predict customer reactions to alternative tariff structures 39 41 while others employ monte carlo analysis or different simulation techniques 23 26 42 the design of ibts is often guided by the objectives of equity and affordability both crucially affected by the definition of the unit price and size of the first block of consumption it has been argued that the size of the first block should be set taking into account water quantities required to meet the basic needs 43 44 for instance 45 explain that the upper limit of the first block should be close to the essential minimum quantity of water use and that the number of blocks should be kept low in order to simplify the tariff and better enable users to understand their bills starting from the basis of an ibt with a low priced initial block to cover basic needs 39 simulate different nonlinear tariffs finally proposing a combination of a fixed fee for the first block of the tariff for low income households and a nonlinear pricing rule for larger water use volumes that incorporates a menu of tariffs based on actual water consumption by the households 39 show that the latter outperform a uniform price policy in terms of welfare another way to meet affordability and equity objectives would be to use social tariffs such as those that exempt poorer users from the fixed charge and the first block price however as 38 explain in order to meet these objectives social tariffs should be implemented according to the vulnerability of domestic users in terms of water affordability rather than in response to other short term political criteria other works focus on the distributional impact of tariffs 40 46 47 46 simulate the effects of two price reforms an across the board price increase and the adoption of an ibt on budgets for water finding that the distributional impacts of the reform depend on assumptions regarding the nature of the demand function such as whether it is estimated following a stone geary or a double log functional form for the across the board price increase the double log demand model would predict no change in the distribution of water expenditures while the stone geary demand specification would predict a worsening of the inequality of water expenditures however both specifications show that moving towards an ibt reduces the inequality of water expenditures 47 study the distributional effects of water pricing policies based on block pricing they find that improvements in income distribution can be achieved using a progressive block price structure reducing the price of the first block however this may result in large losses for the water company or if these losses are to be prevented in large price increases for all consumers an income dependent price system whereby higher income groups are charged higher prices for all or the first few consumption blocks may have desirable distributive effects however the administrative costs of such a system may be prohibitive 40 simulate the potential impact of various water pricing scenarios on aggregate water demand aggregate water sales revenue and consumer surpluses they confirm previous findings ibts are an effective redistributive tool through cross subsidies across blocks but they may cause cost recovery problems for a given level of cost recovery ibts can lead to societal losses while contributing little to increase equity the performance of alternative tariff designs depends on the availability of accurate estimates of the correlation between household water use and income average and marginal costs the price to which households are responding and the target of cost recovery 23 to avoid such problems more sophisticated ibts can be applied that are designed to reduce the bills of large families 22 or ibts based on use of per capita instead of calculating tariffs based on historical average costs and fixed demand 48 propose tariffs adjusted by climate and hydrographic information and water demand these according to their simulations would lead to price reductions for domestic customers of between 10 and 20 as 48 suggest that the first block threshold be kept in line with the households average disposable income in order to reduce peak hour demand efficiently 36 suggest an hourly increasing block tariff with a penalty to target outdoor consumption 36 explain that this approach is probably the fairest tariff when considering all socio demographic groups covering all water consumers 24 also propose a dynamic urban water tariff based on two distinct blocks where the size of the first block would be based on equity considerations and the size of the second would depend on storage range in reservoirs or scarcity conditions with several rates according to the different possible scenarios in terms of efficiency and cost recovery of two part tariffs 49 find two block ibts inferior to an efficient two part tariff two block ibts have adverse financial impacts on small users because ibts in general hinder the ability of small consumers to reduce their water bills by reducing consumption when it comes to the potential of water tariffs to induce water conservation 42 show that ibts can effectively lead to behavioral changes and water consumption reductions especially by heavy users although the predicted water savings would be less than those induced by the adoption of water restrictions 2 2 experiments in the analysis of water tariff changes apart from considering simulations of possible tariff changes a number of articles also analyze natural experiments 50 51 studying water use before and after a real change in tariff prices or structures in order to assess the effect of the change on user behavior while some of them find price reforms effective in reducing water use other do not have detected significant impacts of tariffs change on water consumption beginning with the first group of studies 52 consider the addition of a third price block to an ibt to find that doubling the marginal price leads to a decrease in water consumption of 12 among high use households however 51 finds that a price increase and the introduction of metering led to an average reduction in consumption of more than 13 however most of the poorest households experienced an increase in water bills of 31 while richer households that were better able to adjust their consumption managed to reduce the impact of the price increase on their bills 50 compare a uniform pricing scheme and an ibt and find that the latter negatively affects water consumption making that structure more conservation oriented than a uniform pricing policy 50 find that the reform resulted in roughly a 37 reduction in water consumption 53 estimated a reduction in water demand of 17 as a gradual change from a uniform rate pricing to fiscally neutral ibt water budgets suggesting that tariff structures have potential as conservation tools a second group of studies detect moderate reductions in consumption even increases on water use 54 find modest effects reforms introducing ibts in china with reductions in urban water demand of 3 5 55 who exploit a natural experiment consisting of a tariff reform from a linear rate to an ibt scheme in sanitation fees in 2013 find consumption quite insensitive to the tariff change since the total water consumption only decreased during the year following the reform but increased the year after similarly 56 studies a change in tariff structures from uniform prices for both water and sewer usage to a five block ibt structure using a difference in differences approach to capture the overall treatment effect of the change in tariffs 56 finds that the tariff reform induces an overall increase in consumption due to the lower prices for the first units of water regarding the effect of tariff changes on price elasticity there are also heterogeneous results 34 using lcms do not find any significant impact of the tariff reform on price elasticity in the short term 34 even estimate a slightly lower level of price elasticity for one of the user classes they identify as the one registering the second lowest level of consumption in the sample 57 estimate different price elasticities of water demand in germany noticing an asymmetric response depending on the direction of the price change similarly 35 find heterogeneous responses when assessing the impact of a water rate reform in norman oklahoma us moving from a rate structure which first decreased and then increased across higher consumption blocks to a strict ibt with a fixed fee surprisingly even though ultra low consumption users faced a large increase in total and average cost of water they responded to the tariff reform by increasing their water consumption while higher consumption customers who experienced a less severe increase in the total and average charge per gallon reduced their water use moreover 35 detect stronger reactions in the long run than in the short run 58 assess the impact of several rate changes in california between 2010 and 2011 they find that the change from uniform to tiered rates lead to changes in price elasticities from the range 0 22 0 39 to 0 43 0 44 50 estimate price elasticities fell in the range between 0 97 and 1 35 after the change compared to the 0 43 and 0 58 elasticities obtained under the uniform pricing scheme supporting the case for the conservation effects of ibts some other studies explicitly consider heterogeneity among users 59 study a tariff reform involving a general price increase in japan whereby the prices of an ibt increased in 2016 in the middle of the study period 2014 2018 59 estimated five price elasticities by household class and using lcms find three classes of response to the tariff change 5 of households responded sensitively 40 60 slightly and 35 55 did not respond at all 59 suggest two explanations for the non responsive households their lack of concern about water price since the ratio of water bill to total expenditure is only about 1 7 in japan or maybe the difficulty for low consuming households to reduce their water usage further 59 conclude that considering the low water price elasticities found pricing is not a very effective tool to alter household water behavior they also find that price elasticity appeared to be larger for larger uses and that there were no significant differences between the short term effects on elasticities of the price increase and the corresponding effects three years later finally some studies involve field experiments whose design sometimes includes monetary incentives to simulate implicit tariff changes for low consumption users for example 60 assess the impact of both monetary and non monetary experimental treatments finding that households that receive monetary incentives tend to reduce water consumption the literature has addressed the impact of water tariff reforms using different methodologies however to the best of our knowledge only a few papers 34 59 have analyzed the existence of different profile responses to a significant structural change of a water tariff addressing this heterogeneity in consumption patterns after a tariff reform remains a significant issue to be explored in this paper we use an innovative approach to assess this issue which is described in section 4 3 database our empirical exercise exploits two main sources of data first we have information on water consumption per household and water tariffs for a random sample of urban households in four different districts of the city of granada spain these consumption and price data were provided by emasagra 2 2 in 2010 emasagra was a mixed ownership company such that 51 of its capital was owned by the city council and 49 by the agbar group this kind of public private partnership is commonplace in the spanish water sector 61 nowadays the company still keeps most of its capital in public hands but the share of private participation differs slightly from that in 2010 the company in charge of water supply and sewage collection in granada the water supplier provided us with a representative sample of residential users residing in the city center whose water consumption is mainly indoors and who live in relatively older houses 3 3 households in older houses generally decide to adopt efficient electrical appliances or not as opposed to households in newer buildings that include efficient technologies by default in addition a survey was conducted to collect information about several household features 4 4 emasagra provided a random sample of 5 483 customer representative of granada s city centre after a pre test that identified unusable or outdated addresses 5 182 were finally selected for interviewing households were contacted a maximum of four times before being dismissed despite great efforts to obtain valid responses a high percentage of households did not open the door 34 8 many households opened the door but refused to collaborate with answer the survey 20 9 there were also some non occupied apartments and some erroneous addresses only 0 7 of households in the sample 36 were not contacted the response rate was 28 6 the average household size in granada is 2 5 2 7 in our sample the proportion of females is 54 55 in our sample however although the average age in the city is 42 our sample shows 50 likely because users tend to be older in the city center the proportion of newhouse would be about 25 in the population and 25 in our sample overall we expect there to be no substantial lack of representativeness in our sample these included the household s socioeconomic characteristics occupation household size education level housing characteristics age size equipment attitudes towards the environment and conservation habits 5 5 the survey was conducted after the tariff reform a pre test was conducted in october 2011 while the main survey was conducted between 9 november 2011 and february 3 2012 although the survey was carried out in 2011 and therefore we only have socioeconomic information from that year the variables analyzed can be considered time invariant in the short medium term using this information and in order to compare each household at two different moments of time we built a balanced 6 6 originally the panel was unbalanced but in order to maintain comparable data from both years households with incomplete information were eliminated from the final sample panel of 878 households from granada observed during the 12 two month billing periods in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a total of 10 536 observations table 1 shows that there is very little seasonal variation in the average registered consumption per billing period water use across billing periods within the year recorded consumption is somewhat lower after the summer season but otherwise relatively constant the lack of seasonality that one would expect in summer might be explained by the fact that many users leave the city centre when the high temperatures hit granada for the more bearable countryside and seaside secondary residences granada applies an ibt with a fixed water service fee independent of consumption 7 7 the fixed component includes a water supply fee and a sewage collection fee and a set of price blocks as shown in table 2 the tariff was substantially reformed in 2011 most blocks were enlarged but a narrow 2 m3 month first block was introduced at the slightly lower price of 0 9731 to make a basic amount of water more affordable the 1 unit price differential between the third and fourth blocks represented also a substantial increase aimed at reducing higher consumption levels the figures in table 3 show the expected bill amount corresponding to seven different monthly consumption levels in order to facilitate the comparison of the tariffs applied before and after the reform additionally the last column of table 3 includes an index of price escalation in the variable component of the tariff structures used in granada in 2010 and 2011 to this end we adapted the price escalation index proposed by 19 equation 1 p 730 this price escalation measure considers the total water bill corresponding to a representative number of monthly levels of consumption 8 8 however although 19 used 3 m3 month as the first level of monthly consumption we use 2 m3 instead this allows us to capture the marginal price in the first block applied to consumption between 0 and 2 m3 the levels we thus considered in our calculation were 2 5 10 15 20 25 and 50 m 3 month in a given tariff structure selected independently of the size of the price blocks in the tariff the weighted average of the differential between use levels in the effective price per unit is normalized by the unit price corresponding to 25 m 3 of monthly consumption so that when used to compare tariffs across jurisdictions the index is not unduly informed by absolute price levels across tariffs as opposed to relative changes in marginal prices within tariffs the weights are given by the proportion of users consuming in each interval defined by the selected water bill levels so that the formula allocates more weight to the levels of escalation affecting more users although the 2011 tariff reform resulted in a general price increase especially for the heavy water users the degree of price escalation in 2010 and 2011 is similar having only slightly increased under the new tariff incidentally the values we obtained for granada fall very close to the average levels found for a large number of communities in 2000 and 2014 by 19 9 9 see 19 table 5 p 746 in order to ensure comparability between the 2010 and 2011 tariffs we homogenize them by generating a set of consumption synthetic tiers by which we mean that we generated some artificial blocks splitting some of the original blocks to make the two tariffs which originally had a different block structure comparable between 2020 and 2011 fig 1 displays this homogenized tariff structure which results in seven consumption tiers 10 10 note that the figures in table 3 involve the levels of consumption except the first one used in the calculation of price escalation proposed by 19 and are independent of the sizes of the blocks in the actual tariffs used in granada fig 1 more directly describes the actual block distribution used in the tariffs specifically used in granada after the block sizes were artificially adjusted to make them homogeneous between 2010 and 2011 fig 1 displays the tariff schedules in 2010 and 2011 illustrating the use of the synthetic consumption tiers on the one hand the marginal price in each tier differs between 2010 and 2011 however the difference between 2011 and 2010 could be positive as in the case of tiers 2 4 6 and 7 or negative tiers 1 3 5 on the other hand it is possible for two tiers to have the same marginal price in a given year as in the case of tiers 2 and 3 in 2011 depending on their consumption tier after the tariff reform some households could end up facing a higher or lower unit price without changing their consumption levels fig 2 shows the average consumption in each billing period of the two years right before and right after the change of tariff structure in the first two billing periods of 2011 on average households reduced their consumption just like in the fifth billing period however compared to their 2010 counterparts consumption was higher in the third and last billing periods of 2011 fig 3 displays the average marginal price paid in each billing period of the years before and after changing water tariff structure in this case we can clearly see that on average households pay a higher marginal price in 2011 than before the tariff change in order to model the process prompted by the change in the tariff of switching tiers between 2010 and 2011 we propose using a variable based on comparing a given billing period between 2010 and 2011 for each household this variable labeled switch describes the switching across tiers between two corresponding billing periods t capturing both the direction and extent of the switch since we constructed seven consumption tiers switch is a categorical variable which ranges from 6 to 6 taking the following values 0 if the household did not change in its consumption tier in a given billing period in 2011 relative to the corresponding billing period in 2010 a negative value ranging from 1 to 6 to indicate a move to lower tiers between the two years or a positive value 1 to 6 for a move to a higher tier as shown in further detail in table 4 there were no switches across consumption tiers between 2010 and 2011 for a sizable percentage 69 13 of observations in 14 31 of cases there was a switch to an upper tier and surprisingly 16 55 of the households switched to a lower tier table 4 also shows that although most switches involved a move to an immediately lower or higher tier for a non negligible percentage of households the switch involved more than one tier the information contained in this variable was summarized for each household through its mean and standard deviation throughout the six billing periods as variables meanswitch and sdswitch those variables capture the households behavioral changes in terms of water consumption variable meanswitch indicates whether on average the consumption tier has changed relative to the previous year for that household while sdswitch shows the dispersion throughout the year of such changes in tier indicating whether there have been ups and downs that is switches in opposite directions for example if meanswitch is 1 for a given household it means that the household on average has moved to an upper tier synthetic tier if its dispersion is low that means that average change was the result of a relatively systematic change pattern in its consumption always upwards however a high degree of dispersion would suggest that in some periods the household moved to an upper tier and in other to a lower tier if on average it moved up one tier moreover variable mpchange accounts for the difference in marginal prices in per m3 paid in a given billing period between 2010 and 2011 by each household a positive negative value of this variable indicates that the household faced a higher lower marginal price after the tariff reform under the new tariff the change in marginal price can be the result of a change in price for the same level of consumption a change in consumption or both this variable complements switch since the tariff reform was structural involving changes in the size of the tariff s blocks the mean change in marginal prices is positive that is the marginal price paid by households was on average higher in 2011 than in 2010 to summarize the information from the six comparisons between each of the corresponding billing periods for each household the mean and standard deviation of this change in marginal prices paid was calculated as variables meanmpchange and sdmpchange also included in our model finally we consider as independent variable the average daily water consumption 11 11 variable dailym3 was calculated accounting for the exact number of days in each billing period whose length was roughly two months per household in the first billing period of 2011 dailym3 this variable provides information about the level of water consumption for each group 12 12 we consider the recorded level of water consumption in the first billing period of 2011 because that is the first period after the tariff reform and probably when most households started noticing the new tariff it also refers to a period when most users would have stayed at home as opposed to the summer when most families usually take a long holiday break away from the heat in urban granada when modeling the probability of class membership for each household after applying a lcm to identify household types based on their response to the tariff reform 13 13 see section 4 our choice of potential explanatory factors was guided by the extant literature about residential water demand consumption 1 2 4 28 29 62 63 however it is important to recall that in our case we are specifying a model to explain the posterior probabilities of belonging to different household classes within the context of their reacting between two years to changes in the water tariff the expectations about and interpretations of their effects in both types of analysis would not necessarily be the same it is also for this reason that we could only in a limited way ground our hypothesis on the results reported in literature on water demand as such in particular we consider several groups of variables assuming that the socioeconomic characteristics of the households influence their behavior we included in our model the number of household members hsize the proportion of females in the household p female and a variable proxying the household s education level college we attempted to include following 34 also indicators of the age composition of the household since this type of information has sometimes been found relevant in water demand studies whether using household level or aggregate data 1 21 30 57 64 65 there is however no full consensus on the sign of the effects of most commonly the share of over 65 adults and under 18 children on demand and these indicators proved unable to contribute to our modeling of the probability of class membership within our lcm 14 14 we also acknowledge that given the relative fragility of our lcm we were constrained in our choice of model specification by the difficulty to achieve convergence in the estimation the number of members of the household hsize is obviously a variable that affects water demand when measured by household but also when measured in per capita terms 65 67 as 68 find water consumption increases at a lower rate than household size indicating the possible existence of economies of scale however the expected effect of this variable on changes in consumption in reaction to the tariff reform is less clear although we did not have any a priori expectation of what type of influence this variable might have on class membership we used the proportion of females in the household p female this is because household makeup has been considered as a potential factor in the water conservation literature and also because women and men could be expected to have different patterns of water end use behavior attitudes towards water conservation and degrees of accurate perception of their own water use although the available research in this area is far from conclusive 63 67 69 76 15 15 for instance while 77 suggest that women are more committed to water conservation 78 find gender not significant 79 show that women follow more conservation practices making better use of water for preparing food and turning off the tap while brushing teeth while 80 do not find gender a significant factor to explain the accuracy of perceptions of the water tariff consumption or cost similarly we consider an indicator of the level of education of the household since there are precedents if again no conclusive evidence in the literature that it might be a factor both in terms of water use perception of tariffs and own consumption as well as attitudes towards conservation 65 67 71 74 77 81 82 in terms of housing features we considered the age of the house newhouse if the house has been renovated in recent years renovated and the existence of efficient appliances app effic we included also attitudinal and behavioral factors expected to affect water consumption decisions a water saving habits index habitindex 16 16 this index was constructed as the proportion of habits adopted by the household out of the eight we proposed six of the eight habits we considered were used in q19 of the questionnaire available here used by 83 these habits are usually mentioned in educational campaigns by water suppliers and public authorities the verbatim description used for each habit is available in theappendix we added the habits of being watchful with water while brushing teeth and washing cars while removing a question about the use of washers and dishwashers since not all of our respondents would own them and one and using double flow toilets in our view more a question about water saving equipment rather than habits and a variable indicating the respondent s stated concern about the environment enviro in order to try and capture the household s knowledge about tariffs and other water consumption issues we included an indicators of knowledge of the water supplier s website web the existence of an environmental campaign to promote reductions in water consumption in the past five years campaign the structure of water tariff tariff and the size of the water bill underbill which indicates that the user underestimates the actual bill a broader description of the variables is available in table 5 while table 6 provides summary statistics of the variables used in the analysis as shown in table 6 the average household is composed of 2 7 family members with an average proportion of females of 55 in 67 of the households the first second or both family members have postsecondary education the average daily consumption in the first billing period of 2011 was 249 liters per household about 33 of respondents live in homes that are less than 30 years old and 40 of respondents had made renovations within the last five years some 81 of respondents declared to be very concerned about the environment while 55 are aware of educational campaigns on water saving and 22 know the water supplier s website 17 17 most water bills in spain are paid through direct billing so they do not even need to check the amount owed additionally in 2010 emasagra started promoting the use of e bills but customers still received paper bills in 2011 the proportion of e bills issued was still negligible 84 about 29 of the households own efficient water appliances dishwashers and or washing machines when it comes to information about water prices it is noteworthy that 35 of respondents know the structure of the water tariff but in 49 of cases respondents underestimate their water bill 18 18 moreover 51 of respondents overestimate the water bill while only 4 1 estimates their bill within a 15 margin of error finally around 42 of the households spend more than a month a year away from home and 75 of the respondents consider themselves satisfied with life in general 4 methodology our aim is to identify different groups of consumers according to their switching patterns across the spectrum of consumption tiers to do so we use a particular case of generalized structural equation model gsem that fits models with categorical latent variables namely latent class analysis lca in lcms we assume that the sample of individuals is drawn from a population that is a finite mixture of c distinct subpopulations 85 ch 18 the unobserved levels of a categorical latent variable are known as latent classes which in our model represent groups of consumers with different unobservable preferences behaviors lca allows for the possibility of modeling distinct parameters for each class of household and estimating the probability of belonging to each class we are interested in identifying different switching profiles and examining what drives the probabilities of belonging to each class c the latter are estimated using a fractional multinomial logistic regression specified as follows 1 π c e γ c z i c 1 c e γ c z i c 1 c where z is a vector of exogenous variables γ c are parameters to be estimated in the multinomial logit model by default the first class will be treated as the benchmark class our lcm groups households into distinct classes based on their values of five dependent variables meanswitch sdswitch meanmpchange sdmpchange and dailym3 and explains the probabilities of belonging to each class using independent variables described in section 3 19 19 stata s command gsem was used to estimate the lcm when applying lcms the appropriate number of classes must be determined prior to conducting the estimation we follow the usual strategy of successively estimating several models with an increasing number of classes and choosing the best fitting model according to statistical information criteria usually the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic 5 results several versions of the lcm were estimated based on an increasing number of classes the corresponding information criteria statistics are shown in table 7 according to the aic and to a lesser extent the bic the preferred estimation is a model with five distinct classes 20 20 for a thorough description of the issues behind the choice of the number of classes according to information criteria see 86 the bic criterion worsens with five classes so it suggests using only four in contrast the aic criterion shows an improvement from considering more than four classes we cautiously chose to restrict the analysis to five classes based on these statistical criteria and also to avoid overly complicating the interpretation of the different classes in particular we note that the predicted distribution of households among six classes according to the modal probabilities suggested by our postestimation analysis would result in classes with rather similar sizes which would cast doubt on the soundness of their interpretation table 8 shows the results of the lcms with five classes in terms of the determinants of class membership indicated in broad qualitative terms by the untransformed coefficients of the fractional multinomial logit whose benchmark category is class 1 table 9 displays predicted class memberships based on the modal posterior class probability 21 21 all households have non zero predicted probabilities of belonging to each class so it might seem somewhat arbitrary to them according to the class for which their predicted probability is highest however entropy values 87 close to 1 as the one shown in table 9 indicate a clear delineation of classes justifying the notion of allocating households to a single given class out the five and a brief class description based on the marginal means of five variables the largest proportion of households with mean predicted probabilities of 42 and 29 are most likely to belong to classes 1 and 3 followed by classes 5 and 4 16 and 9 respectively the predicted mean probability of membership of class 2 is the lowest of the five groups 4 below using the information available in tables 8 and 9 we label and describe these household classes class 1 the reference class in our model is predicted to be the largest and labeled the indifferent according to the first column in table 9 although that meant that the marginal price they paid was noticeably higher households in class 1 hardly moved to a higher consumption tier between 2010 and 2011 these families consume an average of close to 200 liters per day which is the second lowest consumption level households with a modal predicted probability placing them in class 2 are the most rare 4 registering the lowest water consumption levels some 90 liters day we label them seasonal since the figures in table 8 suggest that they probably spend long periods away from home on average class 2 households faced a slightly higher marginal price and moved to a much lower tier in 2011 class 3 contains a sizeable share 29 of households we label the informed group as shown in table 8 it is relatively likely for them to know the supplier s webpage and the tariff schedule their consumption tier in 2011 is on average slightly lower than in 2010 however their marginal price increased after the tariff change they consume a daily average of 307 liters slightly higher than the average consumption in the city like class 2 class 4 is expected to be small 9 however in contrast to class 2 these families register the highest consumption levels 338 liters day they on average moved to a substantially higher consumption tier and to face marginal price increases again on average however the standard deviation of their responses to the tariff change suggests that these households do not have a consistent behavioral pattern consequently we chose to label them the careless although they are the heaviest consumers along the considered period they increased their consumption climbing to a higher consumption tier in 2011 moreover and according to table 8 they are less likely to claim having water conservation habits than households in the other classes finally class 5 with a predicted share of 16 of households in the population would attract the label environmentally aware these households consume on average 278 liters day the lowest consumption level among the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 in response to the tariff reform they substantially reduced their consumption to move to a lower tier and managed to pay a lower marginal price like the careless class above they show high variability in their yearly patterns further details related to key drivers of the probabilities belonging to each class are shown in table 8 households that spend more days a year away from home that have fewer members that own fewer efficient appliances and that are less environmentally concerned are more likely to belong to the seasonal class 2 than to the reference class 1 furthermore those who underestimate their water bills are also more likely to be among these seasonal households compared to the reference class the opposite is observed in the case of the informed class 3 and the careless class 4 and the environmentally aware class 5 underestimating one s bill reduces makes it less likely to belong to these classes than to the reference class the probability of belonging to classes 3 4 and 5 is higher than for the reference class for larger households while the opposite applies in the case of class 2 as mentioned previously knowing about the tariffs and the webpage of the supplier makes it more likely to belong to the informed class than to the reference class households that are less satisfied with life in general environmentally concerned and who know the supplier s webpage are relatively more likely to belong in the environmentally aware class 5 finally having fewer water saving habits and being unaware of water saving campaigns although while being better informed about tariffs increases the probability of belonging among the careless households class 4 than to belong to the reference class 6 discussion fig 4 displays average marginal effects 22 22 these marginal or discrete when applicable effects are first calculated for each individual in the sample and then averaged across individuals except for the cases of the variables whose values we specifically set the values of all relevant variables are thus kept during the calculation at the actual individual values related to four selected variables that would be potential candidates for policy variables we consider three variables related to information web tariff and underbill and one variable linked to environmental attitudes enviro we display how the marginal effects vary depending on household size 23 23 note that hsize is a variable that significantly explains the membership in different classes although information on household size is not always publicly available the water supplier could easily obtain data on family size at least when customers apply for special tariffs based on this criterion for the sake of economy of space although fig 4 displays marginal effects corresponding to all five classes we limit our discussion below to the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 being relatively well informed affects the probability of belonging to several user classes for instance knowing the supplier s website increases the probability of belonging among the environmentally aware class 5 and the informed class 3 by up to 10 and up to 6 respectively similarly knowing the tariff schedule is associated with an increase in the probability of belonging to the informed class of about 7 however these variables have a slight negative effect on the probability of being among the indifferent class 1 moreover those who underestimate their bill are between 8 and 15 more likely to belong to class 1 environmentally friendly attitudes increase the probability of belonging to class 5 by more than 10 this class of household had exhibited good environmental behaviors since they substantially reduced their consumption tier due to the nonlinearity of the model the effects of the drivers on class membership depend on the values of all variables we showcase this with reference to the case of household size for instance when it comes to the probability of belonging to classes 3 the informed or 5 the environmentally aware knowledge of the tariffs and the supplier s website generally show stronger marginal effects for smaller size households surprisingly though the impact of underestimating one s bill on the probability of belonging to classes 3 and 5 increases with household size therefore even though the impacts of this variable are usually negative in the case of class 3 its marginal effect becomes positive for households larger than seven members this exemplifies how our findings would be relevant in terms of policy design since they allow to tailor interventions to different sociodemographic profiles table 10 shows how the average levels of consumption changed between 2010 and 2011 for each household class although the effect of the tariff is very different across classes 24 24 we also note that the predicted to be the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 show the more modest average reactions to the tariff change the stronger effects shown table 10 correspond to the much smaller classes 2 and 4 the overall effect of the adoption of the new tariff format is very limited this finding is in line with the study by 34 25 25 in order to assess the impact of this tariff reform in granada 34 included in their demand function an interaction term between the binary indicator for the year 2011 and the average price in granada and with other empirical applications in other geographical locations that report a moderate impact on water use of tariff reforms involving ibts as mentioned in section 2 2 that fact does not necessarily means that tariff design has no impact on water conservation but rather that this impact might often be more modest than expected depending on the target population and a variety of other circumstances 88 more in line with the main theme of our study we can also see that the tariff reform had a relatively modest impact when it comes to the rearrangement of users among consumption blocks and their moving towards or away from the borderline consumption levels defined in the tariffs this issue is discussed below as the figures in tables 11 and 12 are presented overall however it is not too surprising to see that in general only the largest users who pay the highest unit prices at the margin find it worthwhile to pay relatively closer attention to the tariff structure to the extent that consumers in the lowest use block are also among the ones with lowest incomes and because the increase in unit price in the second block was substantial their reaction in their case also in line with theoretical expectations is also less of a surprise 26 26 89 found similar differences across income levels in terms of reactions to ibts but for most of the users the water bill is not large enough to merit much consideration of the tariff and its adjustment table 11 displays the shares of users consuming within each of the synthetic tiers we considered to make the two tariffs structures comparable it shows that except for the case of the blocks corresponding to heavier uses the proportion of users falling within a given tier changes in most cases in the same direction as the unit price for that block for example the 2 8 m 3 tier attracted users although its price substantially increased the opposite occurred in the case of the 8 10 tier the unit price decreased substantially but the share of users decreased between 2020 and 2011 only for the lowest level of consumption indeed one of the key targets of the tariff reform and the two tiers associated with the largest uses do we find a pattern more in line with theoretical expectations the price and the proportion of users changed in opposite directions table 12 shows that the change in tariff basically did not alter the proportion of users clustering bunching within the neighborhood of the block border here measured as consuming within one cubic metre of the kink in the budget line that the 2011 tariff would impose one would expect a relative degree of bunching around those levels of consumption when they were indeed dividing blocks in the tariff but much less clustering otherwise this is because a theoretical response to the marginal price would accumulate users theoretically at the kinks if in practice just around the kinks 90 91 the fact that by and large there are no differences suggests that most users make little efforts to optimize in a theoretically expected way their level of water use under an ibt as 92 p 538 mentioned the absence of bunching implies either that i consumers respond to marginal price with zero elasticity or that ii they respond to alternative price although empirical evidence on bunching in this context is unclear 89 93 and the fact is that the presence or absence of this behavior is directly related to price perception issues and the quality of information that users have about water tariffs in our analysis knowing the structure of the tariff increases the probability to be in the group with the most rational behavior consumption reductions under price increases this finding probably supports the idea that tariff reforms must be accompanied by strong informational campaigns explaining the new tariff structure and making it more comprehensive for all kind of users 7 conclusions the aim of this paper is to analyze behavioral profiles before and after a change in residential water tariffs to this end we examine changes in the consumption tiers and marginal prices paid across billing periods in 2010 the base year and 2011 following a modification of the tariff scheme and its price levels that comparison is not straightforward because both the size and the prices of each consumption block in the tariff were modified so comparability required the constructing of artificial consumption tiers by merging the tariffs applied in 2010 and 2011 we also assume that sociodemographic variables do not change in the period considered in this study we identify five distinct profiles of users certain households class 5 the environmentally aware group who are more likely to be concerned about the environment tend to reduce their consumption tier we also detect two other household classes classes 2 and 3 for whom there is an inverse link between water prices and consumption as it would be expected according to standard economic theory compared to those in the benchmark class households in these groups are less likely underestimating their bill households in what we label the informed class 3 are more likely to be familiar with the supplier s webpage and the tariff schedule information which users not always find worthwhile to obtain is essential to adopt efficient decisions however deficiencies in the levels of user information are pervasive when it comes to the design of public policies in the residential water sector water suppliers should consider the use of different tools websites mobile phone apps etc to nudge households in order to improve their level of information on water tariffs or bill our contribution is twofold on the one hand this is to our knowledge the first study of the switching behavior across water consumption tiers after a tariff change using this methodology on the other hand we identify different response patterns among water customers that we link to their socioeconomic characteristics their environmental concerns and their knowledge about water consumption and water prices knowing how different types of households are expected to respond to changes in the structure of water tariffs and in what proportions would help to anticipate the effect of future changes in tariffs or price levels would have on water consumption for example suppliers and planners might be interested in predicting whether changing the size of the tariff blocks for the same level of consumption would increase the final price of water would mostly lead to a general reduction in water consumption or if on the contrary would lead only certain users such as those most environmentally aware or those best informed about the details of the tariff to reduce their consumption unfortunately our analysis addresses the issue of the effectiveness of water tariffs from a short run perspective only since no data are available to observe if the profiles detected are stable or instead change over time a long run analysis would require much more information on sociodemographics and water consumption prices throughout several years moreover our findings are related to a specific context a city located in southern spain so they are not necessarily transferable to other areas however and despite these limitations this research contributes to the understanding of water pricing by adopting an original approach to address a frequent topic in the water demand literature the impact of water tariff reforms the availability of better datasets in the future would make it possible to exploit this approach to its full potential

8647,water demand is often found to be relatively price inelastic with substantial percentages of water consumption irresponsive to price changes this does not mean that households are insensitive to price changes or unresponsive to tariff reforms in order to explore the latter and using latent class models we classified households into a series of distinct types according to how they switch between consumption tiers in response to changes in their water tariff we then identified key drivers of this switching behavior proposing that not only tariff related variables but also sociodemographic attitudinal and information conditions define switching profiles our empirical exercise exploits information on water consumption and tariffs from 878 households in granada spain for the years 2010 and 2011 when a new tariff structure was implemented as well as a survey that collected additional information about household characteristics keywords demand management policies latent class model increasing block prices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction for decades water management has represented a key concern for many public authorities around the world demand management policies dmps are potentially useful tools for dealing with issues of water scarcity and quality and rationalizing the use of this vital resource among dmps the effectiveness of pricing tools has been widely discussed and hundreds of studies have concluded that residential water use is relatively unresponsive to price changes adopting a traditional approach based on residential water demand estimation most previous studies estimated price elasticity values below 1 1 4 moreover the scant but growing number of studies that estimate demand functions based on the stone geary utility function 5 9 suggest that a substantial percentage of total water consumption is structural since it cannot be modified using economic tools however that does not necessarily mean that households are completely insensitive to price reforms or increases or that they are all equally sensitive to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have focused on modeling the switching patterns of households between the different blocks or tiers of their tariff schedules this paper s aim is to identify different response types among households and to identify the drivers of this switching behavior guided by the literature we assume that not only the characteristics of the tariff but also sociodemographic attitudinal and information conditions will help identify the different household types however as one of the main policy variables available to water managers we are particularly interested in the role of tariff reforms in the promotion of block switching additionally we test whether the quality of the information households have about water tariffs significantly affects switching behavior residential water tariffs are often complex 10 13 and user misinformation is common 7 14 we propose that this approach could complement the analysis of the effects of pricing policies on household behavior based on the estimation of water demand elasticities by studying water consumption before and after a change in prices and tariff structures this research focuses on finding out whether households respond to the tariff change in a manner consistent with the expectations of classic economic theory or rather the incomplete knowledge about prices tariff structures and one s own water consumption results in unexpected user responses furthermore we exploit a tariff change in january 1 2011 to compare consumption patterns between two years during which the price the number and the size of the consumption blocks in the water tariff are different we thus seek to identify different household behavioral profiles in response to the change in tariff structure and to explain them in terms of user characteristics such as the level of concern about environmental issues ownership of water efficient appliances the level of knowledge about water prices and tariff structures the outline of the paper is as follows first we briefly discuss earlier works that analyze the effects of price reforms section 3 introduces the context the water tariff reform that took place in granada and outlines the database and the key variables used in the empirical analysis in section 4 the main methodological issues and the latent class model lcm are briefly explained next the main results are discussed in section 5 before we conclude with a summary of the main findings and policy implications 2 literature review water tariffs are considered a potentially useful policy tool to meet a combination of objectives such as efficiency sustainability equity and cost recovery 11 13 15 given their multifaceted nature the literature has studied different aspects of tariffs 1 1 for a recent systematic review on the design and evaluation of water tariffs see 16 such as progressivity 17 price escalation 18 20 affordability 21 sustainability 13 equity 22 24 welfare 25 and capacity cost recovery 26 27 price plays a role in managing water demand by negatively influencing water consumption 1 2 28 29 however the complexity of tariffs resulting for example from the combination of fixed quotas and increasing block tariffs ibts tends to distort the ability of domestic consumers to relate the size of their bill to the volume of water purchased 7 30 additionally since users receive their water bills long after the time of consumption it is not straightforward to relate consumption habits to the size of the bill let alone in the case of multiblock tariffs to the relevant marginal price per unit finally water bills tend to represent a relatively minor expense within the budget of the typical users in developed nations so it is not worthwhile for them to put much effort into learning about the details of tariff structures or adapting their behavior accordingly which is often driven largely by habits this section includes a review of previous studies that assess the impact of water tariff reforms some works analyze the effects of changing an existing tariff in terms of price increases under the same tariff structure 26 31 32 while others compare an existing tariff to an alternative tariff structure 22 33 35 additionally some studies conduct price simulations while others take advantage of natural or designed experiments these two dimensions are discussed below 2 1 analyzing water tariff reforms simulations as 16 explains a large proportion of earlier works simulate a change from the existing tariff to a new one 36 38 under more or less simple assumptions studying changes in a single parameter price or estimating price or income elasticities of demand some analyses involve the estimation of residential water demand functions and the use of econometric techniques to predict customer reactions to alternative tariff structures 39 41 while others employ monte carlo analysis or different simulation techniques 23 26 42 the design of ibts is often guided by the objectives of equity and affordability both crucially affected by the definition of the unit price and size of the first block of consumption it has been argued that the size of the first block should be set taking into account water quantities required to meet the basic needs 43 44 for instance 45 explain that the upper limit of the first block should be close to the essential minimum quantity of water use and that the number of blocks should be kept low in order to simplify the tariff and better enable users to understand their bills starting from the basis of an ibt with a low priced initial block to cover basic needs 39 simulate different nonlinear tariffs finally proposing a combination of a fixed fee for the first block of the tariff for low income households and a nonlinear pricing rule for larger water use volumes that incorporates a menu of tariffs based on actual water consumption by the households 39 show that the latter outperform a uniform price policy in terms of welfare another way to meet affordability and equity objectives would be to use social tariffs such as those that exempt poorer users from the fixed charge and the first block price however as 38 explain in order to meet these objectives social tariffs should be implemented according to the vulnerability of domestic users in terms of water affordability rather than in response to other short term political criteria other works focus on the distributional impact of tariffs 40 46 47 46 simulate the effects of two price reforms an across the board price increase and the adoption of an ibt on budgets for water finding that the distributional impacts of the reform depend on assumptions regarding the nature of the demand function such as whether it is estimated following a stone geary or a double log functional form for the across the board price increase the double log demand model would predict no change in the distribution of water expenditures while the stone geary demand specification would predict a worsening of the inequality of water expenditures however both specifications show that moving towards an ibt reduces the inequality of water expenditures 47 study the distributional effects of water pricing policies based on block pricing they find that improvements in income distribution can be achieved using a progressive block price structure reducing the price of the first block however this may result in large losses for the water company or if these losses are to be prevented in large price increases for all consumers an income dependent price system whereby higher income groups are charged higher prices for all or the first few consumption blocks may have desirable distributive effects however the administrative costs of such a system may be prohibitive 40 simulate the potential impact of various water pricing scenarios on aggregate water demand aggregate water sales revenue and consumer surpluses they confirm previous findings ibts are an effective redistributive tool through cross subsidies across blocks but they may cause cost recovery problems for a given level of cost recovery ibts can lead to societal losses while contributing little to increase equity the performance of alternative tariff designs depends on the availability of accurate estimates of the correlation between household water use and income average and marginal costs the price to which households are responding and the target of cost recovery 23 to avoid such problems more sophisticated ibts can be applied that are designed to reduce the bills of large families 22 or ibts based on use of per capita instead of calculating tariffs based on historical average costs and fixed demand 48 propose tariffs adjusted by climate and hydrographic information and water demand these according to their simulations would lead to price reductions for domestic customers of between 10 and 20 as 48 suggest that the first block threshold be kept in line with the households average disposable income in order to reduce peak hour demand efficiently 36 suggest an hourly increasing block tariff with a penalty to target outdoor consumption 36 explain that this approach is probably the fairest tariff when considering all socio demographic groups covering all water consumers 24 also propose a dynamic urban water tariff based on two distinct blocks where the size of the first block would be based on equity considerations and the size of the second would depend on storage range in reservoirs or scarcity conditions with several rates according to the different possible scenarios in terms of efficiency and cost recovery of two part tariffs 49 find two block ibts inferior to an efficient two part tariff two block ibts have adverse financial impacts on small users because ibts in general hinder the ability of small consumers to reduce their water bills by reducing consumption when it comes to the potential of water tariffs to induce water conservation 42 show that ibts can effectively lead to behavioral changes and water consumption reductions especially by heavy users although the predicted water savings would be less than those induced by the adoption of water restrictions 2 2 experiments in the analysis of water tariff changes apart from considering simulations of possible tariff changes a number of articles also analyze natural experiments 50 51 studying water use before and after a real change in tariff prices or structures in order to assess the effect of the change on user behavior while some of them find price reforms effective in reducing water use other do not have detected significant impacts of tariffs change on water consumption beginning with the first group of studies 52 consider the addition of a third price block to an ibt to find that doubling the marginal price leads to a decrease in water consumption of 12 among high use households however 51 finds that a price increase and the introduction of metering led to an average reduction in consumption of more than 13 however most of the poorest households experienced an increase in water bills of 31 while richer households that were better able to adjust their consumption managed to reduce the impact of the price increase on their bills 50 compare a uniform pricing scheme and an ibt and find that the latter negatively affects water consumption making that structure more conservation oriented than a uniform pricing policy 50 find that the reform resulted in roughly a 37 reduction in water consumption 53 estimated a reduction in water demand of 17 as a gradual change from a uniform rate pricing to fiscally neutral ibt water budgets suggesting that tariff structures have potential as conservation tools a second group of studies detect moderate reductions in consumption even increases on water use 54 find modest effects reforms introducing ibts in china with reductions in urban water demand of 3 5 55 who exploit a natural experiment consisting of a tariff reform from a linear rate to an ibt scheme in sanitation fees in 2013 find consumption quite insensitive to the tariff change since the total water consumption only decreased during the year following the reform but increased the year after similarly 56 studies a change in tariff structures from uniform prices for both water and sewer usage to a five block ibt structure using a difference in differences approach to capture the overall treatment effect of the change in tariffs 56 finds that the tariff reform induces an overall increase in consumption due to the lower prices for the first units of water regarding the effect of tariff changes on price elasticity there are also heterogeneous results 34 using lcms do not find any significant impact of the tariff reform on price elasticity in the short term 34 even estimate a slightly lower level of price elasticity for one of the user classes they identify as the one registering the second lowest level of consumption in the sample 57 estimate different price elasticities of water demand in germany noticing an asymmetric response depending on the direction of the price change similarly 35 find heterogeneous responses when assessing the impact of a water rate reform in norman oklahoma us moving from a rate structure which first decreased and then increased across higher consumption blocks to a strict ibt with a fixed fee surprisingly even though ultra low consumption users faced a large increase in total and average cost of water they responded to the tariff reform by increasing their water consumption while higher consumption customers who experienced a less severe increase in the total and average charge per gallon reduced their water use moreover 35 detect stronger reactions in the long run than in the short run 58 assess the impact of several rate changes in california between 2010 and 2011 they find that the change from uniform to tiered rates lead to changes in price elasticities from the range 0 22 0 39 to 0 43 0 44 50 estimate price elasticities fell in the range between 0 97 and 1 35 after the change compared to the 0 43 and 0 58 elasticities obtained under the uniform pricing scheme supporting the case for the conservation effects of ibts some other studies explicitly consider heterogeneity among users 59 study a tariff reform involving a general price increase in japan whereby the prices of an ibt increased in 2016 in the middle of the study period 2014 2018 59 estimated five price elasticities by household class and using lcms find three classes of response to the tariff change 5 of households responded sensitively 40 60 slightly and 35 55 did not respond at all 59 suggest two explanations for the non responsive households their lack of concern about water price since the ratio of water bill to total expenditure is only about 1 7 in japan or maybe the difficulty for low consuming households to reduce their water usage further 59 conclude that considering the low water price elasticities found pricing is not a very effective tool to alter household water behavior they also find that price elasticity appeared to be larger for larger uses and that there were no significant differences between the short term effects on elasticities of the price increase and the corresponding effects three years later finally some studies involve field experiments whose design sometimes includes monetary incentives to simulate implicit tariff changes for low consumption users for example 60 assess the impact of both monetary and non monetary experimental treatments finding that households that receive monetary incentives tend to reduce water consumption the literature has addressed the impact of water tariff reforms using different methodologies however to the best of our knowledge only a few papers 34 59 have analyzed the existence of different profile responses to a significant structural change of a water tariff addressing this heterogeneity in consumption patterns after a tariff reform remains a significant issue to be explored in this paper we use an innovative approach to assess this issue which is described in section 4 3 database our empirical exercise exploits two main sources of data first we have information on water consumption per household and water tariffs for a random sample of urban households in four different districts of the city of granada spain these consumption and price data were provided by emasagra 2 2 in 2010 emasagra was a mixed ownership company such that 51 of its capital was owned by the city council and 49 by the agbar group this kind of public private partnership is commonplace in the spanish water sector 61 nowadays the company still keeps most of its capital in public hands but the share of private participation differs slightly from that in 2010 the company in charge of water supply and sewage collection in granada the water supplier provided us with a representative sample of residential users residing in the city center whose water consumption is mainly indoors and who live in relatively older houses 3 3 households in older houses generally decide to adopt efficient electrical appliances or not as opposed to households in newer buildings that include efficient technologies by default in addition a survey was conducted to collect information about several household features 4 4 emasagra provided a random sample of 5 483 customer representative of granada s city centre after a pre test that identified unusable or outdated addresses 5 182 were finally selected for interviewing households were contacted a maximum of four times before being dismissed despite great efforts to obtain valid responses a high percentage of households did not open the door 34 8 many households opened the door but refused to collaborate with answer the survey 20 9 there were also some non occupied apartments and some erroneous addresses only 0 7 of households in the sample 36 were not contacted the response rate was 28 6 the average household size in granada is 2 5 2 7 in our sample the proportion of females is 54 55 in our sample however although the average age in the city is 42 our sample shows 50 likely because users tend to be older in the city center the proportion of newhouse would be about 25 in the population and 25 in our sample overall we expect there to be no substantial lack of representativeness in our sample these included the household s socioeconomic characteristics occupation household size education level housing characteristics age size equipment attitudes towards the environment and conservation habits 5 5 the survey was conducted after the tariff reform a pre test was conducted in october 2011 while the main survey was conducted between 9 november 2011 and february 3 2012 although the survey was carried out in 2011 and therefore we only have socioeconomic information from that year the variables analyzed can be considered time invariant in the short medium term using this information and in order to compare each household at two different moments of time we built a balanced 6 6 originally the panel was unbalanced but in order to maintain comparable data from both years households with incomplete information were eliminated from the final sample panel of 878 households from granada observed during the 12 two month billing periods in 2010 and 2011 resulting in a total of 10 536 observations table 1 shows that there is very little seasonal variation in the average registered consumption per billing period water use across billing periods within the year recorded consumption is somewhat lower after the summer season but otherwise relatively constant the lack of seasonality that one would expect in summer might be explained by the fact that many users leave the city centre when the high temperatures hit granada for the more bearable countryside and seaside secondary residences granada applies an ibt with a fixed water service fee independent of consumption 7 7 the fixed component includes a water supply fee and a sewage collection fee and a set of price blocks as shown in table 2 the tariff was substantially reformed in 2011 most blocks were enlarged but a narrow 2 m3 month first block was introduced at the slightly lower price of 0 9731 to make a basic amount of water more affordable the 1 unit price differential between the third and fourth blocks represented also a substantial increase aimed at reducing higher consumption levels the figures in table 3 show the expected bill amount corresponding to seven different monthly consumption levels in order to facilitate the comparison of the tariffs applied before and after the reform additionally the last column of table 3 includes an index of price escalation in the variable component of the tariff structures used in granada in 2010 and 2011 to this end we adapted the price escalation index proposed by 19 equation 1 p 730 this price escalation measure considers the total water bill corresponding to a representative number of monthly levels of consumption 8 8 however although 19 used 3 m3 month as the first level of monthly consumption we use 2 m3 instead this allows us to capture the marginal price in the first block applied to consumption between 0 and 2 m3 the levels we thus considered in our calculation were 2 5 10 15 20 25 and 50 m 3 month in a given tariff structure selected independently of the size of the price blocks in the tariff the weighted average of the differential between use levels in the effective price per unit is normalized by the unit price corresponding to 25 m 3 of monthly consumption so that when used to compare tariffs across jurisdictions the index is not unduly informed by absolute price levels across tariffs as opposed to relative changes in marginal prices within tariffs the weights are given by the proportion of users consuming in each interval defined by the selected water bill levels so that the formula allocates more weight to the levels of escalation affecting more users although the 2011 tariff reform resulted in a general price increase especially for the heavy water users the degree of price escalation in 2010 and 2011 is similar having only slightly increased under the new tariff incidentally the values we obtained for granada fall very close to the average levels found for a large number of communities in 2000 and 2014 by 19 9 9 see 19 table 5 p 746 in order to ensure comparability between the 2010 and 2011 tariffs we homogenize them by generating a set of consumption synthetic tiers by which we mean that we generated some artificial blocks splitting some of the original blocks to make the two tariffs which originally had a different block structure comparable between 2020 and 2011 fig 1 displays this homogenized tariff structure which results in seven consumption tiers 10 10 note that the figures in table 3 involve the levels of consumption except the first one used in the calculation of price escalation proposed by 19 and are independent of the sizes of the blocks in the actual tariffs used in granada fig 1 more directly describes the actual block distribution used in the tariffs specifically used in granada after the block sizes were artificially adjusted to make them homogeneous between 2010 and 2011 fig 1 displays the tariff schedules in 2010 and 2011 illustrating the use of the synthetic consumption tiers on the one hand the marginal price in each tier differs between 2010 and 2011 however the difference between 2011 and 2010 could be positive as in the case of tiers 2 4 6 and 7 or negative tiers 1 3 5 on the other hand it is possible for two tiers to have the same marginal price in a given year as in the case of tiers 2 and 3 in 2011 depending on their consumption tier after the tariff reform some households could end up facing a higher or lower unit price without changing their consumption levels fig 2 shows the average consumption in each billing period of the two years right before and right after the change of tariff structure in the first two billing periods of 2011 on average households reduced their consumption just like in the fifth billing period however compared to their 2010 counterparts consumption was higher in the third and last billing periods of 2011 fig 3 displays the average marginal price paid in each billing period of the years before and after changing water tariff structure in this case we can clearly see that on average households pay a higher marginal price in 2011 than before the tariff change in order to model the process prompted by the change in the tariff of switching tiers between 2010 and 2011 we propose using a variable based on comparing a given billing period between 2010 and 2011 for each household this variable labeled switch describes the switching across tiers between two corresponding billing periods t capturing both the direction and extent of the switch since we constructed seven consumption tiers switch is a categorical variable which ranges from 6 to 6 taking the following values 0 if the household did not change in its consumption tier in a given billing period in 2011 relative to the corresponding billing period in 2010 a negative value ranging from 1 to 6 to indicate a move to lower tiers between the two years or a positive value 1 to 6 for a move to a higher tier as shown in further detail in table 4 there were no switches across consumption tiers between 2010 and 2011 for a sizable percentage 69 13 of observations in 14 31 of cases there was a switch to an upper tier and surprisingly 16 55 of the households switched to a lower tier table 4 also shows that although most switches involved a move to an immediately lower or higher tier for a non negligible percentage of households the switch involved more than one tier the information contained in this variable was summarized for each household through its mean and standard deviation throughout the six billing periods as variables meanswitch and sdswitch those variables capture the households behavioral changes in terms of water consumption variable meanswitch indicates whether on average the consumption tier has changed relative to the previous year for that household while sdswitch shows the dispersion throughout the year of such changes in tier indicating whether there have been ups and downs that is switches in opposite directions for example if meanswitch is 1 for a given household it means that the household on average has moved to an upper tier synthetic tier if its dispersion is low that means that average change was the result of a relatively systematic change pattern in its consumption always upwards however a high degree of dispersion would suggest that in some periods the household moved to an upper tier and in other to a lower tier if on average it moved up one tier moreover variable mpchange accounts for the difference in marginal prices in per m3 paid in a given billing period between 2010 and 2011 by each household a positive negative value of this variable indicates that the household faced a higher lower marginal price after the tariff reform under the new tariff the change in marginal price can be the result of a change in price for the same level of consumption a change in consumption or both this variable complements switch since the tariff reform was structural involving changes in the size of the tariff s blocks the mean change in marginal prices is positive that is the marginal price paid by households was on average higher in 2011 than in 2010 to summarize the information from the six comparisons between each of the corresponding billing periods for each household the mean and standard deviation of this change in marginal prices paid was calculated as variables meanmpchange and sdmpchange also included in our model finally we consider as independent variable the average daily water consumption 11 11 variable dailym3 was calculated accounting for the exact number of days in each billing period whose length was roughly two months per household in the first billing period of 2011 dailym3 this variable provides information about the level of water consumption for each group 12 12 we consider the recorded level of water consumption in the first billing period of 2011 because that is the first period after the tariff reform and probably when most households started noticing the new tariff it also refers to a period when most users would have stayed at home as opposed to the summer when most families usually take a long holiday break away from the heat in urban granada when modeling the probability of class membership for each household after applying a lcm to identify household types based on their response to the tariff reform 13 13 see section 4 our choice of potential explanatory factors was guided by the extant literature about residential water demand consumption 1 2 4 28 29 62 63 however it is important to recall that in our case we are specifying a model to explain the posterior probabilities of belonging to different household classes within the context of their reacting between two years to changes in the water tariff the expectations about and interpretations of their effects in both types of analysis would not necessarily be the same it is also for this reason that we could only in a limited way ground our hypothesis on the results reported in literature on water demand as such in particular we consider several groups of variables assuming that the socioeconomic characteristics of the households influence their behavior we included in our model the number of household members hsize the proportion of females in the household p female and a variable proxying the household s education level college we attempted to include following 34 also indicators of the age composition of the household since this type of information has sometimes been found relevant in water demand studies whether using household level or aggregate data 1 21 30 57 64 65 there is however no full consensus on the sign of the effects of most commonly the share of over 65 adults and under 18 children on demand and these indicators proved unable to contribute to our modeling of the probability of class membership within our lcm 14 14 we also acknowledge that given the relative fragility of our lcm we were constrained in our choice of model specification by the difficulty to achieve convergence in the estimation the number of members of the household hsize is obviously a variable that affects water demand when measured by household but also when measured in per capita terms 65 67 as 68 find water consumption increases at a lower rate than household size indicating the possible existence of economies of scale however the expected effect of this variable on changes in consumption in reaction to the tariff reform is less clear although we did not have any a priori expectation of what type of influence this variable might have on class membership we used the proportion of females in the household p female this is because household makeup has been considered as a potential factor in the water conservation literature and also because women and men could be expected to have different patterns of water end use behavior attitudes towards water conservation and degrees of accurate perception of their own water use although the available research in this area is far from conclusive 63 67 69 76 15 15 for instance while 77 suggest that women are more committed to water conservation 78 find gender not significant 79 show that women follow more conservation practices making better use of water for preparing food and turning off the tap while brushing teeth while 80 do not find gender a significant factor to explain the accuracy of perceptions of the water tariff consumption or cost similarly we consider an indicator of the level of education of the household since there are precedents if again no conclusive evidence in the literature that it might be a factor both in terms of water use perception of tariffs and own consumption as well as attitudes towards conservation 65 67 71 74 77 81 82 in terms of housing features we considered the age of the house newhouse if the house has been renovated in recent years renovated and the existence of efficient appliances app effic we included also attitudinal and behavioral factors expected to affect water consumption decisions a water saving habits index habitindex 16 16 this index was constructed as the proportion of habits adopted by the household out of the eight we proposed six of the eight habits we considered were used in q19 of the questionnaire available here used by 83 these habits are usually mentioned in educational campaigns by water suppliers and public authorities the verbatim description used for each habit is available in theappendix we added the habits of being watchful with water while brushing teeth and washing cars while removing a question about the use of washers and dishwashers since not all of our respondents would own them and one and using double flow toilets in our view more a question about water saving equipment rather than habits and a variable indicating the respondent s stated concern about the environment enviro in order to try and capture the household s knowledge about tariffs and other water consumption issues we included an indicators of knowledge of the water supplier s website web the existence of an environmental campaign to promote reductions in water consumption in the past five years campaign the structure of water tariff tariff and the size of the water bill underbill which indicates that the user underestimates the actual bill a broader description of the variables is available in table 5 while table 6 provides summary statistics of the variables used in the analysis as shown in table 6 the average household is composed of 2 7 family members with an average proportion of females of 55 in 67 of the households the first second or both family members have postsecondary education the average daily consumption in the first billing period of 2011 was 249 liters per household about 33 of respondents live in homes that are less than 30 years old and 40 of respondents had made renovations within the last five years some 81 of respondents declared to be very concerned about the environment while 55 are aware of educational campaigns on water saving and 22 know the water supplier s website 17 17 most water bills in spain are paid through direct billing so they do not even need to check the amount owed additionally in 2010 emasagra started promoting the use of e bills but customers still received paper bills in 2011 the proportion of e bills issued was still negligible 84 about 29 of the households own efficient water appliances dishwashers and or washing machines when it comes to information about water prices it is noteworthy that 35 of respondents know the structure of the water tariff but in 49 of cases respondents underestimate their water bill 18 18 moreover 51 of respondents overestimate the water bill while only 4 1 estimates their bill within a 15 margin of error finally around 42 of the households spend more than a month a year away from home and 75 of the respondents consider themselves satisfied with life in general 4 methodology our aim is to identify different groups of consumers according to their switching patterns across the spectrum of consumption tiers to do so we use a particular case of generalized structural equation model gsem that fits models with categorical latent variables namely latent class analysis lca in lcms we assume that the sample of individuals is drawn from a population that is a finite mixture of c distinct subpopulations 85 ch 18 the unobserved levels of a categorical latent variable are known as latent classes which in our model represent groups of consumers with different unobservable preferences behaviors lca allows for the possibility of modeling distinct parameters for each class of household and estimating the probability of belonging to each class we are interested in identifying different switching profiles and examining what drives the probabilities of belonging to each class c the latter are estimated using a fractional multinomial logistic regression specified as follows 1 π c e γ c z i c 1 c e γ c z i c 1 c where z is a vector of exogenous variables γ c are parameters to be estimated in the multinomial logit model by default the first class will be treated as the benchmark class our lcm groups households into distinct classes based on their values of five dependent variables meanswitch sdswitch meanmpchange sdmpchange and dailym3 and explains the probabilities of belonging to each class using independent variables described in section 3 19 19 stata s command gsem was used to estimate the lcm when applying lcms the appropriate number of classes must be determined prior to conducting the estimation we follow the usual strategy of successively estimating several models with an increasing number of classes and choosing the best fitting model according to statistical information criteria usually the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic 5 results several versions of the lcm were estimated based on an increasing number of classes the corresponding information criteria statistics are shown in table 7 according to the aic and to a lesser extent the bic the preferred estimation is a model with five distinct classes 20 20 for a thorough description of the issues behind the choice of the number of classes according to information criteria see 86 the bic criterion worsens with five classes so it suggests using only four in contrast the aic criterion shows an improvement from considering more than four classes we cautiously chose to restrict the analysis to five classes based on these statistical criteria and also to avoid overly complicating the interpretation of the different classes in particular we note that the predicted distribution of households among six classes according to the modal probabilities suggested by our postestimation analysis would result in classes with rather similar sizes which would cast doubt on the soundness of their interpretation table 8 shows the results of the lcms with five classes in terms of the determinants of class membership indicated in broad qualitative terms by the untransformed coefficients of the fractional multinomial logit whose benchmark category is class 1 table 9 displays predicted class memberships based on the modal posterior class probability 21 21 all households have non zero predicted probabilities of belonging to each class so it might seem somewhat arbitrary to them according to the class for which their predicted probability is highest however entropy values 87 close to 1 as the one shown in table 9 indicate a clear delineation of classes justifying the notion of allocating households to a single given class out the five and a brief class description based on the marginal means of five variables the largest proportion of households with mean predicted probabilities of 42 and 29 are most likely to belong to classes 1 and 3 followed by classes 5 and 4 16 and 9 respectively the predicted mean probability of membership of class 2 is the lowest of the five groups 4 below using the information available in tables 8 and 9 we label and describe these household classes class 1 the reference class in our model is predicted to be the largest and labeled the indifferent according to the first column in table 9 although that meant that the marginal price they paid was noticeably higher households in class 1 hardly moved to a higher consumption tier between 2010 and 2011 these families consume an average of close to 200 liters per day which is the second lowest consumption level households with a modal predicted probability placing them in class 2 are the most rare 4 registering the lowest water consumption levels some 90 liters day we label them seasonal since the figures in table 8 suggest that they probably spend long periods away from home on average class 2 households faced a slightly higher marginal price and moved to a much lower tier in 2011 class 3 contains a sizeable share 29 of households we label the informed group as shown in table 8 it is relatively likely for them to know the supplier s webpage and the tariff schedule their consumption tier in 2011 is on average slightly lower than in 2010 however their marginal price increased after the tariff change they consume a daily average of 307 liters slightly higher than the average consumption in the city like class 2 class 4 is expected to be small 9 however in contrast to class 2 these families register the highest consumption levels 338 liters day they on average moved to a substantially higher consumption tier and to face marginal price increases again on average however the standard deviation of their responses to the tariff change suggests that these households do not have a consistent behavioral pattern consequently we chose to label them the careless although they are the heaviest consumers along the considered period they increased their consumption climbing to a higher consumption tier in 2011 moreover and according to table 8 they are less likely to claim having water conservation habits than households in the other classes finally class 5 with a predicted share of 16 of households in the population would attract the label environmentally aware these households consume on average 278 liters day the lowest consumption level among the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 in response to the tariff reform they substantially reduced their consumption to move to a lower tier and managed to pay a lower marginal price like the careless class above they show high variability in their yearly patterns further details related to key drivers of the probabilities belonging to each class are shown in table 8 households that spend more days a year away from home that have fewer members that own fewer efficient appliances and that are less environmentally concerned are more likely to belong to the seasonal class 2 than to the reference class 1 furthermore those who underestimate their water bills are also more likely to be among these seasonal households compared to the reference class the opposite is observed in the case of the informed class 3 and the careless class 4 and the environmentally aware class 5 underestimating one s bill reduces makes it less likely to belong to these classes than to the reference class the probability of belonging to classes 3 4 and 5 is higher than for the reference class for larger households while the opposite applies in the case of class 2 as mentioned previously knowing about the tariffs and the webpage of the supplier makes it more likely to belong to the informed class than to the reference class households that are less satisfied with life in general environmentally concerned and who know the supplier s webpage are relatively more likely to belong in the environmentally aware class 5 finally having fewer water saving habits and being unaware of water saving campaigns although while being better informed about tariffs increases the probability of belonging among the careless households class 4 than to belong to the reference class 6 discussion fig 4 displays average marginal effects 22 22 these marginal or discrete when applicable effects are first calculated for each individual in the sample and then averaged across individuals except for the cases of the variables whose values we specifically set the values of all relevant variables are thus kept during the calculation at the actual individual values related to four selected variables that would be potential candidates for policy variables we consider three variables related to information web tariff and underbill and one variable linked to environmental attitudes enviro we display how the marginal effects vary depending on household size 23 23 note that hsize is a variable that significantly explains the membership in different classes although information on household size is not always publicly available the water supplier could easily obtain data on family size at least when customers apply for special tariffs based on this criterion for the sake of economy of space although fig 4 displays marginal effects corresponding to all five classes we limit our discussion below to the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 being relatively well informed affects the probability of belonging to several user classes for instance knowing the supplier s website increases the probability of belonging among the environmentally aware class 5 and the informed class 3 by up to 10 and up to 6 respectively similarly knowing the tariff schedule is associated with an increase in the probability of belonging to the informed class of about 7 however these variables have a slight negative effect on the probability of being among the indifferent class 1 moreover those who underestimate their bill are between 8 and 15 more likely to belong to class 1 environmentally friendly attitudes increase the probability of belonging to class 5 by more than 10 this class of household had exhibited good environmental behaviors since they substantially reduced their consumption tier due to the nonlinearity of the model the effects of the drivers on class membership depend on the values of all variables we showcase this with reference to the case of household size for instance when it comes to the probability of belonging to classes 3 the informed or 5 the environmentally aware knowledge of the tariffs and the supplier s website generally show stronger marginal effects for smaller size households surprisingly though the impact of underestimating one s bill on the probability of belonging to classes 3 and 5 increases with household size therefore even though the impacts of this variable are usually negative in the case of class 3 its marginal effect becomes positive for households larger than seven members this exemplifies how our findings would be relevant in terms of policy design since they allow to tailor interventions to different sociodemographic profiles table 10 shows how the average levels of consumption changed between 2010 and 2011 for each household class although the effect of the tariff is very different across classes 24 24 we also note that the predicted to be the largest classes classes 1 3 and 5 show the more modest average reactions to the tariff change the stronger effects shown table 10 correspond to the much smaller classes 2 and 4 the overall effect of the adoption of the new tariff format is very limited this finding is in line with the study by 34 25 25 in order to assess the impact of this tariff reform in granada 34 included in their demand function an interaction term between the binary indicator for the year 2011 and the average price in granada and with other empirical applications in other geographical locations that report a moderate impact on water use of tariff reforms involving ibts as mentioned in section 2 2 that fact does not necessarily means that tariff design has no impact on water conservation but rather that this impact might often be more modest than expected depending on the target population and a variety of other circumstances 88 more in line with the main theme of our study we can also see that the tariff reform had a relatively modest impact when it comes to the rearrangement of users among consumption blocks and their moving towards or away from the borderline consumption levels defined in the tariffs this issue is discussed below as the figures in tables 11 and 12 are presented overall however it is not too surprising to see that in general only the largest users who pay the highest unit prices at the margin find it worthwhile to pay relatively closer attention to the tariff structure to the extent that consumers in the lowest use block are also among the ones with lowest incomes and because the increase in unit price in the second block was substantial their reaction in their case also in line with theoretical expectations is also less of a surprise 26 26 89 found similar differences across income levels in terms of reactions to ibts but for most of the users the water bill is not large enough to merit much consideration of the tariff and its adjustment table 11 displays the shares of users consuming within each of the synthetic tiers we considered to make the two tariffs structures comparable it shows that except for the case of the blocks corresponding to heavier uses the proportion of users falling within a given tier changes in most cases in the same direction as the unit price for that block for example the 2 8 m 3 tier attracted users although its price substantially increased the opposite occurred in the case of the 8 10 tier the unit price decreased substantially but the share of users decreased between 2020 and 2011 only for the lowest level of consumption indeed one of the key targets of the tariff reform and the two tiers associated with the largest uses do we find a pattern more in line with theoretical expectations the price and the proportion of users changed in opposite directions table 12 shows that the change in tariff basically did not alter the proportion of users clustering bunching within the neighborhood of the block border here measured as consuming within one cubic metre of the kink in the budget line that the 2011 tariff would impose one would expect a relative degree of bunching around those levels of consumption when they were indeed dividing blocks in the tariff but much less clustering otherwise this is because a theoretical response to the marginal price would accumulate users theoretically at the kinks if in practice just around the kinks 90 91 the fact that by and large there are no differences suggests that most users make little efforts to optimize in a theoretically expected way their level of water use under an ibt as 92 p 538 mentioned the absence of bunching implies either that i consumers respond to marginal price with zero elasticity or that ii they respond to alternative price although empirical evidence on bunching in this context is unclear 89 93 and the fact is that the presence or absence of this behavior is directly related to price perception issues and the quality of information that users have about water tariffs in our analysis knowing the structure of the tariff increases the probability to be in the group with the most rational behavior consumption reductions under price increases this finding probably supports the idea that tariff reforms must be accompanied by strong informational campaigns explaining the new tariff structure and making it more comprehensive for all kind of users 7 conclusions the aim of this paper is to analyze behavioral profiles before and after a change in residential water tariffs to this end we examine changes in the consumption tiers and marginal prices paid across billing periods in 2010 the base year and 2011 following a modification of the tariff scheme and its price levels that comparison is not straightforward because both the size and the prices of each consumption block in the tariff were modified so comparability required the constructing of artificial consumption tiers by merging the tariffs applied in 2010 and 2011 we also assume that sociodemographic variables do not change in the period considered in this study we identify five distinct profiles of users certain households class 5 the environmentally aware group who are more likely to be concerned about the environment tend to reduce their consumption tier we also detect two other household classes classes 2 and 3 for whom there is an inverse link between water prices and consumption as it would be expected according to standard economic theory compared to those in the benchmark class households in these groups are less likely underestimating their bill households in what we label the informed class 3 are more likely to be familiar with the supplier s webpage and the tariff schedule information which users not always find worthwhile to obtain is essential to adopt efficient decisions however deficiencies in the levels of user information are pervasive when it comes to the design of public policies in the residential water sector water suppliers should consider the use of different tools websites mobile phone apps etc to nudge households in order to improve their level of information on water tariffs or bill our contribution is twofold on the one hand this is to our knowledge the first study of the switching behavior across water consumption tiers after a tariff change using this methodology on the other hand we identify different response patterns among water customers that we link to their socioeconomic characteristics their environmental concerns and their knowledge about water consumption and water prices knowing how different types of households are expected to respond to changes in the structure of water tariffs and in what proportions would help to anticipate the effect of future changes in tariffs or price levels would have on water consumption for example suppliers and planners might be interested in predicting whether changing the size of the tariff blocks for the same level of consumption would increase the final price of water would mostly lead to a general reduction in water consumption or if on the contrary would lead only certain users such as those most environmentally aware or those best informed about the details of the tariff to reduce their consumption unfortunately our analysis addresses the issue of the effectiveness of water tariffs from a short run perspective only since no data are available to observe if the profiles detected are stable or instead change over time a long run analysis would require much more information on sociodemographics and water consumption prices throughout several years moreover our findings are related to a specific context a city located in southern spain so they are not necessarily transferable to other areas however and despite these limitations this research contributes to the understanding of water pricing by adopting an original approach to address a frequent topic in the water demand literature the impact of water tariff reforms the availability of better datasets in the future would make it possible to exploit this approach to its full potential

8648,using event study methodology this paper examined the effects of water environment regulations on the stock prices of polluting chinese firms over the past decade it was found that there were relatively weak market responses to regulations passed by the national people s congress china s top legislative body and more significant market responses to regulations implemented by less powerful administrations in particular the market reaction in various industries to the state council s water ten plan was instant and strong while most water environment regulations had negative effects on heavy polluters some recent regulations had positive wealth effects because water environment regulations have different effects on shareholder values in different industries these results could

and environmental protection relationships has become a challenge in developing countries as the largest developing country china s environmental problems especially water quality problems have attracted world attention in particular 18 8 of the 10 168 national groundwater monitoring sites were found to have extremely poor water quality in 2019 and in 2017 china discharged 69 97 billion tonnes of sewage an increase of 68 51 over 2000 which included 10 22 million tonnes of chemical oxygen demand and 1 40 million tonnes of ammonia nitrogen 1 1 data come from china water resources bulletin and china statistical yearbook released in 2020 because of china s increasing environmental pollution the chinese government committed to the formulation and implementation of environmental protection regulations for which a hierarchical policy system was established comprising the national people s congress the state council the national development and reform commission and other ministries at various levels with regulatory importance depending on the rank of the department issuing the regulations promulgations passed by the national people s congress take precedence followed by those from the state council the national development and reform commission and the ministry of environmental protection 1 with a focus on the dual economic development and environmental protection goals strict industrial practice environmental regulations were issued to standardize industry behavior and promote economic development 2 however the industry effects of these hierarchical environmental regulations have not yet been fully explored significant studies have examined the industry effects of environmental regulations on productivity and financial performance however no consensus has been reached environmental regulations such as technological standards environmental taxes or tradable emissions permits have forced industries to reallocate labor and capital to implement pollution reduction measures 3 with the consequent cost of compliance and the reduction in available resources for investment and research resulting in a decline in financial performances and having a detrimental effect on industry profits 4 or tobin s q 5 however the porter hypothesis argues that properly designed environmental regulations should stimulate innovation and increase productivity 6 7 with many studies also finding that stringent environmental regulations can motivate technological innovation 8 13 well designed regulations could provide a sound basis for industry resource investment as regulated companies could protect themselves from certain market risks and become better investment targets 14 the effects of environmental regulations and the associated policy instruments have been found to widely differ with some industries or sectors being adversely affected and others being positively affected 1 15 20 however most previous studies have tended to conduct pre and post performance analyses for a single regulation with few examining the policy effects of regulations issued by the different legislative bodies because china has a hierarchical policy making system it has the ideal experimental setting to examine capital market responses to the water environment regulations from the different government levels in heavy polluting industry sectors the companies in which are already under pressure to reduce emissions and strengthen their water environment governance therefore this study sought to determine the capital market responses to the hierarchical water regulations from the different levels of government and the implementation of costly pollution control measures to assess whether green governance could lead to positive sustainable industry transformations the impacts of the water environment regulations from the different levels of government on regulated firms were measured using the cumulative abnormal stock price returns stock price returns are a reliable measure of company performance as they reflect current operating conditions reputation and development prospects 21 previous studies in various countries have also used stock prices to examine the impact of environmental regulations and have come to varying conclusions 22 26 the analysis of the impact of china s water environment regulations over the past decade found that the market responses had a dynamic time effect and particular industry patterns short term market reactions to the water pollution prevention and control legislation enacted by the npc were found to be less significant than the reactions to state council and ministry issued administrative regulations with the water ten plan 2 2 water ten plan short for action plan for prevention and control of water pollution is a regulation enacted by the state council of china in 2015 to strengthen the prevention and control of water pollution and ensure water security issued by the state council being the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history because the chinese public has become increasingly environmentally conscious in recent years and believes that the development of green economies and clean production can improve production technology and the green transformation of polluting firms a greater number of industries have had positive cumulative average abnormal returns caars after 2016 this paper has three main contributions first few studies based on previous theories and event study methodology have focused on the impact of hierarchical water environment regulations on heavily water polluting industries second the impacts of the regulations are examined over time from which it was found that some recent regulations have had significantly positive wealth effects for heavy polluters third the different effects of the water environment regulations on shareholder value by industry were examined from which it was found that nitrogenous fertilizer companies were at greater risk from the long term negative impacts of the water environment regulations the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the sample collection section 3 details the methodology and data sources section 4 presents the empirical results and discussion and section 5 concludes the paper 2 sample selection and description 2 1 hierarchical water environment regulations regulations protect the public s rights and interests as environmental regulations are generally promulgated to control pollution and or improve the ecological environment regulatory punishments for pollution violations are also part of environmental policies in almost every industrialized country 27 two main regulatory tools are used in china command and control cac regulations and market based instruments mbi 28 however china s environmental policy system is generally dominated by cac regulations 29 that use legislative and administrative means to ensure enterprise compliance with non compliance being subject to penalties and fines mbis however tend to use market mechanisms such as price and quantitative instruments and incentive measures to guide enterprises to reduce their emissions in china the government takes the lead policy formulation and implementation role unlike the mbis which encourage enterprises to voluntarily participate in market transactions cac regulations have absolute control and supervision rights that allow the prescription of particular product designs manufacturing methods and pollution control technologies 30 based on the organization for economic co operation and development oecd classification 31 and previous studies 30 the cac regulations and mbis in china fall mainly into the categories outlined in table 1 as cac regulations and mbis are the most common policy instruments in china this paper focused on these two types table 2 lists some sample regulations extracted from wolters kluwer china law and reference database because the first water environment regulations were announced in 2010 to match the stock price data of the listed firms the search covered the period from january 1 2010 to december 31 2019 and included documents issued by the national people s congress the state council the national development and reform commission the ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of ecology and environment the national people s congress npc is china s highest legislative body and the state council is the highest administrative body the npc enacts and revises laws and supervises their implementation and the state council formulates administrative measures enacts administrative regulations and issues decisions and orders the national development and reform commission implements guidelines policies and development and reform work plans and similar to the u s environmental protection agency the ministry of environmental protection protects and enhances the environment to the fullest extent possible under the laws enacted by the npc 32 based on the institutional reforms to the state council approved at the first session of the 13th national people s congress in march 2018 the ministry of ecology and environment was established by integrating the functions and responsibilities of the ministry of environmental protection these government agencies form a hierarchical framework for the formulation and implementation of water environment regulations over the past decade chinese authorities have attached greater importance to water environmental protection in 2011 the ministry of environmental protection announced a list of 334 national key monitoring sewage treatment plants in which the supervisory monitoring results exceeded the standard in 2013 the mep first announced three water pollutant discharge standards and then published a document on the sewage charges at centralized urban sewage treatment facilities which was the first time since 2010 that officials had detailed sewage charge standards and calculation methods and laid the foundations for an environmental tax in october 2013 the state council promulgated regulations on urban drainage and sewage treatment to ensure safe urban drainage and sewage treatment facility operations in 2014 the ndrc issued interim measures for the management of water pollution prevention and control projects in key river basins which detailed the project implementation standards in 2015 a water pollution prevention and control action plan aimed at the small scale paper iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals textiles geoprocessing pharmaceuticals leather pesticides and electroplating industries was issued which completely banned severely polluting production that was not in line with national policies this plan which was referred to as the water ten plan was strict with the ministry of environmental protection predicting that its implementation would boost gdp growth by about 5 7 trillion cny and increase the environmental protection industry output value by about 1 9 trillion cny of which about 1 4 trillion cny would be from the direct purchase of products and services a previous study 33 found that the water ten plan significantly improved the industrial water pollution problems in china the npc published a draft amendment to the water pollution prevention and control law in december 2016 3 3 in china before they come into force legislative regulations issued by the npc go through several stages agenda setting inter agency review top leadership approval of a draft npc deliberation and implementation in accordance with legal procedures 34 on june 27 2017 the draft passed the npc standing committee and the revised water pollution prevention and control law was formally implemented which improved existing systems and made innovation and breakthroughs a legal responsibility for example it set clear boundaries for illegality perfected the total emissions control system for key water pollutants expanded the punishment scope and established new penalty methods in 2018 the pollutant discharge permit management measures on trial were further refined the original interim provisions strengthened and the penalty clause supplemented with the pollutant discharge permit management measures on trial resolving total enterprise pollutant discharge control legal liability problems in 2019 eleven national environmental protection standards were approved which included sewage monitoring technical specifications and ecological environment monitoring regulations overall ten water environment regulations enacted by the different government agencies were included in this study 2 2 companies it was surmised that the announcement of stringent environmental regulations would increase the risks for the heavily polluting companies directly affected by these water environment regulations following jin et al 35 and referring to the water pollution prevention and control action plan the shenwan industry classification was used to divide the existing company sample into nine industry sectors table 3 which included the highest water polluting industries paper iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals textiles agroprocessing pharmaceuticals pesticides and electroplating 36 the sample comprised 242 listed companies on the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges all of which were high water polluting industries supervised by the water environment regulations table 3 gives a breakdown of the number of companies in each subsample nonferrous metals accounted for 33 1 of the sample followed by pharmaceuticals 23 6 iron and steel 12 4 textiles agroprocessing paper pesticides nitrogenous fertilizer from 2 to 9 and electroplating 0 8 table 4 gives the sample firm statistics based on the last closing day for the most recent quarter preceding february 6 2020 from which it can be seen that the pharmaceuticals industry had the highest average market capitalization the iron and steel industry had the largest staff size and sales revenue and profits and the agroprocessing and nitrogenous fertilizer sample had the highest asset liability ratios and therefore the higher financial risks 3 methodology and data based on the efficient markets hypothesis emh company information is quickly transmitted to the stock market with the stock price anomalously changing based on the stakeholders judgments with a focus on stock returns fama et al 37 and brown and warner 38 developed the event study methodology to quantify the impact of an event on stock prices which has consequently become the most widely adopted method to study event impacts 21 39 42 therefore this methodology was used to estimate the abnormal returns and evaluate the effect of the environmental regulations on company performances the first step was to choose an event window within which the abnormal returns were to be estimated for which calendar time was converted into event time for example day 0 was the day the regulation was announced day 1 was the trading day following the event and day 1 was the last trading day before the event as it was assumed that there were no other events within the event windows to exclude the influence of unrelated events on the stock prices the event window had to be relatively short normally under the belief that information is quickly incorporated into the stock market event window periods are set at one or two days however as capital markets in developing countries are generally less efficient than those in developed countries 23 the environmental news response time is slower therefore guided by previous studies 23 43 the caars were calculated over a period of five trading days to capture investor reactions to the announcements to ensure robustness the caars were also reported over both shorter and longer event periods for instance three 10 and 20 trading days as stated as longer event periods can be affected by other extraneous events the primary focus was on interpreting the stock market reactions over the five day event period as in other studies 1 44 the estimation window used to estimate expected returns was 240 trading days a one year estimation period as it was possible that information may have leaked before the major policy decision was formally published it was surmised that this could have influenced shareholder expectations therefore in the estimation period the data from ten trading days before the event day were excluded with the estimation window length starting at day 250 and ending at day 11 the second step was to identify the abnormal returns which are the actual stock returns minus the returns that would have been realized if the event had not taken place expected returns the hypothesis was that when the stringent water environment regulations were announced the highly polluting companies would experience negative abnormal returns traditional capital asset pricing models capm only use market risk factors to describe portfolio or stock returns however fama and french 45 added size risk and value risk factors to the capm to reflect stocks that had smaller market capitalization and higher book to market ratios which tended to do better than the market in 2015 fama and french 46 adapted their model to include five factors market risk size risk value risk profitability and investment under the assumption that companies reporting higher future earnings would have higher stock market returns and companies that directed their profit toward major growth projects would be more likely to suffer losses the fama french five factor model has been found to provide better estimates for expected returns in event studies 1 r i t r f t α i β i r m t r f t s i s m b t h i h m l t r i r m w t c i c m a t ε i t where r i t is the return on stock

obtained as 5 c a a r t 1 t 2 1 n i 1 n c a r i t 1 t 2 the third step was to test the statistical significance of the abnormal returns as the regulation was issued on the same calendar day for all sample firms there can be cross sectional correlations when events occur in multiple companies on the same day kolari and pynnönen 47 proposed a new test statistic that modified the patell test to account for the cross correlation of abnormal returns first patell 48 suggested that scaled abnormal returns sars should be used for statistical tests which are defined as 6 s a r i t a r i t 1 1 l 1 p 1 r m t r m 2 t 250 11 r m t r m 2 s a r i where s a r i is the regression residual standard deviation l 1 is the length of the estimation window p is the number of explanatory variables in the

kolari and pynnönen 47 a cross correlation adjusted scaled t ratio adj patell was defined as shown in equations 7 and 8 the test statistic for testing h0 aar 0 is given by 7 t a a r s a r t n l 1 p 1

asset management research center 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects on the stock price the full sample effects of the water environment regulations on the stock prices are shown in table 5 as noted the focus was on the caars for days 0 5 however the caars for days 0 3 days 0 10 and days 0 20 were also reported to identify the short term responses and the long term change patterns for all heavy polluting companies regulations 1 2 3 4 7 9 and 10 had significant market responses in three trading days however the response to regulation 7 was only significant at a10 level within three trading days that is its effect was weak and short lived similarly regulation 10 s impact strength declined in the long run which implied that while the market perceived these events as unusual it did not see the impacts as being long lasting the effects of regulations 5 6 and 8 on all heavy polluters were insignificant in the short term and the caars for regulation 6 only became significant after 20 trading days which seemed inconsistent with the higher political and social status of the water ten plan therefore to better identify the impacts on different industries and prevent offsets between industries the impacts of the water environment regulations on the subsamples were further explored table 6 table 6 primarily focuses on the caars for days 0 5 with the caars for all the event windows days 0 3 days 0 5 days 0 10 days 0 20 shown in appendix a the findings based on the above results are summarized in the following 4 1 1 different responses to the hierarchical regulations table 5 shows that regulations 1 2 3 4 9 and 10 had significant strong market reactions on all heavy polluters these regulations were enacted by mep 1 2 3 9 mee 10 and sc 4 regulation 6 water ten plan which was promulgated by sc was found to have the most significant effect on the water polluting industry companies with most showing significant caars 0 5 table 6 and five showing significant caars in three trading days see appendix a in particular the paper nitrogenous fertilizer and electroplating industry caars were all significant at a 1 level for days 0 3 the negative effects of the water ten plan were mostly extreme on the nitrogenous fertilizer industry which continued for days 0 20 which indicated that the market reacted quickly and strongly to the promulgation of this regulation and continued to trade for up to 20 trading days which confirmed that the sc water ten plan was the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history as shown in table a1 in appendix a the caars within five trading days of regulations 7 and 8 were relatively weak although seven industries were affected by regulation 8 fewer industries showed significant market responses compared to the water ten plan the npc regulations had weaker market responses which did not appear to align with the market attention given to npc rulings significant impacts were more often observed 20 trading days after the promulgation of the water pollution prevention and control law which may have been because the market needed more time to assess the long term impacts of these more abstract laws in recent years administrative regulations issued by the ministries commissions and sc departments have become major chinese legislative components 49 because there are a significantly greater number of administrative regulations than laws most of which are generally more specific in their implementation the state council and ministries issued administrative regulations such as instructions orders and rules to elucidate the implementation of the laws passed by the npc 50 therefore the investors short term reactions to the npc s water pollution prevention and control legislation were less significant than their reactions to some other regulations 4 1 2 shift in investor attitudes the driving hypothesis was that the stringent water environment regulation announcements would result in negative abnormal returns for the heavy polluters however the empirical results revealed that this was not necessarily the case from the results shown in fig 1 and table 5 most regulations had a significant negative impact in the shorter or longer term but there was a noticeable shift in investor attitudes fig 1 shows the number of positive and negative cumulative abnormal returns for days 0 5 on each announcement date over the sample period interestingly more positive cars were observed after 2016 however the announcement of the pollutant discharge permit management on trial measures in 2018 resulted in negative cars as shown in table 5 three regulations that were respectively enacted in 2016 2017 and 2019 resulted in significant positive effects regulation 10 had the most significant short term positive market responses and the positive effects of regulation 8 strengthened over time table 7 shows the number of industries that were significantly negatively or positively affected by the regulations from which it can be seen that except for the pollutant discharge permit management on trial measures announcement more industries had positive caars after 2016 which proved the robustness of the above results further the regulation 10 impacts on two industries were both positive and immediate therefore it was concluded that the market investor reactions to the water environment regulations were not overwhelmingly negative or positive this shift in investor attitudes may be good news for heavy polluters as some investors were bullish on the positive benefits of the water environment regulations for regulation 8 which was the water pollution prevention and control law a greater number of investors decided to buy stock with this positive attitude being evident over time investors also saw regulation 10 as being 100 good news for two heavily polluting industries as these listed firms gradually acquired larger significant positive wealth effects the implementation of some water environment regulations seemed to meet the market needs to a certain extent therefore water environment regulation compliance by the heavy polluters was seen by stakeholders as a directly responsible act a fulfillment of their corporate social responsibility and an elevation of their corporate reputations the chinese public has become increasingly environmentally conscious and has a much clearer understanding of china s environmental protection system for example market investors have found that developing green economies and promoting clean production can accelerate economic growth transformation from extensive to intensive and lead to production technology improvements in polluting firms therefore well designed regulations can provide the public with official information on investment resources which means that these regulated firms have become better investment targets these findings were consistent with lanoie et al 51 which concluded that stringent regulations can have a positive effect by giving polluting firms the opportunity to identify and eliminate inefficiencies regulation 9 was the only regulation that had significant negative effects on four industries it appeared that the investors regarded the implementation of the pollutant discharge permit system as bad news for industries that had serious water pollution problems as the pollutant discharge permit system drafts included strong administrative regulations 52 many investors believed that the implementation of the emissions permit systems would require substantial investment in environmental protection equipment by the heavy polluters to meet the standards this result was consistent with previous studies that found that environmental regulations increased compliance costs and led to negative portfolio returns 22 24 4 1 3 heterogeneous industry responses table 8 shows the regulations that had significant effects on the subsamples for robustness all results during all event windows were reported in an attempt to explore the sensitivities of the different industry market responses the days when the caars became significant were recorded from which the following was found 1 the paper industry always showed significantly positive and instant market reactions however 20 trading days after the promulgation of regulation 4 the significantly paper industry positive reaction turned negative however this did not affect the main conclusion that firms in the paper industry had positive wealth effects after the announcement of the water environment regulations 2 the caars for the pharmaceuticals companies were all insignificant for days 0 5 and only became significantly negative for one regulation after a longer period therefore the pharmaceutical industry polluters were not significantly affected by the introduction of the water environment regulations 3 iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals were the top three industries significantly and negatively affected by the regulations with the nonferrous metals polluters being found to be the most sensitive to the water environment regulations with most caars being statistically significant for days 0 5 and all event windows 4 the caars for the agroprocessing companies were significant after 20 trading days which was a longer time than in the other industries 5 the regulations had the greatest positive impact on the electroplating industry however investor attitude was not always consistent which indicated that the electroplating industry needed to pay attention to the possible effects of environmental regulations the three industries that were significantly negatively affected were further analyzed from which it was found that the nitrogenous fertilizer industry had suffered the strongest negative impacts table 6 with the negative caars still significant after 20 trading days see appendix a these results indicated that the water environment regulation impacts on the nitrogenous fertilizer industry were significantly negative and sustained which indicated that nitrogenous fertilizer companies are facing greater challenges from the water environment regulations than companies in the other industries there are many small and medium sized firms in the nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals industries with some having failed to meet the environmental standards and accumulated large debts therefore in the long run the nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals industries are at greater risk from environmental protection regulations as these regulations will inevitably raise the entry threshold and industry operating costs the iron and steel industry a pillar industry with a large production capacity in china is facing serious problems such as high energy consumption high pollution and extensive management therefore the compliance pressure from environmental protection regulations such as the pollution discharge permit system could significantly increase production costs which means that investors would be more likely to negatively respond to these industries while the pharmaceutical industry companies appeared to be less sensitive to the water environment regulation announcements it is possible that negative returns may occur over the long term only one of the ten regulations showed a significant market reaction after 20 trading days see appendix a china s pharmaceutical industry has been growing rapidly primarily because china has become the main global low cost pharmaceutical producer and is the world s second largest pharmaceutical market by value 53 as can be seen from the market value the pharmaceutical industry was the largest of the sample industries table 4 zhao et al 1 argued that as large firms have comparative financial human and technical resource advantages they are more able to comply with environmental regulations however the pharmaceutical industry s water pollution is still serious in past decades because of the frequent overuse of medicines and the incomplete removal of pharmaceutical residues pharmaceutical wastewater is either treated in sewage treatment plants or directly discharged into the water environment which has increased the frequency of medical residues in the water environment 54 therefore investors cannot judge the impact degree in the pharmaceutical industry or they need a longer time to judge the regulation impacts that is investors appear to be taking a wait and see attitude the research results further indicated the risks that different industries might face based on the divergent market responses paper industry stocks seemed to be the safest choice followed by the electroplating industry however as the electroplating industry stocks also exhibited some negative reactions investing in this industry sector may not always be an effective way to guard against water environment regulation risk therefore short term exposure to pharmaceutical stocks seems to be a more stable option however investors need to be aware of the possible long term risks one possible way for investors to reduce their losses from policy shocks would be to avoid investing in the iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals and agroprocessing stocks especially as the first three industries have been found to have the largest holding risks after the enactment of all water environment regulations 4 2 robustness tests to assess the robustness of the findings the analysis was continued by considering different estimation windows conducting a non parametric test and using the fama french three factor model then to exclude the general market trend influences the non water polluting company responses to the water environment regulations were also examined using the propensity score matching psm method normally a minimum estimation window of 100 trading days ensures that the regression has not been unduly impacted by outliers 55 following armitage 56 an estimation window of 300 trading days was therefore used to estimate the expected returns corrado 57 first proposed a nonparametric rank test for abnormal security price performances in event studies however as this test was derived for single day event windows it could lose its power when the event window is wider kolari and pynnönen 58 utilized corrado s 57 rank testing approach and proposed a new nonparametric generalized rank test grank t that could be used on both single day and cars therefore grank t was used for the robustness tests because it outperformed previous caar rank tests and was robust to the cross correlation of returns for an additional robustness check the fama french three factor model was used to estimate the expected returns as shown in table 9 the results of the robustness tests were similar to the main findings with at least eight of the ten regulations having significant impacts during the event windows using a 300 trading day estimation window the rank t test and the fama french three factor model all regulations were supported by at least one of the robustness tests which gave the results credibility and confirmed the main conclusions to ensure the effects mainly originated from the regulations rather than from the overall market the water environment regulation impacts on non water polluting firms were examined using the psm method to match the non water polluting samples that corresponded to the heavy polluters psm is designed to reduce the influence of bias due to confounding variables to make more reasonable comparisons between experimental and control groups 59 as in previous studies 60 62 a few major firm specific factors were selected to be the matching variables size free float shares roa leverage sales growth cash ratio and tangibility 4 4 size was measured as the natural logarithm of total market value free float shares were the natural logarithm of the number of free float shares roa was the ratio of total sales to total assets leverage was the ratio of total liabilities to total assets sales growth was the annual sales growth rate cash ratio was cash and cash equivalents to current liabilities and tangibility was tangible assets to total assets the psm was employed on 1344 china a share listed firms using one to two nearest neighbor matching and a caliper distance of 0 05 table a2 in appendix a presents the results of the characteristic variable differences before and after the psm application before the nearest neighbor matching the mean free float share sales growth and tangibility differences between the water polluting and non water polluting companies were significant at the 5 level indicating that there was sample selection bias however after the psm matching the free float share sales growth and tangibility p values were more than 0 1 and the bias between the mean values for all treated and control group variables was less than 10 which indicated that there was no significant difference between the matched water polluting companies and the non water polluting companies with a 268 matching non water polluting sample obtained the industry spread for which was real estate 19 0 electronic 14 2 transportation 13 1 commercial trade 11 9 computer 11 9 electrical equipment 10 8 communication 7 8 media 6 3 and domestic appliances 4 9 then the event study methodology was applied to examine the water environment regulation impact on the non water polluting firms the results for which were insignificant for all ten water environment regulations table 10 indicating that the significant market response of the heavy polluters was not a general market trend therefore overall the results were proven to be robust and consistent 5 conclusions this paper provided empirical evidence on the effects of the chinese hierarchical water environment regulations on the shareholder value of polluting firms in china it was found that the reactions to the national people s congress promulgations had a weaker market response while the regulations implemented by the less powerful bodies such as the state council the ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of ecological and environment had more significant market responses market investors were found to react rather quickly and strongly to the promulgation of the water ten plan with this response remaining strong after a month which provided proof that the water ten plan issued by the state council was the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history the empirical results suggested that most water environment regulations had negative market reactions in the last decade however the more recent chinese water environment regulations were found to have positive wealth effects for the heavy polluters inferring that there were possible win win outcomes between the environmental regulations and the regulated firms financial performances as the general public has been focusing more on environmental issues the research results indicated that well designed efficient regulations could improve financial performances and ensure future water environment protection although the study sought to determine that compliance by the heavy water polluters was good news for the shareholders and society further observations of the water environment regulation effects are needed in future studies to draw more accurate conclusions as severe water environment regulations might create opportunities for environmentally friendly businesses breakthroughs are needed in core equipment and technological innovations to achieve greater development future work will employ a larger sample to determine china s water environment regulation effects on the financial performances of more diversified industries authorship statements yao liming conceptualization funding acquisition

8648,using event study methodology this paper examined the effects of water environment regulations on the stock prices of polluting chinese firms over the past decade it was found that there were relatively weak market responses to regulations passed by the national people s congress china s top legislative body and more significant market responses to regulations implemented by less powerful administrations in particular the market reaction in various industries to the state council s water ten plan was instant and strong while most water environment regulations had negative effects on heavy polluters some recent regulations had positive wealth effects because water environment regulations have different effects on shareholder values in different industries these results could assist in guiding hierarchical water environment regulation policies and portfolio diversification keywords water environment regulation stock price event study water ten plan 1 introduction rapid industrialization urbanization and economic growth have led to significant rises in energy consumption industrial pollutant emissions and environmental pollution therefore balancing the development and environmental protection relationships has become a challenge in developing countries as the largest developing country china s environmental problems especially water quality problems have attracted world attention in particular 18 8 of the 10 168 national groundwater monitoring sites were found to have extremely poor water quality in 2019 and in 2017 china discharged 69 97 billion tonnes of sewage an increase of 68 51 over 2000 which included 10 22 million tonnes of chemical oxygen demand and 1 40 million tonnes of ammonia nitrogen 1 1 data come from china water resources bulletin and china statistical yearbook released in 2020 because of china s increasing environmental pollution the chinese government committed to the formulation and implementation of environmental protection regulations for which a hierarchical policy system was established comprising the national people s congress the state council the national development and reform commission and other ministries at various levels with regulatory importance depending on the rank of the department issuing the regulations promulgations passed by the national people s congress take precedence followed by those from the state council the national development and reform commission and the ministry of environmental protection 1 with a focus on the dual economic development and environmental protection goals strict industrial practice environmental regulations were issued to standardize industry behavior and promote economic development 2 however the industry effects of these hierarchical environmental regulations have not yet been fully explored significant studies have examined the industry effects of environmental regulations on productivity and financial performance however no consensus has been reached environmental regulations such as technological standards environmental taxes or tradable emissions permits have forced industries to reallocate labor and capital to implement pollution reduction measures 3 with the consequent cost of compliance and the reduction in available resources for investment and research resulting in a decline in financial performances and having a detrimental effect on industry profits 4 or tobin s q 5 however the porter hypothesis argues that properly designed environmental regulations should stimulate innovation and increase productivity 6 7 with many studies also finding that stringent environmental regulations can motivate technological innovation 8 13 well designed regulations could provide a sound basis for industry resource investment as regulated companies could protect themselves from certain market risks and become better investment targets 14 the effects of environmental regulations and the associated policy instruments have been found to widely differ with some industries or sectors being adversely affected and others being positively affected 1 15 20 however most previous studies have tended to conduct pre and post performance analyses for a single regulation with few examining the policy effects of regulations issued by the different legislative bodies because china has a hierarchical policy making system it has the ideal experimental setting to examine capital market responses to the water environment regulations from the different government levels in heavy polluting industry sectors the companies in which are already under pressure to reduce emissions and strengthen their water environment governance therefore this study sought to determine the capital market responses to the hierarchical water regulations from the different levels of government and the implementation of costly pollution control measures to assess whether green governance could lead to positive sustainable industry transformations the impacts of the water environment regulations from the different levels of government on regulated firms were measured using the cumulative abnormal stock price returns stock price returns are a reliable measure of company performance as they reflect current operating conditions reputation and development prospects 21 previous studies in various countries have also used stock prices to examine the impact of environmental regulations and have come to varying conclusions 22 26 the analysis of the impact of china s water environment regulations over the past decade found that the market responses had a dynamic time effect and particular industry patterns short term market reactions to the water pollution prevention and control legislation enacted by the npc were found to be less significant than the reactions to state council and ministry issued administrative regulations with the water ten plan 2 2 water ten plan short for action plan for prevention and control of water pollution is a regulation enacted by the state council of china in 2015 to strengthen the prevention and control of water pollution and ensure water security issued by the state council being the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history because the chinese public has become increasingly environmentally conscious in recent years and believes that the development of green economies and clean production can improve production technology and the green transformation of polluting firms a greater number of industries have had positive cumulative average abnormal returns caars after 2016 this paper has three main contributions first few studies based on previous theories and event study methodology have focused on the impact of hierarchical water environment regulations on heavily water polluting industries second the impacts of the regulations are examined over time from which it was found that some recent regulations have had significantly positive wealth effects for heavy polluters third the different effects of the water environment regulations on shareholder value by industry were examined from which it was found that nitrogenous fertilizer companies were at greater risk from the long term negative impacts of the water environment regulations the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the sample collection section 3 details the methodology and data sources section 4 presents the empirical results and discussion and section 5 concludes the paper 2 sample selection and description 2 1 hierarchical water environment regulations regulations protect the public s rights and interests as environmental regulations are generally promulgated to control pollution and or improve the ecological environment regulatory punishments for pollution violations are also part of environmental policies in almost every industrialized country 27 two main regulatory tools are used in china command and control cac regulations and market based instruments mbi 28 however china s environmental policy system is generally dominated by cac regulations 29 that use legislative and administrative means to ensure enterprise compliance with non compliance being subject to penalties and fines mbis however tend to use market mechanisms such as price and quantitative instruments and incentive measures to guide enterprises to reduce their emissions in china the government takes the lead policy formulation and implementation role unlike the mbis which encourage enterprises to voluntarily participate in market transactions cac regulations have absolute control and supervision rights that allow the prescription of particular product designs manufacturing methods and pollution control technologies 30 based on the organization for economic co operation and development oecd classification 31 and previous studies 30 the cac regulations and mbis in china fall mainly into the categories outlined in table 1 as cac regulations and mbis are the most common policy instruments in china this paper focused on these two types table 2 lists some sample regulations extracted from wolters kluwer china law and reference database because the first water environment regulations were announced in 2010 to match the stock price data of the listed firms the search covered the period from january 1 2010 to december 31 2019 and included documents issued by the national people s congress the state council the national development and reform commission the ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of ecology and environment the national people s congress npc is china s highest legislative body and the state council is the highest administrative body the npc enacts and revises laws and supervises their implementation and the state council formulates administrative measures enacts administrative regulations and issues decisions and orders the national development and reform commission implements guidelines policies and development and reform work plans and similar to the u s environmental protection agency the ministry of environmental protection protects and enhances the environment to the fullest extent possible under the laws enacted by the npc 32 based on the institutional reforms to the state council approved at the first session of the 13th national people s congress in march 2018 the ministry of ecology and environment was established by integrating the functions and responsibilities of the ministry of environmental protection these government agencies form a hierarchical framework for the formulation and implementation of water environment regulations over the past decade chinese authorities have attached greater importance to water environmental protection in 2011 the ministry of environmental protection announced a list of 334 national key monitoring sewage treatment plants in which the supervisory monitoring results exceeded the standard in 2013 the mep first announced three water pollutant discharge standards and then published a document on the sewage charges at centralized urban sewage treatment facilities which was the first time since 2010 that officials had detailed sewage charge standards and calculation methods and laid the foundations for an environmental tax in october 2013 the state council promulgated regulations on urban drainage and sewage treatment to ensure safe urban drainage and sewage treatment facility operations in 2014 the ndrc issued interim measures for the management of water pollution prevention and control projects in key river basins which detailed the project implementation standards in 2015 a water pollution prevention and control action plan aimed at the small scale paper iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals textiles geoprocessing pharmaceuticals leather pesticides and electroplating industries was issued which completely banned severely polluting production that was not in line with national policies this plan which was referred to as the water ten plan was strict with the ministry of environmental protection predicting that its implementation would boost gdp growth by about 5 7 trillion cny and increase the environmental protection industry output value by about 1 9 trillion cny of which about 1 4 trillion cny would be from the direct purchase of products and services a previous study 33 found that the water ten plan significantly improved the industrial water pollution problems in china the npc published a draft amendment to the water pollution prevention and control law in december 2016 3 3 in china before they come into force legislative regulations issued by the npc go through several stages agenda setting inter agency review top leadership approval of a draft npc deliberation and implementation in accordance with legal procedures 34 on june 27 2017 the draft passed the npc standing committee and the revised water pollution prevention and control law was formally implemented which improved existing systems and made innovation and breakthroughs a legal responsibility for example it set clear boundaries for illegality perfected the total emissions control system for key water pollutants expanded the punishment scope and established new penalty methods in 2018 the pollutant discharge permit management measures on trial were further refined the original interim provisions strengthened and the penalty clause supplemented with the pollutant discharge permit management measures on trial resolving total enterprise pollutant discharge control legal liability problems in 2019 eleven national environmental protection standards were approved which included sewage monitoring technical specifications and ecological environment monitoring regulations overall ten water environment regulations enacted by the different government agencies were included in this study 2 2 companies it was surmised that the announcement of stringent environmental regulations would increase the risks for the heavily polluting companies directly affected by these water environment regulations following jin et al 35 and referring to the water pollution prevention and control action plan the shenwan industry classification was used to divide the existing company sample into nine industry sectors table 3 which included the highest water polluting industries paper iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals textiles agroprocessing pharmaceuticals pesticides and electroplating 36 the sample comprised 242 listed companies on the shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges all of which were high water polluting industries supervised by the water environment regulations table 3 gives a breakdown of the number of companies in each subsample nonferrous metals accounted for 33 1 of the sample followed by pharmaceuticals 23 6 iron and steel 12 4 textiles agroprocessing paper pesticides nitrogenous fertilizer from 2 to 9 and electroplating 0 8 table 4 gives the sample firm statistics based on the last closing day for the most recent quarter preceding february 6 2020 from which it can be seen that the pharmaceuticals industry had the highest average market capitalization the iron and steel industry had the largest staff size and sales revenue and profits and the agroprocessing and nitrogenous fertilizer sample had the highest asset liability ratios and therefore the higher financial risks 3 methodology and data based on the efficient markets hypothesis emh company information is quickly transmitted to the stock market with the stock price anomalously changing based on the stakeholders judgments with a focus on stock returns fama et al 37 and brown and warner 38 developed the event study methodology to quantify the impact of an event on stock prices which has consequently become the most widely adopted method to study event impacts 21 39 42 therefore this methodology was used to estimate the abnormal returns and evaluate the effect of the environmental regulations on company performances the first step was to choose an event window within which the abnormal returns were to be estimated for which calendar time was converted into event time for example day 0 was the day the regulation was announced day 1 was the trading day following the event and day 1 was the last trading day before the event as it was assumed that there were no other events within the event windows to exclude the influence of unrelated events on the stock prices the event window had to be relatively short normally under the belief that information is quickly incorporated into the stock market event window periods are set at one or two days however as capital markets in developing countries are generally less efficient than those in developed countries 23 the environmental news response time is slower therefore guided by previous studies 23 43 the caars were calculated over a period of five trading days to capture investor reactions to the announcements to ensure robustness the caars were also reported over both shorter and longer event periods for instance three 10 and 20 trading days as stated as longer event periods can be affected by other extraneous events the primary focus was on interpreting the stock market reactions over the five day event period as in other studies 1 44 the estimation window used to estimate expected returns was 240 trading days a one year estimation period as it was possible that information may have leaked before the major policy decision was formally published it was surmised that this could have influenced shareholder expectations therefore in the estimation period the data from ten trading days before the event day were excluded with the estimation window length starting at day 250 and ending at day 11 the second step was to identify the abnormal returns which are the actual stock returns minus the returns that would have been realized if the event had not taken place expected returns the hypothesis was that when the stringent water environment regulations were announced the highly polluting companies would experience negative abnormal returns traditional capital asset pricing models capm only use market risk factors to describe portfolio or stock returns however fama and french 45 added size risk and value risk factors to the capm to reflect stocks that had smaller market capitalization and higher book to market ratios which tended to do better than the market in 2015 fama and french 46 adapted their model to include five factors market risk size risk value risk profitability and investment under the assumption that companies reporting higher future earnings would have higher stock market returns and companies that directed their profit toward major growth projects would be more likely to suffer losses the fama french five factor model has been found to provide better estimates for expected returns in event studies 1 r i t r f t α i β i r m t r f t s i s m b t h i h m l t r i r m w t c i c m a t ε i t where r i t is the return on stock

expected returns with the a r i t being the abnormal return for stock i on day t which was defined as 2 a r i t r f t α ˆ i r f t β ˆ i r m t r f t s ˆ i s m b t h ˆ i h m l t r ˆ i r m w t c ˆ i c m a t the mean abnormal returns associated with a distinct point in time before or after the event day day t were calculated by 3 a a r t 1 n i 1 n a r i t in which n was the sample size to measure the event impact persistence over a particular period event window the abnormal returns for stock i were summed to obtain the cumulative abnormal returns cars the car for stock i over time period days t1 t2 was given by 4 c a r i t 1 t 2 t t 1 t 2 a r i t the cars were aggregated across n observations to measure the average cumulative effect on the sample stocks from day t1 to day t2 with the caar obtained as 5 c a a r t 1 t 2 1 n i 1 n c a r i t 1 t 2 the third step was to test the statistical significance of the abnormal returns as the regulation was issued on the same calendar day for all sample firms there can be cross sectional correlations when events occur in multiple companies on the same day kolari and pynnönen 47 proposed a new test statistic that modified the patell test to account for the cross correlation of abnormal returns first patell 48 suggested that scaled abnormal returns sars should be used for statistical tests which are defined as 6 s a r i t a r i t 1 1 l 1 p 1 r m t r m 2 t 250 11 r m t r m 2 s a r i where s a r i is the regression residual standard deviation l 1 is the length of the estimation window p is the number of explanatory variables in the expected return regression and r m is the mean for the market returns in the estimation window under the normality assumption the s a r i t is t distributed with l 1 p 1 degrees of freedom following kolari and pynnönen 47 a cross correlation adjusted scaled t ratio adj patell was defined as shown in equations 7 and 8 the test statistic for testing h0 aar 0 is given by 7 t a a r s a r t n l 1 p 1 l 1 p 3 1 1 n 1 r where s a r t is the mean sar on day t and r is the average for the sample cross correlations for the estimation period residuals the test statistic for testing h0 caar 0 is given by

research csmar database and the daily market return risk free rate book to market factor hml size factor smb profitability factor rmw and investment factor cma data were downloaded from the china asset management research center 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects on the stock price the full sample effects of the water environment regulations on the stock prices are shown in table 5 as noted the focus was on the caars for days 0 5 however the caars for days 0 3 days 0 10 and days 0 20 were also reported to identify the short term responses and the long term change patterns for all heavy polluting companies regulations 1 2 3 4 7 9 and 10 had significant market responses in three trading days however the response to regulation 7 was only significant at a10 level within three trading days that is its effect was weak and short lived similarly regulation 10 s impact strength declined in the long run which implied that while the market perceived these events as unusual it did not see the impacts as being long lasting the effects of regulations 5 6 and 8 on all heavy polluters were insignificant in the short term and the caars for regulation 6 only became significant after 20 trading days which seemed inconsistent with the higher political and social status of the water ten plan therefore to better identify the impacts on different industries and prevent offsets between industries the impacts of the water environment regulations on the subsamples were further explored table 6 table 6 primarily focuses on the caars for days 0 5 with the caars for all the event windows days 0 3 days 0 5 days 0 10 days 0 20 shown in appendix a the findings based on the above results are summarized in the following 4 1 1 different responses to the hierarchical regulations table 5 shows that regulations 1 2 3 4 9 and 10 had significant strong market reactions on all heavy polluters these regulations were enacted by mep 1 2 3 9 mee 10 and sc 4 regulation 6 water ten plan which was promulgated by sc was found to have the most significant effect on the water polluting industry companies with most showing significant caars 0 5 table 6 and five showing significant caars in three trading days see appendix a in particular the paper nitrogenous fertilizer and electroplating industry caars were all significant at a 1 level for days 0 3 the negative effects of the water ten plan were mostly extreme on the nitrogenous fertilizer industry which continued for days 0 20 which indicated that the market reacted quickly and strongly to the promulgation of this regulation and continued to trade for up to 20 trading days which confirmed that the sc water ten plan was the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history as shown in table a1 in appendix a the caars within five trading days of regulations 7 and 8 were relatively weak although seven industries were affected by regulation 8 fewer industries showed significant market responses compared to the water ten plan the npc regulations had weaker market responses which did not appear to align with the market attention given to npc rulings significant impacts were more often observed 20 trading days after the promulgation of the water pollution prevention and control law which may have been because the market needed more time to assess the long term impacts of these more abstract laws in recent years administrative regulations issued by the ministries commissions and sc departments have become major chinese legislative components 49 because there are a significantly greater number of administrative regulations than laws most of which are generally more specific in their implementation the state council and ministries issued administrative regulations such as instructions orders and rules to elucidate the implementation of the laws passed by the npc 50 therefore the investors short term reactions to the npc s water pollution prevention and control legislation were less significant than their reactions to some other regulations 4 1 2 shift in investor attitudes the driving hypothesis was that the stringent water environment regulation announcements would result in negative abnormal returns for the heavy polluters however the empirical results revealed that this was not necessarily the case from the results shown in fig 1 and table 5 most regulations had a significant negative impact in the shorter or longer term but there was a noticeable shift in investor attitudes fig 1 shows the number of positive and negative cumulative abnormal returns for days 0 5 on each announcement date over the sample period interestingly more positive cars were observed after 2016 however the announcement of the pollutant discharge permit management on trial measures in 2018 resulted in negative cars as shown in table 5 three regulations that were respectively enacted in 2016 2017 and 2019 resulted in significant positive effects regulation 10 had the most significant short term positive market responses and the positive effects of regulation 8 strengthened over time table 7 shows the number of industries that were significantly negatively or positively affected by the regulations from which it can be seen that except for the pollutant discharge permit management on trial measures announcement more industries had positive caars after 2016 which proved the robustness of the above results further the regulation 10 impacts on two industries were both positive and immediate therefore it was concluded that the market investor reactions to the water environment regulations were not overwhelmingly negative or positive this shift in investor attitudes may be good news for heavy polluters as some investors were bullish on the positive benefits of the water environment regulations for regulation 8 which was the water pollution prevention and control law a greater number of investors decided to buy stock with this positive attitude being evident over time investors also saw regulation 10 as being 100 good news for two heavily polluting industries as these listed firms gradually acquired larger significant positive wealth effects the implementation of some water environment regulations seemed to meet the market needs to a certain extent therefore water environment regulation compliance by the heavy polluters was seen by stakeholders as a directly responsible act a fulfillment of their corporate social responsibility and an elevation of their corporate reputations the chinese public has become increasingly environmentally conscious and has a much clearer understanding of china s environmental protection system for example market investors have found that developing green economies and promoting clean production can accelerate economic growth transformation from extensive to intensive and lead to production technology improvements in polluting firms therefore well designed regulations can provide the public with official information on investment resources which means that these regulated firms have become better investment targets these findings were consistent with lanoie et al 51 which concluded that stringent regulations can have a positive effect by giving polluting firms the opportunity to identify and eliminate inefficiencies regulation 9 was the only regulation that had significant negative effects on four industries it appeared that the investors regarded the implementation of the pollutant discharge permit system as bad news for industries that had serious water pollution problems as the pollutant discharge permit system drafts included strong administrative regulations 52 many investors believed that the implementation of the emissions permit systems would require substantial investment in environmental protection equipment by the heavy polluters to meet the standards this result was consistent with previous studies that found that environmental regulations increased compliance costs and led to negative portfolio returns 22 24 4 1 3 heterogeneous industry responses table 8 shows the regulations that had significant effects on the subsamples for robustness all results during all event windows were reported in an attempt to explore the sensitivities of the different industry market responses the days when the caars became significant were recorded from which the following was found 1 the paper industry always showed significantly positive and instant market reactions however 20 trading days after the promulgation of regulation 4 the significantly paper industry positive reaction turned negative however this did not affect the main conclusion that firms in the paper industry had positive wealth effects after the announcement of the water environment regulations 2 the caars for the pharmaceuticals companies were all insignificant for days 0 5 and only became significantly negative for one regulation after a longer period therefore the pharmaceutical industry polluters were not significantly affected by the introduction of the water environment regulations 3 iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals were the top three industries significantly and negatively affected by the regulations with the nonferrous metals polluters being found to be the most sensitive to the water environment regulations with most caars being statistically significant for days 0 5 and all event windows 4 the caars for the agroprocessing companies were significant after 20 trading days which was a longer time than in the other industries 5 the regulations had the greatest positive impact on the electroplating industry however investor attitude was not always consistent which indicated that the electroplating industry needed to pay attention to the possible effects of environmental regulations the three industries that were significantly negatively affected were further analyzed from which it was found that the nitrogenous fertilizer industry had suffered the strongest negative impacts table 6 with the negative caars still significant after 20 trading days see appendix a these results indicated that the water environment regulation impacts on the nitrogenous fertilizer industry were significantly negative and sustained which indicated that nitrogenous fertilizer companies are facing greater challenges from the water environment regulations than companies in the other industries there are many small and medium sized firms in the nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals industries with some having failed to meet the environmental standards and accumulated large debts therefore in the long run the nitrogenous fertilizer and nonferrous metals industries are at greater risk from environmental protection regulations as these regulations will inevitably raise the entry threshold and industry operating costs the iron and steel industry a pillar industry with a large production capacity in china is facing serious problems such as high energy consumption high pollution and extensive management therefore the compliance pressure from environmental protection regulations such as the pollution discharge permit system could significantly increase production costs which means that investors would be more likely to negatively respond to these industries while the pharmaceutical industry companies appeared to be less sensitive to the water environment regulation announcements it is possible that negative returns may occur over the long term only one of the ten regulations showed a significant market reaction after 20 trading days see appendix a china s pharmaceutical industry has been growing rapidly primarily because china has become the main global low cost pharmaceutical producer and is the world s second largest pharmaceutical market by value 53 as can be seen from the market value the pharmaceutical industry was the largest of the sample industries table 4 zhao et al 1 argued that as large firms have comparative financial human and technical resource advantages they are more able to comply with environmental regulations however the pharmaceutical industry s water pollution is still serious in past decades because of the frequent overuse of medicines and the incomplete removal of pharmaceutical residues pharmaceutical wastewater is either treated in sewage treatment plants or directly discharged into the water environment which has increased the frequency of medical residues in the water environment 54 therefore investors cannot judge the impact degree in the pharmaceutical industry or they need a longer time to judge the regulation impacts that is investors appear to be taking a wait and see attitude the research results further indicated the risks that different industries might face based on the divergent market responses paper industry stocks seemed to be the safest choice followed by the electroplating industry however as the electroplating industry stocks also exhibited some negative reactions investing in this industry sector may not always be an effective way to guard against water environment regulation risk therefore short term exposure to pharmaceutical stocks seems to be a more stable option however investors need to be aware of the possible long term risks one possible way for investors to reduce their losses from policy shocks would be to avoid investing in the iron and steel nitrogenous fertilizer nonferrous metals and agroprocessing stocks especially as the first three industries have been found to have the largest holding risks after the enactment of all water environment regulations 4 2 robustness tests to assess the robustness of the findings the analysis was continued by considering different estimation windows conducting a non parametric test and using the fama french three factor model then to exclude the general market trend influences the non water polluting company responses to the water environment regulations were also examined using the propensity score matching psm method normally a minimum estimation window of 100 trading days ensures that the regression has not been unduly impacted by outliers 55 following armitage 56 an estimation window of 300 trading days was therefore used to estimate the expected returns corrado 57 first proposed a nonparametric rank test for abnormal security price performances in event studies however as this test was derived for single day event windows it could lose its power when the event window is wider kolari and pynnönen 58 utilized corrado s 57 rank testing approach and proposed a new nonparametric generalized rank test grank t that could be used on both single day and cars therefore grank t was used for the robustness tests because it outperformed previous caar rank tests and was robust to the cross correlation of returns for an additional robustness check the fama french three factor model was used to estimate the expected returns as shown in table 9 the results of the robustness tests were similar to the main findings with at least eight of the ten regulations having significant impacts during the event windows using a 300 trading day estimation window the rank t test and the fama french three factor model all regulations were supported by at least one of the robustness tests which gave the results credibility and confirmed the main conclusions to ensure the effects mainly originated from the regulations rather than from the overall market the water environment regulation impacts on non water polluting firms were examined using the psm method to match the non water polluting samples that corresponded to the heavy polluters psm is designed to reduce the influence of bias due to confounding variables to make more reasonable comparisons between experimental and control groups 59 as in previous studies 60 62 a few major firm specific factors were selected to be the matching variables size free float shares roa leverage sales growth cash ratio and tangibility 4 4 size was measured as the natural logarithm of total market value free float shares were the natural logarithm of the number of free float shares roa was the ratio of total sales to total assets leverage was the ratio of total liabilities to total assets sales growth was the annual sales growth rate cash ratio was cash and cash equivalents to current liabilities and tangibility was tangible assets to total assets the psm was employed on 1344 china a share listed firms using one to two nearest neighbor matching and a caliper distance of 0 05 table a2 in appendix a presents the results of the characteristic variable differences before and after the psm application before the nearest neighbor matching the mean free float share sales growth and tangibility differences between the water polluting and non water polluting companies were significant at the 5 level indicating that there was sample selection bias however after the psm matching the free float share sales growth and tangibility p values were more than 0 1 and the bias between the mean values for all treated and control group variables was less than 10 which indicated that there was no significant difference between the matched water polluting companies and the non water polluting companies with a 268 matching non water polluting sample obtained the industry spread for which was real estate 19 0 electronic 14 2 transportation 13 1 commercial trade 11 9 computer 11 9 electrical equipment 10 8 communication 7 8 media 6 3 and domestic appliances 4 9 then the event study methodology was applied to examine the water environment regulation impact on the non water polluting firms the results for which were insignificant for all ten water environment regulations table 10 indicating that the significant market response of the heavy polluters was not a general market trend therefore overall the results were proven to be robust and consistent 5 conclusions this paper provided empirical evidence on the effects of the chinese hierarchical water environment regulations on the shareholder value of polluting firms in china it was found that the reactions to the national people s congress promulgations had a weaker market response while the regulations implemented by the less powerful bodies such as the state council the ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of ecological and environment had more significant market responses market investors were found to react rather quickly and strongly to the promulgation of the water ten plan with this response remaining strong after a month which provided proof that the water ten plan issued by the state council was the strictest and most influential water pollution control regulation in china s history the empirical results suggested that most water environment regulations had negative market reactions in the last decade however the more recent chinese water environment regulations were found to have positive wealth effects for the heavy polluters inferring that there were possible win win outcomes between the environmental regulations and the regulated firms financial performances as the general public has been focusing more on environmental issues the research results indicated that well designed efficient regulations could improve financial performances and ensure future water environment protection although the study sought to determine that compliance by the heavy water polluters was good news for the shareholders and society further observations of the water environment regulation effects are needed in future studies to draw more accurate conclusions as severe water environment regulations might create opportunities for environmentally friendly businesses breakthroughs are needed in core equipment and technological innovations to achieve greater development future work will employ a larger sample to determine china s water environment regulation effects on the financial performances of more diversified industries authorship statements yao liming conceptualization funding acquisition

8649,energy and water are essential resources for ensuring economic growth both sectors are closely interrelated electricity generation is one of the most water intensive activities worldwide and the cooling of thermoelectric power stations represents one of the largest uses of water within the energy sector this study provides evidence on the existence of an environmental kuznets curve ekc for water withdrawal at the thermoelectricity sector in spain one of the most arid countries in europe for the period 1970 2019 using the ardl model our results show a direct relationship between per capita income and water withdrawal until an estimated turning point is reached in the spanish case further development has led to a reduction in water needs for the following reasons 1 the use of less water intensive cooling systems 2 changes in generation technology keywords water withdrawal thermal power generation economic growth environmental kuznets curve spain 1 introduction water and energy are drivers of growth water the most critical resource globally represents an essential input in practically all economic activities agriculture industry energy recreational etc 1 extensive research has also shown the importance of energy in promoting economic growth 2 in turn the energy sector is the second thirstiest sector worldwide accounting for about 10 of water withdrawals and 3 of water consumption globally 3 water and energy systems are intrinsically linked and their potential implications for economic growth seem indisputable energy and water sectors are closely interrelated on the one hand energy is used at each stage of the cycle of water supply treatment and disposal on the other hand water is necessary for the extraction refining and transformation of fuels transport and storage and electricity generation 4 consequently the water energy nexus as it is known in the literature is receiving increasing attention from researchers and practitioners 5 8 within the energy sector electricity generation is the activity that involves the largest volumes of water approximately 88 of global power generation is water intensive 9 in addition to hydropower plants thermoelectric power stations fueled by coal fuel oil natural gas or uranium require significant volumes of water in 2010 nearly 80 of the world s electricity was still generated in thermoelectric power plants moreover thermal power generation was responsible for almost one half of all water withdrawals in the us and in various european countries 10 11 unlike hydropower plants thermoelectric facilities boil water to create steam to spin turbines that generate electricity later the steam that has passed through the turbine is cooled to water before it can be reused to produce more electricity cooling is the stage that requires the largest amounts of water within the electricity generation process 12 water shortages are already affecting many regions worldwide and many power plants are being forced to shut down due to lack of water 13 15 securing the supply of water and electricity is essential to the progress of economies therefore it is a key question to explore the relationship between economic growth and pressure on water resources the relationship between economic growth and the environment is complex pioneering work on such relationship emerged in the 1990s based on the initial idea of the kuznets curve 16 19 since then the environmental kuznets curve ekc has become one of the most discussed topics among environmental economists in recent years 20 23 the ekc so called because of its similarity to the relationship that economist simon kuznets previously established between economic growth and inequality in income distribution 24 suggests that there is an inverted u shaped relationship in which environmental pressure increases as economic growth does then when a certain level of per capita income is reached namely the turning point the environmental pressure decreases 25 according to the theoretical underpinnings of this hypothesis industrialization and agricultural modernization may initially explain the increase in environmental pressure by contrast factors that could explain the subsequent turndown include 1 positive income elasticities for environmental quality 2 changes in the composition of consumption and production 3 increasing levels of education and environmental awareness 4 more open political systems 5 the presence of increasing returns of scale in the energy production system 21 26 27 the existing literature on the ekc and water pressure tends to consider water consumption that is the part of the freshwater withdrawn which is not returned to the original water body due to evaporation as a relevant variable nevertheless in this paper we focus on water withdrawal i e the total amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for the cooling of thermal power plants during the electricity generation process in a context of climate change with increasing water scarcity minimizing the amount of water that makes a process possible may become more important than minimizing the volume of water consumed although the quantity of water withdrawn is subsequently returned to the aquatic environment the water withdrawn is no longer available at the precise place and time for other uses thus the economic notion of opportunity cost becomes particularly important here likewise water withdrawal provides an idea of the volumes of water we initially need to run a thermoelectric power plant if such volumes are not available initially the power plant may not operate properly 28 the implementation of the different electricity generation technologies in spain is crucial to understand the evolution of water requirements in the long term until the 1960s hydroelectricity remained the major contributor to spanish electricity generation the economic miracle of the 1960s and early 1970s required more energy input in terms of electricity this resulted in the expansion of the spanish thermoelectric fleet with the commissioning of new thermal power plants coal and fuel oil and the beginning of nuclear generation with the opening of the first generation of nuclear power plants with the turn of the century natural gas combined cycle wind and solar power and biomass joined to the electricity mix fig 1 shows the complete picture in terms of water use the percentage of electricity generation that depends on water has declined over the last two decades due to the shift towards renewable energy sources however at present more than 60 of the spanish electricity generation still depends on the availability of fresh water the increasing adoption of less thirsty cooling technologies has also had important implications in this respect 29 this paper aims to evaluate the validity of the ekc for water withdrawals from thermoelectricity generation in spain the most arid country in europe for the period 1970 2019 thermoelectric sector has represented the most important contributor to the spanish electricity generation over the second half of the 20th century in spain likewise although the share of thermoelectricity generation that still depends on the availability of fresh water remains significant there is an absence of studies analysing its relationship with economic growth in this regard we aim at checking whether economic growth is environmentally beneficial in other words whether pressure on water resources is reduced as income increases or the lack of water availability could hinder economic growth to do so we follow the autoregressive distributed lag ardl bounds cointegration technique by using data of cooling water withdrawal from all those thermoelectric power plants using fresh water the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a vast body of both international and national research addressing the ekc section 3 explains the data used and the methodology followed to perform the analysis section 4 shows the results finally sections 5 presents the discussion and main conclusions 2 literature review the origins of the kuznets curve date back to the mid 20th century when the economist simon kuznets published economic growth and income inequality 24 this work concluded that the variables inequality and economic growth follow an inverted u shaped relationship initially the growth of the economy leads to greater inequality however there is a level of per capita income that results in a trend change from which any increase in income translates into less inequality later other authors developed new approaches based on kuznets initial idea by including environmental quality variables and resulting in the so called environmental kuznets curve ekc 30 31 the ekc has been widely criticised evidence has shown that the existence of the ekc is not always fulfilled as it depends on a variety of factors such as the type of pollutant or the geographical region under consideration 25 32 33 a significant body of international literature has sought to validate the ekc hypothesis for air pollution 26 34 38 sandy desertification 39 and deforestation 40 among others by contrast existing studies on the relationship between economic growth and water use are more limited and tend to consider all uses of water for a wide range of countries for example 41 made use of the dataset provided by ref 42 to assess the existence of the ekc for water use cole concluded that water use may benefit from composition and technique effects although there is no certainty that this will occur in developing countries 43 analysed the relationship between per capita water use and per capita income for 65 countries over the period 1962 2008 these authors made use of not only traditional panel data models but also a panel smooth transition regression pstr approach they found a negative association between per capita income and per capita water withdrawal regardless of the model used additionally their findings pointed to a particular ekc with a decreasing part that dominates the link between both variables from 1960 to the present 44 addressed freshwater use as a function of economic development the author found some support for the existence of an ekc but results were highly dependent on the choice of datasets and statistical technique likewise results were also sector specific and the ekc curves proved to be poor indicators of country performance however only some isolated studies have attempted to assess the validity of the ekc for the energy sector for example 45 investigated the relationship between hydropower energy consumption ecological footprint and economic growth for brazil china canada india norway and the us authors concluded that the ekc hypothesis is not valid for these countries in the case of spain 46 analysed trends in annual emissions of six relevant air pollutants carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxides and non methanic volatile organic compounds from 1980 to 1996 authors found no correlation between higher income levels and lower emissions except for so2 whose evolution could be compatible with the ekc hypothesis 47 also evaluated the relationship between income growth and atmospheric pollution in spain by considering additional emission gases namely the six greenhouse gases and three gases associated with local and regional environmental problems in this case the authors renounced to prove the existence of an ekc in spain they contributed to the ekc debate from two perspectives 1 by conducting a structural decomposition analysis to examine the contribution of several factors involved in economic dynamics to the evolution of atmospheric emissions and 2 by analysing the emissions associated with the consumption patterns of different groups of households according to their expenditure levels 48 tested the ekc for the spanish economy by making use of cointegration tests that allow for the identification of structural breaks these authors found not only linear cointegration with two breaks in 1941 and 1967 but also a long run elasticity between co2 and income decreasing over time more recently other authors such as balaguer and cantavella modelled the ekc for spain by exploiting long time series 1874 2011 and by using real oil prices as indicator of fuel consumption the authors supported the ekc hypothesis through an autoregressive distributed lag ardl model 49 to our knowledge this is the first analysis on the relationship between economic growth and water pressure resulting from thermoelectricity generation this article aims to fill the gap in the literature on the water energy nexus through a case study of the thermoelectric sector the most important contributor to the spanish electricity generation over the second half of the 20th century this study may be of relevance when making policy recommendations on water and energy in a country that suffers from water availability problems does economic growth really have a positive impact on water withdrawal in a particularly thirsty sector such as thermoelectricity are only technological variables causing the decline in water withdrawal 3 data and methodology 3 1 data sources to test the ekc hypothesis in the context of the water thermoelectricity nexus in spain we identified all thermoelectric power plants operating in spain peninsula only between 1970 and 2019 and using fresh water for cooling we focus on the operational stage of the facilities i e on the electricity generation process our database included a total of 8 nuclear reactors grouped in 6 plants 19 coal plants 1 fuel oil gas plant 1 fuel oil plant 1 integrated gasification combined cycle power plant and 9 natural gas combined cycle facilities we excluded from the analysis those power plants cooling with sea water gas and air table 1 shows the classification of the power plants mentioned by type of generation technology and cooling system we collected data on electricity generation in spain for the period 1970 2019 from the annual reports of unesa 50 and red eléctrica de españa 51 regarding data on water withdrawal the international literature provides technical factors for different generation technologies and cooling systems 52 53 table 2 presents a summary of the water factors used in the subsequent analysis finally annual real per capita income constant prices of 2010 data comes from the spanish national institute of statistics www ine es the following two sections explain the methodology used to estimate water withdrawal from the thermoelectric generation process and to test the validity of the related ekc in spain 3 2 estimated water withdrawal two highlighted concepts emerge when estimating water used for electricity generation water withdrawal and water consumption the us geological survey usgs defines water withdrawal as the amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for use by contrast water consumption refers to the amount of water withdrawn that is evaporated transpired incorporated into products or crops or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment 54 cooling is the stage that entails the largest volumes of water within the electricity generation process cooling systems are classified into two categories dry cooling and wet cooling in turn wet cooling technologies are subdivided into two types once through and cooling towers once through systems remove water from a nearby source i e river lake aquifer or sea circulate it through a steam condenser and discharge the resulting warmer water into the original water body conversely cooling towers withdraw water and circulate it within the system while air is forced through the circulating water flows the waste heat from the cooling water is eventually expelled into the atmosphere through the tower these systems present differences in quantitative impacts on water resources due to their different functioning whilst once through cooling systems result in higher water withdrawal cooling towers involve higher water consumption 55 consequently the type of fuel power generation technology and cooling system are the factors that determine the water requirements of a thermoelectric power plant 56 to estimate the operational water withdrawal of the spanish thermoelectric power plants we followed the methodology used in ref 57 once the technical water factors per power plant were identified the operational water withdrawal of a single power plant n in year t was estimated by multiplying the corresponding intensity factor wwf measured in m3 mwh and the electricity generated eg in mwh formally 1 w w t n w w f t n e g t n thus for a given year the total water withdrawal is 2 total w w t n 1 n w w f t n e g t n 3 3 testing the validity of the ekc once the water withdrawal from thermal power plants has been estimated we can analyze their relationship to per capita income the availability of reliable data allows us to analyze the possible existence of the ekc relationship between 1970 and 2019 to test the validity of the ekc hypothesis we have as our goal the estimation of a log linear quadratic function that analyzes the relation between water withdrawal and real per capita income in addition to the possible non linear effects of per capita income over water withdrawal we also incorporated in the equation several variables to account for the electricity mix by introducing the share of electricity generated by the different types of thermoelectric plants and the shares of the electricity generated using each cooling system we can more reliably estimate the existence of the relationship over time also by including the total thermoelectricity generation we can estimate the effect on water withdrawal from a higher demand for electricity using these variables we can control for the size and the structure of the thermoelectric sector so that real per capita income level can be used as a proxy of the level of development in spain 3 ln w w t β 0 β 1 ln y t β 2 l n y t 2 β 3 ln e t β 4 n t β 5 c t β 6 f t β 7 t t β 8 t r e n d ε t where w w t is water withdrawal y t is per capita real income e t is the total electricity generated in the power plants the share of electricity generated in nuclear power plants is denoted by n t the shares of electricity generated in thermal power stations fueled by coal and fuel oil are denoted by c t f t respectively t t is the share of electricity generated using cooling towers as a cooling system ε t is the regression error term since the sum of total shares of both power plants and cooling systems is 100 both combined cycle power plants and once through cooling are excluded to avoid multicollinearity β 1 is expected to be positive whereas under the ekc hypotheses β 2 should be negative in that case the relationship between real income per capita and water withdrawal will be positive negative for any value of the real per capita income that is lower greater than a certain turning point this turning point can be obtained calculating the local maximum β 1 2 β 2 as we are dealing with a long run relationship first we must acknowledge the possibility of a spurious relationship between the variables as they are usually non stationary different approaches exist to deal with this problem mainly a methodology based on the residuals by ref 58 the maximum likelihood based approach used by ref 59 and 60 we use the later known as the autoregressive distributed lag ardl for the cointegration analysis this approach does not require the same order of integration for all variables but they have to be either i 0 or i 1 as i 2 will make the results unreliable in order to begin the analysis we employ the augmented dickey fuller adf and phillips perron pp tests to analyze the presence of unit roots in each variable this step is important to be sure that we are not dealing with i 2 variables the results are presented in supplementary table 1 at the 10 level of significance we reject the hypothesis of i 2 for all variables considered both using the augmented dickey fuller test adf and the phillips perron test the variables c and f are not i 1 in the adf test as they are stationary in levels which implies that we have different degrees of integration over the variables for this we believe the ardl technique is the best procedure for analyzing the ekc relationship the analysis of the long run relationship using the ardl methodology is based on the estimation of equation 4 4 δ l n w w t β 0 i 1 p β 1 i δ l n w w t i i 0 p β 2 i δ l n y t i i 0 p β 3 i δ l n y t i 2 i 0 p β 4 i δ l n e t i i 0 p β 5 i δ n t i i 0 p β 6 i δ c t i i 0 p β 7 i δ f t i i 0 p β 8 i δ t t i β 9 t r e n d θ e c t t 1 where e c t t 1 is the error correction term and represents the error obtained from the long run relation if it exists estimated with equation 3 in this context θ shows the speed of adjustment respect to the long run equilibrium this parameter should be between 0 and 1 to have convergence between the short run and the long run for the estimation of equation 4 the optimal lag structure of the variables must be selected using information criteria such as the bayesian information criterion bic and the akaike information criterion aic supplementary table 2 shows the lag structure that offers the lower best value of both the bic and aic for the analysis of the model we have chosen the lag structure selected as the preferred model by the bic 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 although in section 4 2 we do the same analysis for the other three preferred models to see how robust the results are 4 results 4 1 ardl estimation we use stata to perform the estimation procedure and select the top ardl model selected by the bic criteria 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 table 3 shows the estimated parameters of the long run relationship equation 3 and table 4 shows the estimated error correction model equation 4 with both short run coefficients and the adjustment speed the estimated coefficients show the presence of a non linear relationship between the income per capita level and the total water withdrawals the negative coefficient of l n 2 y shows that there is a turning point from which a greater income per capital level will decrease the endogenous variable as is expected a 1 increase in the amount of energy generated will increase the amount of total water withdrawals in 0 96 close to a constant proportional relationship the share of energy generated from both nuclear and coal power plants shows an increase in the amount of total water withdrawal as we could expect looking to the coefficients of water requirements that are shown in table 2 for the same reason the share of energy generated from fueloil and the share of energy generated with cooling towers shows a decrease in the total water withdrawal these results are in line with the coefficients associated with the relationship between the energy produced and the water withdrawal needed table 4 shows the estimated coefficients of the error correction model the most important parameter the speed of adjustment from the short run equilibrium to the long run equilibrium state is slightly below 1 1 1119 which shows that it over corrects itself furthermore a negative and significative coefficient also shows the existence of the long run estimated model we obtained the f statistic and t statistic values for the 60 bound they are compared with the 61 critical values for sample sizes ranging from 30 to 80 the null hypothesis of no level relationship is rejected with the f statistc 1234 2 p value 0 000 and the t statistic 57 843 p value 0 000 thus we can conclude that there is cointegration between our variables supplementary table 3 shows the diagnostic tests which reveal the following results the ramsey reset test has the null hypothesis of no omitted variables in the estimated model and thus no misspecification in our case the f statistic shows that the null hypothesis is not rejected p value 0 8476 two heteroscedasticity tests have been carried out to test the null hypothesis of a constant variance homoscedasticity in our case both the white test p value 0 727 and the breusch pagan test p value 0 5355 shows that the null hypothesis may not be rejected we employ two normality tests with the null hypothesis of a normal distribution in the residuals of the estimated model the chi square test p value 0 9645 and the shapiro wilk test p value 0 740 do not reject the null hypothesis finally we use the breusch godfrey test with the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation p value 0 3033 in this case we also can not reject the null hypothesis to check the stability of the estimation of both the long run and short run parameters from the ardl 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 we apply the cumulative cusum and cumulative sum of squares cusumq proposed by ref 62 if the plotted graphs for the cusum and cusumq show that the statistic stay within the critical bounds of a 5 level of significance the null hypotheses which implies that all coefficients of the regression are stable cannot be rejected figs 2 and 3 show that both the cusum and cusumq remain within the critical bound of the 5 significance level therefore we conclude that the stability of all coefficients in the ardl model cannot be rejected once obtained the estimated parameters of the ardl we can highlight the following remarks the objective of this paper was to analyze the relationship between income per capita levels and water withdrawal from thermoelectricity generation fig 4 shows the non linear relationship between those two variables which served as the first motivation to try to study if the presence of an ekc was the main factor in the decline of water withdrawal during the later years it shows the fitted values of water withdrawal estimated using the previously estimated long run model table 3 in relation to the income per capita levels we add a simple quadratic polynomial to show the non linear relationship between the two two main reasons explain this point first the estimated coefficients in the long run relationship show the presence of a kuznets curve between the level of per capita gdp and water withdrawal as θ 1 is positive and θ 2 is negative we conclude that a nonlinear relationship exists we find a positive relation for low values of the log of per capita gdp that is transformed into a negative relationship for values that are greater than the local maximum θ 1 2 θ 2 9 9882 which implies a per capita income level of 21 769 euros constant prices of 2010 second the actual technological change based on the continuous substitution of energy generated from power plants that use a once through system to the ones based on cooling towers which need less water withdrawals to obtain the same amount of energy generated this change can be seen in fig 5 this substitution with the fact that the estimated model concludes that the percentage of energy generated through cooling towers affects negatively to the amount of water withdrawals seem to explain the decrease in water withdrawals other changes in the energy mix like the increase of nuclear power and the decrease of coal power seem to not directly affect the amount of water withdrawal as the coefficients of both variables are rather similar this second effect has been studied as one of the main reasons behind the ekc as countries show a greater level of development in the presence of increasing returns in the technological link between the production of a product and the pollutant that it creates we should see this inverted u shape 21 27 4 2 robustness test to check for the robustness of our results we carried out the same analysis changing the variables considered or the lag structure of the estimated model in fig 6 we show the summary of our results for each model on the one hand the coefficient estimated for the square of the income per capital level in logarithms on the other hand whether the ardl show signs of cointegration and if it does if the presence of the kuznets curve is also present we use a specification chart to show the level of robustness of the most important variable for the key purpose of this paper to see if there is a non linear relationship between income per capita levels and the total water withdrawals model a is the one already estimated in the previous section b c and d models are the ones estimated with the lag structure of the three next preferred models shown in supplementary table 2 for the rest of the models we have eliminated some key variables shown in fig 6 with a red circle if they are eliminated from the estimated model we mainly conclude that the estimated model is quite similar for different configurations of the lag structure in the four preferred models both for the akaike and bayesian information criteria the coefficients their significance and signs are rather similar all four show that there is a cointegration relationship between the variables and conclude that the kuznets curve exists in the relationship between per capita income and water withdrawals for models h to j we eliminate some key variables the percentage of energy generated through cooling towers the structure of the different plants in the energy mix and both with these changes the presence of the kuznets curve is rejected although the estimated model has always a worse performance than the original one we present in supplementary table 4 the complete estimated long run model for each alternative 5 conclusions and discussion this paper provides evidence on the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for water withdrawal at the thermoelectricity sector in spain for the period 1970 2019 the results show that two main reasons explain the decline of water withdrawal first the increase in the share of cooling towers in the spanish thermoelectric fleet over time consequently there is a significant and negative effect to the total amount of water withdrawals second the presence of an ekc this implies that there is a turning point from which an increase in the income per capita level decreases the amount of water withdrawal this effect cannot be explained through the changes in the technological mix as those variables are already considered in the model the presence of increasing returns of scale could explain this result another potential explanation for the presence of the ekc is that a more developed country could shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies i e solar and wind power which use less water economic growth has indeed an impact in water withdrawal however this impact does not occur automatically changes in the electricity mix represent the main drivers in declined water demands with economic growth being the force that promote those changes in an increasing thirsty world policy should be aimed not at hindering changes but at enhancing them finally some limitations and caveats must be introduced in line with 44 since we focused on the thermoelectricity sector and only considered conventional thermal and nuclear power plants our results are sector specific and should be analysed with caution to account for the whole heterogeneity of our study case we included relevant factors such as the structure of the thermoelectricity sector and technology however other variables related to the level and quality of environmental protection have been omitted due to the lack of data including other sectors generation technologies i e hydropower concentrated solar power or photovoltaic solar energy and variables could have additional implications for this study these issues represent avenues for future research author contributions

consumption globally 3 water and energy systems are intrinsically linked and their potential implications for economic growth seem indisputable energy and water sectors are closely interrelated on the one hand energy is used at each stage of the cycle of water supply treatment and disposal on the other hand water is necessary for the extraction refining and transformation of fuels transport and storage and electricity generation 4 consequently the water energy nexus as it is known in the literature is receiving increasing attention from researchers and practitioners 5 8 within the energy sector electricity generation is the activity that involves the largest volumes of water approximately 88 of global power generation is water intensive 9 in addition to hydropower plants thermoelectric power stations fueled by coal fuel oil natural gas or uranium require significant volumes of water in 2010 nearly 80 of the world s electricity was still generated in thermoelectric power plants moreover thermal power generation was responsible for almost one half of all water withdrawals in the us and in various european countries 10 11 unlike hydropower plants thermoelectric facilities boil water to create steam to spin turbines that generate electricity later the steam that has passed through the turbine is cooled to water before it can be reused to produce more electricity cooling is the stage that requires the largest amounts of water within the electricity generation process 12 water shortages are already affecting many regions worldwide and many power plants are being forced to shut down due to lack of water 13 15 securing the supply of water and electricity is essential to the progress of economies therefore it is a key question to explore the relationship between economic growth and pressure on water resources the relationship between economic growth and the environment is complex pioneering work on such relationship emerged in the 1990s based on the initial idea of the kuznets curve 16 19 since then the environmental kuznets curve ekc has become one of the most discussed topics among environmental economists in recent years 20 23 the ekc so called because of its similarity to the relationship that economist simon kuznets previously established between economic growth and inequality in income distribution 24 suggests that there is an inverted u shaped relationship in which environmental pressure increases as economic growth does then when a certain level of per capita income is reached namely the turning point the environmental pressure decreases 25 according to the theoretical underpinnings of this hypothesis industrialization and agricultural modernization may initially explain the increase in environmental pressure by contrast factors that could explain the subsequent turndown include 1 positive income elasticities for environmental quality 2 changes in the composition of consumption and production 3 increasing levels of education and environmental awareness 4 more open political systems 5 the presence of increasing returns of scale in the energy production system 21 26 27 the existing literature on the ekc and water pressure tends to consider water consumption that is the part of the freshwater withdrawn which is not returned to the original water body due to evaporation as a relevant variable nevertheless in this paper we focus on water withdrawal i e the total amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for the cooling of thermal power plants during the electricity generation process in a context of climate change with increasing water scarcity minimizing the amount of water that makes a process possible may become more important than minimizing the volume of water consumed although the quantity of water withdrawn is subsequently returned to the aquatic environment the water withdrawn is no longer available at the precise place and time for other uses thus the economic notion of opportunity cost becomes particularly important here likewise water withdrawal provides an idea of the volumes of water we initially need to run a thermoelectric power plant if such volumes are not available initially the power plant may not operate properly 28 the implementation of the different electricity generation technologies in spain is crucial to understand the evolution of water requirements in the long term until the 1960s hydroelectricity remained the major contributor to spanish electricity generation the economic miracle of the 1960s and early 1970s required more energy input in terms of electricity this resulted in the expansion of the spanish thermoelectric fleet with the commissioning of new thermal power plants coal and fuel oil and the beginning of nuclear generation with the opening of the first generation of nuclear power plants with the turn of the century natural gas combined cycle wind and solar power and biomass joined to the electricity mix fig 1 shows the complete picture in terms of water use the percentage of electricity generation that depends on water has declined over the last two decades due to the shift towards renewable energy sources however at present more than 60 of the spanish electricity generation still depends on the availability of fresh water the increasing adoption of less thirsty cooling technologies has also had important implications in this respect 29 this paper aims to evaluate the validity of the ekc for water withdrawals from thermoelectricity generation in spain the most arid country in europe for the period 1970 2019 thermoelectric sector has represented the most important contributor to the spanish electricity generation over the second half of the 20th century in spain likewise although the share of thermoelectricity generation that still depends on the availability of fresh water remains significant there is an absence of studies analysing its relationship with economic growth in this regard we aim at checking whether economic growth is environmentally beneficial in other words whether pressure on water resources is reduced as income increases or the lack of water availability could hinder economic growth to do so we follow the autoregressive distributed lag ardl bounds cointegration technique by using data of cooling water withdrawal from all those thermoelectric power plants using fresh water the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a vast body of both international and national research addressing the ekc section 3 explains the data used and the methodology followed to perform the analysis section 4 shows the results finally sections 5 presents the discussion and main conclusions 2 literature review the origins of the kuznets curve date back to the mid 20th century when the economist simon kuznets published economic growth and income inequality 24 this work concluded that the variables inequality and economic growth follow an inverted u shaped relationship initially the growth of the economy leads to greater inequality however there is a level of per capita income that results in a trend change from which any increase in income translates into less inequality later other authors developed new approaches based on kuznets initial idea by including environmental quality variables and resulting in the so called environmental kuznets curve ekc 30 31 the ekc has been widely criticised evidence has shown that the existence of the ekc is not always fulfilled as it depends on a variety of factors such as the type of pollutant or the geographical region under consideration 25 32 33 a significant body of international literature has sought to validate the ekc hypothesis for air pollution 26 34 38 sandy desertification 39 and deforestation 40 among others by contrast existing studies on the relationship between economic growth and water use are more limited and tend to consider all uses of water for a wide range of countries for example 41 made use of the dataset provided by ref 42 to assess the existence of the ekc for water use cole concluded that water use may benefit from composition and technique effects although there is no certainty that this will occur in developing countries 43 analysed the relationship between per capita water use and per capita income for 65 countries over the period 1962 2008 these authors made use of not only traditional panel data models but also a panel smooth transition regression pstr approach they found a negative association between per capita income and per capita water withdrawal regardless of the model used additionally their findings pointed to a particular ekc with a decreasing part that dominates the link between both variables from 1960 to the present 44 addressed freshwater use as a function of economic development the author found some support for the existence of an ekc but results were highly dependent on the choice of datasets and statistical technique likewise results were also sector specific and the ekc curves proved to be poor indicators of country performance however only some isolated studies have attempted to assess the validity of the ekc for the energy sector for example 45 investigated the relationship between hydropower energy consumption ecological footprint and economic growth for brazil china canada india norway and the us authors concluded that the ekc hypothesis is not valid for these countries in the case of spain 46 analysed trends in annual emissions of six relevant air pollutants carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxides and non methanic volatile organic compounds from 1980 to 1996 authors found no correlation between higher income levels and lower emissions except for so2 whose evolution could be compatible with the ekc hypothesis 47 also evaluated the relationship between income growth and atmospheric pollution in spain by considering additional emission gases namely the six greenhouse gases and three gases associated with local and regional environmental problems in this case the authors renounced to prove the existence of an ekc in spain they contributed to the ekc debate from two perspectives 1 by conducting a structural decomposition analysis to examine the contribution of several factors involved in economic dynamics to the evolution of atmospheric emissions and 2 by analysing the emissions associated with the consumption patterns of different groups of households according to their expenditure levels 48 tested the ekc for the spanish economy by making use of cointegration tests that allow for the identification of structural breaks these authors found not only linear cointegration with two breaks in 1941 and 1967 but also a long run elasticity between co2 and income decreasing over time more recently other authors such as balaguer and cantavella modelled the ekc for spain by exploiting long time series 1874 2011 and by using real oil prices as indicator of fuel consumption the authors supported the ekc hypothesis through an autoregressive distributed lag ardl model 49 to our knowledge this is the first analysis on the relationship between economic growth and water pressure resulting from thermoelectricity generation this article aims to fill the gap in the literature on the water energy nexus through a case study of the thermoelectric sector the most important contributor to the spanish electricity generation over the second half of the 20th century this study may be of relevance when making policy recommendations on water and energy in a country that suffers from water availability problems does economic growth really have a positive impact on water withdrawal in a particularly thirsty sector such as thermoelectricity are only technological variables causing the decline in water withdrawal 3 data and methodology 3 1 data sources to test the ekc hypothesis in the context of the water thermoelectricity nexus in spain we identified all thermoelectric power plants operating in spain peninsula only between 1970 and 2019 and using fresh water for cooling we focus on the operational stage of the facilities i e on the electricity generation process our database included a total of 8 nuclear reactors grouped in 6 plants 19 coal plants 1 fuel oil gas plant 1 fuel oil plant 1 integrated gasification combined cycle power plant and 9 natural gas combined cycle facilities we excluded from the analysis those power plants cooling with sea water gas and air table 1 shows the classification of the power plants mentioned by type of generation technology and cooling system we collected data on electricity generation in spain for the period 1970 2019 from the annual reports of unesa 50 and red eléctrica de españa 51 regarding data on water withdrawal the international literature provides technical factors for different generation technologies and cooling systems 52 53 table 2 presents a summary of the water factors used in the subsequent analysis finally annual real per capita income constant prices of 2010 data comes from the spanish national institute of statistics www ine es the following two sections explain the methodology used to estimate water withdrawal from the thermoelectric generation process and to test the validity of the related ekc in spain 3 2 estimated water withdrawal two highlighted concepts emerge when estimating water used for electricity generation water withdrawal and water consumption the us geological survey usgs defines water withdrawal as the amount of water removed from the ground or diverted from a water source for use by contrast water consumption refers to the amount of water withdrawn that is evaporated transpired incorporated into products or crops or otherwise removed from the immediate water environment 54 cooling is the stage that entails the largest volumes of water within the electricity generation process cooling systems are classified into two categories dry cooling and wet cooling in turn wet cooling technologies are subdivided into two types once through and cooling towers once through systems remove water from a nearby source i e river lake aquifer or sea circulate it through a steam condenser and discharge the resulting warmer water into the original water body conversely cooling towers withdraw water and circulate it within the system while air is forced through the circulating water flows the waste heat from the cooling water is eventually expelled into the atmosphere through the tower these systems present differences in quantitative impacts on water resources due to their different functioning whilst once through cooling systems result in higher water withdrawal cooling towers involve higher water consumption 55 consequently the type of fuel power generation technology and cooling system are the factors that determine the water requirements of a thermoelectric power plant 56 to estimate the operational water withdrawal of the spanish thermoelectric power plants we followed the methodology used in ref 57 once the technical water factors per power plant were identified the operational water withdrawal of a single power plant n in year t was estimated by multiplying the corresponding intensity factor wwf measured in m3 mwh and the electricity generated eg in mwh formally 1 w w t n w w f t n e g t n thus for a given year the total water withdrawal is 2 total w w t n 1 n w w f t n e g t n 3 3 testing the validity of the ekc once the water withdrawal from thermal power plants has been estimated we can analyze their relationship to per capita income the availability of reliable data allows us to analyze the possible existence of the ekc relationship between 1970 and 2019 to test the validity of the ekc hypothesis we have as our goal the estimation of a log linear quadratic function that analyzes the relation between water withdrawal and real per capita income in addition to the possible non linear effects of per capita income over water withdrawal we also incorporated in the equation several variables to account for the electricity mix by introducing the share of electricity generated by the different types of thermoelectric plants and the shares of the electricity generated using each cooling system we can more reliably estimate the existence of the relationship over time also by including the total thermoelectricity generation we can estimate the effect on water withdrawal from a higher demand for electricity using these variables we can control for the size and the structure of the thermoelectric sector so that real per capita income level can be used as a proxy of the level of development in spain 3 ln w w t β 0 β 1 ln y t β 2 l n y t 2 β 3 ln e t β 4 n t β 5 c t β 6 f t β 7 t t β 8 t r e n d ε t where w w t is water withdrawal y t is per capita real income e t is the total electricity generated in the power plants the share of electricity generated in nuclear power plants is denoted by n t the shares of electricity generated in thermal power stations fueled by coal and fuel oil are denoted by c t f t respectively t t is the share of electricity generated using cooling towers as a cooling system ε t is the regression error term since the sum of total shares of both power plants and cooling systems is 100 both combined cycle power plants and once through cooling are excluded to avoid multicollinearity β 1 is expected to be positive whereas under the ekc hypotheses β 2 should be negative in that case the relationship between real income per capita and water withdrawal will be positive negative for any value of the real per capita income that is lower greater than a certain turning point this turning point can be obtained calculating the local maximum β 1 2 β 2 as we are dealing with a long run relationship first we must acknowledge the possibility of a spurious relationship between the variables as they are usually non stationary different approaches exist to deal with this problem mainly a methodology based on the residuals by ref 58 the maximum likelihood based approach used by ref 59 and 60 we use the later known as the autoregressive distributed lag ardl for the cointegration analysis this approach does not require the same order of integration for all variables but they have to be either i 0 or i 1 as i 2 will make the results unreliable in order to begin the analysis we employ the augmented dickey fuller adf and phillips perron pp tests to analyze the presence of unit roots in each variable this step is important to be sure that we are not dealing with i 2 variables the results are presented in supplementary table 1 at the 10 level of significance we reject the hypothesis of i 2 for all variables considered both using the augmented dickey fuller test adf and the phillips perron test the variables c and f are not i 1 in the adf test as they are stationary in levels which implies that we have different degrees of integration over the variables for this we believe the ardl technique is the best procedure for analyzing the ekc relationship the analysis of the long run relationship using the ardl methodology is based on the estimation of equation 4 4 δ l n w w t β 0 i 1 p β 1 i δ l n w w t i i 0 p β 2 i δ l n y t i i 0 p β 3 i δ l n y t i 2 i 0 p β 4 i δ l n e t i i 0 p β 5 i δ n t i i 0 p β 6 i δ c t i i 0 p β 7 i δ f t i i 0 p β 8 i δ t t i β 9 t r e n d θ e c t t 1 where e c t t 1 is the error correction term and represents the error obtained from the long run relation if it exists estimated with equation 3 in this context θ shows the speed of adjustment respect to the long run equilibrium this parameter should be between 0 and 1 to have convergence between the short run and the long run for the estimation of equation 4 the optimal lag structure of the variables must be selected using information criteria such as the bayesian information criterion bic and the akaike information criterion aic supplementary table 2 shows the lag structure that offers the lower best value of both the bic and aic for the analysis of the model we have chosen the lag structure selected as the preferred model by the bic 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 although in section 4 2 we do the same analysis for the other three preferred models to see how robust the results are 4 results 4 1 ardl estimation we use stata to perform the estimation procedure and select the top ardl model selected by the bic criteria 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 table 3 shows the estimated parameters of the long run relationship equation 3 and table 4 shows the estimated error correction model equation 4 with both short run coefficients and the adjustment speed the estimated coefficients show the presence of a non linear relationship between the income per capita level and the total water withdrawals the negative coefficient of l n 2 y shows that there is a turning point from which a greater income per capital level will decrease the endogenous variable as is expected a 1 increase in the amount of energy generated will increase the amount of total water withdrawals in 0 96 close to a constant proportional relationship the share of energy generated from both nuclear and coal power plants shows an increase in the amount of total water withdrawal as we could expect looking to the coefficients of water requirements that are shown in table 2 for the same reason the share of energy generated from fueloil and the share of energy generated with cooling towers shows a decrease in the total water withdrawal these results are in line with the coefficients associated with the relationship between the energy produced and the water withdrawal needed table 4 shows the estimated coefficients of the error correction model the most important parameter the speed of adjustment from the short run equilibrium to the long run equilibrium state is slightly below 1 1 1119 which shows that it over corrects itself furthermore a negative and significative coefficient also shows the existence of the long run estimated model we obtained the f statistic and t statistic values for the 60 bound they are compared with the 61 critical values for sample sizes ranging from 30 to 80 the null hypothesis of no level relationship is rejected with the f statistc 1234 2 p value 0 000 and the t statistic 57 843 p value 0 000 thus we can conclude that there is cointegration between our variables supplementary table 3 shows the diagnostic tests which reveal the following results the ramsey reset test has the null hypothesis of no omitted variables in the estimated model and thus no misspecification in our case the f statistic shows that the null hypothesis is not rejected p value 0 8476 two heteroscedasticity tests have been carried out to test the null hypothesis of a constant variance homoscedasticity in our case both the white test p value 0 727 and the breusch pagan test p value 0 5355 shows that the null hypothesis may not be rejected we employ two normality tests with the null hypothesis of a normal distribution in the residuals of the estimated model the chi square test p value 0 9645 and the shapiro wilk test p value 0 740 do not reject the null hypothesis finally we use the breusch godfrey test with the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation p value 0 3033 in this case we also can not reject the null hypothesis to check the stability of the estimation of both the long run and short run parameters from the ardl 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 we apply the cumulative cusum and cumulative sum of squares cusumq proposed by ref 62 if the plotted graphs for the cusum and cusumq show that the statistic stay within the critical bounds of a 5 level of significance the null hypotheses which implies that all coefficients of the regression are stable cannot be rejected figs 2 and 3 show that both the cusum and cusumq remain within the critical bound of the 5 significance level therefore we conclude that the stability of all coefficients in the ardl model cannot be rejected once obtained the estimated parameters of the ardl we can highlight the following remarks the objective of this paper was to analyze the relationship between income per capita levels and water withdrawal from thermoelectricity generation fig 4 shows the non linear relationship between those two variables which served as the first motivation to try to study if the presence of an ekc was the main factor in the decline of water withdrawal during the later years it shows the fitted values of water withdrawal estimated using the previously estimated long run model table 3 in relation to the income per capita levels we add a simple quadratic polynomial to show the non linear relationship between the two two main reasons explain this point first the estimated coefficients in the long run relationship show the presence of a kuznets curve between the level of per capita gdp and water withdrawal as θ 1 is positive and θ 2 is negative we conclude that a nonlinear relationship exists we find a positive relation for low values of the log of per capita gdp that is transformed into a negative relationship for values that are greater than the local maximum θ 1 2 θ 2 9 9882 which implies a per capita income level of 21 769 euros constant prices of 2010 second the actual technological change based on the continuous substitution of energy generated from power plants that use a once through system to the ones based on cooling towers which need less water withdrawals to obtain the same amount of energy generated this change can be seen in fig 5 this substitution with the fact that the estimated model concludes that the percentage of energy generated through cooling towers affects negatively to the amount of water withdrawals seem to explain the decrease in water withdrawals other changes in the energy mix like the increase of nuclear power and the decrease of coal power seem to not directly affect the amount of water withdrawal as the coefficients of both variables are rather similar this second effect has been studied as one of the main reasons behind the ekc as countries show a greater level of development in the presence of increasing returns in the technological link between the production of a product and the pollutant that it creates we should see this inverted u shape 21 27 4 2 robustness test to check for the robustness of our results we carried out the same analysis changing the variables considered or the lag structure of the estimated model in fig 6 we show the summary of our results for each model on the one hand the coefficient estimated for the square of the income per capital level in logarithms on the other hand whether the ardl show signs of cointegration and if it does if the presence of the kuznets curve is also present we use a specification chart to show the level of robustness of the most important variable for the key purpose of this paper to see if there is a non linear relationship between income per capita levels and the total water withdrawals model a is the one already estimated in the previous section b c and d models are the ones estimated with the lag structure of the three next preferred models shown in supplementary table 2 for the rest of the models we have eliminated some key variables shown in fig 6 with a red circle if they are eliminated from the estimated model we mainly conclude that the estimated model is quite similar for different configurations of the lag structure in the four preferred models both for the akaike and bayesian information criteria the coefficients their significance and signs are rather similar all four show that there is a cointegration relationship between the variables and conclude that the kuznets curve exists in the relationship between per capita income and water withdrawals for models h to j we eliminate some key variables the percentage of energy generated through cooling towers the structure of the different plants in the energy mix and both with these changes the presence of the kuznets curve is rejected although the estimated model has always a worse performance than the original one we present in supplementary table 4 the complete estimated long run model for each alternative 5 conclusions and discussion this paper provides evidence on the existence of an environmental kuznets curve for water withdrawal at the thermoelectricity sector in spain for the period 1970 2019 the results show that two main reasons explain the decline of water withdrawal first the increase in the share of cooling towers in the spanish thermoelectric fleet over time consequently there is a significant and negative effect to the total amount of water withdrawals second the presence of an ekc this implies that there is a turning point from which an increase in the income per capita level decreases the amount of water withdrawal this effect cannot be explained through the changes in the technological mix as those variables are already considered in the model the presence of increasing returns of scale could explain this result another potential explanation for the presence of the ekc is that a more developed country could shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies i e solar and wind power which use less water economic growth has indeed an impact in water withdrawal however this impact does not occur automatically changes in the electricity mix represent the main drivers in declined water demands with economic growth being the force that promote those changes in an increasing thirsty world policy should be aimed not at hindering changes but at enhancing them finally some limitations and caveats must be introduced in line with 44 since we focused on the thermoelectricity sector and only considered conventional thermal and nuclear power plants our results are sector specific and should be analysed with caution to account for the whole heterogeneity of our study case we included relevant factors such as the structure of the thermoelectricity sector and technology however other variables related to the level and quality of environmental protection have been omitted due to the lack of data including other sectors generation technologies i e hydropower concentrated solar power or photovoltaic solar energy and variables could have additional implications for this study these issues represent avenues for future research author contributions
