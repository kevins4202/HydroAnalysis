25160,we modified the grazing module of the apex simulation model to allow for selective grazing of plant species and dietary specific excretion of urine and feces to determine the sensitivity of these changes on nutrient flows vegetation responses and grazer diet we simulated the conditions of a 20 year historic grazing treatment conducted in kansas united states of america simulated scenarios were a factorial of 2 grazer types naïve and selective and 3 stocking densities high medium low naïve grazers represented model behavior before our modifications selective grazers selected forage species based on crude protein content digestibility and anti quality factors we found that the new selective grazing algorithm resulted in a change in grazer diet quality nutrient excretion and standing vegetation residue the difference between selective and naïve grazers varied over the course of the grazing season with greatest differences occurring early in the year c3 grasses were generally preferred in the spring after which time c4 grasses were preferred until autumn simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density although stocking density did impact standing vegetation residue urinary and fecal n excretion varied seasonally and interacted with weather induced plant water stress the revised model s ability to simulate differences in vegetation

productivity and their potential to cause environmental harm such as the hypoxic zone in the gulf of mexico white et al 2014 nutrient flows in agricultural systems are affected by weather plant species and management rotz et al 2005 among other factors grazing adds a layer of complexity to nutrient cycling not found in farming systems that lack animals because the chemical forms of nutrients

and policy makers to develop what if scenarios with different management practices to simulate management s impact on productivity and the environment since 2003 the apex model has been used in this capacity by the conservation effects assessment project ceap within the united states department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs apex is a deterministic process based model that simulates soil processes plant growth agricultural management and environmental outcomes a strength of apex over the closely related model epic williams et al 1984 is that apex can simulate spatial extents ranging from field patches to small watersheds for grazing applications this means that apex could be used to simulate spatial plant herbivore dynamics at pasture ranch or small watershed scales however simulating agricultural systems that include grazers presents a unique set of challenges not faced when simulating cropland jones et al 2017 including the simulation of biologically diverse vegetation plant animal interaction nutrient transfers snow et al 2014 and the longer time frames needed to simulate perennial herbaceous and woody species jones et al 2017 the apex model s ability to simulate prairie plant growth was recently improved zilverberg et al 2017 so that the nrcs could use apex to simulate grazing land as well as cropland however the model s simulation of plant herbivore interactions remained simplistic and thus needed improvement to better simulate conservation practices involving grazing management domestic and wild grazers select a diet from among the choices found in their environment diet selection is the result of a complex interaction of animal and environment stuth 1991 provenza et al 2003 it has long been recognized that preference for a plant species commonly changes throughout the year e g dyksterhuis 1948 senft et al 1985 stuth 1991 as the plant s concentration of nutrients changes its digestibility changes its chemical constituents change and even as its physical structure changes when grazers continually select preferred plant species while ignoring non preferred species they can shift the competitive balance of those plant species in their environment for instance differences in stocking rates in the great plains of north america create different vegetation communities launchbaugh 1967 hanson et al 1978 porensky et al 2016 subsequently grazers diet choices are limited to the plant species present in the altered vegetative community diet intake can also be altered due to changes in biomass availability resulting from grazing thus constraining future selectivity and or selection of lower preference species walker 1993 rangeland models commonly include features to allow selective grazing for example the savanna model coughenour 1993 allows the user to rank plant species according to preference by each grazer species edys coldren et al 2011 goes a step further by also subdividing plant species by plant parts the sustainable grazing system model johnson et al 2003 assigns preference parameters to individual species as well as leaf vs stem within a species b cullen personal communication phygrow stuth et al 2003b allows the user to assign a preference class preferred desirable undesirable or non consumed rather than a numerical ranking to each plant part leaf vs wood and growth stage rapid dormant and dead of each plant species for each grazer animal species gpfarm range assigns preference values to plant functional groups andales et al 2005 blackburn and kothmann 1991 developed a model that incorporated nitrogen concentration digestibility and anti quality factors of the plant species into a single equation to determine its desirability originally a crop model apex lacked simulation of selective grazing its grazers consumed plants in equal proportion to their environmental abundance to address shortcomings in apex s handling of selective grazing and nutrient cycling related to grazing we made several updates to the model the purpose of this article is to describe those changes demonstrate the impact of those changes under various scenarios and identify the model s sensitivity to changing environmental and management conditions we hypothesize that 1 our model updates will more accurately depict seasonality of grazing preferences for certain plant species as compared to older versions of apex 2 simulated selectivity will decrease as stocking density increases 3 preferred plant species will have less standing mass at the end of the grazing season when grazed by selective grazers rather than naïve grazers 4 at the end of the grazing season total residue and total standing mass will not differ between selective and naïve grazers for a given stocking rate and 5 excretion of n p will vary with season and environmental conditions 2 updates made to the model the apex agricultural policy environmental extender model is designed to simulate the impacts of agricultural management on whole farms and small watersheds it uses a daily time step and is primarily deterministic the model s major components were described by gassman et al 2010 and are represented in fig 1 to enhance plant animal interactions in apex we began by requiring additional input specifications at the plant and animal levels these will be described followed by several sections detailing the plant animal interaction initial efforts have focused on beef cattle production because this is the dominant type of animal production on u s grazing lands and because of the detailed information available however the design remains flexible to allow anticipated expansion for other types of grazers 2 1 vegetation specifications previous versions of apex included nitrogen concentration n of standing live and dead plant species so it was a simple matter to calculate crude protein cp of forage as 6 25 n however apex did not include measures of digestibility or energy content of forages thus we added the ability to simulate total digestible nutrients tdn which ranges from 0 to 100 to estimate tdn the user enters a maximum and a minimum tdn value for each forage the model simulates changes in tdn on a daily basis using a linear equation that decreases from the maximum to the minimum according to the plant s maturity for example suppose a species requires 1400 heat units to reach maturity has accumulated 1000 heat units in the current year and has maximum and minimum tdn values of 80 and 50 respectively its current tdn would be 80 1000 1400 80 50 58 6 2 2 grazer specifications a grazer specification file which includes all of the grazer types that can be used in a simulation was developed for the updated model as with crop and forage species the file comes with preloaded default values but these can be changed by the user users can also create new grazers grazers are defined in part by their full body weight fbw kg and an option for how to calculate daily dry matter intake dmi kg in this study we restrict our use to apex s simple intake option which assumes that grazers are neither gaining nor losing body weight and that daily dry matter forage intake is a percentage of body weight 1 dmi pb fbw where pb is percentage of body weight defined by the user in the grazer input file grazers are also described by their thresholds for preferred desirable and undesirable forage as well as their tolerance for forage anti quality factors these are described in detail in section 2 5 in the previous version of apex apex 1501 only one herd could graze an area at a given time this restriction has been removed so that an unlimited number of herds can graze an area at the same time each herd is composed of homogeneous individuals except for a cow calf herd which includes both cows and calves at certain times of the year each grazer also has a stocking density ha animal 1 and grazing threshold kg ha 1 when standing forage including both live and dead passes below this threshold the grazer ceases grazing optionally the user can choose to have deficits of intake demand filled with hay because each grazer has a unique threshold it is possible to allow one herd to continue grazing while another herd is fed hay or rotates to a different subarea when plant growth brings standing forage above the grazing threshold grazing of a subarea resumes if grazers are present hay consumption is reduced accordingly 2 3 water intake the quantity of water consumed is the sum of free water intake drinking water and water contained in the forage or feed consumed free water fw liters is calculated as a function of heat ball et al 1999 using 2 fw 0 076 fbw0 7086 tx0 7146 where tx is 2 0 or the maximum daily temperature ⁰c whichever is greater water content wc of standing dead vegetation was assumed to be 10 water content of standing live vegetation follows an s shaped curve decreasing from 75 water content at emergence to 25 water content at maturity 2 4 excretion of urine and feces all forage consumed is assumed to be digested or excreted the portion of ingested forage that is digestible is defined by tdn thus the dry weight of feces is 3 feces dmi 1 tdn 100 where tdn ranges from 0 to 100 the quantity of urinary water produced is a fixed percentage of water consumption based on the work of paquay et al 1970a b and betteridge and andrewes 1986 4 urinary water 0 31 wf fw where wf is the volume of water in forage consumed in liters apex simulates the cycling of n and p for grazing animals most nutrients are either excreted in feces and urine or contained in animal products such as weight gain or milk small amounts of nutrients may be lost via other avenues such as hair fall and saliva but these are insignificant for purposes of this simulation therefore we ignore these other losses and conserve n and p within the system by using equation 5 5 nutrient excreted nutrient intake nutrient in products for animals at homeostasis nutrient in products 0 and thus all n and p consumed are excreted in feces or urine excreted p pe is assumed to be partitioned among urine pu and feces pf as follows based on karn 2001 review of the literature 6 pu 0 04 pe 7 pf 0 96 pe the fraction of n that is excreted ne in urine rather than feces increases with dietary cp concentration dcp we employed an equation developed by waldrip et al 2013 to adjust the fraction of n excreted in urine fnu with changes in dcp 8 fnu 1 8 dcp 28 8 then total urinary n nu and fecal n nf are given by 9 nu ne fnu 10 nf ne nu where ne is total n excreted urinary and fecal n and p are returned to the soil surface in mineral and organic forms table s1 urinary n is treated as mineral n because although urinary n is primarily urea it is quickly converted to ammonium in the soil bussink and oenema 1998 the concentration of c in urine is simulated as 43 of the concentration of mineral n in urine following the elemental proportions of urea the concentration of c in feces is a constant 35 of the fecal dry weight 2 5 diet selection the most biologically important and computationally intensive improvement to apex grazing was the implementation of selective grazing in previous versions apex grazers had indiscriminately consumed standing forage in equal proportion to its fraction of the total standing mass that is to say if the standing live mass of a particular grass species composed 30 of the total mass of standing live and dead vegetation it also composed 30 of every grazer s diet differential forage preference the measure of relative intake of alternative forages allen et al 2011 was lacking the revised version adopts the general approach and empirical equations of the phygrow model stuth et al 2003b phygrow has been used for more than a decade to simulate anticipated forage shortages stuth et al 2003a 2005 angerer 2012 in phygrow and the revised version of apex the preference by a certain grazer for a certain unit of vegetation on a given day is classified in one of four categories 1 preferred 2 desirable 3 undesirable or 4 non consumed these categories are the same as those used by the nrcs bureau of land management and united states forest service when developing an ecological site description esd as well as phygrow however both phygrow and esd s use the additional categories of emergency and toxic because these categories only apply to extreme situations and because apex does not simulate the effects of toxic forage consumption the emergency and toxic categories were not included in apex for purposes of simplification for the nrcs the unit of vegetation is the plant species which when supported by direct observation and or literature may further be divided into plant parts leaves stems twigs fruit mast for phygrow each species has 10 potential units of vegetation for which a preference class must be defined four herbaceous growth stages four woody growth stages herbaceous litter and woody litter thus phygrow simulations require inputting a number of plant animal matrices one for each grazer that define the preference of that grazer for each of the plant species and its 10 potential growth and litter stages the edys model coldren et al 2011 takes a similar approach but includes as many preference categories as there are plant species thus both phygrow and edys require that a user input large plant animal preference matrices the mathematical model described by senft 1989 requires assigning preference parameters for each plant species or plant community this approach is valid across different mixes of the same species but requires re recalculation of a parameter when species are added or subtracted from the list senft 1989 p 299 apex takes a different approach to assigning preference classes this approach seeks to limit the number of user inputs required while remaining general enough to apply to many ecosystems with few or no changes required to input parameters standing n g m 2 of a plant community has been shown to be correlated with grazing preference senft et al 1985 on a daily basis apex calculates a forage quality qgf for each combination of forage f and grazer g based on nitrogen concentration total digestible nutrients and forage anti quality factors based on the approach of blackburn and kothman 1991 apex adds a fourth factor not included by blackburn and kothman 1991 the grazer s tolerance to forage anti quality factors 11 qgf minimum 0 032 n concentration g g 1 minimum 0 9 tdn g g 1 minimum 1 1 grazer anti quality tolerance anti quality of forage where the grazer anti quality tolerance ranges from 0 no tolerance to 1 unaffected by anti quality factors and forage anti quality also ranges from 0 no anti quality factors to 1 extreme anti quality factors anti quality factors may be chemical e g tannins or physical e g spines qgf is calculated separately for standing live and standing dead of each forage then the relative qgf rqgf of each live and dead forage is calculated as 12 rqgf qgf maximum qgf where maximum qgf is the maximum qgf value of all forages for a particular grazer each grazer in apex has three rqg thresholds that define when forages pass from preferred to desirable from desirable to undesirable and from undesirable to non consumed for instance a grazer with rqg thresholds of 0 15 0 60 and 0 95 would consider all forages with rqgf 1 0 0 15 to be preferred those from 1 0 0 60 to 1 0 0 15 to be desirable those from 1 0 0 95 to 1 0 0 60 to be undesirable and those 1 0 0 95 to be non consumed the same thresholds are used for all forage species apex maintains separate pools of standing live and dead forage for each forage species each with its own rqgf therefore live and dead biomass of the same species can simultaneously be in different preference classes litter plant material lying on the ground is not consumed by grazers in apex except to distinguish between living and dead biomass apex does not maintain separate pools of standing biomass that is to say it does not distinguish between leaf stem or woody biomass in apex preferred forages are consumed in greater proportion than their contribution to the total standing mass undesirable forages are consumed in smaller proportion than they occur in the total standing mass the proportional consumption of desirable species depends upon other forages available the equations were derived by quirk and stuth 1995 13 pfracg 1 e 3 65 pf gi tf gi 14 ufracg 0 031971 e2 89 uf gi tf gi 15 dfracg 1 0 ufracg pfracg where g refers to the grazer i refers to the day pfrac refers to the fraction of the diet that is preferred pf is the quantity kg ha 1 of preferred forage tf is the sum of all standing live and dead forage kg ha 1 ufrac is the fraction of the diet that is undesirable uf is the quantity of undesirable forage kg ha 1 and dfrac is the fraction of the diet that is desirable if there are more than one species in the same preference class they will be consumed in their relative proportions for example if species a 500 kg ha 1 and species b 750 kg ha 1 are both preferred forages pfracg 80 and dmi is 10 kg the grazer will consume 8 kg of preferred forage of the 8 kg 3 2 kg will come from a and 4 8 kg from b because both pfrac and dfrac range between 0 and 1 but sum to less than 1 an animal s diet is always guaranteed to contain all forages classified as preferred desirable or undesirable assuming there is enough forage to meet the grazing threshold thus a mixed diet is achieved but the results are deterministic spatial simulation of grazing is possible when simulating more than one subarea but a herd in the model can only graze one subarea per day thus simulating vegetation patchiness and spatial selectivity of grazing stations at the sub paddock level is currently not possible with apex when multiple grazers demand the same plant species and life class live or dead in greater proportion than its availability apex executes a conflict resolution algorithm consumption of the species and life class demanded is proportionally reduced for each grazer such that all available is consumed then to make up the grazers demand deficit each grazer consumes remaining species in proportion to their fraction in the standing mass that is to say naïvely this naïve grazing is used for conflict resolution because it requires less computation than required by executing preferential grazing an unknown number of times and because the amount of the grazers diet affected would typically be small over the course of a simulation 3 sensitivity analysis to test the sensitivity of the new features added to apex we simulated plant animal interactions at hays kansas usa 38 87 n 99 31 w this site corresponds to the loamy upland ecological site in major land resource area 73 usda nrcs united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 2006 a long term grazing experiment at hays was described by launchbaugh 1957 1967 and the different vegetation communities were simulated by zilverberg et al 2017 mean annual precipitation from 1936 to 1965 was 586 mm of which 79 fell from april through september noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 mean annual temperatures for the period were annual maximum 42 c daily mean 12 c and annual minimum 24 c noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 pastures were grazed by yearling steers or heifers from may 1 to oct 1 or nov 1 except when grazing was terminated early due to lack of forage launchbaugh 1967 we simulated the hays site using the same input soil harney silt loam time period 1936 1965 and historic weather noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 as zilverberg et al 2017 we used the same input vegetation as the light grazing treatment from zilverberg et al 2017 which included two perennial c4 grasses blue grama bouteloua gracilis and buffalograss bouteloua dactyloides one perennial c3 grass western wheatgrass pascopyrum smithii an annual c3 grass japanese brome bromus arvensis and a perennial forb western ragweed ambrosia psylostachia vegetative species were based on launchbaugh 1967 measurements all grasses were given values of 0 for anti quality factors ambrosia psylostachia was simulated with a 0 7 anti quality factor at emergence and 0 9 at maturity to demonstrate the degree of selectivity introduced by the model improvements we simulated two different grazer types 1 naïve grazers like those of previous versions of apex and 2 selective grazers that demonstrated preference for specific forages the selective grazers were yearling steers weighing 313 kg throughout each grazing season we used a value of 2 5 for dmi the hay feeding option was not used we applied three different stocking densities 0 5 0 7 or 1 25 animal ha 1 to the vegetation from the historic light grazing treatment launchbaugh 1967 to test our hypothesis that selectivity would decrease as stocking density increased grazers and stocking densities were applied in a factorial arrangement such that we had 6 total scenarios 2 grazers 3 densities the model was run once for each scenario each simulation included the years 1936 through 1965 we report the final 20 years of each simulation which correspond to the 20 years of the historic grazing experiment 1946 1965 to evaluate selectivity of simulated grazers we used vanderploeg and scavia 1979 electivity index e which lechowicz 1982 recommended from among a suite of electivity indices the equation is 16 wi ri pi ri pi 17 e i wi 1 n wi 1 n where r is the quantity of forage consumed kg ha 1 p is the quantity of forage available kg ha 1 and n is the number of forages we calculated a single e for each forage species including both standing live and standing dead mass e was calculated on a daily basis for the duration of the simulation we report the mean daily value of e for each forage and interpret larger e values as indicators of greater preference to further demonstrate the impact or lack thereof of selective grazing stocking density and weather on environmental variables we also report the following for each scenario dmi by plant species water consumption total urinary and fecal n p and end of grazing season standing live dead and surface residue finally to demonstrate the variation in nutrient cycling caused by the interaction of model updates and environment we evaluated urinary and fecal n excretion on the 3rd day of each month from may through sep of each of the 20 simulated years at the moderate stocking density using selective grazers on each day we developed a simple linear regression relating a dependent variable urinary n excreted kg animal 1 or fecal n excreted kg animal 1 to a dependent variable water stress water stress was the mean water stress value of the five forage species water stress values range from 0 extreme stress to 1 no stress we report the r2 of each regression and the p value of an f test of the regression 4 results of sensitivity analysis 4 1 intake of naïve and selective grazers as affected by stocking density daily dry matter intake was held constant for naïve grazers representing older versions of apex and selective grazers demonstrating new features in order to simplify interpretation of results but intake varied by stocking density and plant species fig 2 3 in a few years there was insufficient forage to meet grazer demand near the end of the season at the highest stocking density this is reflected in a slightly lower mean intake in late august september and october fig 2 selective grazers demonstrated seasonal changes in preference for plant species supporting our first hypothesis selective grazers preference for the c4 perennial grasses endured most of the year at all stocking densities preference for other species was more variable throughout the grazing season fig 3 4 contrary to our second hypothesis selectivity was relatively unaffected by stocking density fig 4 free water consumption followed seasonal temperature patterns for both naïve and selective grazers fig s1 a consequence of selective grazing was that the selective grazers maintained a higher diet quality than the naïve grazers for most of the season whether measured as concentration of nitrogen or digestibility fig 5 the difference in diet quality between the grazer types was greatest early in the grazing season across all stocking rates selective grazers choose a diet that averaged 70 tdn and 11 3 cp through july 15 compared with 68 tdn and 9 6 cp by naïve grazers after july 15 diets were similar in digestibility 60 for both types of grazers and cp 6 6 for selective 6 2 for naïve fig 5 4 2 nutrient excretion simulation results supported our fifth hypothesis that excretion of n p would vary with season and environmental conditions quantity of nitrogen excretion reflected dietary differences between selective and naïve grazers as well as seasonal changes in nitrogen consumption fig 6 the percentage of total nitrogen excretion that was excreted in urine followed the same pattern as the total quantity ranging from nearly 60 for selective grazers in early spring to less than 40 for selective and naïve grazers in mid summer fig 7 excretion of phosphorus in urine was minimal fig s2 excretion of phosphorus in feces generally declined over the course of the grazing season and varied more for selective grazers than naïve grazers fig 6 phosphorus excretion was generally greater for selective grazers than naïve grazers fig 6 year to year variation in daily urinary and fecal n excretion kg animal 1 fig 8 9 on the 3rd day of the month was relatively high in some months i e may june compared to others i e july aug sep urinary and fecal n excretion increased when plants were less stressed in june and july p 0 01 but the same relationship was weaker in may p 0 09 for urinary n and 0 02 for fecal n and not significant p 0 10 in aug or sep fig 8 9 4 3 forage residue at the end of the grazing season mass of standing dead plant residue was less for selective grazers than for naïve grazers at all stocking densities whereas biomass of standing live was greater for selective than naïve grazers at all stocking densities fig 10 this counterintuitive result occurred because selective grazers left more living biomass of the forb a psylostachia and less of the c4 grasses b dactyloides and b gracilis at the end of the grazing season fig 10 however when standing live and standing dead residue were summed together and averaged across stocking rates there was virtually no difference between naïve 969 kg ha 1 and selective grazers 945 kg ha 1 likewise flat residue i e litter was virtually the same for naïve 9 5 kg ha 1 and selective grazers 8 5 kg ha 1 fig 10 supporting our fourth hypothesis biomass of standing live standing dead and flat residue decreased as stocking density increased fig 10 grazer type interacted with plant species in determining the quantity of standing live and standing dead biomass remaining at the end of the grazing season fig 10 in support of our third hypothesis selective grazers left disproportionately more a psylostachia and b arvensis and disproportionately less of the perennial grasses b dactyloides b gracilis and p smithii than did naïve grazers the effects on b dactyloides b gracilis and a psylostachia were exaggerated by stocking density that is to say differences were greatest when stocking densities were greatest fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 selective grazing upgrading the apex model to allow selective grazing caused changes in simulated intake of individual plant species fig 2 3 this change started a chain reaction which affected dietary quality fig 5 the quantity of nutrients excreted fig 6 s2 the form of nutrients excreted fig 7 and residue left in the pasture at the end of the grazing season fig 10 changes in diet quality and nutrient cycling could affect long term productivity and profitability the ability to better simulate changes in nutrient excretion caused by selective grazing also has broader implications for improved modeling of livestock systems for instance increased excretion of nitrogen by selective grazers changes the chemical form of this nutrient from primarily organic forms found in plants to urea in urine impacting its availability to plants and susceptibility to loss from the agricultural system cameron et al 2013 therefore models that do not provide for selective grazing could misrepresent nitrogen losses relative to naïve grazers selective grazers avoided b arvensis during the early grazing season but increased preference for this species as autumn approached the simulated increase in preference with the approach of autumn was due to the decline in quality of other forages which improved the relative palatability of the senesced b arvensis this cool season annual is generally recognized as a poor forage although it likely would have been among the preferred forages if the simulated growing season had begun earlier than 1 may as it was this early growing forage had already declined significantly in quality by 1 may in the field we have observed a preference for the seeds of b arvensis when it reaches maturity at the end of spring in some years but the model did not capture this dynamic because it does not allow for grazing of individual plant parts the other cool season grass the perennial p smithii was the preferred forage at the beginning of the grazing season fig 4 but preference for this perennial declined quickly as it approached maturity in late spring preference for p smithii slowly rebounded from midsummer onward as small amounts of regrowth became available in the cool autumn temperatures at the close of the grazing season p smithii was once again the preferred forage fig 4 at the beginning of the grazing season grazers were indifferent to the c4 grasses b dactyloides and b gracilis indicated by both species having e values near 0 fig 4 however preference for these species quickly increased and remained high throughout the grazing season this can be attributed to their lesser degree of maturity at the outset of summer relative to the c3 grasses and the relatively high forage quality of their senesced forage in late summer and early autumn this result agreed with expectations based on anecdotal field observations preference for the perennial forb a psylostachia was initially low in spring when much of its standing mass was the previous year s senescent growth and it was competing with relatively high quality perennial grasses as summer approached and the grasses reached maturity relative quality of the slowly maturing a psylostachia improved somewhat however as summer progressed and a psylostachia continued to increase in maturity its e declined until the beginning of autumn when most forage had senesced overall the preference for a psylostachia was relatively low given its high cp and digestibility values these positive factors were more than offset by high input values for anti quality factors in the forage generally speaking simulation results accurately represented grazer preferences expected from field observations it was not surprising that selective grazers chose a higher quality diet than naïve grazers before 15 july fig 5 however the similarity in diet quality after 15 july was unanticipated this was likely the consequence of all forages being relatively mature and there being little difference in quality among the 5 forage choices in addition to weaknesses already mentioned the model lacks mechanisms for simulating specific secondary compounds e g alkaloids saponins tannins found in forage as well as the past experience of individual animals both of which influence foraging decisions villalba et al 2015 for instance lyman et al 2012 observed that cattle increased foraging on plants containing high concentrations of alkaloids after first grazing on forages with high concentrations of saponins but apex cannot currently simulate this complex behavior likewise apex s approach to simulating toxins is to reduce the desirability of a particular forage by including an anti quality parameter but the model does not include thresholds at which consumption of the toxin limits intake due to a satiation effect as described by provenza 2003 another area where the complex reality of grazing is simplified by the apex model is in the spatial aspects of grazing large herbivores exhibit preferences for specific locations such as near a water source on gentle slopes and in portions of the landscape known to be nutrient rich bailey et al 1996 through the use of multiple subareas apex could be used to simulate different vegetation communities soils and slopes within a single pasture but it does not yet include a mechanism for grazers to prefer for instance the b gracilis that is growing on a 1 slope over the b gracilis that is growing on a 30 slope in addition apex operates at a spatial scale that does not permit the small scale dynamics of grazing at individual plant or feeding station levels while it is technically feasible to add to apex more complex grazing behavior such as preference based on slopes toxin satiation and complementary effects of secondary compounds such enhancements must be weighed against the price paid in model complexity and demands on the user to provide valid input data for simulations whose objective is to evaluate relatively large scale scale environmental e g erosion and production e g grazing days ha 1 consequences simulation of dietary toxin levels is probably unnecessary in most cases 5 2 stocking density stocking density had little apparent effect on preference by grazers fig 4 diet quality fig 5 or nutrient excretion fig 6 the minimal impact on selectivity was somewhat surprising because we expected a high stocking density to reduce the amount of high quality forage available within a grazing season forcing consumption of less preferred forages the lack of this effect may have been caused by non extreme stocking densities even under the highest stocking density grazers were able to meet their full forage demand in most years in addition one of the three preferred species b gracilis b dactyloides or p smithii was usually available throughout the year long term heavy stocking at this site caused most forages to disappear other than b dactyloides b gracilis and a small remnant population of p smithii launchbaugh 1967 all three are considered preferred species but do not produce large quantities of biomass particularly b dactyloides and b gracilis thus although stocking density affected plant species composition in the historic field study it changed aboveground biomass productivity more than it changed the availability of preferred forage apex simulations begin each year with the same plant populations if apex incorporated simulation of changing plant populations from one year to the next some of these long term dynamics might be captured but would probably have little effect on diet quality at this site and during this grazing period 1 may to 1 oct given the site s assemblage of palatable grasses that are also fairly grazing tolerant the effect of stocking density on diet quality was also somewhat surprising the heaviest stocking densities had slightly higher digestibility and cp concentration in the spring this was the result of interaction between grazers and plant growth plants that were grazed produced regrowth in the model this is represented by a lesser overall stage of maturity in grazed species thus heavier stocking kept plants at an earlier stage of development on average as with impact of stocking density on species selectivity the result might have been different under a more extreme stocking density that is to say if forage supply of preferred forage was inadequate to meet demand animals would be forced to eat more low quality less preferred forage during a particular grazing season as long as sufficient quantities of less preferred forages were available lower digestibility and higher passage rate could limit intake at the most extreme stocking densities forage supply could be exhausted to the extent that forage intake was less than demand because nutrient excretion is directly tied to diet quality excretion of nutrients followed intake of nutrients on an animal 1 basis on an area basis ha 1 both intake fig 2 and excretion data not shown increased proportionately with stocking density 6 conclusions upgrading the apex model by incorporating selective grazing resulted in a change in species selection by grazers overall diet quality nutrient excretion and standing vegetation residue the differences between selective and naïve grazers with respect to the aforementioned variables changed over the course of the grazing season with greatest differences occurring early in the year generally speaking diet preference followed expectations based on literature values a c3 grass was preferred in the spring until it reached maturity after which time c4 grasses were preferred in autumn the c3 perennial was once again the preferred forage the model did not capture the short lived preference for mature seeds of a c3 annual grass that was observed in some years in the field

25160,we modified the grazing module of the apex simulation model to allow for selective grazing of plant species and dietary specific excretion of urine and feces to determine the sensitivity of these changes on nutrient flows vegetation responses and grazer diet we simulated the conditions of a 20 year historic grazing treatment conducted in kansas united states of america simulated scenarios were a factorial of 2 grazer types naïve and selective and 3 stocking densities high medium low naïve grazers represented model behavior before our modifications selective grazers selected forage species based on crude protein content digestibility and anti quality factors we found that the new selective grazing algorithm resulted in a change in grazer diet quality nutrient excretion and standing vegetation residue the difference between selective and naïve grazers varied over the course of the grazing season with greatest differences occurring early in the year c3 grasses were generally preferred in the spring after which time c4 grasses were preferred until autumn simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density although stocking density did impact

and policy makers to develop what if scenarios with different management practices to simulate management s impact on productivity and the environment since 2003 the apex model has been used in this capacity by the conservation effects assessment project ceap within the united states department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs apex is a deterministic process based model that simulates soil processes plant growth agricultural management and environmental outcomes a strength of apex over the closely related model epic williams et al 1984 is that apex can simulate spatial extents ranging from field patches to small watersheds for grazing applications this means that apex could be used to simulate spatial plant herbivore dynamics at pasture ranch or small watershed scales however simulating agricultural systems that include grazers presents a unique set of challenges not faced when simulating cropland jones et al 2017 including the simulation of biologically diverse vegetation plant animal interaction nutrient transfers snow et al 2014 and the longer time frames needed to simulate perennial herbaceous and woody species jones et al 2017 the apex model s ability to simulate prairie plant growth was recently improved zilverberg et al 2017 so that the nrcs could use apex to simulate grazing land as well as cropland however the model s simulation of plant herbivore interactions remained simplistic and thus needed improvement to better simulate conservation practices involving grazing management domestic and wild grazers select a diet from among the choices found in their environment diet selection is the result of a complex interaction of animal and environment stuth 1991 provenza et al 2003 it has long been recognized that preference for a plant species commonly changes throughout the year e g dyksterhuis 1948 senft et al 1985 stuth 1991 as the plant s concentration of nutrients changes its digestibility changes its chemical constituents change and even as its physical structure changes when grazers continually select preferred plant species while ignoring non preferred species they can shift the competitive balance of those plant species in their environment for instance differences in stocking rates in the great plains of north america create different vegetation communities launchbaugh 1967 hanson et al 1978 porensky et al 2016 subsequently grazers diet choices are limited to the plant species present in the altered vegetative community diet intake can also be altered due to changes in biomass availability resulting from grazing thus constraining future selectivity and or selection of lower preference species walker 1993 rangeland models commonly include features to allow selective grazing for example the savanna model coughenour 1993 allows the user to rank plant species according to preference by each grazer species edys coldren et al 2011 goes a step further by also subdividing plant species by plant parts the sustainable grazing system model johnson et al 2003 assigns preference parameters to individual species as well as leaf vs stem within a species b cullen personal communication phygrow stuth et al 2003b allows the user to assign a preference class preferred desirable undesirable or non consumed rather than a numerical ranking to each plant part leaf vs wood and growth stage rapid dormant and dead of each plant species for each grazer animal species gpfarm range assigns preference values to plant functional groups andales et al 2005 blackburn and kothmann 1991 developed a model that incorporated nitrogen concentration digestibility and anti quality factors of the plant species into a single equation to determine its desirability originally a crop model apex lacked simulation of selective grazing its grazers consumed plants in equal proportion to their environmental abundance to address shortcomings in apex s handling of selective grazing and nutrient cycling related to grazing we made several updates to the model the purpose of this article is to describe those changes demonstrate the impact of those changes under various scenarios and identify the model s sensitivity to changing environmental and management conditions we hypothesize that 1 our model updates will more accurately depict seasonality of grazing preferences for certain plant species as compared to older versions of apex 2 simulated selectivity will decrease as stocking density increases 3 preferred plant species will have less standing mass at the end of the grazing season when grazed by selective grazers rather than naïve grazers 4 at the end of the grazing season total residue and total standing mass will not differ between selective and naïve grazers for a given stocking rate and 5 excretion of n p will vary with season and environmental conditions 2 updates made to the model the apex agricultural policy environmental extender model is designed to simulate the impacts of agricultural management on whole farms and small watersheds it uses a daily time step and is primarily deterministic the model s major components were described by gassman et al 2010 and are represented in fig 1 to enhance plant animal interactions in apex we began by requiring additional input specifications at the plant and animal levels these will be described followed by several sections detailing the plant animal interaction initial efforts have focused on beef cattle production because this is the dominant type of animal production on u s grazing lands and because of the detailed information available however the design remains flexible to allow anticipated expansion for other types of grazers 2 1 vegetation specifications previous versions of apex included nitrogen concentration n of standing live and dead plant species so it was a simple matter to calculate crude protein cp of forage as 6 25 n however apex did not include measures of digestibility or energy content of forages thus we added the ability to simulate total digestible nutrients tdn which ranges from 0 to 100 to estimate tdn the user enters a maximum and a minimum tdn value for each forage the model simulates changes in tdn on a daily basis using a linear equation that decreases from the maximum to the minimum according to the plant s maturity for example suppose a species requires 1400 heat units to reach maturity has accumulated 1000 heat units in the current year and has maximum and minimum tdn values of 80 and 50 respectively its current tdn would be 80 1000 1400 80 50 58 6 2 2 grazer specifications a grazer specification file which includes all of the grazer types that can be used in a simulation was developed for the updated model as with crop and forage species the file comes with preloaded default values but these can be changed by the user users can also create new grazers grazers are defined in part by their full body weight fbw kg and an option for how to calculate daily dry matter intake dmi kg in this study we restrict our use to apex s simple intake option which assumes that grazers are neither gaining nor losing body weight and that daily dry matter forage intake is a percentage of body weight 1 dmi pb fbw where pb is percentage of body weight defined by the user in the grazer input file grazers are also described by their thresholds for preferred desirable and undesirable forage as well as their tolerance for forage anti quality factors these are described in detail in section 2 5 in the previous version of apex apex 1501 only one herd could graze an area at a given time this restriction has been removed so that an unlimited number of herds can graze an area at the same time each herd is composed of homogeneous individuals except for a cow calf herd which includes both cows and calves at certain times of the year each grazer also has a stocking density ha animal 1 and grazing threshold kg ha 1 when standing forage including both live and dead passes below this threshold the grazer ceases grazing optionally the user can choose to have deficits of intake demand filled with hay because each grazer has a unique threshold it is possible to allow one herd to continue grazing while another herd is fed hay or rotates to a different subarea when plant growth brings standing forage above the grazing threshold grazing of a subarea resumes if grazers are present hay consumption is reduced accordingly 2 3 water intake the quantity of water consumed is the sum of free water intake drinking water and water contained in the forage or feed consumed free water fw liters is calculated as a function of heat ball et al 1999 using 2 fw 0 076 fbw0 7086 tx0 7146 where tx is 2 0 or the maximum daily temperature ⁰c whichever is greater water content wc of standing dead vegetation was assumed to be 10 water content of standing live vegetation follows an s shaped curve decreasing from 75 water content at emergence to 25 water content at maturity 2 4 excretion of urine and feces all forage consumed is assumed to be digested or excreted the portion of ingested forage that is digestible is defined by tdn thus the dry weight of feces is 3 feces dmi 1 tdn 100 where tdn ranges from 0 to 100 the quantity of urinary water produced is a fixed percentage of water consumption based on the work of paquay et al 1970a b and betteridge and andrewes 1986 4 urinary water 0 31 wf fw where wf is the volume of water in forage consumed in liters apex simulates the cycling of n and p for grazing animals most nutrients are either excreted in feces and urine or contained in animal products such as weight gain or milk small amounts of nutrients may be lost via other avenues such as hair fall and saliva but these are insignificant for purposes of this simulation therefore we ignore these other losses and conserve n and p within the system by using equation 5 5 nutrient excreted nutrient intake nutrient in products for animals at homeostasis nutrient in products 0 and thus all n and p consumed are excreted in feces or urine excreted p pe is assumed to be partitioned among urine pu and feces pf as follows based on karn 2001 review of the literature 6 pu 0 04 pe 7 pf 0 96 pe the fraction of n that is excreted ne in urine rather than feces increases with dietary cp concentration dcp we employed an equation developed by waldrip et al 2013 to adjust the fraction of n excreted in urine fnu with changes in dcp 8 fnu 1 8 dcp 28 8 then total urinary n nu and fecal n nf are given by 9 nu ne fnu 10 nf ne nu where ne is total n excreted urinary and fecal n and p are returned to the soil surface in mineral and organic forms table s1 urinary n is treated as mineral n because although urinary n is primarily urea it is quickly converted to ammonium in the soil bussink and oenema 1998 the concentration of c in urine is simulated as 43 of the concentration of mineral n in urine following the elemental proportions of urea the concentration of c in feces is a constant 35 of the fecal dry weight 2 5 diet selection the most biologically important and computationally intensive improvement to apex grazing was the implementation of selective grazing in previous versions apex grazers had indiscriminately consumed standing forage in equal proportion to its fraction of the total standing mass that is to say if the standing live mass of a particular grass species composed 30 of the total mass of standing live and dead vegetation it also composed 30 of every grazer s diet differential forage preference the measure of relative intake of alternative forages allen et al 2011 was lacking the revised version adopts the general approach and empirical equations of the phygrow model stuth et al 2003b phygrow has been used for more than a decade to simulate anticipated forage shortages stuth et al 2003a 2005 angerer 2012 in phygrow and the revised version of apex the preference by a certain grazer for a certain unit of vegetation on a given day is classified in one of four categories 1 preferred 2 desirable 3 undesirable or 4 non consumed these categories are the same as those used by the nrcs bureau of land management and united states forest service when developing an ecological site description esd as well as phygrow however both phygrow and esd s use the additional categories of emergency and toxic because these categories only apply to extreme situations and because apex does not simulate the effects of toxic forage consumption the emergency and toxic categories were not included in apex for purposes of simplification for the nrcs the unit of vegetation is the plant species which when supported by direct observation and or literature may further be divided into plant parts leaves stems twigs fruit mast for phygrow each species has 10 potential units of vegetation for which a preference class must be defined four herbaceous growth stages four woody growth stages herbaceous litter and woody litter thus phygrow simulations require inputting a number of plant animal matrices one for each grazer that define the preference of that grazer for each of the plant species and its 10 potential growth and litter stages the edys model coldren et al 2011 takes a similar approach but includes as many preference categories as there are plant species thus both phygrow and edys require that a user input large plant animal preference matrices the mathematical model described by senft 1989 requires assigning preference parameters for each plant species or plant community this approach is valid across different mixes of the same species but requires re recalculation of a parameter when species are added or subtracted from the list senft 1989 p 299 apex takes a different approach to assigning preference classes this approach seeks to limit the number of user inputs required while remaining general enough to apply to many ecosystems with few or no changes required to input parameters standing n g m 2 of a plant community has been shown to be correlated with grazing preference senft et al 1985 on a daily basis apex calculates a forage quality qgf for each combination of forage f and grazer g based on nitrogen concentration total digestible nutrients and forage anti quality factors based on the approach of blackburn and kothman 1991 apex adds a fourth factor not included by blackburn and kothman 1991 the grazer s tolerance to forage anti quality factors 11 qgf minimum 0 032 n concentration g g 1 minimum 0 9 tdn g g 1 minimum 1 1 grazer anti quality tolerance anti quality of forage where the grazer anti quality tolerance ranges from 0 no tolerance to 1 unaffected by anti quality factors and forage anti quality also ranges from 0 no anti quality factors to 1 extreme anti quality factors anti quality factors may be chemical e g tannins or physical e g spines qgf is calculated separately for standing live and standing dead of each forage then the relative qgf rqgf of each live and dead forage is calculated as 12 rqgf qgf maximum qgf where maximum qgf is the maximum qgf value of all forages for a particular grazer each grazer in apex has three rqg thresholds that define when forages pass from preferred to desirable from desirable to undesirable and from undesirable to non consumed for instance a grazer with rqg thresholds of 0 15 0 60 and 0 95 would consider all forages with rqgf 1 0 0 15 to be preferred those from 1 0 0 60 to 1 0 0 15 to be desirable those from 1 0 0 95 to 1 0 0 60 to be undesirable and those 1 0 0 95 to be non consumed the same thresholds are used for all forage species apex maintains separate pools of standing live and dead forage for each forage species each with its own rqgf therefore live and dead biomass of the same species can simultaneously be in different preference classes litter plant material lying on the ground is not consumed by grazers in apex except to distinguish between living and dead biomass apex does not maintain separate pools of standing biomass that is to say it does not distinguish between leaf stem or woody biomass in apex preferred forages are consumed in greater proportion than their contribution to the total standing mass undesirable forages are consumed in smaller proportion than they occur in the total standing mass the proportional consumption of desirable species depends upon other forages available the equations were derived by quirk and stuth 1995 13 pfracg 1 e 3 65 pf gi tf gi 14 ufracg 0 031971 e2 89 uf gi tf gi 15 dfracg 1 0 ufracg pfracg where g refers to the grazer i refers to the day pfrac refers to the fraction of the diet that is preferred pf is the quantity kg ha 1 of preferred forage tf is the sum of all standing live and dead forage kg ha 1 ufrac is the fraction of the diet that is undesirable uf is the quantity of undesirable forage kg ha 1 and dfrac is the fraction of the diet that is desirable if there are more than one species in the same preference class they will be consumed in their relative proportions for example if species a 500 kg ha 1 and species b 750 kg ha 1 are both preferred forages pfracg 80 and dmi is 10 kg the grazer will consume 8 kg of preferred forage of the 8 kg 3 2 kg will come from a and 4 8 kg from b because both pfrac and dfrac range between 0 and 1 but sum to less than 1 an animal s diet is always guaranteed to contain all forages classified as preferred desirable or undesirable assuming there is enough forage to meet the grazing threshold thus a mixed diet is achieved but the results are deterministic spatial simulation of grazing is possible when simulating more than one subarea but a herd in the model can only graze one subarea per day thus simulating vegetation patchiness and spatial selectivity of grazing stations at the sub paddock level is currently not possible with apex when multiple grazers demand the same plant species and life class live or dead in greater proportion than its availability apex executes a conflict resolution algorithm consumption of the species and life class demanded is proportionally reduced for each grazer such that all available is consumed then to make up the grazers demand deficit each grazer consumes remaining species in proportion to their fraction in the standing mass that is to say naïvely this naïve grazing is used for conflict resolution because it requires less computation than required by executing preferential grazing an unknown number of times and because the amount of the grazers diet affected would typically be small over the course of a simulation 3 sensitivity analysis to test the sensitivity of the new features added to apex we simulated plant animal interactions at hays kansas usa 38 87 n 99 31 w this site corresponds to the loamy upland ecological site in major land resource area 73 usda nrcs united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 2006 a long term grazing experiment at hays was described by launchbaugh 1957 1967 and the different vegetation communities were simulated by zilverberg et al 2017 mean annual precipitation from 1936 to 1965 was 586 mm of which 79 fell from april through september noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 mean annual temperatures for the period were annual maximum 42 c daily mean 12 c and annual minimum 24 c noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 pastures were grazed by yearling steers or heifers from may 1 to oct 1 or nov 1 except when grazing was terminated early due to lack of forage launchbaugh 1967 we simulated the hays site using the same input soil harney silt loam time period 1936 1965 and historic weather noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 as zilverberg et al 2017 we used the same input vegetation as the light grazing treatment from zilverberg et al 2017 which included two perennial c4 grasses blue grama bouteloua gracilis and buffalograss bouteloua dactyloides one perennial c3 grass western wheatgrass pascopyrum smithii an annual c3 grass japanese brome bromus arvensis and a perennial forb western ragweed ambrosia psylostachia vegetative species were based on launchbaugh 1967 measurements all grasses were given values of 0 for anti quality factors ambrosia psylostachia was simulated with a 0 7 anti quality factor at emergence and 0 9 at maturity to demonstrate the degree of selectivity introduced by the model improvements we simulated two different grazer types 1 naïve grazers like those of previous versions of apex and 2 selective grazers that demonstrated preference for specific forages the selective grazers were yearling steers weighing 313 kg throughout each grazing season we used a value of 2 5 for dmi the hay feeding option was not used we applied three different stocking densities 0 5 0 7 or 1 25 animal ha 1 to the vegetation from the historic light grazing treatment launchbaugh 1967 to test our hypothesis that selectivity would decrease as stocking density increased grazers and stocking densities were applied in a factorial arrangement such that we had 6 total scenarios 2 grazers 3 densities the model was run once for each scenario each simulation included the years 1936 through 1965 we report the final 20 years of each simulation which correspond to the 20 years of the historic grazing experiment 1946 1965 to evaluate selectivity of simulated grazers we used vanderploeg and scavia 1979 electivity index e which lechowicz 1982 recommended from among a suite of electivity indices the equation is 16 wi ri pi ri pi 17 e i wi 1 n wi 1 n where r is the quantity of forage consumed kg ha 1 p is the quantity of forage available kg ha 1 and n is the number of forages we calculated a single e for each forage species including both standing live and standing dead mass e was calculated on a daily basis for the duration of the simulation we report the mean daily value of e for each forage and interpret larger e values as indicators of greater preference to further demonstrate the impact or lack thereof of selective grazing stocking density and weather on environmental variables we also report the following for each scenario dmi by plant species water consumption total urinary and fecal n p and end of grazing season standing live dead and surface residue finally to demonstrate the variation in nutrient cycling caused by the interaction of model updates and environment we evaluated urinary and fecal n excretion on the 3rd day of each month from may through sep of each of the 20 simulated years at the moderate stocking density using selective grazers on each day we developed a simple linear regression relating a dependent variable urinary n excreted kg animal 1 or fecal n excreted kg animal 1 to a dependent variable water stress water stress was the mean water stress value of the five forage species water stress values range from 0 extreme stress to 1 no stress we report the r2 of each regression and the p value of an f test of the regression 4 results of sensitivity analysis 4 1 intake of naïve and selective grazers as affected by stocking density daily dry matter intake was held constant for naïve grazers representing older versions of apex and selective grazers demonstrating new features in order to simplify interpretation of results but intake varied by stocking density and plant species fig 2 3 in a few years there was insufficient forage to meet grazer demand near the end of the season at the highest stocking density this is reflected in a slightly lower mean intake in late august september and october fig 2 selective grazers demonstrated seasonal changes in preference for plant species supporting our first hypothesis selective grazers preference for the c4 perennial grasses endured most of the year at all stocking densities preference for other species was more variable throughout the grazing season fig 3 4 contrary to our second hypothesis selectivity was relatively unaffected by stocking density fig 4 free water consumption followed seasonal temperature patterns for both naïve and selective grazers fig s1 a consequence of selective grazing was that the selective grazers maintained a higher diet quality than the naïve grazers for most of the season whether measured as concentration of nitrogen or digestibility fig 5 the difference in diet quality between the grazer types was greatest early in the grazing season across all stocking rates selective grazers choose a diet that averaged 70 tdn and 11 3 cp through july 15 compared with 68 tdn and 9 6 cp by naïve grazers after july 15 diets were similar in digestibility 60 for both types of grazers and cp 6 6 for selective 6 2 for naïve fig 5 4 2 nutrient excretion simulation results supported our fifth hypothesis that excretion of n p would vary with season and environmental conditions quantity of nitrogen excretion reflected dietary differences between selective and naïve grazers as well as seasonal changes in nitrogen consumption fig 6 the percentage of total nitrogen excretion that was excreted in urine followed the same pattern as the total quantity ranging from nearly 60 for selective grazers in early spring to less than 40 for selective and naïve grazers in mid summer fig 7 excretion of phosphorus in urine was minimal fig s2 excretion of phosphorus in feces generally declined over the course of the grazing season and varied more for selective grazers than naïve grazers fig 6 phosphorus excretion was generally greater for selective grazers than naïve grazers fig 6 year to year variation in daily urinary and fecal n excretion kg animal 1 fig 8 9 on the 3rd day of the month was relatively high in some months i e may june compared to others i e july aug sep urinary and fecal n excretion increased when plants were less stressed in june and july p 0 01 but the same relationship was weaker in may p 0 09 for urinary n and 0 02 for fecal n and not significant p 0 10 in aug or sep fig 8 9 4 3 forage residue at the end of the grazing season mass of standing dead plant residue was less for selective grazers than for naïve grazers at all stocking densities whereas biomass of standing live was greater for selective than naïve grazers at all stocking densities fig 10 this counterintuitive result occurred because selective grazers left more living biomass of the forb a psylostachia and less of the c4 grasses b dactyloides and b gracilis at the end of the grazing season fig 10 however when standing live and standing dead residue were summed together and averaged across stocking rates there was virtually no difference between naïve 969 kg ha 1 and selective grazers 945 kg ha 1 likewise flat residue i e litter was virtually the same for naïve 9 5 kg ha 1 and selective grazers 8 5 kg ha 1 fig 10 supporting our fourth hypothesis biomass of standing live standing dead and flat residue decreased as stocking density increased fig 10 grazer type interacted with plant species in determining the quantity of standing live and standing dead biomass remaining at the end of the grazing season fig 10 in support of our third hypothesis selective grazers left disproportionately more a psylostachia and b arvensis and disproportionately less of the perennial grasses b dactyloides b gracilis and p smithii than did naïve grazers the effects on b dactyloides b gracilis and a psylostachia were exaggerated by stocking density that is to say differences were greatest when stocking densities were greatest fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 selective grazing upgrading the apex model to allow selective grazing caused changes in simulated intake of individual plant species fig 2 3 this change started a chain reaction which affected dietary quality fig 5 the quantity of nutrients excreted fig 6 s2 the form of nutrients excreted fig 7 and residue left in the pasture at the end of the grazing season fig 10 changes in diet quality and nutrient cycling could affect long term productivity and profitability the ability to better simulate changes in nutrient excretion caused by selective grazing also has broader implications for improved modeling of livestock systems for instance increased excretion of nitrogen by selective grazers changes the chemical form of this nutrient from primarily organic forms found in plants to urea in urine impacting its availability to plants and susceptibility to loss from the agricultural system cameron et al 2013 therefore models that do not provide for selective grazing could misrepresent nitrogen losses relative to naïve grazers selective grazers avoided b arvensis during the early grazing season but increased preference for this species as autumn approached the simulated increase in preference with the approach of autumn was due to the decline in quality of other forages which improved the relative palatability of the senesced b arvensis this cool season annual is generally recognized as a poor forage although it likely would have been among the preferred forages if the simulated growing season had begun earlier than 1 may as it was this early growing forage had already declined significantly in quality by 1 may in the field we have observed a preference for the seeds of b arvensis when it reaches maturity at the end of spring in some years but the model did not capture this dynamic because it does not allow for grazing of individual plant parts the other cool season grass the perennial p smithii was the preferred forage at the beginning of the grazing season fig 4 but preference for this perennial declined quickly as it approached maturity in late spring preference for p smithii slowly rebounded from midsummer onward as small amounts of regrowth became available in the cool autumn temperatures at the close of the grazing season p smithii was once again the preferred forage fig 4 at the beginning of the grazing season grazers were indifferent to the c4 grasses b dactyloides and b gracilis indicated by both species having e values near 0 fig 4 however preference for these species quickly increased and remained high throughout the grazing season this can be attributed to their lesser degree of maturity at the outset of summer relative to the c3 grasses and the relatively high forage quality of their senesced forage in late summer and early autumn this result agreed with expectations based on anecdotal field observations preference for the perennial forb a psylostachia was initially low in spring when much of its standing mass was the previous year s senescent growth and it was competing with relatively high quality perennial grasses as summer approached and the grasses reached maturity relative quality of the slowly maturing a psylostachia improved somewhat however as summer progressed and a psylostachia continued to increase in maturity its e declined until the beginning of autumn when most forage had senesced overall the preference for a psylostachia was relatively low given its high cp and digestibility values these positive factors were more than offset by high input values for anti quality factors in the forage generally speaking simulation results accurately represented grazer preferences expected from field observations it was not surprising that selective grazers chose a higher quality diet than naïve grazers before 15 july fig 5 however the similarity in diet quality after 15 july was unanticipated this was likely the consequence of all forages being relatively mature and there being little difference in quality among the 5 forage choices in addition to weaknesses already mentioned the model lacks mechanisms for simulating specific secondary compounds e g alkaloids saponins tannins found in forage as well as the past experience of individual animals both of which influence foraging decisions villalba et al 2015 for instance lyman et al 2012 observed that cattle increased foraging on plants containing high concentrations of alkaloids after first grazing on forages with high concentrations of saponins but apex cannot currently simulate this complex behavior likewise apex s approach to simulating toxins is to reduce the desirability of a particular forage by including an anti quality parameter but the model does not include thresholds at which consumption of the toxin limits intake due to a satiation effect as described by provenza 2003 another area where the complex reality of grazing is simplified by the apex model is in the spatial aspects of grazing large herbivores exhibit preferences for specific locations such as near a water source on gentle slopes and in portions of the landscape known to be nutrient rich bailey et al 1996 through the use of multiple subareas apex could be used to simulate different vegetation communities soils and slopes within a single pasture but it does not yet include a mechanism for grazers to prefer for instance the b gracilis that is growing on a 1 slope over the b gracilis that is growing on a 30 slope in addition apex operates at a spatial scale that does not permit the small scale dynamics of grazing at individual plant or feeding station levels while it is technically feasible to add to apex more complex grazing behavior such as preference based on slopes toxin satiation and complementary effects of secondary compounds such enhancements must be weighed against the price paid in model complexity and demands on the user to provide valid input data for simulations whose objective is to evaluate relatively large scale scale environmental e g erosion and production e g grazing days ha 1 consequences simulation of dietary toxin levels is probably unnecessary in most cases 5 2 stocking density stocking density had little apparent effect on preference by grazers fig 4 diet quality fig 5 or nutrient excretion fig 6 the minimal impact on selectivity was somewhat surprising because we expected a high stocking density to reduce the amount of high quality forage available within a grazing season forcing consumption of less preferred forages the lack of this effect may have been caused by non extreme stocking densities even under the highest stocking density grazers were able to meet their full forage demand in most years in addition one of the three preferred species b gracilis b dactyloides or p smithii was usually available throughout the year long term heavy stocking at this site caused most forages to disappear other than b dactyloides b gracilis and a small remnant population of p smithii launchbaugh 1967 all three are considered preferred species but do not produce large quantities of biomass particularly b dactyloides and b gracilis thus although stocking density affected plant species composition in the historic field study it changed aboveground biomass productivity more than it changed the availability of preferred forage apex simulations begin each year with the same plant populations if apex incorporated simulation of changing plant populations from one year to the next some of these long term dynamics might be captured but would probably have little effect on diet quality at this site and during this grazing period 1 may to 1 oct given the site s assemblage of palatable grasses that are also fairly grazing tolerant the effect of stocking density on diet quality was also somewhat surprising the heaviest stocking densities had slightly higher digestibility and cp concentration in the spring this was the result of interaction between grazers and plant growth plants that were grazed produced regrowth in the model this is represented by a lesser overall stage of maturity in grazed species thus heavier stocking kept plants at an earlier stage of development on average as with impact of stocking density on species selectivity the result might have been different under a more extreme stocking density that is to say if forage supply of preferred forage was inadequate to meet demand animals would be forced to eat more low quality less preferred forage during a particular grazing season as long as sufficient quantities of less preferred forages were available lower digestibility and higher passage rate could limit intake at the most extreme stocking densities forage supply could be exhausted to the extent that forage intake was less than demand because nutrient excretion is directly tied to diet quality excretion of nutrients followed intake of nutrients on an animal 1 basis on an area basis ha 1 both intake fig 2 and excretion data not shown increased proportionately with stocking density 6 conclusions upgrading the apex model by incorporating selective grazing resulted in a change in species selection by grazers overall diet quality nutrient excretion and standing vegetation residue the differences between selective and naïve grazers with respect to the aforementioned variables changed over the course of the grazing season with greatest differences occurring early in the year generally speaking diet preference followed expectations based on literature values a c3 grass was preferred in the spring until it reached maturity after which time c4 grasses were preferred in autumn the c3 perennial was once again the preferred forage the model did not capture the short lived preference for mature seeds of a c3 annual grass that was observed in some years in the field because apex remains unable to distinguish grazers preferences for different plant parts e g leaves stems seeds mast this is a cost of minimizing user input requirements simulated diet quality was relatively insensitive to stocking density although stocking density did impact standing vegetation residue urinary and fecal n excretion varied seasonally and interacted with weather induced plant water stress the revised model s ability to simulate differences in vegetation residue diet quality and nutrient excretion provide necessary building blocks to use or improve the model for the

25161,this article introduces the ahc model as a new tool for modeling and assessing the agroecosystem processes the ahc as a one dimensional numerical physical model simulates the soil water and salt nitrogen dynamics heat transport and crop growth and yield in various soil crop environments the key features of the ahc include that it provides the optional function for simulating the fate of salt or nitrogen it has an efficient global method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation and it is useful in a wide range of field conditions especially for those in northern china a menu driven program is developed as a user friendly interface for efficient data manipulation this paper primarily describes the main structures and algorithms of the ahc and presents its field applicability model testing and application was conducted with two cases 1 a salinity case with maize growing in salt affected fields under arid and shallow groundwater environments hetao upper yellow river basin northwest china and 2 a nitrogen case with a wheat maize rotation system in the semihumid monsoon region tai an north china plain good agreement was obtained between the simulated and observed data including the soil water contents salt nitrogen contents and crop growth indicators the soil water and salt nitrogen dynamics crop growth processes and their complex interactive effects were also well interpreted using the ahc rational simulation proves the good applicability of the ahc for practical field use keywords soil water salinity nitrogen crop growth model calibration numerical modeling 1 introduction agroecosystem models can be defined as a quantitative scheme for predicting hydrological chemical and biological processes in soil crop systems with relevant human and environmental factors on various scales monteith 1996 sinclair and seligman 2000 steduto et al 2009 the functions and applications of the model mainly include evaluating field experiments searching for the best management practices and use as heuristic tools in teaching and research sinclair and seligman 1996 cameira et al 2007 šimůnek et al 2016 current agroecosystem models have varying degrees of numerical sophistication ranging from purely empirical to highly mechanistic monteith 1996 kucharik 2003 in the aspect of agro hydrological processes the models can be classified as balance and physically mechanistic models the former includes the lumped balance models e g simdualkc and the cascading layer models e g aquacrop and dssat rosa et al 2012 steduto et al 2009 jones et al 2003 the latter are fully based on deterministic and physical laws such as hydrus swap daisy and rzwqm šimůnek et al 2005 van dam et al 1997 hansen 2002 ahuja et al 2000 for the aspect of crop growth and yield formation the models might be divided into empirical models and process based models empirical models consist of empirical functions that are chosen to fit measurements from the field process based models often simulate the plant biomass or organ development based on the plant physiology or morphology typically as epic wofost and dssat williams et al 1984 van diepen et al 1989 hoogenboom et al 2015 so far agro ecosystem modeling is still facing some disputes and dilemmas in the generality of models and in the balance of simplicity and complexity therond et al 2011 rosa et al 2012 sinclair and seligman 2000 on the other hand existing agroecosystem models generally have different functionalities for practical use models for irrigation management mainly focus on soil water salinity and crops e g simdualkc aquacrop swap and saltmod oosterbaan 2001 while the suite of specialized crop models always includes the simulation of the fate of nutrients or even the soil carbon balance such as epic rzwqm dssat and apsim mccown et al 1996 moreover some researchers conclude that the agroecosystem models can be classified into two types of approaches scientific and engineering steduto et al 2009 the first aims to improve the understanding of crop behavior based on physiology and the second attempts to provide management advice to farmers and policymakers generally a common consensus is that it is impossible to create universal models as each season or new location brings new challenges that are not foreseen in the original model sinclair and seligman 2000 therefore considerable and continuous efforts of modification of model functions are thus necessary to make the model cope with discrepancies that derive from the changes in the peculiarities of the application environments sinclair and seligman 1996 2000 coucheney et al 2015 xu et al 2016 model calibration is another major challenge in agroecosystem modeling involving a sensitivity analysis sa parameter estimation pe and uncertainty analysis xu et al 2016 the sa is a critical step to identify the sensitive and important parameters dejonge et al 2012 the most popular sa practice is that of the oat one factor at a time method which has the limitation of local attributes of data sampling in addition to local methods global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are recently more preferred and applied to some agroecosystem models typically as the extended fast sobol and lh oat methods zhao et al 2014 della peruta et al 2014 xu et al 2016 the automatic inverse optimization method is becoming a preferred alternative in parameter estimation the local pe method has been widely used however it may prematurely terminate the search and thus is prone to find local rather than global minima šimůnek et al 2012 the global pe methods become a better alternative when more parameters are to be estimated or a more complex model adopted some classic applications in agroecosystem modeling include the use of pest genetic algorithm glue ensemble kalman filter and shuffled complex methods doherty 2005 ines and droogers 2002 abbaspour et al 2001 evensen 2003 duan et al 1994 to our knowledge only a few mature models release their own specific pe module for practical use e g the inverse solution based on the gradient type minimization method in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2012 and the dssat glue program jones et al 2011 an uncertainty analysis is also applied for model parameters xu et al 2016 however especially in watershed hydrologic modeling because of the high uncertainty at large scales yang et al 2008 in view of previous studies the agroecosystem models developed by different research institutions usually have relatively specific backgrounds features and adaptabilities the deficiencies in the application of existing models may be considered as 1 most models only focus on either the salinity simulation or the nitrogen simulation and the interaction with crop growth 2 few models provide mature functions to efficiently handle the parameter calibration and 3 the models often cannot be directly used in changed environments different from its original development without a certain or even significant degree of modification of model functions meanwhile the water deficit secondary salinity and unreasonable nitrogen fertilization are the three most significant issues that agroecosystems are facing in many regions worldwide these issues exist particularly in different areas of northern china therefore in this paper we propose a new model software named ahc for agroecosystem simulation with the motivation of integrating our previous experimental and modeling work related to various conditions in the yellow river basin north china plain and hexi corridor region of northern china xu et al 2011 2012a xu et al 2012b 2013 xu et al 2015 2016 jiang et al 2015 wang and huang 2008 wang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 neng 2016 the ahc is developed as a systematic tool to numerically simulate the soil water flow the fate of salt or nitrogen heat transport and crop growth and yield with the effects of ambient environmental changes the efficient global methods for sensitivity analysis and inverse estimation of parameters are also involved the conceptual framework and distinctive components and features of the ahc are herein described and then the model is applied in two case studies related to salinity and nitrogen issues respectively these two examples of applications could provide a comprehensive presentation of the main features and applicability of our proposed model 2 model description 2 1 overview of ahc and its components the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator is designed with two main parts i e the mathematical model and the graphical user interface gui the mathematical model as the core of the ahc could be seen as composed of three processes agroecosystem simulation aesim process global sensitivity analysis gsa process and global parameter estimation gpe process process could be defined as a kind of modularization entity and each process is a part of code that performs certain functions by specific methods the source code is all written in fortran and compiled with intel visual fortran composer xe 2011 the friendly gui is developed for pre and post processing of datasets using the visual basic net vb net programming language in microsoft visual studio 2010 the mathematical model of fortran codes is packaged into the gui program the aesim process is inherited and modified from the previous agro hydrological model swap epic it consisted of five main modules related to soil water evaporation and transpiration solute heat and plant the main calculation flow chart is presented in fig 1 the soil water module is mainly drawn from the swap model van dam et al 1997 with significant improvements related to soil evaporation root water uptake soil thawing etc xu et al 2013 2015 the solute transport module was originally developed by xu et al 2016 for the simulation of salinity which is adopted and continuously improved in particular the function of simulating the fate of nitrogen is newly added for solute transport in ahc which is based on the previous modeling work on nitrogen simulation on the north china plain ncp wang and huang 2008 wang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 the heat transport is simulated using a convection dispersion equation crop growth and yield formation are simulated with the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 with the code compiled by xu et al 2013 thus the ahc became a one dimensional 1 d physically based model that in brief simulates water flow solute transport and transformation optionally salt or nitrogen heat transport and crop growth and yield in agricultural fields the simulation of soil water salt and crop growth has been preliminarily tested with several crops e g wheat maize cabbage and sunflower and different field conditions e g different soils and deep or shallow water tables when using the previous version swap epic xu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2015 neng 2016 by close coupling with arcinfo 9 the gis based version is also applied to access the regional water use and water productivity xu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the gsa process and gpe process are used in conjunction to determine the parameters for model calibration the former is based on an efficient latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method and the latter is developed using the modified micro genetic algorithm modified mga they have been developed and preliminarily tested in the parameter calibration of swap epic with a two year experiment in a salt affected wheat field xu et al 2016 the friendly gui is preliminarily developed by neng 2016 with continuous testing and improvement 2 2 detailed description of model components and mechanisms 2 2 1 agroecosystem simulation aesim process 1 soil water flow the soil water flow module is based on using the 1 d richards equation for vertical flow 1 c h h t z k h h z 1 s h where c is the differential soil water capacity cm 1 h is the soil water pressure head cm t is time d z is the vertical coordinate cm positive upward k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 and s is the sink term cm3 cm 3 d 1 this equation is solved using an implicit finite difference scheme eq 1 requires knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties which are described by the van genuchten mualem vgm model van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 as follows 2 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n 1 1 n 3 k h k s s e λ 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 where se is the effective saturation θ is the soil water content cm3 cm 3 θr and θs denote the residual and saturated water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 α cm 1 and n are empirical shape parameters and λ is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter the top boundary condition can be determined by the rates of actual evaporation ea and actual transpiration ta and the fluxes of irrigation precipitation and interception potential evapotranspiration et is estimated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and it is first separated into potential soil evaporation ep and potential crop transpiration tp based upon the leaf area index lai actual evaporation and transpiration rates are then respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the surface soil and the root zone three functions could be optionally used to estimate ea under dry soil conditions the effect of film mulches on soil evaporation can be considered to further limit the soil evaporation moreover a surface reservoir boundary condition is applied if surface ponding is expected to develop additionally the surface runoff is allowed when the water ponding depth is over a user specified maximum ponding height the detailed calculations related to the upper boundary can be found in annex a the model further provides eight options to prescribe the lower boundary conditions the dirichlet type pressure head as a function of time neumann type bottom flux as a function of time cauchy type bottom flux as a function of groundwater level and free drainage in deep groundwater level conditions lateral field drainage fluxes to the drainage system are alternatively simulated using a simple linear or nonlinear i e using the drainage equations of hooghoudt and ernst relationship between groundwater level and drainage flux since the treatment of the bottom boundary conditions and lateral drainage is kept same as that in swap model a brief introduction of principles and equations is provided in annex e a more detailed description can be found in kroes and van dam 2003 initial conditions can be implemented with three input options the soil water content pressure heads or a groundwater level when assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil profile the sink term s is the actual soil water extraction rate by plant roots its potential rate at a certain depth sp z is calculated by distributing tp into each root zone compartment as a function of the specified root length density the actual root water uptake rate sa z is determined by considering the water and salt stress that is assumed to be multiplicative the integration of sa z over the rooting depth is equal to the ta rate in addition the function of the compensated root water uptake could be considered following the conception of jarvis 1989 it represents a threshold value above which the root water uptake reduced in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by uptake from other less stressed parts šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the detailed algorithm for root water uptake under stress can be found in annex a 2 solute transport and transformation salinity and nitrogen a significant modification is introduced to the solute module for the ahc compared with the older version of swap epic only for salinity issue in xu et al 2016 in the latest module the general formulation of the mass conservation and transport equations involving in a sequential first order decay chain during transient water flow in a variably saturated rigid porous medium are taken as 4 θ c 1 ρ b q 1 t q c 1 z z θ d d i f 1 d d i s 1 c 1 z μ w 1 μ w 1 θ c 1 μ s 1 μ s 1 ρ b q 1 k r 1 s c 1 k 1 5 θ c k ρ b q k t q c k z z θ d d i f k d d i s k c k z μ w k μ w k θ c k μ s k μ s k ρ b q k k r 1 s c k μ w k 1 θ c k 1 μ s k 1 ρ b q k 1 2 k n s where the subscripts w and s refer to liquid and solid phases respectively and subscript k represents the kth chain number c is the solute concentration in the soil liquid phase g cm 3 ρb is the dry soil bulk density g cm 3 q is the adsorbed solid concentration g g 1 q is the darcian velocity cm d 1 ddif is the diffusion coefficient cm2 d 1 ddis is the dispersion coefficient cm2 d 1 μ is the first order rate coefficient of transformation d 1 μ is the similar first order rate coefficient of transformation providing connections between individual chain species and kr is the root uptake preference factor a kr value greater than 1 0 represents the occurrence of active root uptake the fully implicit or crank nicholson central finite difference scheme is applied to solve the eqs 4 and 5 grid peclet number and courant number are used together to ensure numerical stability the third boundary condition is applied for both top and bottom boundaries for solute transport the drainage infiltration to from the ditches is also included in the model the k should be equal to 1 for salinity simulation without considering the reaction chain and solid adsorption for nitrogen simulation the transformation and transport processes including mineralization immobilization solid adsorption nitrification denitrification volatilization nitrous oxide n 2 o emission water uptake positive and active and leaching are involved in the chain equations the urea hydrolysis to ammonia is also considered and described using the first order kinetics equation the detailed calculation principles related to nitrogen transformation and plant root uptake can be found in annex b the concentration flux boundary conditions third type are provided for both upper and bottom boundaries which is consistent with the actual field conditions moreover the ahc provides two specific treatments for applying to the frost conditions first a variable active node method is proposed to describe the simulation zone i e active zone and simulate the fate of soil water and solute during the soil thawing period in a simple way xu et al 2013 this is particularly designed for the cold early spring season when the upper soil layer fully thaws while the underlying frozen soil layer is in the process of thawing e g for spring wheat growth in northwest china second the k h is adjusted under frost conditions because soil water freezes below a soil temperature of 0 c a detailed description is provided in annex c 3 heat transport neglecting the effect of water vapor diffusion on transport the 1 d heat transfer can be described with a convection dispersion equation of the form in the heat transport module as follows 6 c p θ t t z λ θ t z c w q t z where cp θ and cw are the volumetric heat capacity j cm 3 c 1 of soil and water respectively t is the soil temperature c and λ θ is the coefficient of the apparent thermal conductivity of the soil j cm 1 c 1 d 1 a fully implicit finite difference scheme is applied to solve eq 6 the soil heat capacity and thermal conductivity are calculated from the soil composition and the volume fractions of air and water for each compartment referring to the approach of de vries 1975 at the soil surface the daily average air temperature and the temperature of irrigation water are used to define the boundary conditions 4 crop growth and yield the crop growth module in the ahc called epic cgm is mainly based on the concept of the epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 also considering the effects of salinity stress and dormancy this module is developed because its biological process is relatively simple but well applicable to the field regional issues compared with some other detailed models epic cgm considers leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield together with the effects of temperature water and salt nitrogen stress biomass is computed from the solar radiation intercepted by the crop leaf area which is estimated with beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 the potential increase in biomass on a given day is estimated as a function of the plant radiation use efficiency rue with consideration of environmental stress e g from soil water salinity or nitrogen and temperature the rue is estimated using the approach proposed by stockle et al 1992 lai is computed for the various phenological development stages considering heat unit accumulation williams et al 1989 lai represents the level of canopy cover and is estimated as a function of heat units crop stress and development stages crop height is estimated like that in the epic model williams et al 1989 the fraction of total biomass partitioned to the root system is 30 50 in seedlings and reduces to 5 20 in mature plants jones 1985 this model decreases the fraction of total biomass in roots frroot linearly from 0 4 at emergence to 0 2 at maturity which is similar to the epic model williams et al 1989 the root depth generally increases rapidly from planting to a specific maximum depth by early mid season borg and grimes 1986 the maximum root depth is required and could be specified according to the field observations or the previous literature the vertical root distribution in the soil profile is assumed to be a piecewise linear function of the root depth the actual crop yield is calculated using the harvest index concept following the epic model procedures williams et al 1989 i e as a function of the above ground biomass and environmental stress from soil temperature soil salinity fertilizers etc the detailed calculation of epic cgm can be found in annex d 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis process the lh oat method is adopted in the ahc to perform the parameter sensitivity analysis it has a sampling strategy that is a combination of latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat sampling and thus allows performing gsa for a long list of parameters with less computational cost van griensven et al 2006 the calculation procedures are presented in detail in fig 2 with the parameter number being equal to m as an example lh oat starts with dividing the parameter range into n intervals and then taking n lh sampling points for each parameter with each interval to be sampled only once then n parameter groups are randomly generated after that each parameter group is varied for m times by changing each of the m parameters one at a time using the oat design thus it only requires a total of n m 1 model runs a global sensitivity index i e sp for the jth parameter i e p corresponding to a criterion is calculated by averaging the partial effects sp i for all lh points eq 7 and fig 2 7 s p 1 n i 1 n m e 1 i e j i 1 f j e m i m e 1 i e j i e m i m e 1 i e j i 1 f j e m i m e 1 j e j i e m i 2 f j where m refers to the model functions ej i is the value for the jth parameter p at the ith lh point sampling and fj is the fraction by which the parameter ej i is changed a predefined constant with a default value of 5 the final global sensitivity value for a parameter could then be estimated by the weighted average of the sp values under multicriteria conditions gsa result is obtained according to the sp value with the largest value being given the rank of 1 and the smallest value being given a rank equal to the total number of parameters analyzed xu et al 2016 a total of 316 parameters are involved in the sa database which could be optionally selected in the analysis they could be arranged in four main groups those relative to soil water flow those related to solute transport and transformation those related to plant growth and those describing stress factors of water salt nitrogen their ranges are required and often determined based on the existing literature the model outputs could be optionally selected as objective variables including actual evapotranspiration eta lai bottom flux dry aboveground biomass d agb and layer specific soil moisture and solute concentration content the parameters with higher sensitivity and uncertainty would be selected for further calibration more description about calculation procedures and parameter setting of the gsa process can be found in xu et al 2016 2 2 3 parameter estimation process the genetic algorithm ga is a global and robust method searching for the optimum solution to complex problems using the precept of natural selection holland 1975 goldberg 1989 the calculation flow chart of the ga and its coupling with the aesim process is shown in fig 3 the ga consists of three basic operators of selection crossover and mutation it represents a solution using strings referred to as chromosomes of variables represented as genes in a search problem the search will start by initializing a population of chromosomes each chromosome is evaluated on its performance using a fitness function on the basis of the performance the chromosomes are selected into the mating pool to form offspring through the crossover and mutation of genes selection crossover and mutation are repeated for many generations to reproduce the chromosome that fits the environment best the best chromosome would represent the optimal or near optimal solution to the search problem carroll 1998 goldberg 2002 the modified mga has been adopted to calibrate the model parameters by minimizing the error between simulated and observed data in the gpe process the modified mga code carroll 1998 ines and droogers 2002 is adapted and embedded into the ahc the parameters set with four groups are same as those in the gsa process the parameters selected by the gsa process could be automatically calibrated in the gpe process the number of parameters is recommended not to be more than 15 to avoid the problem of non uniqueness the parameters related to plant growth and stress factors could generally be determined from previous literature and specific experiments additionally the parameters related to solute transformation are generally difficult to be estimated inversely and thus they were suggested to be determined or manually calibrated on the basis of previous experimental or modeling studies while the parameters related to soils mainly soil water flow and solute transport are difficult to determine at each point of interest and are responsible for a large part of the spatial variability of the output variables thus we recommend that users concern these soil parameters in the gpe process similar to the sensitivity analysis the model outputs can be optionally selected as objective variables according to the observation data collected on the basis of these objective variables the fitness function is constructed using the weighted average method a more detailed description about the calculation procedures and parameter setting of the gsa process can be found in xu et al 2016 2 2 4 graphical user interface the gui for the ahc is developed using the vb net which is an object oriented programming language using the microsoft net framework 4 5 in the visual studio 2010 environment the gui allows the user to easily manipulate input files run the model and view the output a main window is designed as a guide for operating the ahc including launching the windows for data input i e for control file model files sensitivity analysis and calibration result display model run and exit fig 4 a the control file is used for managing the file path data file connection function selection simulation period output settings etc in this input window the simulation can also be customized to invoke only those modules of interest for a specified application e g solute or heat simulation can be disabled if not desired which can produce more efficient input operation all data input related to the aesim process is integrated and shown in the input window of the model files fig 4b it could make the data input more intuitive and clearer the input window for the sensitivity analysis and calibration is designed specifically for the data input of gsa and gpe processes respectively in the result display various simulation results e g soil water content soil solution concentration content leaf area index and biomass can be presented and conveniently compared with the observation data in graphics windows fig 4c and d which can help the user calibrate the model meanwhile the statistical indicators i e mre rmse nse r2 and b for model performance evaluation are also calculated and provided for users the efficiency and stability of the gui is also repeatedly tested with several different cases in addition with a slight adaptation the ahc model has been closely linked to gis software i e arcinfo 9 for regional applications in a distributed manner a basic graphical user interface has been constructed using the visual basic language xu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 however it is undergoing an upgrade to arcinfo 10 but not yet completely finished 3 model application in this paper the ahc model was to be evaluated and tested with two experimental datasets i e related to salinity and nitrogen issues respectively by comparing the simulated results with the observed data the test cases could provide a comprehensive presentation of the latest release of the ahc especially the new functions e g crop dormancy setting compensated root water uptake soil surface mulching nitrogen transport and transformation etc in salinity case two year field data during 2012 and 2013 was collected from the maize field with plastic mulching located at the yangchang canal command area yca of the hetao irrigaiton district hetao inner mongolia autonomous region northwest china 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1039 m altitude the field condition was a representative of that in the upper yellow river basin i e affected by salinity under shallow water tables and under plastic film mulching in particular the good quality of observation data was helpful in evaluating the function of the automatic inverse calibration the data was available from our previous study of ren et al 2016 in the nitrogen case the experimental data was obtained from the fields with a winter wheat summer maize rotation system from october 2010 to september 2012 in the shandong agricultural university agricultural experiment station sau aes tai an city shandong province northern china 36 09 37 n 117 09 18 e 130 m altitude the experimental site was also situated in an important food production base ncp where the nitrogen fertilizer is often overused by farmers to obtain high yields the related data was available from the previous study of liu 2014 the model was to be automatically calibrated for both the above two cases with gsa and gpe processes the parameters related to soil water flow and solute transport were usually most uncertain in practice thus only they were considered in the sensitivity analysis and automatic calibration as exemplifications in this study also for restricting the number of calibrated parameters other parameter values were mainly referred to the previous literature and could be adjusted manually the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of regression b were used to evaluate the model performance for both calibration and validation their definitions can be found in the previous study of xu et al 2013 3 1 case study of the salinity simulation 3 1 1 site characteristics and observation data the hetao has a typically arid and semiarid continental climate the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation 20 cm pan were respectively 160 mm and 2240 mm during 1981 2009 with over 70 of the rainfall occurring between june and september the daily meteorological data for the experimental years 2012 and 2013 were taken from the nearby linhe weather station rainfall was registered by a tipping bucket rain gauge in the field the detailed data on the main weather variables are shown in fig 5 the total rainfall was 208 mm and 89 mm during the maize growth seasons in 2012 and 2013 respectively the two years can represent a wet year and a dry year according to the hydrological frequency analysis the groundwater depth gwd was very shallow and varied in the range 0 5 2 5 m during the crop season the soil physical properties were surveyed for the soil profile with a 300 cm depth and four horizons by ren et al 2016 silt loam was the main soil texture in the yca with finer soils distributed below the zone root the water content at saturation field capacity and wilting point dry bulk density and ks were also measured the main soil properties are presented in table 1 the spring maize was sown in early may and harvested in late september with a planting density of 62 000 plants ha 1 irrigation water diverted from the yellow river has a salinity concentration of 0 5 g l 1 basin irrigation was applied by adopting zero slope basin which was the common practice in hetao the irrigation schedule is presented in table 2 the other cultivation practices including fertilizer application and pest crop disease and weed control were recommended by local farmer advisers soil groundwater and crop growth were monitored in observation field from april to september in both years soil sampling was performed every 7 15 days using a soil auger soil samples were collected for every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and in 20 cm increments below the top layer until the a 100 cm depth the soil water content and salt content of the soil solution c sw g l 1 i e soil salinity concentration were measured for each layer the daily gwd was recorded by a water level logger the groundwater salinity concentration was obtained every 10 days lai was directly measured every 15 days and crop yield was recorded after harvest the detailed measurement methods were described in ren et al 2016 3 1 2 model setup for salinity case a soil profile with a 300 cm depth was specified with four horizons according to the soil survey table 1 the domain was further discretized into 300 compartments with a uniform thickness of 1 cm the simulation period was from the early may to late september covering the maize growth period the maximum root depth was set at 90 cm according to field observations and values found in the literature xu et al 2015 for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes a time variable pressure head was selected as the bottom boundary condition which was defined using the observed gwds for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux considering the observed salinity concentration of irrigation water and groundwater respectively the initial conditions of the soil water content and salinity concentration were set based on field measurements the parameters related to soil hydraulic properties solute transport root water uptake stress and crop growth were initially specified before calibration the initial values for unknown soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the physical properties using rosetta model schaap et al 2001 initial values for other parameters were primarily determined according to former studies xu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 kroes and van dam 2003 the measured soil water contents salinity concentrations and lai as mentioned above were used to calibrate parameters automatically using the gpe process then the applicability of the ahc model was tested and evaluated with proper calibration and validation 3 1 3 results and discussion 1 model performance evaluation in the salinity case the gsa results showed that only 11 of a total of 25 soil parameters were very sensitive to the observation data with their global sensitivity values shown in fig 6 a their values were inversely calibrated and are listed in table 1 comparisons between the simulation and observations are presented in figs 7 9 and table 3 the simulated soil water contents showed good agreement with the measured soil water contents for different soil layers during 2013 fig 7 resulting in a mre 0 86 a rmse 0 015 cm3 cm 3 and a nse 0 91 table 3 fig 8 shows that the simulated salinity concentration also fitted well with the observed one during calibration it produced a mre 7 9 a rmse 1 37 g l 1 and a nse 0 67 the simulated soil water and salt dynamics by ahc were quite close to that by hydrus dualkc in ren et al 2016 in addition the simulated lai and yield were in agreement with observations as well fig 9a fitness results produced a mre 11 9 a rmse 0 50 and a nse 0 87 for lai while the simulated crop yield 12 114 kg ha 1 was only 5 lower than the observed one thus the ahc performed reasonably well when simulating the soil water salinity and crop growth during the 2013 calibration period the ahc model with calibrated parameters was further tested and validated with the 2012 experimental data soil moisture reproduced by ahc also represented the observations very well as shown in the small errors of the estimates fig 7 rmse 0 031 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 74 and r2 0 75 the simulated salinity concentration was in good agreement with observations fig 8 rmse 0 99 g l 1 nse 0 42 and r2 0 54 the simulation for lai seemed to be acceptable since there were only limited observation data fig 9b the simulated yield was 12 314 kg ha 1 12 less than the obtained yield in 2012 overall the modeling accuracy of the ahc should be acceptable during the validation period moreover the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the ahc in calibration and validation were within the range of values reported in the previous literature for field modeling cases e g jiang et al 2011 ramos et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 and were even located at a relatively good level the general agreement between the simulated and measured data during calibration and validation indicated that the calibrated ahc could accurately simulate the complicated agroecosystem processes at the experimental site thus it could provide useful and detailed information about the soil water and salt dynamics and maize growth support a better understanding and solve existing problems 2 simulation analysis soil water salinity and crop growth the soil water and salt balance components for the 0 90 cm soil profile i e the root zone during the total simulation period of 2012 and 2013 are presented in table 4 simulation results indicated that the soil moisture was relatively high fluctuating around 0 3 cm 3 cm 3 at the surface layer and approaching saturation in deep layers both during 2012 and 2013 due to the shallow gwd and large irrigation it increased rapidly with irrigation and then gradually decreased due to water consumption and redistribution until the next irrigation or significant rainfall event occurred fig 7 in the meantime the salinity concentration decreased sharply after an irrigation event because the soil solution was diluted and salts were leached to the deeper layers fig 8 the up and down movement of soil water and salt was also partly affected by regional groundwater table fluctuations especially for deeper soil layers the effective rainfall was usually small in hetao and its effects on soil moisture and salinity were mainly limited to the surface soil layer i e 0 20 cm the results showed that maize growth was primarily stressed by salinity and temperature but not water deficit during the early growth period the temperature was relatively low in 2012 fig 5 which was the main limiting factor for maize growth in contrast the salinity was higher in upper layers e g 6 8 g l 1 for solution at 10 40 cm during the early period in 2013 fig 8 and thus became the dominant stress to seedling growth fig f1 overall a few differences were observed for crop growth in the initial stage between 2012 and 2013 however during 2012 the crop growth was significantly affected by waterlogging due to a large rainfall event 80 mm immediately after the first irrigation in late june figs 7 and f1 that resulted in the retardation of crop growth in the vegetative period since late june when there was almost no temperature stress the water uptake and growth of maize were mainly affected by salinity levels fig f1 it was obvious that the salinity concentration and salt stress was markedly higher in 2013 than in 2012 figs 8 and f1 because the higher rainfall in 2012 202 mm can lead to the greater salt leaching and 100 mm less capillary rise there is less salt accumulation into the root zone table 4 thus the maize could then grow better in 2012 in particular the salinity concentration was relatively high during the key period of the reproductive period i e after mid august in 2013 overall the crop yield was relatively higher in 2012 than in 2013 in both 2012 and 2013 it was found that most of the leached salts could not be discharged timely and stayed in the deeper soil layers due to a poor drainage system these salts would reaccumulate into the upper layers with the upward water movement under the arid climate in hetao in summary this test case testing showed that the ahc can well reflect the soil water salt dynamics and interaction with maize growth additionally it indicated that the key issue was the reasonable control of shallow water tables and coordination of irrigation and drainage in hetao 3 2 case study of the nitrogen simulation 3 2 1 site characteristics and observation data the sau aes is located in the southern ncp this region has a temperate continental monsoon climate the mean annual rainfall is 697 mm 70 80 of which occurs between june and september daily meteorological data for 2007 and 2008 were available from the nearby tai an weather station the detailed data on the main weather variables are shown in fig 10 for both experimental years the depth of the groundwater is greater than 10 m during the year silt loam and silt are the main soil textures for topsoil and subsoil respectively with four horizons in the 0 160 cm soil profile in sau aes the principle soil characteristics are listed in table 1 the water contents at saturation field capacity and wilting points the ks and the organic matter content omc were measured for each horizon in addition the soil fertility properties of the upper soils 0 45 cm were as follows soil organic matter 7 9 13 3 g kg 1 total n 0 66 1 12 g kg 1 available phosphorous 34 1 66 1 mg kg 1 and available potassium 74 9 121 7 mg kg 1 the related measurement approaches were described in detail by liu 2014 the cropping system was the rotation of winter wheat and summer maize that was common in ncp the planting density was 2 4 m plants ha 1 and 66 000 plants ha 1 respectively the irrigation and fertilization schedules were determined as recommended by local farmer advisers table 2 irrigation water was pumped from groundwater the food irrigation was adopted and the surface broadcast of urea was applied as the topdressing of fertilizer n which were both the common practices in the ncp other cultivation practices related to pest crop disease and weed control were recommended by farmer advisers soil and crop growth were monitored during the two agricultural years from 2010 and 2012 the soil water content was measured at 20 cm increments from soil surface down to a 160 cm depth using a neutron probe with a frequency of 10 days the nitrate nitrogen no3 n contents were measured approximately every 30 days for the same layers lai and d agb were measured every month the dry grain yield was weighed after harvesting the detailed measurement methods can be found in liu 2014 3 2 2 model setup for nitrogen case a soil profile with a 300 cm depth was specified to have five material horizons for depths below 160 cm the soil properties were initially assumed to be the same as the last observed layer in vertical discretization the soil domain was discretized into 200 compartments with uniform 1 cm thickness for the first 100 cm depth and 2 cm thickness for 100 300 cm the simulation period was from october 3rd 2010 to september 30th 2012 covering two seasons of the rotation of wheat and maize for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation table 2 and precipitation fluxes the surface mulch by wheat straw was considered to estimate ea during the maize season at the bottom a free drainage boundary condition was used to account for the deep gwd for nitrogen transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined as the third type boundary conditions by specifying a concentration flux using the concentration of no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in irrigation water rainfall and groundwater for heat transport the daily average air temperature was used to define top boundary condition if there was rainfall or irrigation third type boundary condition was used to prescribe the top heat flux the third type boundary condition was also applied at the bottom to specify the heat flux the initial conditions of soil water content nitrogen concentration and temperature were set based on field observations the crop dormancy was considered for wheat growth in the winter season the parameters related to soil hydraulic properties nitrogen transport and transformation root water uptake stress and crop growth were initially specified before calibration the unknown soil hydraulic parameters table 1 were initialized with the physical properties using the pedotransfer functions pfts of wösten et al 1999 the parameters related to carbon turnover were assigned according to hansen et al 1991 the values of other parameters were initialized according to previous studies liu 2014 ahuja et al 2000 williams et al 2006 wang 2010 initial values of crop parameters for spring wheat and summer maize were defined on the basis of our previous research in the ncp wang et al 2015 wang 2010 the measured soil water contents no3 n contents lai and d agb as mentioned above were used for parameter estimation through the gpe process modeling results were also evaluated by comparison with those using the rzwqm2 model by liu 2014 3 2 3 results and discussion 1 model performance evaluation in the nitrogen case the gsa showed that 15 of a total of 35 soil parameters were very sensitive to the observation data with their global sensitivity values shown in fig 6b the calibrated values for model parameters are presented in table 1 the comparisons of simulated and measured soil water contents and no3 n contents at different layers are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively both for the calibration 2010 2011 and validation 2011 2012 the results showed that the simulated soil water contents were in a good agreement with the measured soil water contents for various soil layers during 2010 2012 fig 11 the rmse was less than 0 04 cm3 cm 3 for both calibration and validation while the nse reached to over 0 77 table 3 the fitness was even better than that of liu 2014 who used the rzwqm2 additionally because the ahc took into account the crop dormancy and effects of soil frost on hydraulic conductivity the water could be held in the soil layer and the soil moisture changed slightly during the crop dormancy period fig 11 the simulation seemed to be more reasonable during the winter season than that of the rzwqm2 of liu 2014 moreover the simulated surface soil moisture became large after high rainfall and could even approach saturation which was not captured by rzwqm2 this was because the ahc allowed surface ponding to consider the effects of soil bunds while the storage of surface runoff was not considered in rzwqm2 the simulated no3 n contents were also in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones fig 12 simulation of n fate was intrinsically more difficult than that for other terms due to the complex processes of n transport and transformation surface broadcast of urea would increase the uncertainty in observations in spite of that the ahc reasonably captured the dynamics of the observed no3 n contents in particular the no3 n variations were relatively large in near surface layer and were well described using the ahc in addition the simulated no3 n variations by the ahc were also better than that by rzwqm2 liu 2014 the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the ahc during the two years table 3 were within the range of values reported in previous studies e g cameira et al 2007 wang and huang 2008 liu 2014 liang et al 2014 for crop growth the simulated lai and d agb matched quite well with the observations fig 13 with very good fitness indicator values both in calibration and validation table 3 meanwhile simulated grain yields for wheat 7776 kg ha 1 and 7597 kg ha 1 had relative errors of less than 5 in the two seasons and that for maize 8741 kg ha 1 and 9762 kg ha 1 had relative errors of less than 6 thus the ahc performed reasonably well in simulation during the calibration and validation periods of 2010 2012 2 simulation analysis soil water nitrogen and crop growth the water and nitrogen balance components for the 0 100 cm soil profile i e root zone are presented in table 5 the results showed that irrigation and rainfall were mainly consumed by et during the wheat season the eta was 504 and 514 mm for spring wheat in the first and second seasons respectively while ta was 47 mm greater for the first season 2010 2011 because of larger lai in vegetative growth stage the bottom flux of the root zone i e at 100 cm in depth was small and almost moved upward after turning green march to early june this was because there was often less rainfall during the spring season in ncp and the applied irrigation 75 mm was not excessive in particular the wheat was not timely irrigated during the second irrigation event in the first season which caused water stress to some degree fig f2 this also happened in the second season 2011 2012 but occurred before the third irrigation event overall during the two seasons the wheat growth was affected by low temperatures during early stage of the turning green period march and water deficit in the following stages but was almost not affected by nitrogen deficiency fig f2 thus with similar climate conditions especially temperature and radiation the wheat yield was very similar in the two seasons the above analysis was also similar to that using the rzwqm2 liu 2014 the maize was generally irrigated no more than once as it grew in the summer rainy season with rainfall of 597 mm and 324 mm during the first season 2011 and second season 2012 respectively the results showed that the eta of summer maize was approximately 370 mm for both two seasons with slight differences for both ea and ta the rainfall was obviously greater during 2011 figs 10 and 11 thus the deep percolation from the root zone was also more significant during this season reaching to 120 mm and the water storage was increased by 186 mm after harvest table 5 there was almost no surface runoff in the two seasons due to the effects of soil bunds 10 cm overall the stress from water deficit was very small for maize growth because of the plentiful rainfall in the summer rainy season maize growth was mainly affected by nitrogen deficit in the seedling period which was more obvious during 2012 fig f2 however the grain yield was still 11 higher in 2012 than that in 2011 due to the higher solar radiation with a similar cumulative temperature during the maize season from june to september in 2012 fig 10 simulated results indicated that the nitrogen was mainly consumed by crop nitrogen uptake which accounted for approximately 80 and 50 70 of total n consumption during the wheat and maize growth periods respectively the nitrogen was primarily lost through nh3 volatilization after irrigation reaching to approximately 130 kg ha 1 in 2011 and 2012 and accounting for approximately 20 of total n consumption the nitrogen leaching was only significant during the maize growth period i e summer rainy season in the wet year of 2011 the amount of 121 9 kg ha 1 nitrogen was leached out of the root zone 0 100 cm and only 22 could be reused by capillary rise thus the net leaching loss reached to 95 0 kg ha 1 which composed 25 of the total nitrogen loss table 5 for the wheat growth period spring dry season and maize growth period in 2012 lower rainfall season compared to 2011 the amount of nitrogen leaching was less than 32 kg ha 1 for the root zone this was also because the irrigation amount was limited in the experiment it was even less than the upward recharge from the underlying layers for wheat growth thus this resulted in an upward cumulative flux of approximately 30 kg ha 1 during the two seasons table 5 in addition the results also showed that the net leaching loss at 200 cm in depth was less than 20 kg ha 1 both for 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 the results indicated that the denitrification loss just occupied a very small part and could almost be neglected the results for the nitrogen budget by the ahc were similar to those from using rzwqm2 liu 2014 thus the control of nh3 volatilization should receive attention even with relatively reasonable irrigation scheduling in summary the test case indicated that the ahc should be a reliable tool to simulate the water and nitrogen fate and the related crop growth in the field 4 summary and conclusion a new physically based numerical model named ahc that was developed to simulate the agroecosystem processes was presented in this paper the model concept algorithm and structure of the ahc were described in detail with a brief description of the software user interface the model was designed with three main processes i e the aesim gsa and gpe processes each of which consisted of many modules for implementing specific functions the aesim process simulated the soil water flow the fate of salt or nitrogen and heat transport in a mechanical processed based manner that is it was all based on the numerical solution of a series of partial differential equations thus the ahc model was also suitable to very complex agro hydrological conditions the generic crop growth module was drawn from the concept of the epic model which was suitable for various plant species with acceptable accuracy and less data demand the gsa and gpe processes were used in conjunction to determine the parameters during model calibration based on the lh oat and modified mga methods relative to the other agroecosystem models there were three significant features of the ahc 1 the ability to optionally simulate the fate of nitrogen and the fate of salt 2 the robust ability to do global parameter sensitivity analysis and to inversely calibrate the model parameters and 3 the adaptability to a wide range of field conditions especially some specific phenomena or farm practices in northern china e g crop dormancy soil frost and thaw in winter and different film mulching the ahc was then tested with using the data from two typical field experiments that were related to the salinity issue in a maize field in northwest china and the nitrogen use for a wheat maize rotation field on north china plain respectively two years of data were used to evaluate the model performance in both cases eleven sensitive parameters and fifteen ones of all soil hydraulic and transport parameters were screened out for the model calibration in salinity and nitrogen cases respectively the results indicated that the model can accurately capture the dynamics of layered soil water contents the simulated crop indicators leaf area index biomass and yield were also in a quite good agreement with the observations with regard to the solute the ahc could predict the soil salinity concentration well the simulation accuracy for nitrogen fate was acceptable compared to previous studies but yet not as good as that for salt this should be related to the complex mechanism of nitrogen fate and the high spatial variation caused by surface broadcast fertilization in conclusion all indicators supported the ability of the model to simulate the agroecosystem processes furthermore the issues related to field irrigation water use the salinity effect nitrogen use efficiency etc were evaluated using the calibrated model taken as a whole the ahc should prove to be a reliable and efficient tool in analyzing the complex agroecosystem processes and in supporting the rational management of irrigation application salinity control and nitrogen fertilizer use in the subsequent development of the ahc model the focus is to improve the description of the agroecosystem including adding process descriptions of phenomena that are not yet included in the current version e g the soil freezing and thawing the effects of soil tillage on transport processes and pesticide transport another important focus is to better support distributed modeling for regional land and water management acknowledgements

25161,this article introduces the ahc model as a new tool for modeling and assessing the agroecosystem processes the ahc as a one dimensional numerical physical model simulates the soil water and salt nitrogen dynamics heat transport and crop growth and yield in various soil crop environments the key features of the ahc include that it provides the optional function for simulating the fate of salt or nitrogen it has an efficient global method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation and it is useful in a wide range of field conditions especially for those in northern china a menu driven program is developed as a user friendly interface for efficient data manipulation this paper primarily describes the main structures and algorithms of the ahc and presents its field applicability model testing and application was conducted with two cases 1 a salinity case with maize growing in salt affected fields under arid and shallow groundwater environments hetao upper yellow river basin northwest china and 2 a nitrogen case with a wheat maize rotation system in the semihumid monsoon region tai an north china plain good agreement was obtained between the simulated and observed data including the soil water contents salt nitrogen contents and crop growth indicators the soil water and salt nitrogen dynamics crop growth processes and their complex interactive effects were also well interpreted using the ahc rational simulation proves the good applicability of the ahc for practical field use keywords soil water salinity nitrogen crop growth model calibration numerical modeling 1 introduction agroecosystem models can be defined as a quantitative scheme for predicting hydrological chemical and biological processes in soil crop systems with relevant human and environmental factors on various scales monteith 1996 sinclair and seligman 2000 steduto et al 2009 the functions and applications of the model mainly include evaluating field experiments searching for the best management practices and use as heuristic tools in teaching and research sinclair and seligman 1996 cameira et al 2007 šimůnek et al 2016 current agroecosystem models have varying degrees of numerical sophistication ranging from purely empirical to highly mechanistic monteith 1996 kucharik 2003 in the aspect of agro hydrological processes the models can be classified as balance and physically mechanistic models the former includes the lumped balance models e g simdualkc and the cascading layer models e g aquacrop and dssat rosa et al 2012 steduto et al 2009 jones et al 2003 the latter are fully based on deterministic and physical laws such as hydrus swap daisy and rzwqm šimůnek et al 2005 van dam et al 1997 hansen 2002 ahuja et al 2000 for the aspect of crop growth and yield formation the models might be divided into empirical models and process based models empirical models consist of empirical functions that are chosen to fit measurements from the field process based models often simulate the plant biomass or organ development based on the plant physiology or morphology typically as epic wofost and dssat williams et al 1984 van diepen et al 1989 hoogenboom et al 2015 so far agro ecosystem modeling is still facing some disputes and dilemmas in the generality of models and in the balance of simplicity and complexity therond et al 2011 rosa et al 2012 sinclair and seligman 2000 on the other hand existing agroecosystem models generally have different functionalities for practical use models for irrigation management mainly focus on soil water salinity and crops e g simdualkc aquacrop swap and saltmod oosterbaan 2001 while the suite of specialized crop models always includes the simulation of the fate of nutrients or even the soil carbon balance such as epic rzwqm dssat and apsim mccown et al 1996 moreover some researchers conclude that the agroecosystem models can be classified into two types of approaches scientific and engineering steduto et al 2009 the first aims to improve the understanding of crop behavior based on physiology and the second attempts to provide management advice to farmers and policymakers generally a common consensus is that it is impossible to create universal models as each season or new location brings new challenges that are not foreseen in the original model sinclair and seligman 2000 therefore considerable and continuous efforts of modification of model functions are thus necessary to make the model cope with discrepancies that derive from the changes in the peculiarities of the application environments sinclair and seligman 1996 2000 coucheney et al 2015 xu et al 2016 model calibration is another major challenge in agroecosystem modeling involving a sensitivity analysis sa parameter estimation pe and uncertainty analysis xu et al 2016 the sa is a critical step to identify the sensitive and important parameters dejonge et al 2012 the most popular sa practice is that of the oat one factor at a time method which has the limitation of local attributes of data sampling in addition to local methods global sensitivity analysis gsa methods are recently more preferred and applied to some agroecosystem models typically as the extended fast sobol and lh oat methods zhao et al 2014 della peruta et al 2014 xu et al 2016 the automatic inverse optimization method is becoming a preferred alternative in parameter estimation the local pe method has been widely used however it may prematurely terminate the search and thus is prone to find local rather than global minima šimůnek et al 2012 the global pe methods become a better alternative when more parameters are to be estimated or a more complex model adopted some classic applications in agroecosystem modeling include the use of pest genetic algorithm glue ensemble kalman filter and shuffled complex methods doherty 2005 ines and droogers 2002 abbaspour et al 2001 evensen 2003 duan et al 1994 to our knowledge only a few mature models release their own specific pe module for practical use e g the inverse solution based on the gradient type minimization method in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2012 and the dssat glue program jones et al 2011 an uncertainty analysis is also applied for model parameters xu et al 2016 however especially in watershed hydrologic modeling because of the high uncertainty at large scales yang et al 2008 in view of previous studies the agroecosystem models developed by different research institutions usually have relatively specific backgrounds features and adaptabilities the deficiencies in the application of existing models may be considered as 1 most models only focus on either the salinity simulation or the nitrogen simulation and the interaction with crop growth 2 few models provide mature functions to efficiently handle the parameter calibration and 3 the models often cannot be directly used in changed environments different from its original development without a certain or even significant degree of modification of model functions meanwhile the water deficit secondary salinity and unreasonable nitrogen fertilization are the three most significant issues that agroecosystems are facing in many regions worldwide these issues exist particularly in different areas of northern china therefore in this paper we propose a new model software named ahc for agroecosystem simulation with the motivation of integrating our previous experimental and modeling work related to various conditions in the yellow river basin north china plain and hexi corridor region of northern china xu et al 2011 2012a xu et al 2012b 2013 xu et al 2015 2016 jiang et al 2015 wang and huang 2008 wang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 neng 2016 the ahc is developed as a systematic tool to numerically simulate the soil water flow the fate of salt or nitrogen heat transport and crop growth and yield with the effects of ambient environmental changes the efficient global methods for sensitivity analysis and inverse estimation of parameters are also involved the conceptual framework and distinctive components and features of the ahc are herein described and then the model is applied in two case studies related to salinity and nitrogen issues respectively these two examples of applications could provide a comprehensive presentation of the main features and applicability of our proposed model 2 model description 2 1 overview of ahc and its components the ahc agro hydrological chemical and crop systems simulator is designed with two main parts i e the mathematical model and the graphical user interface gui the mathematical model as the core of the ahc could be seen as composed of three processes agroecosystem simulation aesim process global sensitivity analysis gsa process and global parameter estimation gpe process process could be defined as a kind of modularization entity and each process is a part of code that performs certain functions by specific methods the source code is all written in fortran and compiled with intel visual fortran composer xe 2011 the friendly gui is developed for pre and post processing of datasets using the visual basic net vb net programming language in microsoft visual studio 2010 the mathematical model of fortran codes is packaged into the gui program the aesim process is inherited and modified from the previous agro hydrological model swap epic it consisted of five main modules related to soil water evaporation and transpiration solute heat and plant the main calculation flow chart is presented in fig 1 the soil water module is mainly drawn from the swap model van dam et al 1997 with significant improvements related to soil evaporation root water uptake soil thawing etc xu et al 2013 2015 the solute transport module was originally developed by xu et al 2016 for the simulation of salinity which is adopted and continuously improved in particular the function of simulating the fate of nitrogen is newly added for solute transport in ahc which is based on the previous modeling work on nitrogen simulation on the north china plain ncp wang and huang 2008 wang et al 2015 liang et al 2014 the heat transport is simulated using a convection dispersion equation crop growth and yield formation are simulated with the modified epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 with the code compiled by xu et al 2013 thus the ahc became a one dimensional 1 d physically based model that in brief simulates water flow solute transport and transformation optionally salt or nitrogen heat transport and crop growth and yield in agricultural fields the simulation of soil water salt and crop growth has been preliminarily tested with several crops e g wheat maize cabbage and sunflower and different field conditions e g different soils and deep or shallow water tables when using the previous version swap epic xu et al 2013 jiang et al 2015 xu et al 2015 neng 2016 by close coupling with arcinfo 9 the gis based version is also applied to access the regional water use and water productivity xu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 the gsa process and gpe process are used in conjunction to determine the parameters for model calibration the former is based on an efficient latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method and the latter is developed using the modified micro genetic algorithm modified mga they have been developed and preliminarily tested in the parameter calibration of swap epic with a two year experiment in a salt affected wheat field xu et al 2016 the friendly gui is preliminarily developed by neng 2016 with continuous testing and improvement 2 2 detailed description of model components and mechanisms 2 2 1 agroecosystem simulation aesim process 1 soil

respectively ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 α cm 1 and n are empirical shape parameters and λ is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter the top boundary condition can be determined by the rates of actual evaporation ea and actual transpiration ta and the fluxes of irrigation precipitation and interception potential evapotranspiration et is estimated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and it is first separated into potential soil evaporation ep and potential crop transpiration tp based upon the leaf area index lai actual evaporation and transpiration rates are then respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the surface soil and the root zone three functions could be optionally used to estimate ea under dry soil conditions the effect of film mulches on soil evaporation can be considered to further limit the soil evaporation moreover a surface reservoir boundary condition is applied if surface ponding is expected to develop additionally the surface runoff is allowed when the water ponding depth is over a user specified maximum ponding height the detailed calculations related to the upper boundary can be found in annex a the model further provides eight options to prescribe the lower boundary conditions the dirichlet type pressure head as a function of time neumann type bottom flux as a function of time cauchy type bottom flux as a function of groundwater level and free drainage in deep groundwater level conditions lateral field drainage fluxes to the drainage system are alternatively simulated using a simple linear or nonlinear i e using the drainage equations of hooghoudt and ernst relationship between groundwater level and drainage flux since the treatment of the bottom boundary conditions and lateral drainage is kept same as that in swap model a brief introduction of principles and equations is provided in annex e a more detailed description can be found in kroes and van dam 2003 initial conditions can be implemented with three input options the soil water content pressure heads or a groundwater level when assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil profile the sink term s is the actual soil water extraction rate by plant roots its potential rate at a certain depth sp z is calculated by distributing tp into each root zone compartment as a function of the specified root length density the actual root water uptake rate sa z is determined by considering the water and salt stress that is assumed to be multiplicative the integration of sa z over the rooting depth is equal to the ta rate in addition the function of the compensated root water uptake could be considered following the conception of jarvis 1989 it represents a threshold value above which the root water uptake reduced in stressed parts of the root zone is fully compensated by uptake from other less stressed parts šimůnek and hopmans 2009 the detailed algorithm for root water uptake under stress can be found in annex a 2 solute transport and transformation salinity and nitrogen a significant modification is introduced to the solute module for the ahc compared with the older version of swap epic only for salinity issue in xu et al 2016 in the latest module the general formulation of the mass conservation and transport equations involving in a sequential first order decay chain during transient water flow in a variably saturated rigid porous medium are taken as 4 θ c 1 ρ b q 1 t q c 1 z z θ d d i f 1 d d i s 1 c 1 z μ w 1 μ w 1 θ c 1 μ s 1 μ s 1 ρ b q 1 k r 1 s c 1 k 1 5 θ c k ρ b q k t q c k z z

subscript k represents the kth chain number c is the solute concentration in the soil liquid phase g cm 3 ρb is the dry soil bulk density g cm 3 q is the adsorbed solid concentration g g 1 q is the darcian velocity cm d 1 ddif is the diffusion coefficient cm2 d 1 ddis is the dispersion coefficient cm2 d 1 μ is the first order rate coefficient of transformation d 1 μ is the similar first order rate coefficient of transformation providing connections between individual chain species and kr is the root uptake preference factor a kr value greater than 1 0 represents the occurrence of active root uptake the fully implicit or crank nicholson central finite difference scheme is applied to solve the eqs 4 and 5 grid peclet number and courant number are used together to ensure numerical stability the third boundary condition is applied for both top and bottom boundaries for solute transport the drainage infiltration to from the ditches is also included in the model the k should be equal to 1 for salinity simulation without considering the reaction chain and solid adsorption for nitrogen simulation the transformation and transport processes including mineralization immobilization solid adsorption nitrification denitrification volatilization nitrous oxide n 2 o emission water uptake positive and active and leaching are involved in the chain equations the urea hydrolysis to ammonia is also considered and described using the first order kinetics equation the detailed calculation principles related to nitrogen transformation and plant root uptake can be found in annex b the concentration flux boundary conditions third type are provided for both upper and bottom boundaries which is consistent with the actual field conditions moreover the ahc provides two specific treatments for applying to the frost conditions first a variable active node method is proposed to describe the simulation zone i e active zone and simulate the fate of soil water and solute during the soil thawing period in a simple way xu et al 2013 this is particularly designed for the cold early spring season when the upper soil layer fully thaws while the underlying frozen soil layer is in the process of thawing e g for spring wheat growth in northwest china second the k h is adjusted under frost conditions because soil water freezes below a soil temperature of 0 c a detailed description is provided in annex c 3 heat transport neglecting the effect of water vapor diffusion on transport the 1 d heat transfer can be described with a convection dispersion equation of the form in the heat transport module as follows 6 c p θ t t z λ θ t z c w q t z where cp θ and cw are the volumetric heat capacity j cm 3 c 1 of soil and water respectively t is the soil temperature c and λ θ is the coefficient of the apparent thermal conductivity of the soil j cm 1 c 1 d 1 a fully implicit finite difference scheme is applied to solve eq 6 the soil heat capacity and thermal conductivity are calculated from the soil composition and the volume fractions of air and water for each compartment referring to the approach of de vries 1975 at the soil surface the daily average air temperature and the temperature of irrigation water are used to define the boundary conditions 4 crop growth and yield the crop growth module in the ahc called epic cgm is mainly based on the concept of the epic crop growth model williams et al 1989 also considering the effects of salinity stress and dormancy this module is developed because its biological process is relatively simple but well applicable to the field regional issues compared with some other detailed models epic cgm considers leaf area development light interception and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield together with the effects of temperature water and salt nitrogen stress biomass is computed from the solar radiation intercepted by the crop leaf area which is estimated with beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 the potential increase in biomass on a given day is estimated as a function of the plant radiation use efficiency rue with consideration of environmental stress e g from soil water salinity or nitrogen and temperature the rue is estimated using the approach proposed by stockle et al 1992 lai is computed for the various phenological development stages considering heat unit accumulation williams et al 1989 lai represents the level of canopy cover and is estimated as a function of heat units crop stress and development stages crop height is estimated like that in the epic model williams et al 1989 the fraction of total biomass partitioned to the root system is 30 50 in seedlings and reduces to 5 20 in mature plants jones 1985 this model decreases the fraction of total biomass in roots frroot linearly from 0 4 at emergence to 0 2 at maturity which is similar to the epic model williams et al 1989 the root depth generally increases rapidly from planting to a specific maximum depth by early mid season borg and grimes 1986 the maximum root depth is required and could be specified according to the field observations or the previous literature the vertical root distribution in the soil profile is assumed to be a piecewise linear function of the root depth the actual crop yield is calculated using the harvest index concept following the epic model procedures williams et al 1989 i e as a function of the above ground biomass and environmental stress from soil temperature soil salinity fertilizers etc the detailed calculation of epic cgm can be found in annex d 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis process the lh oat method is adopted in the ahc to perform the parameter sensitivity analysis it has a sampling strategy that is a combination of latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat sampling and thus allows performing gsa for a long list of parameters with less computational cost van griensven et al 2006 the calculation procedures are presented in detail in fig 2 with the parameter number being equal to m as an example lh oat starts with dividing the parameter range into n intervals and then taking n lh sampling points for each parameter with each interval to be sampled only once then n parameter groups are randomly generated after that each parameter group is varied for m times by changing each of the m parameters one at a time using the oat design thus it only requires a total of n m 1 model runs a global sensitivity index i e sp for the jth parameter i e p corresponding to a criterion is calculated by averaging the partial effects sp i for all lh points eq 7 and fig 2 7 s p 1 n i 1 n m e 1 i e j i 1 f j e m i m e 1 i e j i e m i m e 1 i e j i 1 f j e m i m e 1 j e j i e m i 2 f j where m refers to the model functions ej i is the value for the jth parameter p at the ith lh point sampling and fj is the fraction by which the parameter ej i is changed a predefined constant with a default value of 5 the final global sensitivity value for a parameter could then be estimated by the weighted average of the sp values under multicriteria conditions gsa result is obtained according to the sp value with the largest value being given the rank of 1 and the smallest value being given a rank equal to the total number of parameters analyzed xu et al 2016 a total of 316 parameters are involved in the sa database which could be optionally selected in the analysis they could be arranged in four main groups those relative to soil water flow those related to solute transport and transformation those related to plant growth and those describing stress factors of water salt nitrogen their ranges are required and often determined based on the existing literature the model outputs could be optionally selected as objective variables including actual evapotranspiration eta lai bottom flux dry aboveground biomass d agb and layer specific soil moisture and solute concentration content the parameters with higher sensitivity and uncertainty would be selected for further calibration more description about calculation procedures and parameter setting of the gsa process can be found in xu et al 2016 2 2 3 parameter estimation process the genetic algorithm ga is a global and robust method searching for the optimum solution to complex problems using the precept of natural selection holland 1975 goldberg 1989 the calculation flow chart of the ga and its coupling with the aesim process is shown in fig 3 the ga consists of three basic operators of selection crossover and mutation it represents a solution using strings referred to as chromosomes of variables represented as genes in a search problem the search will start by initializing a population of chromosomes each chromosome is evaluated on its performance using a fitness function on the basis of the performance the chromosomes are selected into the mating pool to form offspring through the crossover and mutation of genes selection crossover and mutation are repeated for many generations to reproduce the chromosome that fits the environment best the best chromosome would represent the optimal or near optimal solution to the search problem carroll 1998 goldberg 2002 the modified mga has been adopted to calibrate the model parameters by minimizing the error between simulated and observed data in the gpe process the modified mga code carroll 1998 ines and droogers 2002 is adapted and embedded into the ahc the parameters set with four groups are same as those in the gsa process the parameters selected by the gsa process could be automatically calibrated in the gpe process the number of parameters is recommended not to be more than 15 to avoid the problem of non uniqueness the parameters related to plant growth and stress factors could generally be determined from previous literature and specific experiments additionally the parameters related to solute transformation are generally difficult to be estimated inversely and thus they were suggested to be determined or manually calibrated on the basis of previous experimental or modeling studies while the parameters related to soils mainly soil water flow and solute transport are difficult to determine at each point of interest and are responsible for a large part of the spatial variability of the output variables thus we recommend that users concern these soil parameters in the gpe process similar to the sensitivity analysis the model outputs can be optionally selected as objective variables according to the observation data collected on the basis of these objective variables the fitness function is constructed using the weighted average method a more detailed description about the calculation procedures and parameter setting of the gsa process can be found in xu et al 2016 2 2 4 graphical user interface the gui for the ahc is developed using the vb net which is an object oriented programming language using the microsoft net framework 4 5 in the visual studio 2010 environment the gui allows the user to easily manipulate input files run the model and view the output a main window is designed as a guide for operating the ahc including launching the windows for data input i e for control file model files sensitivity analysis and calibration result display model run and exit fig 4 a the control file is used for managing the file path data file connection function selection simulation period output settings etc in this input window the simulation can also be customized to invoke only those modules of interest for a specified application e g solute or heat simulation can be disabled if not desired which can produce more efficient input operation all data input related to the aesim process is integrated and shown in the input window of the model files fig 4b it could make the data input more intuitive and clearer the input window for the sensitivity analysis and calibration is designed specifically for the data input of gsa and gpe processes respectively in the result display various simulation results e g soil water content soil solution concentration content leaf area index and biomass can be presented and conveniently compared with the observation data in graphics windows fig 4c and d which can help the user calibrate the model meanwhile the statistical indicators i e mre rmse nse r2 and b for model performance evaluation are also calculated and provided for users the efficiency and stability of the gui is also repeatedly tested with several different cases in addition with a slight adaptation the ahc model has been closely linked to gis software i e arcinfo 9 for regional applications in a distributed manner a basic graphical user interface has been constructed using the visual basic language xu et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 however it is undergoing an upgrade to arcinfo 10 but not yet completely finished 3 model application in this paper the ahc model was to be evaluated and tested with two experimental datasets i e related to salinity and nitrogen issues respectively by comparing the simulated results with the observed data the test cases could provide a comprehensive presentation of the latest release of the ahc especially the new functions e g crop dormancy setting compensated root water uptake soil surface mulching nitrogen transport and transformation etc in salinity case two year field data during 2012 and 2013 was collected from the maize field with plastic mulching located at the yangchang canal command area yca of the hetao irrigaiton district hetao inner mongolia autonomous region northwest china 40 48 40 n 107 05 15 e 1039 m altitude the field condition was a representative of that in the upper yellow river basin i e affected by salinity under shallow water tables and under plastic film mulching in particular the good quality of observation data was helpful in evaluating the function of the automatic inverse calibration the data was available from our previous study of ren et al 2016 in the nitrogen case the experimental data was obtained from the fields with a winter wheat summer maize rotation system from october 2010 to september 2012 in the shandong agricultural university agricultural experiment station sau aes tai an city shandong province northern china 36 09 37 n 117 09 18 e 130 m altitude the experimental site was also situated in an important food production base ncp where the nitrogen fertilizer is often overused by farmers to obtain high yields the related data was available from the previous study of liu 2014 the model was to be automatically calibrated for both the above two cases with gsa and gpe processes the parameters related to soil water flow and solute transport were usually most uncertain in practice thus only they were considered in the sensitivity analysis and automatic calibration as exemplifications in this study also for restricting the number of calibrated parameters other parameter values were mainly referred to the previous literature and could be adjusted manually the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of regression b were used to evaluate the model performance for both calibration and validation their definitions can be found in the previous study of xu et al 2013 3 1 case study of the salinity simulation 3 1 1 site characteristics and observation data the hetao has a typically arid and semiarid continental climate the average annual rainfall and pan evaporation 20 cm pan were respectively 160 mm and 2240 mm during 1981 2009 with over 70 of the rainfall occurring between june and september the daily meteorological data for the experimental years 2012 and 2013 were taken from the nearby linhe weather station rainfall was registered by a tipping bucket rain gauge in the field the detailed data on the main weather variables are shown in fig 5 the total rainfall was 208 mm and 89 mm during the maize growth seasons in 2012 and 2013 respectively the two years can represent a wet year and a dry year according to the hydrological frequency analysis the groundwater depth gwd was very shallow and varied in the range 0 5 2 5 m during the crop season the soil physical properties were surveyed for the soil profile with a 300 cm depth and four horizons by ren et al 2016 silt loam was the main soil texture in the yca with finer soils distributed below the zone root the water content at saturation field capacity and wilting point dry bulk density and ks were also measured the main soil properties are presented in table 1 the spring maize was sown in early may and harvested in late september with a planting density of 62 000 plants ha 1 irrigation water diverted from the yellow river has a salinity concentration of 0 5 g l 1 basin irrigation was applied by adopting zero slope basin which was the common practice in hetao the irrigation schedule is presented in table 2 the other cultivation practices including fertilizer application and pest crop disease and weed control were recommended by local farmer advisers soil groundwater and crop growth were monitored in observation field from april to september in both years soil sampling was performed every 7 15 days using a soil auger soil samples were collected for every 10 cm in the top 0 20 cm layer and in 20 cm increments below the top layer until the a 100 cm depth the soil water content and salt content of the soil solution c sw g l 1 i e soil salinity concentration were measured for each layer the daily gwd was recorded by a water level logger the groundwater salinity concentration was obtained every 10 days lai was directly measured every 15 days and crop yield was recorded after harvest the detailed measurement methods were described in ren et al 2016 3 1 2 model setup for salinity case a soil profile with a 300 cm depth was specified with four horizons according to the soil survey table 1 the domain was further discretized into 300 compartments with a uniform thickness of 1 cm the simulation period was from the early may to late september covering the maize growth period the maximum root depth was set at 90 cm according to field observations and values found in the literature xu et al 2015 for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation and precipitation fluxes a time variable pressure head was selected as the bottom boundary condition which was defined using the observed gwds for solute transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined by a concentration flux considering the observed salinity concentration of irrigation water and groundwater respectively the initial conditions of the soil water content and salinity concentration were set based on field measurements the parameters related to soil hydraulic properties solute transport root water uptake stress and crop growth were initially specified before calibration the initial values for unknown soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the physical properties using rosetta model schaap et al 2001 initial values for other parameters were primarily determined according to former studies xu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 kroes and van dam 2003 the measured soil water contents salinity concentrations and lai as mentioned above were used to calibrate parameters automatically using the gpe process then the applicability of the ahc model was tested and evaluated with proper calibration and validation 3 1 3 results and discussion 1 model performance evaluation in the salinity case the gsa results showed that only 11 of a total of 25 soil parameters were very sensitive to the observation data with their global sensitivity values shown in fig 6 a their values were inversely calibrated and are listed in table 1 comparisons between the simulation and observations are presented in figs 7 9 and table 3 the simulated soil water contents showed good agreement with the measured soil water contents for different soil layers during 2013 fig 7 resulting in a mre 0 86 a rmse 0 015 cm3 cm 3 and a nse 0 91 table 3 fig 8 shows that the simulated salinity concentration also fitted well with the observed one during calibration it produced a mre 7 9 a rmse 1 37 g l 1 and a nse 0 67 the simulated soil water and salt dynamics by ahc were quite close to that by hydrus dualkc in ren et al 2016 in addition the simulated lai and yield were in agreement with observations as well fig 9a fitness results produced a mre 11 9 a rmse 0 50 and a nse 0 87 for lai while the simulated crop yield 12 114 kg ha 1 was only 5 lower than the observed one thus the ahc performed reasonably well when simulating the soil water salinity and crop growth during the 2013 calibration period the ahc model with calibrated parameters was further tested and validated with the 2012 experimental data soil moisture reproduced by ahc also represented the observations very well as shown in the small errors of the estimates fig 7 rmse 0 031 cm3 cm 3 nse 0 74 and r2 0 75 the simulated salinity concentration was in good agreement with observations fig 8 rmse 0 99 g l 1 nse 0 42 and r2 0 54 the simulation for lai seemed to be acceptable since there were only limited observation data fig 9b the simulated yield was 12 314 kg ha 1 12 less than the obtained yield in 2012 overall the modeling accuracy of the ahc should be acceptable during the validation period moreover the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the ahc in calibration and validation were within the range of values reported in the previous literature for field modeling cases e g jiang et al 2011 ramos et al 2017 kumar et al 2015 and were even located at a relatively good level the general agreement between the simulated and measured data during calibration and validation indicated that the calibrated ahc could accurately simulate the complicated agroecosystem processes at the experimental site thus it could provide useful and detailed information about the soil water and salt dynamics and maize growth support a better understanding and solve existing problems 2 simulation analysis soil water salinity and crop growth the soil water and salt balance components for the 0 90 cm soil profile i e the root zone during the total simulation period of 2012 and 2013 are presented in table 4 simulation results indicated that the soil moisture was relatively high fluctuating around 0 3 cm 3 cm 3 at the surface layer and approaching saturation in deep layers both during 2012 and 2013 due to the shallow gwd and large irrigation it increased rapidly with irrigation and then gradually decreased due to water consumption and redistribution until the next irrigation or significant rainfall event occurred fig 7 in the meantime the salinity concentration decreased sharply after an irrigation event because the soil solution was diluted and salts were leached to the deeper layers fig 8 the up and down movement of soil water and salt was also partly affected by regional groundwater table fluctuations especially for deeper soil layers the effective rainfall was usually small in hetao and its effects on soil moisture and salinity were mainly limited to the surface soil layer i e 0 20 cm the results showed that maize growth was primarily stressed by salinity and temperature but not water deficit during the early growth period the temperature was relatively low in 2012 fig 5 which was the main limiting factor for maize growth in contrast the salinity was higher in upper layers e g 6 8 g l 1 for solution at 10 40 cm during the early period in 2013 fig 8 and thus became the dominant stress to seedling growth fig f1 overall a few differences were observed for crop growth in the initial stage between 2012 and 2013 however during 2012 the crop growth was significantly affected by waterlogging due to a large rainfall event 80 mm immediately after the first irrigation in late june figs 7 and f1 that resulted in the retardation of crop growth in the vegetative period since late june when there was almost no temperature stress the water uptake and growth of maize were mainly affected by salinity levels fig f1 it was obvious that the salinity concentration and salt stress was markedly higher in 2013 than in 2012 figs 8 and f1 because the higher rainfall in 2012 202 mm can lead to the greater salt leaching and 100 mm less capillary rise there is less salt accumulation into the root zone table 4 thus the maize could then grow better in 2012 in particular the salinity concentration was relatively high during the key period of the reproductive period i e after mid august in 2013 overall the crop yield was relatively higher in 2012 than in 2013 in both 2012 and 2013 it was found that most of the leached salts could not be discharged timely and stayed in the deeper soil layers due to a poor drainage system these salts would reaccumulate into the upper layers with the upward water movement under the arid climate in hetao in summary this test case testing showed that the ahc can well reflect the soil water salt dynamics and interaction with maize growth additionally it indicated that the key issue was the reasonable control of shallow water tables and coordination of irrigation and drainage in hetao 3 2 case study of the nitrogen simulation 3 2 1 site characteristics and observation data the sau aes is located in the southern ncp this region has a temperate continental monsoon climate the mean annual rainfall is 697 mm 70 80 of which occurs between june and september daily meteorological data for 2007 and 2008 were available from the nearby tai an weather station the detailed data on the main weather variables are shown in fig 10 for both experimental years the depth of the groundwater is greater than 10 m during the year silt loam and silt are the main soil textures for topsoil and subsoil respectively with four horizons in the 0 160 cm soil profile in sau aes the principle soil characteristics are listed in table 1 the water contents at saturation field capacity and wilting points the ks and the organic matter content omc were measured for each horizon in addition the soil fertility properties of the upper soils 0 45 cm were as follows soil organic matter 7 9 13 3 g kg 1 total n 0 66 1 12 g kg 1 available phosphorous 34 1 66 1 mg kg 1 and available potassium 74 9 121 7 mg kg 1 the related measurement approaches were described in detail by liu 2014 the cropping system was the rotation of winter wheat and summer maize that was common in ncp the planting density was 2 4 m plants ha 1 and 66 000 plants ha 1 respectively the irrigation and fertilization schedules were determined as recommended by local farmer advisers table 2 irrigation water was pumped from groundwater the food irrigation was adopted and the surface broadcast of urea was applied as the topdressing of fertilizer n which were both the common practices in the ncp other cultivation practices related to pest crop disease and weed control were recommended by farmer advisers soil and crop growth were monitored during the two agricultural years from 2010 and 2012 the soil water content was measured at 20 cm increments from soil surface down to a 160 cm depth using a neutron probe with a frequency of 10 days the nitrate nitrogen no3 n contents were measured approximately every 30 days for the same layers lai and d agb were measured every month the dry grain yield was weighed after harvesting the detailed measurement methods can be found in liu 2014 3 2 2 model setup for nitrogen case a soil profile with a 300 cm depth was specified to have five material horizons for depths below 160 cm the soil properties were initially assumed to be the same as the last observed layer in vertical discretization the soil domain was discretized into 200 compartments with uniform 1 cm thickness for the first 100 cm depth and 2 cm thickness for 100 300 cm the simulation period was from october 3rd 2010 to september 30th 2012 covering two seasons of the rotation of wheat and maize for soil water flow the upper boundary condition was determined by the actual evaporation and transpiration rates and the irrigation table 2 and precipitation fluxes the surface mulch by wheat straw was considered to estimate ea during the maize season at the bottom a free drainage boundary condition was used to account for the deep gwd for nitrogen transport the upper and lower boundary conditions were defined as the third type boundary conditions by specifying a concentration flux using the concentration of no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n in irrigation water rainfall and groundwater for heat transport the daily average air temperature was used to define top boundary condition if there was rainfall or irrigation third type boundary condition was used to prescribe the top heat flux the third type boundary condition was also applied at the bottom to specify the heat flux the initial conditions of soil water content nitrogen concentration and temperature were set based on field observations the crop dormancy was considered for wheat growth in the winter season the parameters related to soil hydraulic properties nitrogen transport and transformation root water uptake stress and crop growth were initially specified before calibration the unknown soil hydraulic parameters table 1 were initialized with the physical properties using the pedotransfer functions pfts of wösten et al 1999 the parameters related to carbon turnover were assigned according to hansen et al 1991 the values of other parameters were initialized according to previous studies liu 2014 ahuja et al 2000 williams et al 2006 wang 2010 initial values of crop parameters for spring wheat and summer maize were defined on the basis of our previous research in the ncp wang et al 2015 wang 2010 the measured soil water contents no3 n contents lai and d agb as mentioned above were used for parameter estimation through the gpe process modeling results were also evaluated by comparison with those using the rzwqm2 model by liu 2014 3 2 3 results and discussion 1 model performance evaluation in the nitrogen case the gsa showed that 15 of a total of 35 soil parameters were very sensitive to the observation data with their global sensitivity values shown in fig 6b the calibrated values for model parameters are presented in table 1 the comparisons of simulated and measured soil water contents and no3 n contents at different layers are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively both for the calibration 2010 2011 and validation 2011 2012 the results showed that the simulated soil water contents were in a good agreement with the measured soil water contents for various soil layers during 2010 2012 fig 11 the rmse was less than 0 04 cm3 cm 3 for both calibration and validation while the nse reached to over 0 77 table 3 the fitness was even better than that of liu 2014 who used the rzwqm2 additionally because the ahc took into account the crop dormancy and effects of soil frost on hydraulic conductivity the water could be held in the soil layer and the soil moisture changed slightly during the crop dormancy period fig 11 the simulation seemed to be more reasonable during the winter season than that of the rzwqm2 of liu 2014 moreover the simulated surface soil moisture became large after high rainfall and could even approach saturation which was not captured by rzwqm2 this was because the ahc allowed surface ponding to consider the effects of soil bunds while the storage of surface runoff was not considered in rzwqm2 the simulated no3 n contents were also in a reasonable agreement with the measured ones fig 12 simulation of n fate was intrinsically more difficult than that for other terms due to the complex processes of n transport and transformation surface broadcast of urea would increase the uncertainty in observations in spite of that the ahc reasonably captured the dynamics of the observed no3 n contents in particular the no3 n variations were relatively large in near surface layer and were well described using the ahc in addition the simulated no3 n variations by the ahc were also better than that by rzwqm2 liu 2014 the goodness of fit indicators obtained with the ahc during the two years table 3 were within the range of values reported in previous studies e g cameira et al 2007 wang and huang 2008 liu 2014 liang et al 2014 for crop growth the simulated lai and d agb matched quite well with the observations fig 13 with very good fitness indicator values both in calibration and validation table 3 meanwhile simulated grain yields for wheat 7776 kg ha 1 and 7597 kg ha 1 had relative errors of less than 5 in the two seasons and that for maize 8741 kg ha 1 and 9762 kg ha 1 had relative errors of less than 6 thus the ahc performed reasonably well in simulation during the calibration and validation periods of 2010 2012 2 simulation analysis soil water nitrogen and crop growth the water and nitrogen balance components for the 0 100 cm soil profile i e root zone are presented in table 5 the results showed that irrigation and rainfall were mainly consumed by et during the wheat season the eta was 504 and 514 mm for spring wheat in the first and second seasons respectively while ta was 47 mm greater for the first season 2010 2011 because of larger lai in vegetative growth stage the bottom flux of the root zone i e at 100 cm in depth was small and almost moved upward after turning green march to early june this was because there was often less rainfall during the spring season in ncp and the applied irrigation 75 mm was not excessive in particular the wheat was not timely irrigated during the second irrigation event in the first season which caused water stress to some degree fig f2 this also happened in the second season 2011 2012 but occurred before the third irrigation event overall during the two seasons the wheat growth was affected by low temperatures during early stage of the turning green period march and water deficit in the following stages but was almost not affected by nitrogen deficiency fig f2 thus with similar climate conditions especially temperature and radiation the wheat yield was very similar in the two seasons the above analysis was also similar to that using the rzwqm2 liu 2014 the maize was generally irrigated no more than once as it grew in the summer rainy season with rainfall of 597 mm and 324 mm during the first season 2011 and second season 2012 respectively the results showed that the eta of summer maize was approximately 370 mm for both two seasons with slight differences for both ea and ta the rainfall was obviously greater during 2011 figs 10 and 11 thus the deep percolation from the root zone was also more significant during this season reaching to 120 mm and the water storage was increased by 186 mm after harvest table 5 there was almost no surface runoff in the two seasons due to the effects of soil bunds 10 cm overall the stress from water deficit was very small for maize growth because of the plentiful rainfall in the summer rainy season maize growth was mainly affected by nitrogen deficit in the seedling period which was more obvious during 2012 fig f2 however the grain yield was still 11 higher in 2012 than that in 2011 due to the higher solar radiation with a similar cumulative temperature during the maize season from june to september in 2012 fig 10 simulated results indicated that the nitrogen was mainly consumed by crop nitrogen uptake which accounted for approximately 80 and 50 70 of total n consumption during the wheat and maize growth periods respectively the nitrogen was primarily lost through nh3 volatilization after irrigation reaching to approximately 130 kg ha 1 in 2011 and 2012 and accounting for approximately 20 of total n consumption the nitrogen leaching was only significant during the maize growth period i e summer rainy season in the wet year of 2011 the amount of 121 9 kg ha 1 nitrogen was leached out of the root zone 0 100 cm and only 22 could be reused by capillary rise thus the net leaching loss reached to 95 0 kg ha 1 which composed 25 of the total nitrogen loss table 5 for the wheat growth period spring dry season and maize growth period in 2012 lower rainfall season compared to 2011 the amount of nitrogen leaching was less than 32 kg ha 1 for the root zone this was also because the irrigation amount was limited in the experiment it was even less than the upward recharge from the underlying layers for wheat growth thus this resulted in an upward cumulative flux of approximately 30 kg ha 1 during the two seasons table 5 in addition the results also showed that the net leaching loss at 200 cm in depth was less than 20 kg ha 1 both for 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 the results indicated that the denitrification loss just occupied a very small part and could almost be neglected the results for the nitrogen budget by the ahc were similar to those from using rzwqm2 liu 2014 thus the control of nh3 volatilization should receive attention even with relatively reasonable irrigation scheduling in summary the test case indicated that the ahc should be a reliable tool to simulate the water and nitrogen fate and the related crop growth in the field 4 summary and conclusion a new physically based numerical model named ahc that was developed to simulate the agroecosystem processes was presented in this paper the model concept algorithm and structure of the ahc were described in detail with a brief description of the software user interface the model was designed with three main processes i e the aesim gsa and gpe processes each of which consisted of many modules for implementing specific functions the aesim process simulated the soil water flow the fate of salt or nitrogen and heat transport in a mechanical processed based manner that is it was all based on the numerical solution of a series of partial differential equations thus the ahc model was also suitable to very complex agro hydrological conditions the generic crop growth module was drawn from the concept of the epic model which was suitable for various plant species with acceptable accuracy and less data demand the gsa and gpe processes were used in conjunction to determine the parameters during model calibration based on the lh oat and modified mga methods relative to the other agroecosystem models there were three significant features of the ahc 1 the ability to optionally simulate the fate of nitrogen and the fate of salt 2 the robust ability to do global parameter sensitivity analysis and to inversely calibrate the model parameters and 3 the adaptability to a wide range of field conditions especially some specific phenomena or farm practices in northern china e g crop dormancy soil frost and thaw in winter and different film mulching the ahc was then tested with using the data from two typical field experiments that were related to the salinity issue in a maize field in northwest china and the nitrogen use for a wheat maize rotation field on north china plain respectively two years of data were used to evaluate the model performance in both cases eleven sensitive parameters and fifteen ones of all soil hydraulic and transport parameters were screened out for the model calibration in salinity and nitrogen cases respectively the results indicated that the model can accurately capture the dynamics of layered soil water contents the simulated crop indicators leaf area index biomass and yield were also in a quite good agreement with the observations with regard to the solute the ahc could predict the soil salinity concentration well the simulation accuracy for nitrogen fate was acceptable compared to previous studies but yet not as good as that for salt this should be related to the complex mechanism of nitrogen fate and the high spatial variation caused by surface broadcast fertilization in conclusion all indicators supported the ability of the model to simulate the agroecosystem processes furthermore the issues related to field irrigation water use the salinity effect nitrogen use efficiency etc were evaluated using the calibrated model taken as a whole the ahc should prove to be a reliable and efficient tool in analyzing the complex agroecosystem processes and in supporting the rational management of irrigation application salinity control and nitrogen fertilizer use in the subsequent development of the ahc model the focus is to improve the description of the agroecosystem including adding process descriptions of phenomena that are not yet included in the current version e g the soil freezing and thawing the effects of soil tillage on transport processes and pesticide transport another important focus is to better support distributed modeling for regional land and water management acknowledgements

25162,water resources are an essential and determining factor for food production ecosystem health and socio economic development the socio economic water cycling system is a complex adaptive system changes in the socio economic system at the macro level such as industrial transformation technical progress and water price reform will have impacts on water resources utilization at the micro level in this study we applied the multi region computable general equilibrium theory to build a multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model for analyzing the impacts of water price reform water reallocation schemes and industrialization processes on water resources utilization with particular attention being placed on the water land nexus importantly the key parameters for constructing this multiple scale sewc model such as the relationships between water and land resources vary spatially across multiple levels i e the levels of river basin county and irrigation area we therefore innovatively considered and estimated the key parameters firstly and then integrated them into the model to achieve more reliable simulation results taking the heihe river basin as an empirical example the simulated results show that a 5 increase in both the surface water price and the groundwater price in gaotai county would lead to a differing extent of the economic impact among the other counties consequently an appropriate allocation scheme of water resources according to the levels of irrigation area county and the heihe river basin is imperative if water utilization pressure is to be mitigated within the entire river basin keywords socio economic water cycling model framework interactions across scales water land nexus 1 introduction water is directly and tightly linked to the development of the global economy to regional eco environment health and to human wellbeing water security water use efficiency and water productivity are key concerns of integrated water resource management in arid and semi arid inland river basins bakker 2012 cook and bakker 2012 harmancioglu et al 2013 water resource managers focus on different perspectives at the multiple spatial levels of river basin county irrigation area and even individual water users world water assessment programme wwap 2015 socio economic water cycling refers to the utilization and transfer of water resources in the socio economic system the systematic and comprehensive analysis of multiple scale socio economic water cycling can go beyond physical availability and boundaries of water resources whereby water resources can be reallocated within the entire river basin to achieve regional synergetic development according to rational industrial structure and layout the multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model attempts to optimize surface water and groundwater across economic ecological and livelihood utilizations under the constraint of outside in water resource availability of a river basin traditional economic models focused mainly on the economic value of water consuming products and ignored the ecological and environmental cost of depleting natural resources however two decades ago the global water partnership gwp proposed the integrated water resources management iwrm model for transferring the conventional segmented sectoral water resource management mode to a cross sectoral management style at the catchment scale gwp 2004 an iwrm system contains multiple complicated scales of water administrative boundaries gastelum et al 2009 giupponi and sgobbi 2013 iwrm aims to promote sustainable development and water resources management to maximize human wellbeing without compromising vital ecosystem services the gwp initiated a framework of holistic water resources management that considers multiple stakeholders such as individual users administrative agencies and policy makers under the guidance of this state of the art framework more concrete and representative applications and practices should be performed at various interconnected governmental sectoral and geographical levels lautenbach et al 2009 manos et al 2010 water and land are essential production elements in generating economic development and primary natural factors controlling the type and extent of hydrological processes the level of socio economic development is restricted by how much land and water resources are available both locally and regionally fao 2011 chen et al 2018 especially the water and land resources do not match which determines that the development of agriculture relies on the water resources on a large scale in arid and semi arid inland river basins wu et al 2015 human disturbance and associated land use changes are known to alter hydrological processes through numerous complex pathways strayer et al 2003 townsend et al 2003 for example irrigation activities have become the most important factor in reducing stream flows and in increasing the interaction between groundwater and surface water grafton et al 2013 with rapid urbanization during the last several decades more than 50 of the world s population now lives in cities un desa 2010 the rapid increase in urban water demand therefore arises from growing urban populations and greater economic activity in cities furthermore urbanization brings about an impervious surface sprawl which alters the hydrological processes of floodplains and of rivers the interaction between socio economic water use and natural water cycling processes calls for a multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model with positive and negative feedbacks from hydrological process at both the spatial and temporal dimensions hydro economic models are able to integrate hydrological cycling socio economic development water management and ecological and environmental issues in one comprehensive framework for reallocating water resources to high value uses and for increasing water use productivity andreu et al 1996 such models capture the diverse relationships between ecology and economy to better address climate related hydrological questions as well as economic and social issues in a comprehensive water system brouwer and hofkes 2008 to analyze the water security of a river basin the real time water quantity should be estimated by using several distributed and semi distributed hydrological models such as modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow mode and swat soil water assessment tool these hydrological parameters such as rate of flow water quantity available are regarded as the key variables to transfer into and link with the economic model one of the most critical obstacles for hydro economic models to overcome is the significant difference in the spatial and temporal scales between socio economic models and hydrological models de fraiture 2007 as a result only a few models have been proposed that coordinate water demand and assess the impact of water resource changes on economic growth across multiple spatial scales in an integrated conceptual framework cai 2008 the integrated multiple scale sewc model intends to offer a more comprehensive vision of the economic and social consequences of water management for various water use agents such as households farms and business firms this comprehensive model consequently provides a useful instrument for optimizing the allocation of water resources in summary a multiple scale sewc model aims to facilitate the efficient and effective integrated management of water resources and should consider the multiple interdependent water use agents across multiple spatial scales the sewc model also incorporates the spatial variation of land and water resource endowment and relations the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 reviews research progress on the integrated models of hydrological economic water cycling section 3 sets up the framework of the proposed model and analyzes the feedback mechanisms across multiple spatial scales section 4 provides a case study of the model s application section 5 concludes the study presenting the major findings based on the model s construction and application 2 literature review on integrated models of hydrological economic water cycling the global water system project studies interactions between basin scale processes and global influences such as climate change and global trade as part of its global catchment initiative hydro economic modeling platforms have also been widely used to address global water security questions de fraiture 2007 rosegrant et al 2002 and to tackle complex multi level water management issues in a number of basin locations around the world including in france lanini et al 2004 the us california jenkins et al 2004 australia mainuddin et al 2007 northern china guan and hubacek 2008 western africa ahrends et al 2008 and brazil maneta et al 2009 thorough reviews of hydro economic modeling applications include those of ward et al 2006 and heinz et al 2007 on catchment scale models and that of harou et al 2009 on water allocation models various authors have described methodological issues related to linking hydrological and economic systems including mckinney 1999 heinz et al 2007 harou et al 2009 and brouwer and hofkes 2008 the cascade modeling approach using path analysis was adopted to study the lake naivasha basin odongo et al 2014 alternatives to cascade modeling would be process based models e g agent based models or system dynamics models that account for relevant feedback mechanisms compared with the aforementioned models the socio economic models pay more attention to the optimal production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput such models include linear programming models input output models partial general equilibrium models and computable general equilibrium cge models for example crop models for multi objective constrained optimization of irrigation strategies are used to improve water use efficiency among agricultural sectors letcher et al 2007 the cge model has been used in a wide range of studies related to water resource management some of these studies include the allocation of surface irrigation water to make economic growth diao et al 2005 the effects of groundwater resource regulations on agricultural and non agricultural sectors diao et al 2008 allowable water withdrawals under different water management scenarios calzadilla et al 2010 and improvements in irrigation management to alleviate water scarcity calzadilla et al 2011 hydrological economic models commonly use artificial neural networks for exploratory data analysis of high dimensional multivariate datasets however such models encounter limitations when dealing with highly nonlinear patterns water resources are affected by climate change and human intervention at multiple scales changing climate demographics and economic demands add to the challenge by presenting a moving target cohesive planning and integrated management for sustainable water resources will require continual co development of knowledge and problem solutions in the process of coupling the physical and socio economic domains however the limitations of hydro economic models have been extensively discussed by many researchers mckinney 1999 maneta et al 2009 harou et al 2009 who identify a number of methodological challenges mostly related to the different spatial temporal scales of the hydrologic and economic models generally hydrologic models are delimited by geographical borders and refer to periods of days or climatic seasons whereas economic models are bounded in many cases by administrative boundaries and use longer time horizons based on annual periods there are relatively few hydro economic models that include top down constrained adaptation and bottom up optimized conduction across multiple scales even though there exist a few estimates of the non market value of water resources for socio economic use shabman and stephenson 2000 although not entirely uncontroversial economic valuation techniques can be used to estimate non market values so that such values can be incorporated into decision making notwithstanding the above hydro economic models have been used for several decades by engineers and economists to support water management decisions however there are few models that incorporate the effects of water management changes on non market intangible values provided by ecosystems harmancioglu et al 2013 sustainable development requires balanced and simultaneous consideration of the economic environmental technological and social aspects of an economy sector or individual industrial process as well as of the interactions among all these aspects however before we optimize and allocate water use we need to know the links between the ecological hydrological and economic domains and the effects of their coupling on humans only then can we formalize a river basin management plan and design policy instruments in either the physical or social realms a water allocation substitution module that balances specific water supplies and demands should be based on agreed supply priorities which are decided on the basis of water security use efficiencies and equality some hydro economic models use the system approach involving an evaluation of the economic costs and benefits for different water allocation and substitution scenarios elements of which are isolated and then linked with one another letcher et al 2007 in system models the equations of relationships between the socio economic and hydrological domains need to be constructed and parameters then observed changes in land use and in land cover act are a mirror of socio economic development and of ecosystem change as demand has increased for water resources land use and land cover change models have been coupled to hydro economic models to estimate the impact of socio economic development on stream flows and stormwater runoff townsend et al 2003 odongo et al 2014 in a typical hydro economic model water extraction infrastructure is linked to the hydrologic features of a system in a node link network where economic costs and benefits are generated by water use and production activities we regard the node link network as a suitable tool to express the regional trade flow and water flow in a river basin and therefore the present study integrates the water land and socio economic domains in a node link network 3 framework of the proposed multiple scale socio economic water cycling model multiple scale socio economic water cycling can be considered as a closed system across the scales of river basin county and irrigation area using such a systemic approach allows us to investigate alternatives for improving the water allocation process for increasing water efficiencies and for promoting water productivity how to allocate water resources among multiple regions is the vital component to guaranteeing water security in order to balance water distribution between ecology and economy and also within the related economies at the river basin scale the water security of a river basin is threatened by climate change and by changes in regional trade conditions water resource allocation reallocation among multiple industries is the key to achieving water use efficiency and balancing economic development with ecological safety at the county level generally the agricultural sector is the primary user of water in a county increasing water productivity in the agricultural sector involves optimal decision making regarding the planting structure in the irrigation area of interest the multi region cge model can be used at the basin and county levels to analyze the impacts of water price reform water reallocation and industrialization on regional water use and economy the partial general equilibrium model can be used to allocate the water resource among the irrigated areas according to the crop pattern irrigation rate and other agricultural parameters inputs the key technique is to group into the county level model and the irrigation area model which will be the core of the system for promoting water productivity and improving water use efficiency by water price reform and water reallocation by utilizing a multiple scale model at the river basin county and water user scales we are able to analyze not only the top down impact of exogenous variables on water allocation but also the effect of bottom up water use behaviors table 1 in this way we offer a new perspective on integrated water resource management table 1 the multiple scale sewc model fig 1 considers hydrological processes and the water demand of the socio economic system land use change is vital for assessing the major economic drivers of changes in water demand and the impact of these changes on hydrological processes in addition economic factors dictate how land is used regionally as well as locally and how much water is needed the scarcity of land and or water will act to constrain economic development coordinated and orderly water and land resource system is vital to ensure the social economic development therefore the elasticity of substitution between land and water will change according to resource scarcity the pace of economic development and population density the socio economic system can be affected by some policies but eco hydrology can be impact by climate change a key feature of the model is its ability to handle a large number of regions or sectors in a framework this section describes the production functions and key components of the economic model that is adopted in the multi scale sewc model at the basin scale we consider industry q d where q refers to the industry s water demand and d refers to the industry s region with respect to the basin scale the variables for the model consist of matrices of water flow values dimensioned by commodity industry production region and water use region the virtual water flow is also recorded in matrices producers choose a cost minimizing combination of intermediate and primary factor inputs subject to production functions that are structured by a series of leontief assumptions and constant elasticity of substitution ces nesting assumptions fig 2 the primary factor aggregate is a ces composite of labor and a capital aggregate with the latter itself being a ces composite of land water and other capital the aggregate intermediate input is again a ces composite of different commodity composites which are in turn ces composites of commodities from different sources industry outputs are transformed into commodity outputs via a constant elasity of transformation cet mechanism because we use the multi region cge model for the heihe river basin combined with the eco hydrological model the spatially explicit water supply and demand at the county level can be identified we then use the partial equilibrium model to estimate the water demand of each land parcel and arrive at a water allocation scheme at the land parcel level by doing this the water flow in each irrigation section can be quantified to assist the individuals and organizations that are responsible for the integrated water management the rigorous assumptions and data requirements in the cge model need to be considered as in previous studies wu et al 2015 the economic output per unit water resource was used as the indicator for estimating water use efficiency it was assumed that water security and water utilization efficiency will be augmented if the water resource is reasonably allocated in a diverse manner to crops multiple industrial sectors and different jurisdictions the sectors use various combination of labor capital land water and other intermediate inputs table 2 since water rights transfers among the sectors and rural land transfers in the agricultural sector apply the land and water resources can change between sectors as shown in fig 2 the production technology in a particular sector is represented by a quadruple nested production function first producers combine irrigated land and irrigated water via a ces function to produce an irrigated land aggregate at the irrigation area scale we deduced the substitute elasticity of irrigated land and irrigated water the eqs 1 3 were used to express the principal of elasticity parameter for water and land resources specifically this study selected the translog production function to estimate the elasticity parameter a detailed estimation process regarding the substitute elasticity of land and water resources can be found in widawskya et al 1998 second dry land irrigated land and pastureland are combined with a ces function to produce a cultivated land aggregate meanwhile the land and water used by industries are combined via the leontief function to produce the industrial land aggregate then in the third level the industrial land and irrigated land are combined to produce the land and water aggregate following this the land and water aggregate is combined with the primary factors and intermediate input to produce an output via a leontief function that expresses a production process in county r finally the output value in county r is transformed to the water use value in other counties or outside of the river basin via margins and a cet mechanism 1 σ w l n d w l n w l n d m p w m p l n m p w m p l n 2 m p w m p l n y w y l n η w η l n l n w 3 σ w l n d w l n d m p w m p l n η l n η w η l n η w d η l

of land and water resources a very low value of elasticity in the quadruple nested production function means that there is little substitutability between the water and land inputs even if the price of water rises significantly the ratio of inputs use remains relatively unchanged the elasticity affects the way in which an industry reacts to the increased scarcity of water and thus to the increased price of water a higher elasticity of substitution means that farms can more readily move to those inputs that are cheaper consequently as the quantities of water used in production fall the output of a farm can readily be maintained by increasing the intensity of land use 4 an example of model application 4 1 study area the heihe river basin of northwestern china is located within arid and semi arid climatic regions fig 3 where evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation in the heihe river basin water supply hardly meets overall demand the extensive exploitation of water resources in the middle reach of the heihe river has resulted in distinct ecological damage in the downstream reach cheng et al 2006 water supply is derived mainly from the upstream runoff and groundwater in this river basin and it is used principally for ecological domestic industrial and agricultural irrigation purposes li et al 2001 water use has already approached or exceeded its sustainable threshold wang et al 2009 in the context of climate change and the rapid economic growth being experienced this region water scarcity is becoming an increasingly serious issue and consequently it is imperative to mitigate the contradiction between water demand and supply the heihe river basin covers 11 counties with various industrial structure and water use efficiencies for each industry table 3 agriculture steel food processing and electricity are the dominant industries and major water consumption sectors in the basin in particular agriculture is still the largest water consuming sector in the basin accounting for more than 90 of total water consumption the counties of ganzhou jiayuguan suzhou gaotai linze and jinta are the most important counties because they have the greatest areas under irrigation and consume 80 of the total water resource in the heihe river basin the average water productivity for all industrial sectors in the heihe river basin is approximately 15 chinese yuan m3 lower than the national average however increasing water productivity requires systematic thinking to regulate and optimize water usage amount at the various levels such as individual crops within an irrigation area industrial sectors within a county and counties with industries within and even outside of the river basin for example at the level of industrial sectors water transfers between different industries within a county such as from agriculture to manufacturing sectors has been shown to be a good choice for improving water productivity although with some negative effects celio et al 2010 levine et al 2007 exporting grain products from the heihe river basin to other areas in china results in virtual water being transferred from a region of water scarcity to economically developed regions and is an example of a water resources regulation strategy consequently an appropriate and comprehensive scheme for allocating water resources among various stakeholders at multiple levels is imperative if water demand is to be met for the entire river basin various studies have examined the trends in temperature precipitation li et al 2010 and potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2009 as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of both green and blue water flows zang et al 2012 in the heihe river basin or its sub basins however the integrated management of water resources at multiple scales using a cohesive system has been under examined and the food water land nexus has not been considered to date from the perspective of actual water using the network of the river basin fig 4 illustrates the branches of the heihe river and different water use nodes corroborating the necessity of taking into consideration multi scale water resource management by stakeholders and administrators the liyuan river is one of the branches of the heihe river both the heihe and liyuan rivers provide water for the 14 irrigation areas and 11 counties in the basin fig 4 with 81 7 of the total water supply being provided by the heihe river and the rest 18 3 by the liyuan river li et al 2001 in addition the intra regional trade embedded in the water flow tightens the regional linkages within a complicated system in summary the heihe river basin is a case in point to which the proposed integrated and multi scale water resources management framework and model can be applied 4 2 estimation of model parameters water and land resources are two primary factors for agricultural and industrial production the elasticity of substitution between land and water reflects the matching and substitutional relationships between these two primary natural resources for different levels of geographical region irrigation areas and counties the elasticity parameter thus indicates the degree of unsubstitutability and scarcity of a single resource for agricultural production consequently it is the key parameter for the integrated multi scale water resources management model the smaller the substitution elasticity the more important less able to be substituted is the water resource for agricultural production given a certain quantity of land resource for the region of interest the size of the irrigation area is determined by the amount of water resources available fig 5 the central irrigation area has an elasticity of substitution between water and land of approximately 0 9 this central area has a relatively dense population and a small proportion of land occupied by agriculture for this area the elasticity between land and water resources is relatively high which indicates that the substitution between the two kinds of resources is relatively flexible in other words the scarcity of a single resource is not that serious for this area in contrast the values of substitution elasticity for the marginal irrigation areas are less than 0 25 which means that any kind of resource whether water or land is an indispensable factor for agricultural production in these marginal irrigation areas most of these marginal irrigation areas are agriculture dominated regions however water availability is not sufficient for these areas therefore optimizing water allocation between different crops for these irrigation areas with low substitution elasticity between land and water resources is of primary concern to improve water productivity for a particular irrigation area the promotion of water saving technologies the adjustment of planting structure and the modification of household water use behaviors will all affect water productivity in particular adjusting farming layout through promoting the seed production of hybrid maize miscellaneous grain crops potatoes and sea buckthorn might be an effective and feasible way to improve water productivity at the county level the estimation results show that the more economically developed counties are characterized by higher values of substitution elasticity between water and land fig 6 for example the substitution elasticity between water and land is more than 0 6 for jiayuguan city jiayuguan is the most developed city in the midstream reach of the heihe river basin being an industrial city producing steel and other metal products suzhou county and ganzhou district have the second highest values of substitution elasticity suzhou county is developing an equipment manufacturing industry focusing on wind energy and ganzhou district is a core zone of zhangye city another economically developed city for most of the other counties in the heihe river basin agriculture is the dominant activity producing maize seed exporting it to regions outside the heihe basin and selling it to local markets is the major business for these counties counties in both the upstream and downstream reaches of the river basin depend on animal husbandry for their livelihoods in the midstream part of the river basin the tourist industry is a rapidly growing sector for these counties that agricultural sectors are the dominant industries the substitution elasticity is relative low meaning that the same economic output can be obtained from different input combinations of land water labor capital and other intermediate inputs one of the reasons why the more economically developed counties have high substitution elasticity values is that these counties are able to expend more effort into instituting water saving technologies and consequently have more available water saved to achieve higher outputs that is to say water and land constraints are not as strict for these economically developed counties compared with other counties importantly the unbalanced economic development among different counties produces the distinct elasticity differentials among these same counties which results in a clear pattern of virtual water trading within the basin the basic pattern of net virtual water trading volume among counties is decided by the differing levels of competitiveness of the regional economies within the heihe river basin and the differing spatial availability of water resources cross region water resource flows and trading intensity indicate regional economic connections 4 3 simulation results regional water use policy can result in changes in economic development and in water resources consumption not only for areas within the heihe river basin but also for areas outside the basin in this study we simulate the impact of surface and groundwater price reforms on regional economic development within the basin water price reform has been an effective tool for saving water resources and improving water use productivity zhao et al 2015 the price of water in the heihe river basin is currently very low and water price reform has been piloted in gaotai county and minle county sun et al 2016 water price reform in these pilot counties will have a transmission effect to the other counties in the basin which corroborates the conceptual framework of multi scale iwrm modeling when interpreting the simulation results we highlight the impacts of water price reform on water and land usage and on economic growth measured by gdp change in terms of changes in percentage under the scenario of surface water price reform fig 7 left a surface water price increase of 5 in gaotai county would lead to a decrease in the gdp of that county of 1 2 and a decrease in the amount of surface water resource used of 4 28 simultaneously the amount of groundwater used would increase by around 7 given the values of substitution elasticity between land and water that we estimated for different counties land rent would increase by 1 2 for gaotai county however for the geographically close counties of ganzhou county and linze county the available groundwater amount would decrease because the flow of groundwater is connected for these counties and the groundwater use amount for gaotai county would increase consequently the gdp of ganzhou county would decline by around 0 43 owing to the decrease in the available groundwater amount in contrast surface water price reform would have a positive impact on economic growth for the other counties within the heihe river basin suzhou county which has an industrial structure similar to that of gaotai county would be substantially affected because of the negative impact of surface water price reform on gaotai county the production of isostructural industries in suzhou county would increase in turn resulting in the flow of labor and capital into suzhou county under the scenario of groundwater price reform fig 7 right a groundwater price increase of 5 in gaotai county would have a positive impact on economic growth for all counties except gaotai county itself the amount of surface water used would increase in gaotai county which would lower land rent for this county by around 0 2 water resources would be reallocated under the change in water demand from economic development the biggest positive impact would still occur in suzhou county on account of its similar industrial structure to that of gaotai county although certain issues in the allocation of water resources can be tackled with the proposed multi scale sewc model there are other more far reaching problems yet to be further examined for example only some of the numerous factors that result in water resources pressure were taken into close consideration in the present study moreover the sewc model cannot address temporal variation sufficiently for tracing the seasonal dynamics of water resources besides there is currently an intense debate on ecological water demand and consumption various studies including the present one have made the assumption that ecological water consumption could be regarded as an external constraint when allocating water resources however ecological water demand is also determined by the economic system in this regard we need to improve the estimation of ecological water demand and consumption more accurately to link with the economic system in addition better simulations of future land use will make the eco hydrological part of the proposed integrated model more accurate in capturing the laws of natural water cycling 5 conclusion the proposed multi scale model considering irrigation area county and river basin scales aims to better understand the complicated water use behaviors of social economic agents in responding to changes in water resources in a river basin the flow of water resources does not conform to administrative borders but to physical basin boundaries therefore this study applied the multi region input output table for the heihe river basin as the primary data which made possible the analysis of water flows both within the river basin and outside it at the county level water demand is linked to different industries and can be reallocated optimally based on the modeling results at the irrigation area level specifically for the agricultural sector planting structure can be determined by the restriction of water resource availability and the demand of increasing farmers incomes the socio economic water cycling sewc model pays close attention to the water resources management from the demand side water productivity and water use efficiency integrating biophysical and economic data into modeling approaches remains one of the main challenges for and key aspects of multiple scale sewc modeling socio economic models including sewc model are required to adopt temporal resolutions sufficient for tracing the seasonal dynamics of water resources in the future in addition such models need to take into consideration water rights transfers crop prices subsidies and agricultural production costs amongst others the modeling framework adopted in the present study and applied to the heihe river basin case study have shown the highly complex nature of water resources management as demonstrated by water supply demand relationships with inherent links to trade conditions institutional factors economic structure and agricultural irrigation requirements the multi scale sewc model contributes significantly to understanding complicated water use behaviors at various scales including the irrigation area county and river basin scales and thus for optimally allocating water resources among the various competing demands it is worth emphasizing that this study innovatively identified the spatial variation of the substitute elasticity of land and water resources at the river basin scale moreover different to the previous studies we considered water and land resources as primary input factors for the industrial production usually for agricultural production the results can shed light on generating feasible industrial transformation schemes according to in situ resources endowment focusing to the case study area the heihe river basin there are relatively abundant land resource and scarce water resource water scarcity land resource competition and environmental degradation bring about severe problems for resource managers taking substitute elasticity of land and water resources into consideration integrated management of water and land resources should be implemented among different industrial sectors and sub regions within the basin the rapid industrialization has become a significant factor of water consumption it is imperative for integrated water and land resources management in this basin to allocate water quota among different industrial sectors and promote water productivity for each sector for example in the county that substitute elasticity of water and land resources is relatively low the expansion of cultivated land should be limited because water productivity of agriculture production is relatively low comparing to manufacturing industry water administrative authorities also should strengthen water management measures to implement strict measures of total quantity control and water use efficiency improvement acknowledgements this research is financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 41671526

25162,water resources are an essential and determining factor for food production ecosystem health and socio economic development the socio economic water cycling system is a complex adaptive system changes in the socio economic system at the macro level such as industrial transformation technical progress and water price reform will have impacts on water resources utilization at the micro level in this study we applied the multi region computable general equilibrium theory to build a multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model for analyzing the impacts of water price reform water reallocation schemes and industrialization processes on water resources utilization with particular attention being placed on the water land nexus importantly the key parameters for constructing this multiple scale sewc model such as the relationships between water and land resources vary spatially across multiple levels i e the levels of river basin county and irrigation area we therefore innovatively considered and estimated the key parameters firstly and then integrated them into the model to achieve more reliable simulation results taking the heihe river basin as an empirical example the simulated results show that a 5 increase in both the surface water price and the groundwater price in gaotai county would lead to a differing extent of the economic impact among the other counties consequently an appropriate allocation scheme of water resources according to the levels of irrigation area county and the heihe river basin is imperative if water utilization pressure is to be mitigated within the entire river basin keywords socio economic water cycling model framework interactions across scales water land nexus 1 introduction water is directly and tightly linked to the development of the global economy to regional eco environment health and to human wellbeing water security water use efficiency and water productivity are key concerns of integrated water resource management in arid and semi arid inland river basins bakker 2012 cook and bakker 2012 harmancioglu et al 2013 water resource managers focus on different perspectives at the multiple spatial levels of river basin county irrigation area and even individual water users world water assessment programme wwap 2015 socio economic water cycling refers to the utilization and transfer of water resources in the socio economic system the systematic and comprehensive analysis of multiple scale socio economic water cycling can go beyond physical availability and boundaries of water resources whereby water resources can be reallocated within the entire river basin to achieve regional synergetic development according to rational industrial structure and layout the multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model attempts to optimize surface water and groundwater across economic ecological and livelihood utilizations under the constraint of outside in water resource availability of a river basin traditional economic models focused mainly on the economic value of water consuming products and ignored the ecological and environmental cost of depleting natural resources however two decades ago the global water partnership gwp proposed the integrated water resources management iwrm model for transferring the conventional segmented sectoral water resource management mode to a cross sectoral management style at the catchment scale gwp 2004 an iwrm system contains multiple complicated scales of water administrative boundaries gastelum et al 2009 giupponi and sgobbi 2013 iwrm aims to promote sustainable development and water resources management to maximize human wellbeing without compromising vital ecosystem services the gwp initiated a framework of holistic water resources management that considers multiple stakeholders such as individual users administrative agencies and policy makers under the guidance of this state of the art framework more concrete and representative applications and practices should be performed at various interconnected governmental sectoral and geographical levels lautenbach et al 2009 manos et al 2010 water and land are essential production elements in generating economic development and primary natural factors controlling the type and extent of hydrological processes the level of socio economic development is restricted by how much land and water resources are available both locally and regionally fao 2011 chen et al 2018 especially the water and land resources do not match which determines that the development of agriculture relies on the water resources on a large scale in arid and semi arid inland river basins wu et al 2015 human disturbance and associated land use changes are known to alter hydrological processes through numerous complex pathways strayer et al 2003 townsend et al 2003 for example irrigation activities have become the most important factor in reducing stream flows and in increasing the interaction between groundwater and surface water grafton et al 2013 with rapid urbanization during the last several decades more than 50 of the world s population now lives in cities un desa 2010 the rapid increase in urban water demand therefore arises from growing urban populations and greater economic activity in cities furthermore urbanization brings about an impervious surface sprawl which alters the hydrological processes of floodplains and of rivers the interaction between socio economic water use and natural water cycling processes calls for a multiple scale socio economic water cycling sewc model with positive and negative feedbacks from hydrological process at both the spatial and temporal dimensions hydro economic models are able to integrate hydrological cycling socio economic development water management and ecological and environmental issues in one comprehensive framework for reallocating water resources to high value uses and for increasing water use productivity andreu et al 1996 such models capture the diverse relationships between ecology and economy to better address climate related hydrological questions as well as economic and social issues in a comprehensive water system brouwer and hofkes 2008 to analyze the water security of a river basin the real time water quantity should be estimated by using several distributed and semi distributed hydrological models such as modflow modular three dimensional finite difference ground water flow mode and swat soil water assessment tool these hydrological parameters such as rate of flow water quantity available are regarded as the key variables to transfer into and link with the economic model one of the most critical obstacles for hydro economic models to overcome is the significant difference in the spatial and temporal scales between socio economic models and hydrological models de fraiture 2007 as a result only a few models have been proposed that coordinate water demand and assess the impact of water resource changes on economic growth across multiple spatial scales in an integrated conceptual framework cai 2008 the integrated multiple scale sewc model intends to offer a more comprehensive vision of the economic and social consequences of water management for various water use agents such as households farms and business firms this comprehensive model consequently provides a useful instrument for optimizing the allocation of water resources in summary a multiple scale sewc model aims to facilitate the efficient and effective integrated management of water resources and should consider the multiple interdependent water use agents across multiple spatial scales the sewc model also incorporates the spatial variation of land and water resource endowment and relations the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 reviews research progress on the integrated models of hydrological economic water cycling section 3 sets up the framework of the proposed model and analyzes the feedback mechanisms across multiple spatial scales section 4 provides a case study of the model s application section 5 concludes the study presenting the major findings based on the model s construction and application 2 literature review on integrated models of hydrological economic water cycling the global water system project studies interactions between basin scale processes and global influences such as climate change and global trade as part of its global catchment initiative hydro economic modeling platforms have also been widely used to address global water security questions de fraiture 2007 rosegrant et al 2002 and to tackle complex multi level water management issues in a number of basin locations around the world including in france lanini et al 2004 the us california jenkins et al 2004 australia mainuddin et al 2007 northern china guan and hubacek 2008 western africa ahrends et al 2008 and brazil maneta et al 2009 thorough reviews of hydro economic modeling applications include those of ward et al 2006 and heinz et al 2007 on catchment scale models and that of harou et al 2009 on water allocation models various authors have described methodological issues related to linking hydrological and economic systems including mckinney 1999 heinz et al 2007 harou et al 2009 and brouwer and hofkes 2008 the cascade modeling approach using path analysis was adopted to study the lake naivasha basin odongo et al 2014 alternatives to cascade modeling would be process based models e g agent based models or system dynamics models that account for relevant feedback mechanisms compared with the aforementioned models the socio economic models pay more attention to the optimal production and consumption model based on continuous growth and increasing resource throughput such models include linear programming models input output models partial general equilibrium models and computable general equilibrium cge models for example crop models for multi objective constrained optimization of irrigation strategies are used to improve water use efficiency among agricultural sectors letcher et al 2007 the cge model has been used in a wide range of studies related to water resource management some of these studies include the allocation of surface irrigation water to make economic growth diao et al 2005 the effects of groundwater resource regulations on agricultural and non agricultural sectors diao et al 2008 allowable water withdrawals under different water management scenarios calzadilla et al 2010 and improvements in irrigation management to alleviate water scarcity calzadilla et al 2011 hydrological economic models commonly use artificial neural networks for exploratory data analysis of high dimensional multivariate datasets however such models encounter limitations when dealing with highly nonlinear patterns water resources are affected by climate change and human intervention at multiple scales changing climate demographics and economic demands add to the challenge by presenting a moving target cohesive planning and integrated management for sustainable water resources will require continual co development of knowledge and problem solutions in the process of coupling the physical and socio economic domains however the limitations of hydro economic models have been extensively discussed by many researchers mckinney 1999 maneta et al 2009 harou et al 2009 who identify a number of methodological challenges mostly related to the different spatial temporal scales of the hydrologic and economic models generally hydrologic models are delimited by geographical borders and refer to periods of days or climatic seasons whereas economic models are bounded in many cases by administrative boundaries and use longer time horizons based on annual periods there are relatively few hydro economic models that include top down constrained adaptation and bottom up optimized conduction across multiple scales even though there exist a few estimates of the non market value of water resources for socio economic use shabman and stephenson 2000 although not entirely uncontroversial economic valuation techniques can be used to estimate non market values so that such values can be incorporated into decision making notwithstanding the above hydro economic models have been used for several decades by engineers and economists to support water management decisions however there are few models that incorporate the effects of water management changes on non market intangible values provided by ecosystems harmancioglu et al 2013 sustainable development requires balanced and simultaneous consideration of the economic environmental technological and social aspects of an economy sector or individual industrial process as well as of the interactions among all these aspects however before we optimize and allocate water use we need to know the links between the ecological hydrological and economic domains and the effects of their coupling on humans only then can we formalize a river basin management plan and design policy instruments in either the physical or social realms a water allocation substitution module that balances specific water supplies and demands should be based on agreed supply priorities which are decided on the basis of water security use efficiencies and equality some hydro economic models use the system approach involving an evaluation of the economic costs and benefits for different water allocation and substitution scenarios elements of which are isolated and then linked with one another letcher et al 2007 in system models the equations of relationships between the socio economic and hydrological domains need to be constructed and parameters then observed changes in land use and in land cover act are a mirror of socio economic development and of ecosystem change as demand has increased for water resources land use and land cover change models have been coupled to hydro economic models to estimate the impact of socio economic development on stream flows and stormwater runoff townsend et al 2003 odongo et al 2014 in a typical hydro economic model water extraction infrastructure is linked to the hydrologic features of a system in a node link network where economic costs and benefits are generated by water use and production activities we regard the node link network as a suitable tool to express the regional trade flow and water flow in a river basin and therefore the present study integrates the water land and socio economic domains in a node link network 3 framework of the proposed multiple scale socio economic water cycling model multiple scale socio economic water cycling can be considered as a closed system across the scales of river basin county and irrigation area using such a systemic approach allows us to investigate alternatives for improving the water allocation process for increasing water efficiencies and for promoting water productivity how to allocate water resources among multiple regions is the vital component to guaranteeing water security in order to balance water distribution between ecology and economy and also within the related economies at the river basin scale the water security of a river basin is threatened by climate change and by changes in regional trade conditions water resource allocation reallocation among multiple industries is the key to achieving water use efficiency and balancing economic development with ecological safety at the county level generally the agricultural sector is the primary user of water in a county increasing water productivity in the agricultural sector involves optimal decision making regarding the planting structure in the irrigation area of interest the multi region cge model can be used at the basin and county levels to analyze the impacts of water price reform water reallocation and industrialization on regional water use and economy the partial general equilibrium model can be used to allocate the water resource among the irrigated areas according to the crop pattern irrigation rate and other agricultural parameters inputs the key technique is to group into the county level model and the irrigation area model which will be the core of the system for promoting water productivity and improving water use efficiency by water price reform and water reallocation by utilizing a multiple scale model at the river basin county and water user scales we are able to analyze not only the top down impact of exogenous variables on water allocation but also the effect of bottom up water use behaviors table 1 in this way we offer a new perspective on integrated water resource management table 1 the multiple scale sewc model fig 1 considers hydrological processes and the water demand of the socio economic system land use change is vital for assessing the major economic drivers of changes in water demand and the impact of these changes on hydrological processes in addition economic factors dictate how land is used regionally as well as locally and how much water is needed the scarcity of land and or water will act to constrain economic development coordinated and orderly water and land resource system is vital to ensure the social economic development therefore the elasticity of substitution between land and water will change according to resource scarcity the pace of economic development and population density the socio economic system can be affected by some policies but eco hydrology can be impact by climate change a key feature of the model is its ability to handle a large number of regions or sectors in a framework this section describes the production functions and key components of the economic model that is adopted in the multi scale sewc model at the basin scale we consider industry q d where q refers to the industry s water demand and d refers to the industry s region with respect to the basin scale the variables for the model consist of matrices of water flow values dimensioned by commodity industry production region and water use region the virtual water flow is also recorded in matrices producers choose a cost minimizing combination of intermediate and primary factor inputs subject to production functions that are structured by a series of leontief assumptions and constant elasticity of substitution ces nesting assumptions fig 2 the primary factor aggregate is a ces composite of labor and a capital aggregate with the latter itself being a ces composite of land water and other capital the aggregate intermediate input is again a ces composite of different commodity composites which are in turn ces composites of commodities from different sources industry outputs are transformed into commodity outputs via a constant elasity of transformation cet mechanism because we use the multi region cge model for the heihe river basin combined with the eco hydrological model the spatially explicit water supply and demand at the county level can be identified we then use the partial equilibrium model to estimate the water demand of each land parcel and arrive at a water allocation scheme at the land parcel level by doing this the water flow in each irrigation section can be quantified to assist the individuals and organizations that are responsible for the integrated water management the rigorous assumptions and data requirements in the cge model need to be considered as in previous studies wu et al 2015 the economic output per unit water resource was used as the indicator for estimating water use efficiency it was assumed that water security and water utilization efficiency will be augmented if the water resource is reasonably allocated in a diverse manner to crops multiple industrial sectors and different jurisdictions the sectors use various combination of labor capital land water and other intermediate inputs table 2 since water rights transfers among the sectors and rural land transfers in the agricultural sector apply the land and water resources can change between sectors as shown in fig 2 the production technology in a particular sector is represented by a quadruple nested production function first producers combine irrigated land and irrigated water via a ces function to produce an irrigated land aggregate at the irrigation area scale we deduced the substitute elasticity of irrigated land and irrigated water the eqs 1 3 were used to express the principal of elasticity parameter for water and land resources specifically this study selected the translog production function to estimate the elasticity parameter a detailed estimation process regarding the substitute elasticity of land and water resources can be found in widawskya et al 1998 second dry land irrigated land and pastureland are combined with a ces function to produce a cultivated land aggregate meanwhile the land and water used by industries are combined via the leontief function to produce the industrial land aggregate then in the third level the industrial land and irrigated land are combined to produce the land and water aggregate following this the land and water aggregate is combined with the primary factors and intermediate input to produce an output via a leontief function that expresses a production process in county r finally the output value in county r is transformed to the water use value in other counties or outside of the river basin via margins and a cet mechanism 1 σ w l n d w l n w l n d m p w m p l n m p w m p l n 2 m p w m p l n y w y l n η w η l n l n w 3 σ w l n d w l n d m p w m p l n η l n η w η l n η w d η l

of land and water resources a very low value of elasticity in the quadruple nested production function means that there is little substitutability between the water and land inputs even if the price of water rises significantly the ratio of inputs use remains relatively unchanged the elasticity affects the way in which an industry reacts to the increased scarcity of water and thus to the increased price of water a higher elasticity of substitution means that farms can more readily move to those inputs that are cheaper consequently as the quantities of water used in production fall the output of a farm can readily be maintained by increasing the intensity of land use 4 an example of model application 4 1 study area the heihe river basin of northwestern china is located within arid and semi arid climatic regions fig 3 where evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation in the heihe river basin water supply hardly meets overall demand the extensive exploitation of water resources in the middle reach of the heihe river has resulted in distinct ecological damage in the downstream reach cheng et al 2006 water supply is derived mainly from the upstream runoff and groundwater in this river basin and it is used principally for ecological domestic industrial and agricultural irrigation purposes li et al 2001 water use has already approached or exceeded its sustainable threshold wang et al 2009 in the context of climate change and the rapid economic growth being experienced this region water scarcity is becoming an increasingly serious issue and consequently it is imperative to mitigate the contradiction between water demand and supply the heihe river basin covers 11 counties with various industrial structure and water use efficiencies for each industry table 3 agriculture steel food processing and electricity are the dominant industries and major water consumption sectors in the basin in particular agriculture is still the largest water consuming sector in the basin accounting for more than 90 of total water consumption the counties of ganzhou jiayuguan suzhou gaotai linze and jinta are the most important counties because they have the greatest areas under irrigation and consume 80 of the total water resource in the heihe river basin the average water productivity for all industrial sectors in the heihe river basin is approximately 15 chinese yuan m3 lower than the national average however increasing water productivity requires systematic thinking to regulate and optimize water usage amount at the various levels such as individual crops within an irrigation area industrial sectors within a county and counties with industries within and even outside of the river basin for example at the level of industrial sectors water transfers between different industries within a county such as from agriculture to manufacturing sectors has been shown to be a good choice for improving water productivity although with some negative effects celio et al 2010 levine et al 2007 exporting grain products from the heihe river basin to other areas in china results in virtual water being transferred from a region of water scarcity to economically developed regions and is an example of a water resources regulation strategy consequently an appropriate and comprehensive scheme for allocating water resources among various stakeholders at multiple levels is imperative if water demand is to be met for the entire river basin various studies have examined the trends in temperature precipitation li et al 2010 and potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2009 as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of both green and blue water flows zang et al 2012 in the heihe river basin or its sub basins however the integrated management of water resources at multiple scales using a cohesive system has been under examined and the food water land nexus has not been considered to date from the perspective of actual water using the network of the river basin fig 4 illustrates the branches of the heihe river and different water use nodes corroborating the necessity of taking into consideration multi scale water resource management by stakeholders and administrators the liyuan river is one of the branches of the heihe river both the heihe and liyuan rivers provide water for the 14 irrigation areas and 11 counties in the basin fig 4 with 81 7 of the total water supply being provided by the heihe river and the rest 18 3 by the liyuan river li et al 2001 in addition the intra regional trade embedded in the water flow tightens the regional linkages within a complicated system in summary the heihe river basin is a case in point to which the proposed integrated and multi scale water resources management framework and model can be applied 4 2 estimation of model parameters water and land resources are two primary factors for agricultural and industrial production the elasticity of substitution between land and water reflects the matching and substitutional relationships between these two primary natural resources for different levels of geographical region irrigation areas and counties the elasticity parameter thus indicates the degree of unsubstitutability and scarcity of a single resource for agricultural production consequently it is the key parameter for the integrated multi scale water resources management model the smaller the substitution elasticity the more important less able to be substituted is the water resource for agricultural production given a certain quantity of land resource for the region of interest the size of the irrigation area is determined by the amount of water resources available fig 5 the central irrigation area has an elasticity of substitution between water and land of approximately 0 9 this central area has a relatively dense population and a small proportion of land occupied by agriculture for this area the elasticity between land and water resources is relatively high which indicates that the substitution between the two kinds of resources is relatively flexible in other words the scarcity of a single resource is not that serious for this area in contrast the values of substitution elasticity for the marginal irrigation areas are less than 0 25 which means that any kind of resource whether water or land is an indispensable factor for agricultural production in these marginal irrigation areas most of these marginal irrigation areas are agriculture dominated regions however water availability is not sufficient for these areas therefore optimizing water allocation between different crops for these irrigation areas with low substitution elasticity between land and water resources is of primary concern to improve water productivity for a particular irrigation area the promotion of water saving technologies the adjustment of planting structure and the modification of household water use behaviors will all affect water productivity in particular adjusting farming layout through promoting the seed production of hybrid maize miscellaneous grain crops potatoes and sea buckthorn might be an effective and feasible way to improve water productivity at the county level the estimation results show that the more economically developed counties are characterized by higher values of substitution elasticity between water and land fig 6 for example the substitution elasticity between water and land is more than 0 6 for jiayuguan city jiayuguan is the most developed city in the midstream reach of the heihe river basin being an industrial city producing steel and other metal products suzhou county and ganzhou district have the second highest values of substitution elasticity suzhou county is developing an equipment manufacturing industry focusing on wind energy and ganzhou district is a core zone of zhangye city another economically developed city for most of the other counties in the heihe river basin agriculture is the dominant activity producing maize seed exporting it to regions outside the heihe basin and selling it to local markets is the major business for these counties counties in both the upstream and downstream reaches of the river basin depend on animal husbandry for their livelihoods in the midstream part of the river basin the tourist industry is a rapidly growing sector for these counties that agricultural sectors are the dominant industries the substitution elasticity is relative low meaning that the same economic output can be obtained from different input combinations of land water labor capital and other intermediate inputs one of the reasons why the more economically developed counties have high substitution elasticity values is that these counties are able to expend more effort into instituting water saving technologies and consequently have more available water saved to achieve higher outputs that is to say water and land constraints are not as strict for these economically developed counties compared with other counties importantly the unbalanced economic development among different counties produces the distinct elasticity differentials among these same counties which results in a clear pattern of virtual water trading within the basin the basic pattern of net virtual water trading volume among counties is decided by the differing levels of competitiveness of the regional economies within the heihe river basin and the differing spatial availability of water resources cross region water resource flows and trading intensity indicate regional economic connections 4 3 simulation results regional water use policy can result in changes in economic development and in water resources consumption not only for areas within the heihe river basin but also for areas outside the basin in this study we simulate the impact of surface and groundwater price reforms on regional economic development within the basin water price reform has been an effective tool for saving water resources and improving water use productivity zhao et al 2015 the price of water in the heihe river basin is currently very low and water price reform has been piloted in gaotai county and minle county sun et al 2016 water price reform in these pilot counties will have a transmission effect to the other counties in the basin which corroborates the conceptual framework of multi scale iwrm modeling when interpreting the simulation results we highlight the impacts of water price reform on water and land usage and on economic growth measured by gdp change in terms of changes in percentage under the scenario of surface water price reform fig 7 left a surface water price increase of 5 in gaotai county would lead to a decrease in the gdp of that county of 1 2 and a decrease in the amount of surface water resource used of 4 28 simultaneously the amount of groundwater used would increase by around 7 given the values of substitution elasticity between land and water that we estimated for different counties land rent would increase by 1 2 for gaotai county however for the geographically close counties of ganzhou county and linze county the available groundwater amount would decrease because the flow of groundwater is connected for these counties and the groundwater use amount for gaotai county would increase consequently the gdp of ganzhou county would decline by around 0 43 owing to the decrease in the available groundwater amount in contrast surface water price reform would have a positive impact on economic growth for the other counties within the heihe river basin suzhou county which has an industrial structure similar to that of gaotai county would be substantially affected because of the negative impact of surface water price reform on gaotai county the production of isostructural industries in suzhou county would increase in turn resulting in the flow of labor and capital into suzhou county under the scenario of groundwater price reform fig 7 right a groundwater price increase of 5 in gaotai county would have a positive impact on economic growth for all counties except gaotai county itself the amount of surface water used would increase in gaotai county which would lower land rent for this county by around 0 2 water resources would be reallocated under the change in water demand from economic development the biggest positive impact would still occur in suzhou county on account of its similar industrial structure to that of gaotai county although certain issues in the allocation of water resources can be tackled with the proposed multi scale sewc model there are other more far reaching problems yet to be further examined for example only some of the numerous factors that result in water resources pressure were taken into close consideration in the present study moreover the sewc model cannot address temporal variation sufficiently for tracing the seasonal dynamics of water resources besides there is currently an intense debate on ecological water demand and consumption various studies including the present one have made the assumption that ecological water consumption could be regarded as an external constraint when allocating water resources however ecological water demand is also determined by the economic system in this regard we need to improve the estimation of ecological water demand and consumption more accurately to link with the economic system in addition better simulations of future land use will make the eco hydrological part of the proposed integrated model more accurate in capturing the laws of natural water cycling 5 conclusion the proposed multi scale model considering irrigation area county and river basin scales aims to better understand the complicated water use behaviors of social economic agents in responding to changes in water resources in a river basin the flow of water resources does not conform to administrative borders but to physical basin boundaries therefore this study applied the multi region input output table for the heihe river basin as the primary data which made possible the analysis of water flows both within the river basin and outside it at the county level water demand is linked to different industries and can be reallocated optimally based on the modeling results at the irrigation area level specifically for the agricultural sector planting structure can be determined by the restriction of water resource availability and the demand of increasing farmers incomes the socio economic water cycling sewc model pays close attention to the water resources management from the demand side water productivity and water use efficiency integrating biophysical and economic data into modeling approaches remains one of the main challenges for and key aspects of multiple scale sewc modeling socio economic models including sewc model are required to adopt temporal resolutions sufficient for tracing the seasonal dynamics of water resources in the future in addition such models need to take into consideration water rights transfers crop prices subsidies and agricultural production costs amongst others the modeling framework adopted in the present study and applied to the heihe river basin case study have shown the highly complex nature of water resources management as demonstrated by water supply demand relationships with inherent links to trade conditions institutional factors economic structure and agricultural irrigation requirements the multi scale sewc model contributes significantly to understanding complicated water use behaviors at various scales including the irrigation area county and river basin scales and thus for optimally allocating water resources among the various competing demands it is worth emphasizing that this study innovatively identified the spatial variation of the substitute elasticity of land and water resources at the river basin scale moreover different to the previous studies we considered water and land resources as primary input factors for the industrial production usually for agricultural production the results can shed light on generating feasible industrial transformation schemes according to in situ resources endowment focusing to the case study area the heihe river basin there are relatively abundant land resource and scarce water resource water scarcity land resource competition and environmental degradation bring about severe problems for resource managers taking substitute elasticity of land and water resources into consideration integrated management of water and land resources should be implemented among different industrial sectors and sub regions within the basin the rapid industrialization has become a significant factor of water consumption it is imperative for integrated water and land resources management in this basin to allocate water quota among different industrial sectors and promote water productivity for each sector for example in the county that substitute elasticity of water and land resources is relatively low the expansion of cultivated land should be limited because water productivity of agriculture production is relatively low comparing to manufacturing industry water administrative authorities also should strengthen water management measures to implement strict measures of total quantity control and water use efficiency improvement acknowledgements this research is financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 41671526

25163,under the background of rapid population growth achieving accurate assessments of crop yields is critical to national policy adjustment and food security among all the evaluation methods for crop yields the environmental policy integrated climate epic model is considered to be an effective tool since published it has been widely applied on local regional and global scales however in its practical applications the impact of scale variation on the simulation results has not received full consideration the scale variation can introduce many uncertain effects in the simulation results furthermore as a basis for parameter calibration parameters sensitivity analyses were always been ignored at large scale studies in this study we used the gis based epic gepic model to assess the simulation accuracies at different scales and local sensitivity analysis was adopted to analyze the sensitivity of the crop parameters in each grid first time the results showed that epic model has scale dependence and the smaller the scale is the more accurate the results are the most sensitive parameter of maize and soybeans is the energy conversion to biomass factor wa in the agro pastoral transitional zone of north china whereas the harvest index hi is the most sensitive parameter for the three other crops of rice spring wheat and winter wheat for the same crop parameter sensitivity is heterogeneous in space due to varied input variables in addition we find that parameters sensitivities si vary as the parameters and the variations in si for the five parameters are different excluding the si of hi for spring wheat which has the greatest change and the variation is nearly 0 5 the si of other parameters change slightly in the application of gepic model we should consider the effects of scale variation on crop yields particular for areas with high heterogeneity of cropland patches in addition this study provides a reference for setting the input parameters of the epic model keywords biophysical parameters spatial heterogeneity crop yields accuracy assessment 1 introduction food production is an important guarantee for food security and a cornerstone for ensuring the country s rapid economic development and social stability qi et al 2015 ye et al 2013 in the past four decades grain output has doubled and now exceeded 2 billion tons per year foley et al 2005 the marked increase in food production reduced the proportion of hungry people nevertheless more than one in seven people still hasn t enough food to meet daily needs and are under food insecurity fao 2009 in the future increases in population nearly 9 billion people at the midcentury and associated increases in the demand for high quality food e g meat eggs fish and dairy have put forward new requirements for food production making food security faced with more serious challenges godfray et al 2010 schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 in this case how to achieve accurate assessment of grain yield and accurately simulate the dynamic change of grain yield is of vital importance for assisting national decision making and ensuring food security among all crop yields evaluation methods particularly in predicting future crop yields crop models are essential tools rosenzweig et al 2014 crop model refers to an agricultural mathematical model that can quantitatively and dynamically describe the processes of crop growth harvest and its response to the environment thomson et al 2006 xiong et al 2007 it can depict the physiological and ecological processes of crop growth respiration photosynthesis organic distribution evapotranspiration water and nutrient uptake etc and reflect the effect of sunlight temperature water etc on crop growth qiao et al 2017a crop models have mechanism systematisms universality and are scientific tools for research of sustainable and precision agriculture xiong et al 2014 to date a variety of crop models has been developed including wofost epic dssat and apsim among these models the epic model is one of the most widely applied tools in the yield estimation community because it can evaluate the impacts of climatic and management factors on crop yields and provide adaption measures for optimizing agro ecosystem to ensure food security qiao et al 2018 yu et al 2018 in the epic model it assumes that climate variables soil types and agriculture management strategies are homogeneous for same crop within the research unit wang and li 2010 at the field scale izaurralde et al 2006 simulated soil c dynamics varied as crop tillage practice conventional and conservational and erosion processes in order to apply the epic model at the regional scale saarikko 2000 developed an approach of scaling for the crop model the simulation results of all sites were averaged to represent the crop yield of the study area however the simulation accuracy depends on the number of sites and it could not explicitly represent the spatial pattern of crop yields tan and shibasaki 2003 integrated epic with gis geographic information system and ie inference engine and therefore the epic model could be applied to a broader scale based on the epic and gis gepic research work has been carried out recently qiao et al 2017b wu et al 2011 liu et al 2007b explored the relationship between wheat yields and crop water productivity with resolution of 50 50 km at a global scale it should be noted that the default grid size of the gepic model is 0 5 when applied at regional scales the spatial heterogeneity of crop distribution was largely omitted and the results cannot reflect the impacts of temperature precipitation soil heterogeneity etc on crop yields through the method of downscaling with a resolution higher than 0 5 the model can be better applied at regional scales however scale variations can bring uncertainties grafius et al 2016 previous studies set the research scale without considering the scale effects research on scale effects has been an important issue of ecology wu 2007 wu and qi 2000 in addition to the scale effects model sensitivity to input parameters is also of vital importance for the simulation of crop yields epic model is developed based on crop varieties and growing environment derived from field observations from the us williams et al 1989 when applied in other parts of the world we first need to analyze parameter sensitivity and calibrate model parameters such as local crop types meteorology and soil data etc for the examination of model sensitivity local and global sensitive analysis methods were commonly used to identify sensitive parameters wang et al 2005a 2005b using the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test method wang et al 2005a 2005b first analyzed the parameters sensitivity based on an experimental field in wisconsin and then identified the optimal parameter set to predict average yield and soc dynamics however at large scale studies parameter sensitivity were rarely been considered for each grid cell the parameters sensitivity is heterogeneous to achieve accurate assessment of crop yields it s necessary to analyze the parameter sensitivity and choose the optimal parameter combination to realize parameter localization for each grid cell it should be noted that examination of model sensitivity to different kinds of parameters requires large amount of calculation however this situation is changing in recent years with the above issues in mind we therefore analyzed scale dependent characteristics and model sensitivity of the epic model so as to provide references for the following research we choose the agro pastoral transitional zone of northern china aptz an important food production area in the nation as the study area our research objectives were to 1 evaluate the simulation results at different scales i e 5 km 10 km and 50 km and explore the effects of scale variation on simulated crop yields 2 analyze the spatial heterogeneity of parameters sensitivity e g wa hi and dmla etc for wheat maize soybeans and rice respectively 3 provide reference for the choice of scale and parameters calibration of the epic model 2 study area the aptz is located in northern china with a total area of 7 25 105 km2 fig 1 it spans more than 10 of latitude and covers parts of 10 provinces grasslands 41 8 and farmlands 32 9 are the dominant land use land cover types followed by forests 16 2 barren lands 5 5 urban and built up 2 1 and water bodies 1 6 the aptz is an important food provision area which accounted for 7 7 of china s total food production in 2010 china agricultural statistical yearbook 2010 therefore it is an ideal place to study the scale dependence and parameter sensitivity of the crop model the main crop types include wheat maize rice and soybean wheat is primarily distributed in southern portions while rice and soybean are mainly in northeastern aptz maize is scattered across the region the aptz is located in a semi arid continental temperate monsoon climate zone during growing seasons the average annual maximum temperature is 20 48 c and minimum temperature is 7 75 c from 1980 2010 precipitation is mainly in the northeast and relatively low in the southwestern region the average annual precipitation in growing seasons is 382 2 mm 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and processing the data used in this study are presented in table 2 while the statistical data for crop yield were used for model evaluation the rest nine different types of data were all required for the execution of gepic model specific data acquisition and processing are as follows 3 1 1 meteorological and soil data climate and soil are the most important data sets for running the gepic model the daily meteorological i e precipitation relative humidity wind speed solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature data for the period of 1980 to 2010 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn using the kriging interpolation technique we can acquire the meteorological data at different scales i e 5 10 and 50 km for each grid cell we should build a dly file for each of the meteorological elements presented above the soil data were provided by the cold and arid regions sciences data center http westdc westgis ac cn developed by fischer et al 2008 for each grid cell we should build a sol file that contains the soil general parameters and profile property in addition to the following parameters showed in table 1 the others set the default values in the epic model the default resolution of soil data is 10 km we adopted the commonly used nearest resample technique to acquire the soil data at different scales 3 1 2 agro meteorological data these kinds of data were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn including crop phenology information i e planting and harvest dates the crops planting and harvest dates for major crops of wheat maize rice and soybean within each city was recorded at the agro meteorological stations located in the city in this study we assumed that the crop planting and maturity dates were homogenous within a city due to the lack of crop phenology information in each grid 3 1 3 crop distribution data the geographic distribution of major crops was obtained from the institute of agricultural resources and regional planning liu et al 2015 with a spatial of resolution 10 km crop distribution map was developed based on crop area statistical data map of irrigation area spatial distribution data of cropland based on satellite remote sensing data global agro ecological zones gaez and population density data using a method of spam model http mapspam info you and

2010 haggblade et al 2009 nelson and robertson 2008 the grid cell value represents the sown area for corresponding crop types of wheat maize rice and soybean respectively 3 1 4 map of irrigation areas the global map of irrigation areas gmia with a resolution of 10 10 km was obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations siebert et al 2013 http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap it defines the percentage of irrigated and rain fed area in each grid to reduce data uncertainty we assumed that if the irrigation percentage in a grid cell was more than 10 percent the pixel was under irrigated condition neumann et al 2011 3 1 5 statistical data the statistical data used for model evaluation including crop statistical yields and fertilizer application rate at municipal prefecture scale which were derived from provincial statistical yearbook http cnki net statistical yields of wheat maize rice and soybean from 2005 to 2007 were used for model calibration and those from 2008 to 2010 were used for model validation in this study only nitrogenous n fertilizer was considered because it was of primary importance for crop growth compared with phosphorus p and potassium k 3 2 evaluation on epic model 3 2 1 evaluation on the scale dependence of epic model in the process of accuracy assessment the most commonly used indicators are the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and variance brun et al 2006 the unit of rmse is the same as the statistical yield rmse represents the difference between the simulated and statistical yields the smaller the value is the more accurate the simulation result is rrmse is another important indicator to assess the accuracy of the epic model an rrmse of less than 10 indicates the result is very good if rrmse is more than 10 and less than 20 the result is good in contrast if rrmse is greater than 30 the performance of the model is poor saltelli 2009 the variance measures the degree of dispersion between the simulated and statistical yields the higher the value is the more dispersed the simulation result is 1 r m s e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n 2 r r m s e r m s e 1 n i 1 n o b s i 3 v a r ie n c e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n obsi is the statistical yield simi is the simulated yield and n is the number of sampling points in this study n is equal to 102 3 2 2 sensitivity of crop parameters in the epic model parameters sensitivity analysis is an important part of the process of localizing and regionalizing the crop model wang et al 2005a 2005b wu et al 2009 it can provide reference for model application in the study area model sensitivity analysis methods include screening experiments local sensitivity analysis local sa and global sensitivity analysis global sa screening experiments qualitatively rank the importance of input parameters they do not quantitatively analyze the parameters sensitivity local sa considers only the impact of a single parameter on the model simulation result in the process of simulation the other parameters remain the same it is simple and easy to operate for the global sa we need to consider the impact of multiple changing parameters on the simulation results wu et al 2009 considering the computational capabilities integrated this study adopted the local sa method to analyze the parameters sensitivity of the epic model the local sa index is represented by the following equation 4 s i δ y δ x x y where si represents the impact of parameter x on the simulation result of y δx denotes the variation of parameter x and δy denotes the variation of y with parameter x there are many parameters which have effects on the crop yields based on previous studies huang et al 2006 wang et al 2012 five parameters wa hi dmla dlai and wsyf that are most sensitive to crop yields were chosen the parameter definitions are defined as follows wa is the energy conversion to biomass factor hi is the potential harvest index for a crop under ideal growing conditions dmla is the maximum potential leaf area index dlai is the fraction of the growing season when the leaf area declines and wsyf is the water stress yield factor williams 1990 parameter sensitivity was calculated in each grid cell then we calculated the average of parameter sensitivities in the whole region if si was equal to zero parameter changes had no impact on the simulation results otherwise parameter changes had an impact on the simulation results the higher the value is the higher the impact of parameter changes on the simulation results is however the crop parameters have specific agronomy meanings although the parameters vary with the crop growing environment and the management measures d andrea et al 2008 yang and zhang 2010 the variation of parameters cannot exceed their reasonable range in the process of parameters sensitivity analysis the default value and the ranges of the five parameters are shown in table 3 4 results 4 1 validation of epic model to validate the crop model we adopt methods used at the regional level liu et al 2007a xiong et al 2008 to compare the statistical yield with the simulated yield the yield in individual grids was aggregated into city averages using rmse rrmse and variance we tested the performance of the epic model fig 2 for wheat maize rice and soybeans the rmse were 0 57 t ha 0 91 t ha 0 99 t ha and 0 38 t ha respectively excluding the soybeans the rrmse of other three crops were more than 20 the value of variance for rice was higher than wheat maize and soybeans the trend lines of four crops were all close to the y x line and the r2 values were higher than 0 65 particularly for wheat its r2 value was higher than 0 8 4 2 scale dependence of epic model the input data were divided into three scales 0 5 s approximately equal to 50 km 0 1 approximately equal to 10 km and 0 05 s approximately equal to 5 km by the nearest resampling method using the gepic model maize yields at different scales were simulated the model performance was evaluated by the statistical yield the results are shown in fig 3 at the scale of 5 km rmse was equal to 0 86 t ha and rrmse was equal to 15 8 the variance was equal to 0 73 at the scale of 10 km rmse was equal to 0 91 t ha and rrmse was equal to 16 9 the variance was equal to 0 83 at the scale of 50 km rmse was equal to 1 01 t ha and rrmse was equal to 18 7 the variance was equal to 1 02 as the scale increased rmse rrmse and variance increased gradually meanwhile r2 declined from 0 79 to 0 73 the distance between the fitting trend line and line of y x increased as the scale increased in addition we analyzed the variance and found that its value changed from 0 73 to 1 02 thus the simulated and statistical results became more distributed thus the simulation results were worse with the scale increase the model performance at the three scales can be compared as follows 5 km 10 km 50 km the spatial pattern of the statistical and simulated yields of maize is shown in fig 4 by analyzing the spatial pattern of the statistical yield we found that the areas of high maize yield were distributed in the northeast of the aptz the areas of low maize yield were distributed in the southwest region by analyzing the spatial pattern of the simulated yield we found that the results at the three scales reflected the differences in maize yield in different regions however the simulation result at the scale of 5 km was more consistent with the statistical yield there was no significant difference between the simulation yield at 5 km fig 4b and 10 km scale fig 4c the model performance was better as the scale declined 4 3 sensitivity analysis of crop parameters the sensitivities of five major crop parameters that have important impacts on crop yield were analyzed table 4 the parameters include wa hi dlma dlai and wsyf we calculated the averages of the parameter sensitivities and the sensitivities of the parameters were all greater than zero in the aptz for the crops of maize and soybeans the most sensitivity parameter to crops yields was wa followed by wsyf for maize dlai was a relatively insensitive parameter and for soybeans dmla was relatively insensitive the most sensitive parameter for rice was hi in contrast the most insensitive parameter among the five parameters was wsyf spring wheat was most sensitive to hi followed by wa the most insensitive parameter was dmla in contrast for winter wheat the most sensitive parameter was hi and the most insensitive parameter was wsyf to explore how parameter sensitivity varied with parameters the values of parameters were taken from an interval between 0 8 times the default value x and 1 2 times x excluding the parameter wa for spring wheat and winter wheat the parameter hi for maize and the parameter dlai for soybeans to avoid outing of the parameters range listed in table 2 the value of parameter wa for spring wheat and winter wheat was taken from 0 9 x to 1 2 the values of parameter hi for maize and parameter dlai for soybeans were taken from 0 8 x to 1 1 for winter wheat fig 5 a the sensitivity indices si of all five parameters were greater than zero parameter sensitivity varied and the variations in si for the five parameters were different the si for parameters wa dmla and wsyf were relatively stable and the variation was less than 0 05 si increased with the parameter hi for parameter dlai it was first declined and then increased gradually for spring wheat fig 5b the sensitivity indexes of the five major parameters were all greater than zero excluding the si of parameter hi had a high fluctuation and the variation range was nearly 0 5 the other four parameters sensitivity had slight changes which were less than 0 05 there were no obvious changes for the si of the other four parameters in addition the variation of si for parameter hi was not stable for maize fig 5c the sensitivity indexes of the five major parameters were all greater than zero in addition we found that by excluding wa the si varied obviously for the other four parameters the si for parameters hi dmla and wsyf increased gradually in contrast the trend of si for parameter dlai declined as the parameter variation for rice fig 5d the si of the five parameters were all greater than zero by excluding wa the si of the other four parameters changed obviously and the variation ranges were higher than 0 2 the parameters sensitivity of hi dmla dlai and wsyf varied greatly at first and then tend to be relatively stable for soybeans fig 5e the sensitivity indexes of the five parameters were all greater than zero by excluding the parameter wa the si for other four parameters was relatively unstable however the variation ranges of si for parameters hi dmla dlai and wsyf had no obvious changes which were less than 0 2 the spatial patterns of the most sensitive parameters for wheat maize soybean and rice are shown in fig 6 for wheat the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was wa which accounted for 67 24 of the total planting area wa was followed by wsyf 23 02 hi 6 1 dlai 3 55 and dmla 0 1 for maize the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was dlai which accounted for 36 49 of the total planting area dlai was followed by wa 33 04 wsyf 18 27 hi 8 73 and dmla 3 47 for soybeans the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was hi which accounted for 67 14 of the total planting area hi was followed by wsyf 23 54 wa 8 38 dlai 0 95 and dmla 0 02 for rice the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was wa which accounted for 53 71 of the total planting area wa was followed by dlai 38 11 hi 5 18 wsyf 2 03 and dmla 0 98 excluding for maize the percentages of the most sensitive parameters for the other three crops were all more than 50 5 discussions our study analyzed the scale dependence and parameter sensitivity of the epic model scale dependence was existed and the accuracy of simulated yield increased with scale decrease parameters sensitivity presents two obvious characteristics it varied with parameter values as well as in space when comparing the simulation results with the statistical yields within each municipal unit we found that the simulated results of the epic model were lower than statistical yields for four major crops of wheat maize rice and soybean that is the simulated yields of epic model were underestimated this finding is consistent with that of wang and li 2010 and liu 2009 as to reasons fertilizer application rate and irrigation percentage in model settings may be less than actual agricultural production conditions ecological processes are by nature scale dependent grafius et al 2016 wu 2004 wu and qi 2000 however previous studies usually chose the spatial resolution based on the extent of study area and accessibility to computing resources the effects of scales on simulation results were largely ignored when scaling the model simulation from high to low resolution the spatial heterogeneity of cropland distribution meteorological variables and soil property etc between each grid cell were averaged and aggregated van der biest et al 2015 this may lead to loss of information due to aggregation error easterling et al 1998 on the contrary when scaling the model simulation from low to high resolution the grid cell will be partitioned into several parts uniformly this will reduce the spatial heterogeneity of input data e g soils fertilizer and meteorological information compared with the former the latter had less effects on simulation results this was the main reason why the difference of simulated yield between scale of 10 km and 5 km was small whereas that of 10 km and 50 km was large the spatial heterogeneity of the input data was the main reason for the scale dependent characteristics of the epic models easterling et al 1998 rastetter et al 1992 because of the limitation of the gepic model we could not investigate the scale effects of the gepic model finer than 5 km however our study had valuable implications for the better application of the epic model that is to consider the impacts of grid spacing on the simulated crop yields rather than merely regarding computing resources and time consumption this was especially true for regions with high spatial heterogeneity of cropland distribution for example the farmland fragmentation issue is seriously in china due to the farmland ownership fragmentation plots managed by one household are spatially separated and physical landscape fragmentation su et al 2014 wan and cheng 2001 therefore we can expect that the simulation results will be closer to the observed yields with the refinement of data resolution sensitivity analysis of the crop parameters was another important factor that should be considered in the application of the epic model compared with previous studies targeted on very few parameters at field experimental station huang et al 2006 wang et al 2012 we analyzed the sensitivities of parameters wa hi dlma dlai and wsyf at each grid cell for the first time the results showed that the most sensitive parameter for maize and soybeans in the aptz was wa while hi was the most sensitive parameter for rice spring wheat and winter wheat the most sensitive parameters varied in space mainly because of the heterogeneous input variables parameters sensitivity depends on many factors including crop types water stress and temperature stress etc wa represents the potential growth rate per unit of photosynthetically effective radiation therefore it has a large effect on all five crops yield hi was demonstrated to have a linear relation to crop yield regardless of water stress liu 2009 most sown areas of wheat and rice in the aptz were distributed in the irrigated areas and therefore water stress is rare during crop growth however when areas are under water stress the sensitivity index si of hi will decrease accordingly although the parameters of dmla dlai and wsyf had non negligible impacts on crop yields they were not the main parameters compared with wa and hi in the aptz in addition we found that the si of all five parameters were greater than zero the si varied with the parameters and the variations in si for the five parameters were different therefore it was necessary to consider the variation of si in parameters adjustment we also learned that the most sensitive parameter exhibited spatial heterogeneity for even the same crop type the main reason was that the input variables of meteorological elements soil types topography irrigation fertilizers and other variables varied largely in space this also illustrated why sensitivity analyses become an indispensable part in localization and regionalization of crop models wang et al 2005a 2005b the study of liu 2009 was consistent with our research when applying the epic model to simulate crop yields in different regions spatial heterogeneity will affect the accuracy of simulation results with the same parameter value therefore we should analyze parameter sensitivity based on regional meteorological soil property irrigation fertilization and terrain conditions in the application of the epic model on the whole this study could provide reference for related researches that carried out in regions where crop distribution present fragmentation in addition it also reminds us that we shouldn t merely consider computation resources and therefore ignore the sensitive analysis of parameters at large scale studies scale dependency of process based model is a bit more complex including also content accuracy and quality of the input data available at different scales and limitations this brings although the method of scale dependent analysis is relatively simple our study is helping to shed more light on model application and can be further explored in subsequent studies this is also an important direction of our future research work 6 conclusions as an ecological model epic can be integrated with topics in climate soil crops management technology etc it has been a main research approach for analyzing the impacts of climate change on crop yield food security and soil erosion however previous studies have ignored the impact of scale on the simulation results in the model application this study used a gis based epic model to analyze the scale dependence at three scales the results show that the epic model has scale dependence the simulation results varied with the study scale grain size the smaller the scale and the finer the input data the more accurate the simulated results are in the aptz for the five major crops of maize soybeans rice spring wheat and winter wheat the most sensitive parameter to crop yield varied for the five parameters wa and hi were the two most sensitive parameters and had larger impacts on crop yields in the aptz for the same crop the distribution of the most sensitive parameter had spatial heterogeneity in addition the impacts of the parameters on crop yields varied as the parameters therefore when using the epic model to study the crop productivity we should consider the impacts of scale variation and set the parameters as precisely as possible acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural

25163,under the background of rapid population growth achieving accurate assessments of crop yields is critical to national policy adjustment and food security among all the evaluation methods for crop yields the environmental policy integrated climate epic model is considered to be an effective tool since published it has been widely applied on local regional and global scales however in its practical applications the impact of scale variation on the simulation results has not received full consideration the scale variation can introduce many uncertain effects in the simulation results furthermore as a basis for parameter calibration parameters sensitivity analyses were always been ignored at large scale studies in this study we used the gis based epic gepic model to assess the simulation accuracies at different scales and local sensitivity analysis was adopted to analyze the sensitivity of the crop parameters in each grid first time the results showed that epic model has scale dependence and the smaller the scale is the more accurate the results are the most sensitive parameter of maize and soybeans is the energy conversion to biomass factor wa in the agro pastoral transitional zone of north china whereas the harvest index hi is the most sensitive parameter for the three other crops of rice spring wheat and winter wheat for the same crop parameter sensitivity is heterogeneous in space due to varied input variables in addition we find that parameters sensitivities si vary as the parameters and the variations in si for the five parameters are different excluding the si of hi for spring wheat which has the greatest change and the variation is nearly 0 5 the si of other parameters change slightly in the application of gepic model we should consider the effects of scale variation on crop yields particular for areas with high heterogeneity of cropland patches in addition this study provides a reference for setting the input parameters of the epic

total food production in 2010 china agricultural statistical yearbook 2010 therefore it is an ideal place to study the scale dependence and parameter sensitivity of the crop model the main crop types include wheat maize rice and soybean wheat is primarily distributed in southern portions while rice and soybean are mainly in northeastern aptz maize is scattered across the region the aptz is located in a semi arid continental temperate monsoon climate zone during growing seasons the average annual maximum temperature is 20 48 c and minimum temperature is 7 75 c from 1980 2010 precipitation is mainly in the northeast and relatively low in the southwestern region the average annual precipitation in growing seasons is 382 2 mm 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and processing the data used in this study are presented in table 2 while the statistical data for crop yield were used for model evaluation the rest nine different types of data were all required for the execution of gepic model specific data acquisition and processing are as follows 3 1 1 meteorological and soil data climate and soil are the most important data sets for running the gepic model the daily meteorological i e precipitation relative humidity wind speed solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature data for the period of 1980 to 2010 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn using the kriging interpolation technique we can acquire the meteorological data at different scales i e 5 10 and 50 km for each grid cell we should build a dly file for each of the meteorological elements presented above the soil data were provided by the cold and arid regions sciences data center http westdc westgis ac cn developed by fischer et al 2008 for each grid cell we should build a sol file that contains the soil general parameters and profile property in addition to the following parameters showed in table 1 the others set the default values in the epic model the default resolution of soil data is 10 km we adopted the commonly used nearest resample technique to acquire the soil data at different scales 3 1 2 agro meteorological data these kinds of data were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn including crop phenology information i e planting and harvest dates the crops planting and harvest dates for major crops of wheat maize rice and soybean within each city was recorded at the agro meteorological stations located in the city in this study we assumed that the crop planting and maturity dates were homogenous within a city due to the lack of crop phenology information in each grid 3 1 3 crop distribution data the geographic distribution of major crops was obtained from the institute of agricultural resources and regional planning liu et al 2015 with a spatial of resolution 10 km crop distribution map was developed based on crop area statistical data map of irrigation area spatial distribution data of cropland based on satellite remote sensing data global agro ecological zones gaez and population density data using a method of spam model http mapspam info you and wood 2006 which consists of information entropy distribution probability model and crop allocation optimization model to date the spam model has been widely applied all around the world gruère et al 2010 haggblade et al 2009 nelson and robertson 2008 the grid cell value represents the sown area for corresponding crop types of wheat maize rice and soybean respectively 3 1 4 map of irrigation areas the global map of irrigation areas gmia with a resolution of 10 10 km was obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations siebert et al 2013 http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap it defines the percentage of irrigated and rain fed area in each grid to reduce data uncertainty we assumed that if the irrigation percentage in a grid cell was more than 10 percent the pixel was under irrigated condition neumann et al 2011 3 1 5 statistical data the statistical data used for model evaluation including crop statistical yields and fertilizer application rate at municipal prefecture scale which were derived from provincial statistical yearbook http cnki net statistical yields of wheat maize rice and soybean from 2005 to 2007 were used for model calibration and those from 2008 to 2010 were used for model validation in this study only nitrogenous n fertilizer was considered because it was of primary importance for crop growth compared with phosphorus p and potassium k 3 2 evaluation on epic model 3 2 1 evaluation on the scale dependence of epic model in the process of accuracy assessment the most commonly used indicators are the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and variance brun et al 2006 the unit of rmse is the same as the statistical yield rmse represents the difference between the simulated and statistical yields the smaller the value is the more accurate the simulation result is rrmse is another important indicator to assess the accuracy of the epic model an rrmse of less than 10 indicates the result is very good if rrmse is more than 10 and less than 20 the result is good in contrast if rrmse is greater than 30 the performance of the model is poor saltelli 2009 the variance measures the degree of dispersion between the simulated and statistical yields the higher the value is the more dispersed the simulation result is 1 r m s e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n 2 r r m s e r m s e 1 n i 1 n o b s i 3 v a r ie n c e i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 n obsi is the statistical yield simi is the simulated yield and n is the number of sampling points in this study n is equal to 102 3 2 2 sensitivity of crop parameters in the epic model parameters sensitivity analysis is an important part of the process of localizing and regionalizing the crop model wang et al 2005a 2005b wu et al 2009 it can provide reference for model application in the study area model sensitivity analysis methods include screening experiments local sensitivity analysis local sa and global sensitivity analysis global sa screening experiments qualitatively rank the importance of input parameters they do not quantitatively analyze the parameters sensitivity local sa considers only the impact of a single parameter on the model simulation result in the process of simulation the other parameters remain the same it is simple and easy to operate for the global sa we need to consider the impact of multiple changing parameters on the simulation results wu et al 2009 considering the computational capabilities integrated this study adopted the local sa method to analyze the parameters sensitivity of the epic model the local sa index is represented by the following equation 4 s i δ y δ x x y where si represents the impact of parameter x on the simulation result of y δx denotes the variation of parameter x and δy denotes the variation of y with parameter x there are many parameters which have effects on the crop yields based on previous studies huang et al 2006 wang et al 2012 five parameters wa hi dmla dlai and wsyf that are most sensitive to crop yields were chosen the parameter definitions are defined as follows wa is the energy conversion to biomass factor hi is the potential harvest index for a crop under ideal growing conditions dmla is the maximum potential leaf area index dlai is the fraction of the growing season when the leaf area declines and wsyf is the water stress yield factor williams 1990 parameter sensitivity was calculated in each grid cell then we calculated the average of parameter sensitivities in the whole region if si was equal to zero parameter changes had no impact on the simulation results otherwise parameter changes had an impact on the simulation results the higher the value is the higher the impact of parameter changes on the simulation results is however the crop parameters have specific agronomy meanings although the parameters vary with the crop growing environment and the management measures d andrea et al 2008 yang and zhang 2010 the variation of parameters cannot exceed their reasonable range in the process of parameters sensitivity analysis the default value and the ranges of the five parameters are shown in table 3 4 results 4 1 validation of epic model to validate the crop model we adopt methods used at the regional level liu et al 2007a xiong et al 2008 to compare the statistical yield with the simulated yield the yield in individual grids was aggregated into city averages using rmse rrmse and variance we tested the performance of the epic model fig 2 for wheat maize rice and soybeans the rmse were 0 57 t ha 0 91 t ha 0 99 t ha and 0 38 t ha respectively excluding the soybeans the rrmse of other three crops were more than 20 the value of variance for rice was higher than wheat maize and soybeans the trend lines of four crops were all close to the y x line and the r2 values were higher than 0 65 particularly for wheat its r2 value was higher than 0 8 4 2 scale dependence of epic model the input data were divided into three scales 0 5 s approximately equal to 50 km 0 1 approximately equal to 10 km and 0 05 s approximately equal to 5 km by the nearest resampling method using the gepic model maize yields at different scales were simulated the model performance was evaluated by the statistical yield the results are shown in fig 3 at the scale of 5 km rmse was equal to 0 86 t ha and rrmse was equal to 15 8 the variance was equal to 0 73 at the scale of 10 km rmse was equal to 0 91 t ha and rrmse was equal to 16 9 the variance was equal to 0 83 at the scale of 50 km rmse was equal to 1 01 t ha and rrmse was equal to 18 7 the variance was equal to 1 02 as the scale increased rmse rrmse and variance increased gradually meanwhile r2 declined from 0 79 to 0 73 the distance between the fitting trend line and line of y x increased as the scale increased in addition we analyzed the variance and found that its value changed from 0 73 to 1 02 thus the simulated and statistical results became more distributed thus the simulation results were worse with the scale increase the model performance at the three scales can be compared as follows 5 km 10 km 50 km the spatial pattern of the statistical and simulated yields of maize is shown in fig 4 by analyzing the spatial pattern of the statistical yield we found that the areas of high maize yield were distributed in the northeast of the aptz the areas of low maize yield were distributed in the southwest region by analyzing the spatial pattern of the simulated yield we found that the results at the three scales reflected the differences in maize yield in different regions however the simulation result at the scale of 5 km was more consistent with the statistical yield there was no significant difference between the simulation yield at 5 km fig 4b and 10 km scale fig 4c the model performance was better as the scale declined 4 3 sensitivity analysis of crop parameters the sensitivities of five major crop parameters that have important impacts on crop yield were analyzed table 4 the parameters include wa hi dlma dlai and wsyf we calculated the averages of the parameter sensitivities and the sensitivities of the parameters were all greater than zero in the aptz for the crops of maize and soybeans the most sensitivity parameter to crops yields was wa followed by wsyf for maize dlai was a relatively insensitive parameter and for soybeans dmla was relatively insensitive the most sensitive parameter for rice was hi in contrast the most insensitive parameter among the five parameters was wsyf spring wheat was most sensitive to hi followed by wa the most insensitive parameter was dmla in contrast for winter wheat the most sensitive parameter was hi and the most insensitive parameter was wsyf to explore how parameter sensitivity varied with parameters the values of parameters were taken from an interval between 0 8 times the default value x and 1 2 times x excluding the parameter wa for spring wheat and winter wheat the parameter hi for maize and the parameter dlai for soybeans to avoid outing of the parameters range listed in table 2 the value of parameter wa for spring wheat and winter wheat was taken from 0 9 x to 1 2 the values of parameter hi for maize and parameter dlai for soybeans were taken from 0 8 x to 1 1 for winter wheat fig 5 a the sensitivity indices si of all five parameters were greater than zero parameter sensitivity varied and the variations in si for the five parameters were different the si for parameters wa dmla and wsyf were relatively stable and the variation was less than 0 05 si increased with the parameter hi for parameter dlai it was first declined and then increased gradually for spring wheat fig 5b the sensitivity indexes of the five major parameters were all greater than zero excluding the si of parameter hi had a high fluctuation and the variation range was nearly 0 5 the other four parameters sensitivity had slight changes which were less than 0 05 there were no obvious changes for the si of the other four parameters in addition the variation of si for parameter hi was not stable for maize fig 5c the sensitivity indexes of the five major parameters were all greater than zero in addition we found that by excluding wa the si varied obviously for the other four parameters the si for parameters hi dmla and wsyf increased gradually in contrast the trend of si for parameter dlai declined as the parameter variation for rice fig 5d the si of the five parameters were all greater than zero by excluding wa the si of the other four parameters changed obviously and the variation ranges were higher than 0 2 the parameters sensitivity of hi dmla dlai and wsyf varied greatly at first and then tend to be relatively stable for soybeans fig 5e the sensitivity indexes of the five parameters were all greater than zero by excluding the parameter wa the si for other four parameters was relatively unstable however the variation ranges of si for parameters hi dmla dlai and wsyf had no obvious changes which were less than 0 2 the spatial patterns of the most sensitive parameters for wheat maize soybean and rice are shown in fig 6 for wheat the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was wa which accounted for 67 24 of the total planting area wa was followed by wsyf 23 02 hi 6 1 dlai 3 55 and dmla 0 1 for maize the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was dlai which accounted for 36 49 of the total planting area dlai was followed by wa 33 04 wsyf 18 27 hi 8 73 and dmla 3 47 for soybeans the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was hi which accounted for 67 14 of the total planting area hi was followed by wsyf 23 54 wa 8 38 dlai 0 95 and dmla 0 02 for rice the most sensitive parameter in the aptz was wa which accounted for 53 71 of the total planting area wa was followed by dlai 38 11 hi 5 18 wsyf 2 03 and dmla 0 98 excluding for maize the percentages of the most sensitive parameters for the other three crops were all more than 50 5 discussions our study analyzed the scale dependence and parameter sensitivity of the epic model scale dependence was existed and the accuracy of simulated yield increased with scale decrease parameters sensitivity presents two obvious characteristics it varied with parameter values as well as in space when comparing the simulation results with the statistical yields within each municipal unit we found that the simulated results of the epic model were lower than statistical yields for four major crops of wheat maize rice and soybean that is the simulated yields of epic model were underestimated this finding is consistent with that of wang and li 2010 and liu 2009 as to reasons fertilizer application rate and irrigation percentage in model settings may be less than actual agricultural production conditions ecological processes are by nature scale dependent grafius et al 2016 wu 2004 wu and qi 2000 however previous studies usually chose the spatial resolution based on the extent of study area and accessibility to computing resources the effects of scales on simulation results were largely ignored when scaling the model simulation from high to low resolution the spatial heterogeneity of cropland distribution meteorological variables and soil property etc between each grid cell were averaged and aggregated van der biest et al 2015 this may lead to loss of information due to aggregation error easterling et al 1998 on the contrary when scaling the model simulation from low to high resolution the grid cell will be partitioned into several parts uniformly this will reduce the spatial heterogeneity of input data e g soils fertilizer and meteorological information compared with the former the latter had less effects on simulation results this was the main reason why the difference of simulated yield between scale of 10 km and 5 km was small whereas that of 10 km and 50 km was large the spatial heterogeneity of the input data was the main reason for the scale dependent characteristics of the epic models easterling et al 1998 rastetter et al 1992 because of the limitation of the gepic model we could not investigate the scale effects of the gepic model finer than 5 km however our study had valuable implications for the better application of the epic model that is to consider the impacts of grid spacing on the simulated crop yields rather than merely regarding computing resources and time consumption this was especially true for regions with high spatial heterogeneity of cropland distribution for example the farmland fragmentation issue is seriously in china due to the farmland ownership fragmentation plots managed by one household are spatially separated and physical landscape fragmentation su et al 2014 wan and cheng 2001 therefore we can expect that the simulation results will be closer to the observed yields with the refinement of data resolution sensitivity analysis of the crop parameters was another important factor that should be considered in the application of the epic model compared with previous studies targeted on very few parameters at field experimental station huang et al 2006 wang et al 2012 we analyzed the sensitivities of parameters wa hi dlma dlai and wsyf at each grid cell for the first time the results showed that the most sensitive parameter for maize and soybeans in the aptz was wa while hi was the most sensitive parameter for rice spring wheat and winter wheat the most sensitive parameters varied in space mainly because of the heterogeneous input variables parameters sensitivity depends on many factors including crop types water stress and temperature stress etc wa represents the potential growth rate per unit of photosynthetically effective radiation therefore it has a large effect on all five crops yield hi was demonstrated to have a linear relation to crop yield regardless of water stress liu 2009 most sown areas of wheat and rice in the aptz were distributed in the irrigated areas and therefore water stress is rare during crop growth however when areas are under water stress the sensitivity index si of hi will decrease accordingly although the parameters of dmla dlai and wsyf had non negligible impacts on crop yields they were not the main parameters compared with wa and hi in the aptz in addition we found that the si of all five parameters were greater than zero the si varied with the parameters and the variations in si for the five parameters were different therefore it was necessary to consider the variation of si in parameters adjustment we also learned that the most sensitive parameter exhibited spatial heterogeneity for even the same crop type the main reason was that the input variables of meteorological elements soil types topography irrigation fertilizers and other variables varied largely in space this also illustrated why sensitivity analyses become an indispensable part in localization and regionalization of crop models wang et al 2005a 2005b the study of liu 2009 was consistent with our research when applying the epic model to simulate crop yields in different regions spatial heterogeneity will affect the accuracy of simulation results with the same parameter value therefore we should analyze parameter sensitivity based on regional meteorological soil property irrigation fertilization and terrain conditions in the application of the epic model on the whole this study could provide reference for related researches that carried out in regions where crop distribution present fragmentation in addition it also reminds us that we shouldn t merely consider computation resources and therefore ignore the sensitive analysis of parameters at large scale studies scale dependency of process based model is a bit more complex including also content accuracy and quality of the input data available at different scales and limitations this brings although the method of scale dependent analysis is relatively simple our study is helping to shed more light on model application and can be further explored in subsequent studies this is also an important direction of our future research work 6 conclusions as an ecological model epic can be integrated with topics in climate soil crops management technology etc it has been a main research approach for analyzing the impacts of climate change on crop yield food security and soil erosion however previous studies have ignored the impact of scale on the simulation results in the model application this study used a gis based epic model to analyze the scale dependence at three scales the results show that the epic model has scale dependence the simulation results varied with the study scale grain size the smaller the scale and the finer the input data the more accurate the simulated results are in the aptz for the five major crops of maize soybeans rice spring wheat and winter wheat the most sensitive parameter to crop yield varied for the five parameters wa and hi were the two most sensitive parameters and had larger impacts on crop yields in the aptz for the same crop the distribution of the most sensitive parameter had spatial heterogeneity in addition the impacts of the parameters on crop yields varied as the parameters therefore when using the epic model to study the crop productivity we should consider the impacts of scale variation and set the parameters as precisely as possible acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural

25164,the three types of elements nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s are inextricably linked from the source to the destination throughout the system to analyze the environmental load caused by the three elements this study established a material metabolism model to quantify the relationships among metabolic processes on the provincial scale and examined their environmental implications based on substance flow analysis sfa the results show that the metabolic fluxes of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the socioeconomic system of liaoning province in 2016 were 5 339 million tons 0 582 million tons and 3 084 million tons respectively the agricultural sector caused the greatest environmental pressures on water bodies in which nitrogen and phosphorus accounted for 61 8 and 80 2 of the total water body load for atmospheric load the nitrogen and sulfur elements in the industrial sector caused the largest atmospheric load accounting for 37 8 and 91 4 of the total atmospheric load respectively the main source of phosphorus soil load in liaoning province is the agricultural production accounting for 85 3 of the total soil load caused by phosphorus keywords material metabolism nitrogen phosphorus sulfur conjoint analysis environmental pollution liaoning province 1 introduction the demand for nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s has increased dramatically driven by the socioeconomic development while exerts significant environmental pressures berlin et al 2014 the increasing eutrophication haze and fog environment problems caused by the overcharge of the three elements has drawn increasing attention in recent decades eutrophication has become one of the core issues of water pollution in china in april 2007 the blue green algae blooms in taihu lake caused shutdowns of nearby water treatment plant as a result most areas of the city run into water shortages qin et al 2007 in addition the air pollution caused by nitrogen oxide nox and sulfide led to a series of environmental problems such as atmospheric acid deposition ozone and haze yeo and kim 2016 it is conservatively projected that nox emissions in china will reach nearly 29 million tons in 2020 shi et al 2014 it is reported that from january to march in 2013 approximately 600 million people accounting for 45 of china s total population were adversely affected by haze the metabolism of the three elements n p s has aroused heated discussion on addressing the environmental issues tailed by the misuse and overuse of materials containing either of the three elements geng et al 2015 many scholars have researched on the metabolism of the three kinds of elements researchers have analyzed nitrogen metabolism on the national breemen et al 2002 filoso et al 2006 and regional scales regional nitrogen metabolism mostly focused on urban parfitt et al 2006 and watershed boyer et al 2006 bashkin et al 2002 yoshikawa et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 analyzed the intensity of nitrogen metabolism in beijing by means of ecological network analysis and concluded that atmosphere household and industry had the most interactions with other nodes in the network compared with nitrogen and sulfur more research focused on metabolic analysis of phosphorus varying from global level to villalba et al 2008 national li et al 2015 regional yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 as well as urban levels kalmykova et al 2012 globally the natural circulation metabolic intensity of global phosphorus is only 1 3 that of artificial circulation indicating human activities have significant influences on phosphorus cycles smil 2000 from the perspective of different sectors qiao et al 2011 explored the phosphorus flows through food consumption in beijing and tianjin using a material flow analysis mfa approach the results showed that approximately 55 of the phosphorus contained in food for urban residents consumption resulted in municipal sewage and sludge in the case of the korean steel industry jeong et al 2009 phosphorus lost in steel making slag is estimated to be 10 of domestic phosphorus consumption compared with the metabolic analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus fewer studies concentrated on the metabolism of sulfur tian et al 2012 used the substance flow analysis sfa method to analyze the flow characteristics of sulfur in the industrial park in hangzhou bay zhang et al 2015 combined the structure and functional attributes of lubei eco industrial park in shandong constructed a sulfur metabolism network model based on sfa and identified key nodes of the processes in the industrial sulfur metabolism from the perspective of metabolic spatial scales most studies highlighted the global national urban and industrial parks while few studies of metabolism were conducted on the provincial scale for the structure of metabolic tissues most studies focused on the analysis of a single industrial system in the socioeconomic system while few comprehensive studies on the whole socioeconomic system in terms of metabolic research subjects most studies concentrated on the metabolic analysis of single element while few conducted combined analysis of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur given the inextricably linked relationship between the three elements and their coexistence in many substances such as food coal and oil it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism the socioeconomic system is a complex system that composting of several industrial systems which are interconnected but each different from each other the study presents a comprehensive analysis of elemental metabolism to better explain environmental problems brought by misuse and overuse of substances containing n p s elements the substance flow analysis method is applied to carry out a joint metabolic analysis of the social and economic system supported by the underlying flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur on the province level 2 theories and methods 2 1 substance flow analysis the core principle of substance flow analysis is derived from the law of conservation of mass whose outstanding advantages highlight the capability of addressing specific environmental problems it enables people to explore the critical links and key flows that cause environmental pollution by tracking the input and output of substances in various aspects of the system and the environment and to construct maps of material flow network and quantify the circulation of each link within the system the framework of substance flow analysis is shown in fig 1 the sfa framework consists of four processes production fabrication and manufacture consumption and waste management the waste generated in manufacturing and processing mainly comes from the following channels material flow re entering the production stage waste recycling inlet flow of the machine manufacturing industry reuse and recycling and inlet flow at the waste treatment stage harmful or hazardous industrial waste sfa allows us to quantify relationships between the economy and the environment of a geographically demarcated system 2 2 nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism analysis model on a provincial level combined with the material flow analysis method this study established an analysis model of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in the provincial socioeconomic system 2 2 1 metabolic system boundary in the purpose of establishing the analysis model of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in the provincial socioeconomic system the system boundary needs to be defined clearly according to the purpose of research so the provincial geographic boundary is defined as the metabolic system boundary 2 2 2 metabolic system framework within boundaries of the metabolic system in the study each subsystem is constructed in support of determining pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism systematically based on the sfa analysis framework this study builds a material metabolism system framework on the provincial level as shown in fig 2 the provincial socioeconomic system is divided into four subsystems based on the attributes resource system environmental system provincial socio economic system and raw material product system the four subsystems form the framework of metabolic systems of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur on the province level as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 metabolic pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the relationships between each pair of metabolic subsystems in the framework are analyzed by depicting the flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur and their internal connections with other subsystems this framework serves to describe and explore the reasons that affect the production and conversion of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur can be described as elements in the form of minerals energy industrial products agricultural products and other products enter the socio economic system through transfers and exchanges solid waste treatments related to metabolic pathway mainly include incineration and landfill some of the elements are discharged into the atmosphere in the form of incineration waste gas and the remaining part is buried in the soil the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism pathways are shown in fig 3 despite the interconnection among various subsystems the metabolic pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur are characterized and distinguished from each other through analyses nitrogen is mainly sourced from the atmosphere and imported into the socio economic system in the form of gas minerals industrial products agricultural products and energy phosphorus is naturally stemmed from the phosphate rock and imported into the socioeconomic system mainly in the form of phosphate rock industrial products and agricultural products sulfur is mainly imported into the socio economic system in the form of sulfur ore industrial products agricultural products and energy the ultimate destinations of nitrogen and sulfur are the atmosphere soil and water compared with nitrogen and sulfur the ultimate fates of phosphorus are water and soil 2 2 4 metabolism network of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the provincial network of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism is based on the boundary of the metabolic system and metabolic pathways including five types of nodes and five types of flows as shown in fig 4 the diagram contains five types of nodes and five types of flows the nodes representing a material supply to the socio economic system in the province are denoted by c the nodes representing processes related to consumption and redistribution of materials within the socio economic system are denoted by p the nodes that represent waste treatment are represented by t the nodes that represent the ultimate disposition of the waste are denoted by d which involves the processes of incineration landfill and other ways of waste treatment such as high temperature composting and recycling nodes denoted by s indicate the final environmental attribution of materials five types of flows are described as follows 1 the input flows in the form of raw materials or products enter the provincial socio economic system these processes are denoted by i for example i1 represents that the input flows into the provincial socio economic system in the form of minerals 2 the output flows of the provincial socio economic system in the form of products are expressed by e for example e4 represents the output flow of the provincial socio economic system in the form of agricultural products 3 the element flows in the form of sewage and water reuse are expressed by w for example w1 represents the industrial wastewater flows which are discharges into sewage treatment facilities of companies 4 the element contained flows in solid form represented by x for example x3 represents the flow of household garbage besides the flows of elements that are exchanged with the atmospheric contents are denoted by n for example n2 represents the flow of exhaust gases from industrial processes into the atmosphere the element metabolism diagram at the provincial level constructed by sfa method describes in detail the processes of an element s input from the source internal flow and transformation and finally its return to the environment it reflects the circulation of elements in the system according to the functions and properties of each link within the system the metabolic topological structure of elements at the provincial level includes the industrial system agricultural system and resident life system the industrial system is a system to process and manufacture industrial products materials input to the industrial system are minerals energy industrial products agricultural products and other products after raw materials being processed and manufactured in the industrial system some of them are transformed into industrial products while others are transformed into waste products the agricultural system is a system of producing agricultural products which consumes energy industrial products agricultural products and other products the agricultural production process mainly yields agricultural while still some waste products are disposed into the environment the residential life system is basically a consumption system where energy industrial products agricultural products and other products are consumed they are disposed of in the form of household solid waste and liquid waste and discharges into environment 2 2 5 analytical model based on the topological structure of element metabolism quantification of the causal relationship of each link in the topological structure is of great importance in the purpose of element metabolism analysis the elemental metabolic analysis model is based on the first law of thermodynamics the principle of material conservation this study is based on the assumption that the material metabolism in the socioeconomic system is stable that is input equals output according to the topological structure of element metabolism the model of element metabolism constructed in serving of provincial level analysis is shown as follow according to the properties of each fundamental flow the analytical model is subdivided into a raw material or product flow model a wastewater flow model a solid waste flow model an exhaust gas flow model and a reuse flow model the raw material or product flow model is used to account for the content of elements in various raw materials or products the raw material or product flow e φ i k i φ i the total amount of material or product t k i elemental coefficient in the

capacity of 7 71 million tons per day an estimated 268 million tons of general industrial solid waste was produced and the comprehensive utilization rate of solid waste was 43 8 the domestic garbage clearance volume is 9 27 million tons with harmless disposal rate of 87 6 in 2016 the total nitrogen oxide emissions of liaoning province ranked 8th among all the cities in china with 27 2 of motor vehicles from the above liaoning province is a typical case liaoning province s geographical location in china is shown in fig 5 3 2 conjoint analysis 3 2 1 metabolic structure and flux analysis in 2016 the input amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning socioeconomic system were respectively 5 339 000 tons 5 820 000 tons and 3 084 000 tons and the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur was 9 2 1 5 3 it indicates that the demand for nitrogen and sulfur is higher than that for phosphorus in liaoning province in the topological structure of element metabolism there are some differences in the metabolic processes of the three elements first sulfur metabolism has no nodes and fluxes related to agricultural links second phosphorus metabolic process has no relationship with atmosphere and its associated flows third the metabolic process of nitrogen elements includes all nodes and flow stocks and the nitrogen metabolism process also catalyzes the flow from the atmosphere to industry and the flow from logistics trade to the atmosphere within and outside the province fig 6 shows the metabolic flux ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning province the three elements also differ significantly in the form of material input nitrogen n has two primary inputs first it was mainly imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of industrial products 33 4 because a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer and compound fertilizer were consumed in agricultural sector second it is imported in the form of energy 32 because industrial sector and residents life are supported by consumption of coal and other energy sources with a large amount of nitrogen elements compared with the metabolic processes of phosphorus and sulfur elements nitrogen metabolism is unique in its atmospheric inputs in the input source which accounts for a high proportion about 21 7 the reason is that urea and synthetic ammonia are produced by artificial nitrogen fixation in the process of nitrogen fertilizer production phosphorus p was mainly introduced into the socioeconomic system in the form of industrial products 83 3 it is because that the agricultural sector requires a large amount of phosphate fertilizer and compound fertilizer sulfur is mainly imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of energy 49 and mineral products 38 2 the energy source of sulfur is driven by a large number of consumption of coal and other fossil fuels in industrial sector and residential lives while the mineral source is associated with the huge amount of iron sulfide ore mined in liaoning province which was 2 142 300 tons in 2016 the input sources of liaoning socioeconomic system are shown in fig 7 the dependence of nitrogen and sulfur elements on various input forms is relatively uniform while phosphorus elements are overly dependent on the input of industrial products about 83 3 of the phosphorus was imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of industrial products however these industrial products are mainly concentrated phosphate fertilizers and compound fertilizers this indicates that the critical nodes of phosphorus metabolism system in liaoning province is the phosphorus chemical industry there are mainly two output sources one is to export from the socioeconomic system in the form of products and the other is to discharge waste in forms of solid liquid and gas into the environment the output of nitrogen products phosphorus products and sulfurs products were 3 195 000 tons 279 000 tons and 1 924 000 tons respectively the product conversion rate of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolic system can be defined based on the material input the product conversion rate is expressed as the ratio of product output to material input representing the level of system utilization of input materials according to the input and output the product conversion rate of nitrogen element is 59 8 that of phosphorus element is 48 1 and that of sulfur element is 62 4 moreover the product conversion rate of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the socioeconomic system in liaoning is not very high compared with nitrogen and sulfur phosphorus has the lowest conversion rate less than 50 this indicates that the socioeconomic system of liaoning province has a low utilization level of phosphorus element which causes an enormous waste of phosphorus element and further aggravates the pollution of phosphorus element to environment in 2016 liaoning s social and economic system exported 2 144 000 tons of nitrogen 302 000 tons of phosphorus and 1 160 000 tons of sulfur to the environment the discharges of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur into the atmosphere water and soil are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur was discharged to the soil accounting for 45 5 89 4 and 48 6 of their total emissions respectively there are two reasons that mainly account for the accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements in the soil first excessive inputs of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and other fertilizers result in the accumulation of nutrients in the soil which cannot be absorbed by crops second a large proportion of domestic garbage and solid waste are disposed by incineration and landfill resulted large amount of elements remain in the soil in addition to the accumulation in soil there is also a large amount of nitrogen and sulfur elements emitting to the atmosphere accounting for 40 6 and 49 4 of their total emissions respectively the consumption of coal and other energy and the burning of solid waste are the main reasons for the large amount of nitrogen and sulfur elements being discharged into the atmosphere besides the nitrogen released into the atmosphere were also due to the volatilization of nitrogen fertilizer and the emission of nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhaust the number of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released to water is relatively less accounting for 13 9 10 6 and 2 of the total emission respectively however it leads to severe water pollution especially eutrophication indicating that the water environment in liaoning province is very fragile 3 2 2 water load the main sources of water pollution in liaoning province are industry agriculture and resident life in 2016 the socioeconomic system of liaoning province discharged 297 840 tons of nitrogen 32 078 tons of phosphorus and 22 910 tons of sulfur into water accounting for 5 6 5 5 and 0 74 of the total input respectively the proportion of water load caused by various pollution sources in liaoning province is shown in fig 9 the water load composition of various pollution sources of nitrogen is roughly similar to that of phosphorus elements in liaoning province as shown in fig 9 the agricultural links are major contributors to the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies resulting in n and p accounting for 61 8 and 80 2 of the total water load respectively residential life is a less important source of nitrogen and phosphorus accounting for 33 1 and 18 4 of the total water load respectively the process of sulfur metabolism lacks agricultural links the largest component of the water load of the sulfur element is from the life of residents accounting for 83 2 of the total water load of sulfur element as a result the contribution of three kinds of pollution to water load level can be identified as agriculture sector n 61 8 p 61 8 residents live sector n 33 1 p 33 1 s 83 2 industry sector n 5 1 p 5 1 s 16 8 most of the water load caused by the agricultural link comes from the livestock and poultry breeding industry the water load ratio of liaoning agricultural sector is shown in fig 10 for both nitrogen and phosphorus the water load caused by livestock and poultry breeding industry accounts for more than 90 of the total water load in the agricultural sector it is mainly caused by the low efficiency livestock and poultry sectors qian et al 2017 meanwhile a large quantity of livestock and poultry excrement is treated simply resulting in the low utilization rate of manure and in turn less circulation of the elements the water load caused by the three types of elements in the domestic wastewater is significantly higher than that of the industry sector the water load of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur caused by domestic sewage is more than four times higher than that of industry sector on the one hand it indicates that liaoning province has made remarkable achievements in the treatment of industrial wastewater on the other hand it also indicates that liaoning province has great defects in the treatment of domestic sewage no matter in quantity or pollution degree the influence of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements in domestic sewage on water has far exceeded that of industrial wastewater therefore in the efforts of prevention and control of water pollution caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements attention should be paid not only to industrial links but also to agricultural links and residential life links 3 2 3 atmospheric load for atmospheric load the main sources of atmospheric load produced by three kinds of elements are very different phosphorus has few effects on the atmosphere nevertheless the main sources of air pollution caused by sulfur are industrial emissions domestic pollution and waste incineration compared with the sulfur element the nitrogen released into the atmosphere were due to agricultural sector and vehicle emissions in 2016 the element emission ratio of various sources in the atmosphere in liaoning province is shown in fig 11 the contribution of various pollution sources to atmospheric load during nitrogen metabolism can be expressed as the industrial sector 37 8 agricultural production 27 7 waste incineration 18 1 motor vehicle emissions 13 7 domestic pollution 2 7 the contribution of various pollution sources to atmospheric load during sulfur metabolism can be described as industrial sectors 91 4 domestic pollution 7 8 waste incineration 0 8 no matter nitrogen element or sulfur element industrial emissions are the main sources that cause the most atmospheric load accounting for 37 8 and 91 4 of the total atmospheric load respectively which is mainly associated with the industrial structure and energy utilization structure of liaoning province meanwhile it should be noted that industrial emissions are major contributors to atmospheric load during sulfur metabolism in nitrogen metabolism agriculture waste incineration and motor vehicle emissions contribute to 27 7 of the total nitrogen atmosphere load accordingly to control air pollution caused by nitrogen policymakers should not only pay attention to the air pollution from industrial emissions but pay attention to impacts of agriculture waste incineration motor vehicle emissions on the air 3 2 4 soil environmental load this study presents impacts on soil environment in two parts cultivated soil and non cultivated soil the cultivated land is mainly polluted by the unused chemical fertilizer in the process of crop production while the non cultivated land is mainly polluted by various solid wastes in 2016 the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released from the socioeconomic system in liaoning to the soil was 974 344 tons 270 181 tons and 564 079 tons accounting for 18 2 46 4 and 18 3 of the total input respectively the ratio of soil load of various pollution sources in liaoning province is shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the largest load of nitrogen and sulfur elements in soil is industry accounting for 68 9 and 90 of the total load of soil it is caused by the large amount of industrial solid wastes fly ash slag etc produced in industrial sector which contain nitrogen and sulfur moreover the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial solid wastes in liaoning province is as low as only 43 8 the remaining industrial solid waste discharged into the non arable land soil through landfill waste and other ways the most significant component of soil load caused by phosphorus is agriculture accounting for 85 3 of total soil load of phosphorus the main reason for the above phenomena is that the excessive use of phosphate fertilizer in agricultural production leaves a large amount of phosphorus in the cultivated soil in summary the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during nitrogen metabolism can be expressed as industrial sector 68 9 agricultural production 24 8 domestic pollution 6 3 the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during phosphorus metabolism can be described as agricultural production 85 3 industrial sector 9 4 domestic pollution 5 3 the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during sulfur metabolism can be described as industrial sector 90 domestic pollution 10 3 2 5 countermeasures of environmental load the analysis of environmental load in liaoning province indicates that the socioeconomic system of liaoning province is an open system the metabolic processes of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the system are linear which will inevitably lead to unstable material metabolism structure low material production efficiency and imperfect system function the metabolic patterns of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning province can be highly summarized as linear open type high intensity material metabolism patterns which inevitably causes severe resource depletion and huge environmental load therefore in order to fundamentally solve the huge environmental load caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur it is necessary to systematically regulate the existing elemental metabolic system structure the system integrates and configures the flow path and circulation intensity of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur this study proposed to build a closed loop from resources products waste and renewable resources to achieve the twin goal of optimal resource utilization and minimum waste discharge it would facilitate to achieving resource utilization optimization 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop models and comprehensively analyze nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism on the provincial scale and take a typical chinese industrial province liaoning as a case the developed model captures the interconnection within the industrial system and interconnection between subsystems of industrial systems agricultural systems and residential life systems and further characterizes effects of element cycle on the environment including water soil and air it not only describes the input and output of elements in every aspect of the system but also reflects the relations between various flows in the system the conjoint analysis model may assist the policymakers to investigate environmental problems caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism and develop appropriate measures to address environmental issues in 2016 the total input of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur element in liaoning social and economic system was 5 339 000 tons 5 820 000 tons and 3 084 000 tons respectively the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released to the environment was 2 140 000 tons 3 020 000 tons and 1 160 000 tons respectively the industrial sector is the key point that causes the atmospheric and soil pollution of nitrogen and sulfur in liaoning province pollution caused by agricultural production is the key to water pollution of nitrogen 61 8 and phosphorus 80 2 in liaoning province respectively accounted for 61 8 and 80 of the total emissions of the two types of elements the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements emitted by domestic sewage into the water body are 98 469 tons 5915 tons and 19 056 tons respectively which are 6 5 times 13 2 times and 4 9 times of those discharged from industrial wastewater the removal rate of three kinds of elements 22 37 32 is much lower than that of industrial wastewater 72 1 54 3 54 5 therefore sewage flow is a key stream for pollution prevention and control in liaoning province the metabolic problems of high energy consumption low output and high pollution coexist in the current metabolic structure in liaoning province we propose to take measures to control the total amount of input materials build a substance recycling loop and improve the production efficiency of materials to achieve the purpose of reducing the environmental load acknowledgements this work was supported by the based research projects of national natural science

25164,the three types of elements nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s are inextricably linked from the source to the destination throughout the system to analyze the environmental load caused by the three elements this study established a material metabolism model to quantify the relationships among metabolic processes on the provincial scale and examined their environmental implications based on substance flow analysis sfa the results show that the metabolic fluxes of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the socioeconomic system of liaoning province in 2016 were 5 339 million tons 0 582 million tons and 3 084 million tons respectively the agricultural sector caused the greatest environmental pressures on water bodies in which nitrogen and phosphorus accounted for 61 8 and 80 2 of the total water body load for atmospheric load the nitrogen and sulfur elements in the industrial sector caused the largest atmospheric load accounting for 37 8 and 91 4 of the total atmospheric load respectively the main source of phosphorus soil load in liaoning province is the agricultural production accounting for 85 3 of the total soil load caused by phosphorus keywords material metabolism nitrogen phosphorus sulfur conjoint analysis environmental pollution liaoning province 1 introduction the demand for nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s has increased dramatically driven by the socioeconomic development while exerts significant environmental pressures berlin et al 2014 the increasing eutrophication haze and fog environment problems caused by the overcharge of the three elements has drawn increasing attention in recent decades eutrophication has become one of the core issues of water pollution in china in april 2007 the blue green algae blooms in taihu lake caused shutdowns of nearby water treatment plant as a result most areas of the city run into water shortages qin et al 2007 in addition the air pollution caused by nitrogen oxide nox and sulfide led to a series of environmental problems such as atmospheric acid deposition ozone and haze yeo and kim 2016 it is conservatively projected that nox emissions in china will reach nearly 29 million tons in 2020 shi et al 2014 it is reported that from january to march in 2013 approximately 600 million people accounting for 45 of china s total population were adversely affected by haze the metabolism of the three elements n p s has aroused heated discussion on addressing the environmental issues tailed by the misuse and overuse of materials containing either of the three elements geng et al 2015 many scholars have researched on the metabolism of the three kinds of elements researchers have analyzed nitrogen metabolism on the national breemen et al 2002 filoso et al 2006 and regional scales regional nitrogen metabolism mostly focused on urban parfitt et al 2006 and watershed boyer et al 2006 bashkin et al 2002 yoshikawa et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 analyzed the intensity of nitrogen metabolism in beijing by means of ecological network analysis and concluded that atmosphere household and industry had the most interactions with other nodes in the network compared with nitrogen and sulfur more research focused on metabolic analysis of phosphorus varying from global level to villalba et al 2008 national li et al 2015 regional yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 as well as urban levels kalmykova et al 2012 globally the natural circulation metabolic intensity of global phosphorus is only 1 3 that of artificial circulation indicating human activities have significant influences on phosphorus cycles smil 2000 from the perspective of different sectors qiao et al 2011 explored the phosphorus flows through food consumption in beijing and tianjin using a material flow analysis mfa approach the results showed that approximately 55 of the phosphorus contained in food for urban residents consumption resulted in municipal sewage and sludge in the case of the korean steel industry jeong et al 2009 phosphorus lost in steel making slag is estimated to be 10 of domestic phosphorus consumption compared with the metabolic analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus fewer studies concentrated on the metabolism of sulfur tian et al 2012 used the substance flow analysis sfa method to analyze the flow characteristics of sulfur in the industrial park in hangzhou bay zhang et al 2015 combined the structure and functional attributes of lubei eco industrial park in shandong constructed a sulfur metabolism network model based on sfa and identified key nodes of the processes in the industrial sulfur metabolism from the perspective of metabolic spatial scales most studies highlighted the global national urban and industrial parks while few studies of metabolism were conducted on the provincial scale for the structure of metabolic tissues most studies focused on the analysis of a single industrial system in the socioeconomic system while few comprehensive studies on the whole socioeconomic system in terms of metabolic research subjects most studies concentrated on the metabolic analysis of single element while few conducted combined analysis of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur given the inextricably linked relationship between the three elements and their coexistence in many substances such as food coal and oil it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism the socioeconomic system is a complex system that composting of several industrial systems which are interconnected but each different from each other the study presents a comprehensive analysis of elemental metabolism to better explain environmental problems brought by misuse and overuse of substances containing n p s elements the substance flow analysis method is applied to carry out a joint metabolic analysis of the social and economic system supported by the underlying flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur on the province level 2 theories and methods 2 1 substance flow analysis the core principle of substance flow analysis is derived from the law of conservation of mass whose outstanding advantages highlight the capability of addressing specific environmental problems it enables people to explore the critical links and key flows that cause environmental pollution by tracking the input and output of substances in various aspects of the system and the environment and to construct maps of material flow network and quantify the circulation of each link within the system the framework of substance flow analysis is shown in fig 1 the sfa framework consists of four processes production fabrication and manufacture consumption and waste management the waste generated in manufacturing and processing mainly comes from the following channels material flow re entering the production stage waste recycling inlet flow of the machine manufacturing industry reuse and recycling and inlet flow at the waste treatment stage harmful or hazardous industrial waste sfa allows us to quantify relationships between the economy and the environment of a geographically demarcated system 2 2 nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism analysis model on a provincial level combined with the material flow analysis method this study established an analysis model of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in the provincial socioeconomic system 2 2 1 metabolic system boundary in the purpose of establishing the analysis model of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in the provincial socioeconomic system the system boundary needs to be defined clearly according to the purpose of research so the provincial geographic boundary is defined as the metabolic system boundary 2 2 2 metabolic system framework within boundaries of the metabolic system in the study each subsystem is constructed in support of determining pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism systematically based on the sfa analysis framework this study builds a material metabolism system framework on the provincial level as shown in fig 2 the provincial socioeconomic system is divided into four subsystems based on the attributes resource system environmental system provincial socio economic system and raw material product system the four subsystems form the framework of metabolic systems of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur on the province level as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 metabolic pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the relationships between each pair of metabolic subsystems in the framework are analyzed by depicting the flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur and their internal connections with other subsystems this framework serves to describe and explore the reasons that affect the production and conversion of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the flows of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur can be described as elements in the form of minerals energy industrial products agricultural products and other products enter the socio economic system through transfers and exchanges solid waste treatments related to metabolic pathway mainly include incineration and landfill some of the elements are discharged into the atmosphere in the form of incineration waste gas and the remaining part is buried in the soil the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism pathways are shown in fig 3 despite the interconnection among various subsystems the metabolic pathways of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur are characterized and distinguished from each other through analyses nitrogen is mainly sourced from the atmosphere and imported into the socio economic system in the form of gas minerals industrial products agricultural products and energy phosphorus is naturally stemmed from the phosphate rock and imported into the socioeconomic system mainly in the form of phosphate rock industrial products and agricultural products sulfur is mainly imported into the socio economic system in the form of sulfur ore industrial products agricultural products and energy the ultimate destinations of nitrogen and sulfur are the atmosphere soil and water compared with nitrogen and sulfur the ultimate fates of phosphorus are water and soil 2 2 4 metabolism network of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur the provincial network of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism is based on the boundary of the metabolic system and metabolic pathways including five types of nodes and five types of flows as shown in fig 4 the diagram contains five types of nodes and five types of flows the nodes representing a material supply to the socio economic system in the province are denoted by c the nodes representing processes related to consumption and redistribution of materials within the socio economic system are denoted by p the nodes that represent waste treatment are represented by t the nodes that represent the ultimate disposition of the waste are denoted by d which involves the processes of incineration landfill and other ways of waste treatment such as high temperature composting and recycling nodes denoted by s indicate the final environmental attribution of materials five types of flows are described as follows 1 the input flows in the form of raw materials or products enter the provincial socio economic system these processes are denoted by i for example i1 represents that the input flows into the provincial socio economic system in the form of minerals 2 the output flows of the provincial socio economic system in the form of products are expressed by e for example e4 represents the output flow of the provincial socio economic system in the form of agricultural products 3 the element flows in the form of sewage and water reuse are expressed by w for example w1 represents the industrial wastewater flows which are discharges into sewage treatment facilities of companies 4 the element contained flows in solid form represented by x for example x3 represents the flow of household garbage besides the flows of elements that are exchanged with the atmospheric contents are denoted by n for example n2 represents the flow of exhaust gases from industrial processes into the atmosphere the element metabolism diagram at the provincial level constructed by sfa method describes in detail the processes of an element s input from the source internal flow and transformation and finally its return to the environment it reflects the circulation of elements in the system according to the functions and properties of each link within the system the metabolic topological structure of elements at the provincial level includes the industrial system agricultural system and resident life system the industrial system is a system to process and manufacture industrial products materials input to the industrial system are minerals energy industrial products agricultural products and other products after raw materials being processed and manufactured in the industrial system some of them are transformed into industrial products while others are transformed into waste products the agricultural system is a system of producing agricultural products which consumes energy industrial products agricultural products and other products the agricultural production process mainly yields agricultural while still some waste products are disposed into the environment the residential life system is basically a consumption system where energy industrial products agricultural products and other products are consumed they are disposed of in the form of household solid waste and liquid waste and discharges into environment 2 2 5 analytical model based on the topological structure of element metabolism quantification of the causal relationship of each link in the topological structure is of great importance in the purpose of element metabolism analysis the elemental metabolic analysis model is based on the first law of thermodynamics the principle of material conservation this study is based on the assumption that the material metabolism in the socioeconomic system is stable that is input equals output according to the topological structure of element metabolism the model of element metabolism constructed in serving of provincial level analysis is shown as follow according to the properties of each fundamental flow the analytical model is subdivided into a raw material or product flow model a wastewater flow model a solid waste flow model an exhaust gas flow model and a reuse flow model the raw material or product flow model is used to

system of liaoning province in order to obtain complete research data this study selected 2016 as a time node further analysis is conducted on the influence of the industrial system agricultural system and resident living system on environment water air and soil in liaoning province 3 1 the overview of liaoning province liaoning province located in northeast china is one of the major traditional industrial bases in china it is one of the provinces with the most complete industrial categories in china with over 500 sub industries according to china statistical yearbook 2016 and liaoning statistical yearbook 2016 up until 2016 there had been 158 sewage treatment plants in liaoning with a total sewage treatment capacity of 1 829 billion tons and an average sewage treatment capacity of 7 71 million tons per day an estimated 268 million tons of general industrial solid waste was produced and the comprehensive utilization rate of solid waste was 43 8 the domestic garbage clearance volume is 9 27 million tons with harmless disposal rate of 87 6 in 2016 the total nitrogen oxide emissions of liaoning province ranked 8th among all the cities in china with 27 2 of motor vehicles from the above liaoning province is a typical case liaoning province s geographical location in china is shown in fig 5 3 2 conjoint analysis 3 2 1 metabolic structure and flux analysis in 2016 the input amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning socioeconomic system were respectively 5 339 000 tons 5 820 000 tons and 3 084 000 tons and the ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur was 9 2 1 5 3 it indicates that the demand for nitrogen and sulfur is higher than that for phosphorus in liaoning province in the topological structure of element metabolism there are some differences in the metabolic processes of the three elements first sulfur metabolism has no nodes and fluxes related to agricultural links second phosphorus metabolic process has no relationship with atmosphere and its associated flows third the metabolic process of nitrogen elements includes all nodes and flow stocks and the nitrogen metabolism process also catalyzes the flow from the atmosphere to industry and the flow from logistics trade to the atmosphere within and outside the province fig 6 shows the metabolic flux ratio of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning province the three elements also differ significantly in the form of material input nitrogen n has two primary inputs first it was mainly imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of industrial products 33 4 because a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer and compound fertilizer were consumed in agricultural sector second it is imported in the form of energy 32 because industrial sector and residents life are supported by consumption of coal and other energy sources with a large amount of nitrogen elements compared with the metabolic processes of phosphorus and sulfur elements nitrogen metabolism is unique in its atmospheric inputs in the input source which accounts for a high proportion about 21 7 the reason is that urea and synthetic ammonia are produced by artificial nitrogen fixation in the process of nitrogen fertilizer production phosphorus p was mainly introduced into the socioeconomic system in the form of industrial products 83 3 it is because that the agricultural sector requires a large amount of phosphate fertilizer and compound fertilizer sulfur is mainly imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of energy 49 and mineral products 38 2 the energy source of sulfur is driven by a large number of consumption of coal and other fossil fuels in industrial sector and residential lives while the mineral source is associated with the huge amount of iron sulfide ore mined in liaoning province which was 2 142 300 tons in 2016 the input sources of liaoning socioeconomic system are shown in fig 7 the dependence of nitrogen and sulfur elements on various input forms is relatively uniform while phosphorus elements are overly dependent on the input of industrial products about 83 3 of the phosphorus was imported into the socioeconomic system in liaoning province in the form of industrial products however these industrial products are mainly concentrated phosphate fertilizers and compound fertilizers this indicates that the critical nodes of phosphorus metabolism system in liaoning province is the phosphorus chemical industry there are mainly two output sources one is to export from the socioeconomic system in the form of products and the other is to discharge waste in forms of solid liquid and gas into the environment the output of nitrogen products phosphorus products and sulfurs products were 3 195 000 tons 279 000 tons and 1 924 000 tons respectively the product conversion rate of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolic system can be defined based on the material input the product conversion rate is expressed as the ratio of product output to material input representing the level of system utilization of input materials according to the input and output the product conversion rate of nitrogen element is 59 8 that of phosphorus element is 48 1 and that of sulfur element is 62 4 moreover the product conversion rate of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the socioeconomic system in liaoning is not very high compared with nitrogen and sulfur phosphorus has the lowest conversion rate less than 50 this indicates that the socioeconomic system of liaoning province has a low utilization level of phosphorus element which causes an enormous waste of phosphorus element and further aggravates the pollution of phosphorus element to environment in 2016 liaoning s social and economic system exported 2 144 000 tons of nitrogen 302 000 tons of phosphorus and 1 160 000 tons of sulfur to the environment the discharges of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur into the atmosphere water and soil are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that a large amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur was discharged to the soil accounting for 45 5 89 4 and 48 6 of their total emissions respectively there are two reasons that mainly account for the accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements in the soil first excessive inputs of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and other fertilizers result in the accumulation of nutrients in the soil which cannot be absorbed by crops second a large proportion of domestic garbage and solid waste are disposed by incineration and landfill resulted large amount of elements remain in the soil in addition to the accumulation in soil there is also a large amount of nitrogen and sulfur elements emitting to the atmosphere accounting for 40 6 and 49 4 of their total emissions respectively the consumption of coal and other energy and the burning of solid waste are the main reasons for the large amount of nitrogen and sulfur elements being discharged into the atmosphere besides the nitrogen released into the atmosphere were also due to the volatilization of nitrogen fertilizer and the emission of nitrogen oxides from vehicle exhaust the number of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released to water is relatively less accounting for 13 9 10 6 and 2 of the total emission respectively however it leads to severe water pollution especially eutrophication indicating that the water environment in liaoning province is very fragile 3 2 2 water load the main sources of water pollution in liaoning province are industry agriculture and resident life in 2016 the socioeconomic system of liaoning province discharged 297 840 tons of nitrogen 32 078 tons of phosphorus and 22 910 tons of sulfur into water accounting for 5 6 5 5 and 0 74 of the total input respectively the proportion of water load caused by various pollution sources in liaoning province is shown in fig 9 the water load composition of various pollution sources of nitrogen is roughly similar to that of phosphorus elements in liaoning province as shown in fig 9 the agricultural links are major contributors to the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies resulting in n and p accounting for 61 8 and 80 2 of the total water load respectively residential life is a less important source of nitrogen and phosphorus accounting for 33 1 and 18 4 of the total water load respectively the process of sulfur metabolism lacks agricultural links the largest component of the water load of the sulfur element is from the life of residents accounting for 83 2 of the total water load of sulfur element as a result the contribution of three kinds of pollution to water load level can be identified as agriculture sector n 61 8 p 61 8 residents live sector n 33 1 p 33 1 s 83 2 industry sector n 5 1 p 5 1 s 16 8 most of the water load caused by the agricultural link comes from the livestock and poultry breeding industry the water load ratio of liaoning agricultural sector is shown in fig 10 for both nitrogen and phosphorus the water load caused by livestock and poultry breeding industry accounts for more than 90 of the total water load in the agricultural sector it is mainly caused by the low efficiency livestock and poultry sectors qian et al 2017 meanwhile a large quantity of livestock and poultry excrement is treated simply resulting in the low utilization rate of manure and in turn less circulation of the elements the water load caused by the three types of elements in the domestic wastewater is significantly higher than that of the industry sector the water load of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur caused by domestic sewage is more than four times higher than that of industry sector on the one hand it indicates that liaoning province has made remarkable achievements in the treatment of industrial wastewater on the other hand it also indicates that liaoning province has great defects in the treatment of domestic sewage no matter in quantity or pollution degree the influence of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements in domestic sewage on water has far exceeded that of industrial wastewater therefore in the efforts of prevention and control of water pollution caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements attention should be paid not only to industrial links but also to agricultural links and residential life links 3 2 3 atmospheric load for atmospheric load the main sources of atmospheric load produced by three kinds of elements are very different phosphorus has few effects on the atmosphere nevertheless the main sources of air pollution caused by sulfur are industrial emissions domestic pollution and waste incineration compared with the sulfur element the nitrogen released into the atmosphere were due to agricultural sector and vehicle emissions in 2016 the element emission ratio of various sources in the atmosphere in liaoning province is shown in fig 11 the contribution of various pollution sources to atmospheric load during nitrogen metabolism can be expressed as the industrial sector 37 8 agricultural production 27 7 waste incineration 18 1 motor vehicle emissions 13 7 domestic pollution 2 7 the contribution of various pollution sources to atmospheric load during sulfur metabolism can be described as industrial sectors 91 4 domestic pollution 7 8 waste incineration 0 8 no matter nitrogen element or sulfur element industrial emissions are the main sources that cause the most atmospheric load accounting for 37 8 and 91 4 of the total atmospheric load respectively which is mainly associated with the industrial structure and energy utilization structure of liaoning province meanwhile it should be noted that industrial emissions are major contributors to atmospheric load during sulfur metabolism in nitrogen metabolism agriculture waste incineration and motor vehicle emissions contribute to 27 7 of the total nitrogen atmosphere load accordingly to control air pollution caused by nitrogen policymakers should not only pay attention to the air pollution from industrial emissions but pay attention to impacts of agriculture waste incineration motor vehicle emissions on the air 3 2 4 soil environmental load this study presents impacts on soil environment in two parts cultivated soil and non cultivated soil the cultivated land is mainly polluted by the unused chemical fertilizer in the process of crop production while the non cultivated land is mainly polluted by various solid wastes in 2016 the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released from the socioeconomic system in liaoning to the soil was 974 344 tons 270 181 tons and 564 079 tons accounting for 18 2 46 4 and 18 3 of the total input respectively the ratio of soil load of various pollution sources in liaoning province is shown in fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that the largest load of nitrogen and sulfur elements in soil is industry accounting for 68 9 and 90 of the total load of soil it is caused by the large amount of industrial solid wastes fly ash slag etc produced in industrial sector which contain nitrogen and sulfur moreover the comprehensive utilization rate of industrial solid wastes in liaoning province is as low as only 43 8 the remaining industrial solid waste discharged into the non arable land soil through landfill waste and other ways the most significant component of soil load caused by phosphorus is agriculture accounting for 85 3 of total soil load of phosphorus the main reason for the above phenomena is that the excessive use of phosphate fertilizer in agricultural production leaves a large amount of phosphorus in the cultivated soil in summary the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during nitrogen metabolism can be expressed as industrial sector 68 9 agricultural production 24 8 domestic pollution 6 3 the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during phosphorus metabolism can be described as agricultural production 85 3 industrial sector 9 4 domestic pollution 5 3 the contribution of various pollution sources to soil load during sulfur metabolism can be described as industrial sector 90 domestic pollution 10 3 2 5 countermeasures of environmental load the analysis of environmental load in liaoning province indicates that the socioeconomic system of liaoning province is an open system the metabolic processes of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in the system are linear which will inevitably lead to unstable material metabolism structure low material production efficiency and imperfect system function the metabolic patterns of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur in liaoning province can be highly summarized as linear open type high intensity material metabolism patterns which inevitably causes severe resource depletion and huge environmental load therefore in order to fundamentally solve the huge environmental load caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur it is necessary to systematically regulate the existing elemental metabolic system structure the system integrates and configures the flow path and circulation intensity of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur this study proposed to build a closed loop from resources products waste and renewable resources to achieve the twin goal of optimal resource utilization and minimum waste discharge it would facilitate to achieving resource utilization optimization 4 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop models and comprehensively analyze nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism on the provincial scale and take a typical chinese industrial province liaoning as a case the developed model captures the interconnection within the industrial system and interconnection between subsystems of industrial systems agricultural systems and residential life systems and further characterizes effects of element cycle on the environment including water soil and air it not only describes the input and output of elements in every aspect of the system but also reflects the relations between various flows in the system the conjoint analysis model may assist the policymakers to investigate environmental problems caused by nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism and develop appropriate measures to address environmental issues in 2016 the total input of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur element in liaoning social and economic system was 5 339 000 tons 5 820 000 tons and 3 084 000 tons respectively the total amount of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur released to the environment was 2 140 000 tons 3 020 000 tons and 1 160 000 tons respectively the industrial sector is the key point that causes the atmospheric and soil pollution of nitrogen and sulfur in liaoning province pollution caused by agricultural production is the key to water pollution of nitrogen 61 8 and phosphorus 80 2 in liaoning province respectively accounted for 61 8 and 80 of the total emissions of the two types of elements the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur elements emitted by domestic sewage into the water body are 98 469 tons 5915 tons and 19 056 tons respectively which are 6 5 times 13 2 times and 4 9 times of those discharged from industrial wastewater the removal rate of three kinds of elements 22 37 32 is much lower than that of industrial wastewater 72 1 54 3 54 5 therefore sewage flow is a key stream for pollution prevention and control in liaoning province the metabolic problems of high energy consumption low output and high pollution coexist in the current metabolic structure in liaoning province we propose to take measures to control the total amount of input materials build a substance recycling loop and improve the production efficiency of materials to achieve the purpose of reducing the environmental load acknowledgements this work was supported by the based research projects of national natural science
