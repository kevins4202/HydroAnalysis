16935,estrogenic compounds enter waterways via effluents from wastewater treatment works wwtw thereby indicating a potential risk to organisms inhabiting adjacent receiving waters however little is known about the loads or concentrations of estrogenic compounds that enter australian wwtws the efficiency of removing estrogenic compounds throughout the various stages of tertiary wwtw processes which are common in australia nor the concentrations released into estuarine or marine receiving waters and the associated risk for aquatic taxa residing in these environments therefore seven estrogenic compounds comprising the natural estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bisphenol a bpa 4 t octyl phenol 4 t op and 4 nonyl phenol 4 np in wastewater samples were quantified via liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry lc ms after solid phase extraction at different stages of wastewater treatment and associated receiving waters the concentrations of the target compounds in wastewater ranged from loq limit of quantification to 158 ng l for tanilba bay wwtw and loq to 162 ng l for belmont wwtw most target compounds significantly declined after the secondary treatment phase appreciable removal efficiency throughout the treatment process was observed with removal from 39 21 to 99 98 of influent values at both wwtws the reduction of the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and 4 t op were significantly greater than ee2 bpa and 4 np in both wwtws risk quotients rqs were calculated to assess potential ecological risks from individual estrogenic compounds in predicted diluted effluents no targeted compounds showed any ecological risk rq 1 65 10 2 at both wwtws similarly all rqs for shore samples at both wwtws were below 1 finally the hazard index hi which represents combined estrogenic contaminants ecological risk indicated no mentionable risk for predicted diluted effluents hi 0 0097 to 0 0218

efficiency ecological risk assessment 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system arising from both natural and man made origins estrogens either natural or synthetic and xenoestrogens industrial chemicals with structural similarity to estrogens derived from municipal and industrial sources are released into aquatic environments via wastewater treatment works wwtws effluents exposure to estrogenic chemicals has been reported to cause reproductive abnormalities in aquatic animals exemplified by intersex in males altered oogenesis in females jobling et al 1998 andrew et al 2010 baumann et al 2013 and induction of vitellogenin in oviparous species tran et al 2019 humans and animals produce natural estrogens such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 from cholesterol and pregnenolone mosa et al 2015 synthetic estrogens e g 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 originate from the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies aris et al 2014 du et al 2020 xenoestrogens or industrial chemicals such as bisphenol a bpa 4 t octyl phenol 4 t op and 4 nonyl phenol 4 np originate from industrial manufacturing practice including the production of plastic and epoxy resins lubricating oil additives emulsifiers solubilisers the inner coatings of many food and beverage products surfactants laundry detergents dish detergents and personal care products husain and qayyum 2013 diao et al 2017 humans and livestock can metabolise natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds to produce water soluble and biologically inactive sulfate or glucuronide conjugates that are excreted through urine liu et al 2015 whereas escherichia coli in the gut can deconjugate estrogens via β glucuronidase and sulfatase activities resulting in free estrogens excreted through faeces aris et al 2014 ervin et al 2019 however bacteria in wwtws can convert the inactive conjugates to free estrogens aris et al 2014 thus in wwtws most of the natural and synthetic estrogens are deconjugated or in free form some are conjugated and some are further biodegraded through bacterial action liu et al 2015 conventionally urban and rural authorities use primary 1 secondary 2 or tertiary 3 wastewater treatment processes that are not comprehensibly designed and well suited to remove all estrogenic compounds from wastewater atkinson et al 2012 andrew priestley et al 2012 in brief the pretreatment process removes medium to large suspended solids primary treatment removes grit oil or grease through primary clarifiers and then a subsequent sedimentation process is sequentially followed by an adsorption mechanism however most estrogenic compounds are polar and hydrophilic and thus removal efficiency is low for primary treatment secondary treatment is the key process to reduce micropollutants along with other organic pollutants via microbial degradation processes i e aerobic and anaerobic using either naturally recruited or specifically cultured strains or by abiotic techniques i e chemical or modern physicochemical separation such as membrane bioreactor mbbr activated sludge processes integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas process trickling filter process extended aeration i e intermittent decant extended aeration idea and modified ludzack ettinger mle etc advanced tertiary treatment processes function to remove nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus via denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal via physical i e ion exchange granular activated

mno2 feo4 2 etc before discharging treated effluents into nearby waterways koh et al 2008 ting and praveena 2017 conventional wastewater treatment techniques can significantly reduce edcs in effluents however considerable loads of estrogenic compounds including pharmaceuticals still enter nearby waterways via effluent release liu et al 2015 archer et al 2017 borea et al 2019 for example cargouet et al 2004 found that the removal efficiency of natural and synthetic estrogens in wwtws with an activated sludge process and denitrification was 45 77 for e1 43 70 for e2 and 34 45 for ee2 huang et al 2014 revealed that natural estrogens were removed with high efficiency 75 92 and removal of phenolic edcs was comparatively lower 62 85 through the anoxic anaerobic anoxic membrane bioreactor ambr and anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o technologies most research examining the presence of estrogenic chemicals in wastewater and receiving waters internationally has been conducted in freshwater where the treatment processes and release of effluent differ markedly compared to estuarine and marine wwtws which generally have high to moderate salinity greater anticipated dilution rates and service larger catchment sizes further most published studies to date have examined estrogenic chemicals in effluent and receiving waters with little examination of removal efficiencies from influents to post secondary and tertiary treatment steps thus the aims of this study were to i determine the concentrations and predicted estrogenic activities i e calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs of seven common estrogenic compounds e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np at different stages of wastewater treatment in two wwtws that differ in their treatment strategies and in their marine and estuarine receiving waters in the hunter region along the new south wales nsw south east coast of australia ii assess the removal efficiency of the target compounds throughout the entire treatment process at both wwtws iii quantify the associations among the target compounds at various stages of the treatment process and their relationship to total organic carbon toc and finally iv conduct an ecological risk assessment for effluents and receiving waters based on the determined ceeqs and the risk factors risk quotients rqs and hazard indices his derived by comparing observed concentrations to established predicted no effects concentrations pnecs for adverse biological effects of estrogenic compounds to aquatic taxa 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 tanilba bay wwtw tanilba bay wwtw is a 3 treatment plant located next to tilligerry creek on the inner port of port stephens nsw and services a population of approximately 20 000 people the plant has a flow of 1 5 megalitres d that is treated using an intermittent decant extended aeration idea process with uv disinfection and release of effluents into four infiltration ponds in brief after physical screening and sedimentation in primary treatment the effluents are transferred to an extended aeration tank to oxidise volatile organic chemicals these steps also include a sequencing batch reactor sbr configuration to manage high intermittent ammonia loads during high rainfall events and microbiological action the aeration is stopped regularly to settle the sludge and microorganisms and to decant clear effluents this process can create an affable condition to promote certain nitrifying bacteria enabling the conversion of nitrates into nitrogen gas finally activated sludge and solids are removed via sludge lagoons then the secondary effluents are treated by uv disinfection to destroy microorganisms including pathogens and facilitate oxidation of benzene ring containing organic compounds to produce shorter carbonyl groups koh et al 2008 as an extra polishing step effluent passes through infiltration ponds before migration towards the estuary via the groundwater table and re emergence in tilligerry creek 2 1 2 belmont wwtw belmont wwtw is also a 3 treatment plant located on the eastern side of lake macquarie in newcastle nsw australia this wwtw processes 29 megalitres d of residential wastewater for an estimated population of 115 000 people the plant uses a modified ludzack ettinger mle process for biological nitrogen removal and comprises an inlet works five bioreactors and four secondary clarifiers the mle process is the combination of an anoxic and aerobic treatment ammonia removal occurs as nitrate is formed in the aerobic zone through nitrification followed by recycling the nitrate rich mixed liquor to the anoxic zone for denitrification liu and wang 2017 in brief after physical screening and grit removal in primary treatment the effluents move to an aeration tank to remove co2 oxidise volatile organic chemicals and remove dissolved metals and hydrogen sulfide by supplying air and water then the secondary effluents are transferred to clarifiers to remove suspended solids activated sludge a trickling filter process is employed as a post sedimentation step this mle process employs nitrifying bacteria for the removal of bod ammonia and nitrate nitrite treated effluent from belmont wwtw is combined with treated effluent from edgeworth toronto and dora creek wwtws before discharging to ocean water a combined discharge of 44 megalitres d enters the pacific ocean through an extended ocean outfall approximately 1 500 m offshore at a depth of 25m in soft sandy sediments a total of 168 diffusers are located along the terminal 187 m length of the outfall 2 2 sample collection and processing in both wwtws samples were collected from several stages of the treatment process along with the receiving waters weekly over six weeks from november 2019 to january 2020 for tanilba bay wwtw the samples were collected from raw influents secondary effluents after uv treatment final effluents infiltration pond 4 and tilligerry creek farm road in the estuarine environment fig 1 at belmont wwtw samples were collected from raw influents secondary effluents final effluents and beach water from redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal street fig 1 the sequential treatment processes within the two wwtws are displayed in fig 2 on each sampling occasion at each sampling point 1l of sample was collected and instantly ph adjusted ph 2 via the addition of 10 fold diluted 32 hydrochloric acid hcl the whole sample was then passed through a cellulose acetate syringe filter 0 45 µm to remove any particulate matter subsequently the following steps were carried out i 30 ml of each sample was used to measure total carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and the total organic carbon toc using a toc l analyzer shimadzu japan following standard protocols mosquera corral et al 2005 and ii before the extraction of water samples 500 ml for target estrogenic compounds silica based c18 dionex solex 6 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges were preconditioned and proceeded for final extraction followed by optimised protocols to capture the target compounds zhu et al 2015 2 3 solid phase extraction spe and lcms analysis target chemical standards e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np uhplc grade sigma aldrich were dissolved in appropriate organic solvents viz meoh dmso and used for optimisation on the lc ms system in negative ion mode esi see supplementary fig s1 and table s2 spike tests and method validation were undertaken through solid phase extraction using milli q and ocean water samples using dionex c18 silica based spe cartridges followed by standard methods with modifications see supplementary fig s2 zhu et al 2015 subsequently the environmental samples from the various stages of both wwtws and the receiving marine and estuarine waters were filtered through spe cartridges the cartridges extracted following optimised protocols zhu 2015 islam et al 2021 and finally run through the lc ms system with matrix matched chemical standards see supplementary materials materials and methods for the names of the chemical standards and the experimental details of spe extraction and lcms analysis 2 4 removal efficiencies res of estrogenic compounds removal efficiencies res were calculated based on the concentrations of the target compounds in raw influents and treated effluents using the following equation 1 re c inf c eff c inf 100 where re is removal efficiency cinf and ceff are the influent and effluent concentrations of individual estrogenic compounds respectively target compound concentrations of individual sampling days or replicates each day s sample considered as one replicate at various stages of treatment were employed to calculate the re when chemical concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used for re calculation environmental protection agency 2017 2 5 ecological risk assessment for aquatic taxa 2 5 1 calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs the calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs of samples were computed based on eq 2 using the estradiol equivalency factors eefs and the detected concentrations of the seven target estrogenic compounds eef is defined as the quotient of ec50e2 ec50compound representing the ratio of the ec50 of e2 and that of the target compound liu et al 2020 rather than our own bioassay results the eefs of the target compounds were previously reported in the literature by studies employing either the in vitro e screen cell proliferation assay or the in vivo fish vtg vitellogenin induction assay leusch et al 2009 followed by comparing the ec50 results of the compounds with that of e2 2 ceeq i 1 n c i ee f i n 1 2 7 here ci is the concentration ng l detected for a target compound and eefi is the estradiol equivalency factor of the target compound when chemical concentrations were below the loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used in our ceeq calculation environmental protection agency 2017 2 5 2 risk quotients rqs and hazard indices his the risk quotient rq is the ratio of the individual compound concentration and the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec derived based on the noecs no observed effect concentrations for chronic reproductive effects reported in multiple aquatic species reviewed in tran et al 2019 eq 3 the sum of the rqs forms the hazard index hi eq 4 these two indices are widely employed for the ecological risk assessment of estrogenic compounds in the aquatic environment liu et al 2020 and are calculated as follows 3 rq c i pne c i 4 hi i 1 n r q i n 1 2 7 where ci the concentration ng l detected for a target estrogenic compound and pneci is the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec derived from the noecs no observed effect concentrations for chronic reproductive toxicity reported in multiple aquatic taxa or the extrapolation based on the compound s potency to cause vitellogenin induction relative to e2 as measured in a fish vtg assay see pnecs long term effects in table 1 also tran et al 2019 for a summary of different methodological approaches used for pnec determination when sample concentrations were below the loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used for rq calculation environmental protection agency 2017 along with sampling environmental waters at shoreline sites in tanilba bay and belmont rqs and his in the immediate receiving waters of the wwtws were estimated employing dilution factors for effluents from hydrodynamic modelling hydrodynamic modelling studies have been undertaken for the receiving environments of tanilba bay and belmont wwtws which involved the use of fluorescein tracers to estimate conservative worst case dilution factors accounting for hydrodynamic mixing processes including tides currents and depth for tanilba bay wwtw which discharges into tilligerry creek a minimum dilution factor of 0 01 100 1 is achieved as groundwater moves out into the estuary at 100 m from shore in a depth of 3 m jacobs 2017 for belmont wwtw a dilution factor of 0 02 50 1 is achieved within 300 m of the outfall diffuser 95 of the time ghd 2019 thus effluent estrogen concentrations were multiplied by dilution factors before calculating rqs and his for these receiving environments single chemical exposure effects are expressed as rqs and the chemical mixture effects are expressed as σrq or hi to interpret rq results risk rankings relative to the pnecs are divided into very low to no risk rq 1 0 and at risk rq 1 0 negative reproductive effects predicted to aquatic taxa the same risk rankings were employed for interpreting hi results goumenou and tsatsakis 2019 liu et al 2020 it is known that edcs may display non monotonic dose response relationships nmdrs experimentally especially in in vitro tests and in vivo mechanistic studies matthiessen et al 2017 for this reason there is concern over the reliability of the concentration based approach for risk assessment of edcs however given that nmdrs are not expected to be translated to adverse apical endpoints matthiessen et al 2017 which include the chronic reproductive endpoints at the individual level used to derive pnecs caldwell et al 2012 also reviewed in tran et al 2019 it is unlikely that the risk quotients rq and thus the hazard indices σrq or hi derived here would be impacted by nmdrs 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted in the spss statistical software package version 22 0 spss inc firstly differences in toc tic and tc among stages of the wwtws were assessed via a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test similarly the comparison of the target compounds at different sampling points of wwtws were analysed via a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test all data were assessed for normality using the shapiro wilks test and further assessed for homogeneity of variance using levene s test data were transformed if significant deviations from normality or heterogeneous variance were observed prior to undertaking anova log10 transformation prior to analysis quinn and keough 2002 to reject the null hypothesis outcomes of statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 principal components analysis pca is a multivariate ordination method in which samples from different wwtw stages are plotted on principal components pcs which are low dimensional solutions of correlated independent variables i e target estrogenic compounds the coefficients are termed eigenvectors and represent the strength of the relationship between the individual compounds and the pc loadings greater than 0 7 were considered strongly correlated with the pc the extent to which the pcs represent the true relationship between the samples in the high dimensional space was summarised by the variance explained a percentage from eigenvalues data were log x 1 transformed and normalised prior to entry into pca anderson 2008 in primer 7 primer e version 7 a pearson bivariate correlation rs matrix with all compounds along with toc at different sampling points of the wwtw process was also performed spss statistical software package version 22 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 measurement of carbon contaminants in wastewater samples the raw influent of tanilba bay wwtw contained 59 24 5 07 mg l of toc which significantly declined after secondary treatment post uv but remained almost similar in final effluent and infiltration pond waters 9 58 0 41 to 10 33 0 58 mg l and finally experienced a further significant decline in tilligerry creek receiving waters 4 68 0 66 mg l fig 3 a also see supplementary table s1 the overall removal efficiency re of toc was 83 84 similar removal efficiencies were observed for tic and tc which were 85 26 and 84 39 respectively thus it is reasonable to infer that the idea tertiary treatment process at tanilba bay wwtw is effective in reducing carbon based contamination fig 3c in belmont wwtw the toc of the raw influent was 52 62 6 57 mg l which significantly declined in secondary effluents 11 97 0 61 mg l and final effluents 7 78 0 45 mg l further significant declines were observed in redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal street containing 2 19 0 41 and 2 37 0 56 mg l respectively fig 3b also see supplementary table s1 the re of toc was at 85 21 through the influences of the mle treatment process implying that belmont wwtw was effective in removing carbon contamination similar removal efficiency patterns were observed for tic 90 10 and tc 87 09 fig 3d removal efficiencies were slightly higher at belmont wwtw than at tanilba bay wwtw 3 2 assessment of estrogenic compounds through lc ms analysis 3 2 1 spike test and method validation two types of spiked samples milli q water and ocean water were used to assess methodological recovery and matrix effects integrated with solvents throughout the extraction procedure triplicate n 3 spike tests were performed using a mixture of the target compounds previously optimised in lcms system also see supplementary table s2 and fig s1 at environmentally relevant concentrations i e e1 20 ng l e2 10 ng l e3 5 ng l ee2 5 ng l bpa 500 ng l 4 t op 500 ng l and 4 np 5 000 ng l leusch et al 2009 allinson et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 scott et al 2014 french et al 2015 tran et al 2019 islam et al 2020 the mean percentage recoveries of milli q water samples were determined to be 123 106 136 108 96 0 85 6 and 60 3 for e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np respectively supplementary table 3 however lower recovery rates were found for the ocean water spike with 81 5 110 49 0 87 0 82 0 61 6 and 39 6 for e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np respectively supplementary table s3 most spiked recoveries were satisfactory except for low recoveries of two target compounds e3 and 4 np in the ocean water samples lower recoveries in seawater may be attributable to seawater matrix components and the hydrophilic nature of residual components of inorganic salts and their resultant polarity effects 3 2 2 concentrations of estrogenic compounds the concentrations of the target compounds were similar between influents of the two wwtws despite significant differences in catchment size and volume of water processed daily table 1 exceptions were e1 e2 bpa and np which were 2 3 times higher in concentration in belmont wwtw than in tanilba bay wwtw the concentrations of most estrogenic compounds were higher in the raw influents and significantly lower post secondary treatment concentrations remained largely similar throughout the remainder of the treatment process as well as in receiving waters in tanilba bay wwtw all target compounds except ee2 and bpa were generally higher in influents than in effluents secondary and tertiary and receiving waters e1 concentrations were 24 71 3 14 ng l 8 69 4 19 ng l 5 09 3 36 ng l 2 54 1 67 ng l and 0 64 0 32 ng l for raw influent secondary effluent after uv infiltration pond 4 final effluent and tilligerry creek farm road tcfr respectively the estrogenic compound load in the raw influent was significantly higher than those in the final effluent and tcfr f 6 684 df 4 p 0 001 e2 was determined to be 7 88 1 56 ng l for raw influent which significantly declined at all subsequent sampling points f 6 720 df 4 p 0 001 with the final effluents and tcfr points below the limit of quantification loq 0 05 ng l a similar trend was observed for e3 the concentration detected for raw influent 109 94 6 99 ng l was significantly higher than those detected for all other sampling points f 7 541 df 4 p 0 001 for ee2 no significant differences were found among the sampling points although there was a trend for the influent concentration 7 72 5 41 ng l to be higher than the other sampling points similarly bpa concentrations also showed no significant difference among the sampling points ranging from influent at 52 28 6 60 ng l to receiving waters tcfr at 16 52 6 05 ng l for 4 t op the raw influent concentration 158 12 ng l was significantly greater than the other sampling points f 27 130 df 4 p 0 001 in the case of 4 np the concentration detected for influent 28 57 1 30 ng l was significantly higher than that detected for receiving waters 12 15 2 02 ng l but did not significantly differ from those detected for any of the other sampling points including effluents at belmont wwtw similar declines during the treatment process were observed with lower target compound concentrations in secondary and tertiary effluents and receiving waters than in initial influents the e1 concentration in the influent 46 11 28 1 ng l was significantly higher than all other sampling points the final effluent was 0 72 0 30 ng l while redhead beach sampling rhbs and blacksmiths awabakal st bas were lower than loq 0 05 ng l f 16 017 df 4 p 0 001 in a similar trend the concentration of e2 was detected to be significantly higher in influent 13 84 7 80 ng l than in the samples collected at any of the downstream sampling points where the e2 concentrations detected for final effluent and receiving waters were below loq f 14 322 df 4 p 0 001 comparable to its natural estrogen counterparts e3 was detected at a higher concentration in influent 92 13 15 77 ng l than in any of the samples collected downstream f 15 185 df 4 p 0 001 similar to tanilba bay wwtw ee2 concentrations in belmont wwtw remained relatively constant throughout the treatment process although a trend existed for the influents 6 82 6 72 ng l to be greater than the effluent and both beach samples at loq f 0 824 df 4 p 0 05 in terms of the industrial chemicals the bpa concentration in influent 117 19 ng l was significantly higher than those in final effluent 10 75 4 97 ng l rhbs 11 40 4 14 ng l and bas 7 61 0 91 ng l f 4 874 df 4 p 0 05 the same trend was observed for 4 t op f 5 672 df 4 p 0 01 however 4 np did not decline during the wwtw process nor in receiving waters due to greater temporal variability among samples f 0 622 df 4 p 0 05 3 2 3 multivariate analysis for tanilba bay wwtw the pca revealed two principal components fig 4 a the first component factor explained 62 of the variability in data and was highly positively correlated with e1 e2 e3 ee2 and 4 t op the second component factor explained 14 of the variability in the data and was positively loaded with bpa similar to the findings from anova pca ordination diagrams revealed that influent samples were associated with higher concentrations of the natural estrogens and bpa and were dissimilar to all other stages of the treatment process finally receiving waters were most dissimilar exhibiting the lowest concentrations of estrogenic compounds fig 4a also see supplementary table s4 for belmont wwtw the pca also revealed two principal components fig 4b the first component factor explained 67 of the variability in data and was highly positively correlated with e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa and 4 t op the second component factor explained 16 of the variability in the data and was positively loaded with 4 np pca ordination diagrams indicated that influent samples were associated with higher concentrations of the natural estrogens ee2 4 t op bpa and 4 np and were dissimilar to other stages of the treatment process finally receiving waters were most dissimilar exhibiting the lowest concentrations of estrogens and xenoestrogens excepting 4 np which was elevated fig 4b also see supplementary table s4 pearson correlation rs analysis among the various estrogenic compounds supplementary table s5 showed similar patterns to the pca analysis the three natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and 4 op were all highly correlated in tanilba bay samples suggesting similar patterns of decline throughout the wastewater treatment process bpa and 4 np were moderately correlated with other estrogenic compounds while ee2 was uncorrelated with other estrogenic compounds in belmont wwtw e1 e2 e3 4 t op and bpa were all highly correlated exhibiting similar patterns of decline throughout the treatment process in contrast ee2 and 4 np concentrations were uncorrelated to other estrogenic compounds exhibiting elevations in oceanic water post treatment also toc was highly correlated with the three natural estrogens at both wwtws but a moderate correlation was found with bpa and 4 t op and a weaker correlation found with 4 np interestingly no correlation was found with ee2 3 2 4 removal efficiency of estrogenic compounds in wwtws the res of both wwtws ranged from 39 21 to 99 98 fig 5 in tanilba bay wwtw the three natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and the industrial chemical 4 t op were removed with the highest efficiency at 89 72 99 62 99 98 and 95 28 respectively while the res of the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bpa and 4 np were much lower at 77 49 44 85 and 39 21 respectively at belmont wwtw similar trends occurred for the three natural estrogens bpa and 4 t op with res ranging from 89 75 to 99 97 while lower res were observed for ee2 and 4 np 75 67 and 77 96 respectively overall belmont wwtw was more efficacious at removing natural estrogens and industrial chemicals with lower removal efficiencies for ee2 bpa and 4 np at tanilba bay wwtp in summary all three natural estrogens were effectively removed via tertiary treatment but low to moderate removal efficiency was observed for the synthetic estrogen and the industrial edcs 4 ecological risk assessment 4 1 calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs ceeqs as a measure of predicted estrogenic activity calculated based on the concentrations of the target compounds and their eefs were computed for the environmental samples collected at different stages of the wastewater treatment process at both tanilba bay and belmont wwtws among the different sampling points at tanilba bay wwtw ceeqs were highest in influent e screen 25 65 ng l fish vtg 245 ng l dramatically reduced in final effluent e screen 0 27 ng l fish vtg 6 82 ng l and lowest in receiving waters e screen 0 07 ng l fish vtg 1 28 ng l table 1 and supplementary table s6 a similar decline in ceeqs was also observed along the wastewater treatment process at belmont wwtw ceeqs were highest in influent e screen 29 47 ng l fish vtg 244 13 ng l substantially reduced in secondary e screen 5 83 ng l fish vtg 84 90 ng l and final e screen 0 08 ng l fish vtg 1 49 ng l effluents and lowest in receiving waters e screen 0 08 ng l for both beach sampling points fish vtg 0 98 and 0 94 ng l for redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal st respectively collectively at both wwtws ceeqs generally declined with the stage of the treatment process 4 2 rqs and his for tanilba bay wwtw the rqs of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np in predicted diluted effluent sample were evaluated to be 4 23 10 3 1 25 10 4 4 17 10 6 1 65 10 2 1 75 10 5 6 09 10 4 and 3 50 10 4 respectively whereas these values were 0 106 0 013 0 00 0 250 0 001 0 067 and 0 018 respectively for tcfr estuarine receiving waters table 2 the overall his were 0 0218 for predicted diluted effluents and 0 455 for receiving waters table 2 for the belmont wwtw effluents the rqs of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np were 2 39 10 3 2 50 10 3 8 33 10 6 5 0 10 3 1 34 10 5 1 99 10 3 and 5 22 10 5 respectively table 2 the rqs of marine receiving waters for the target compounds ranged from 0 001 to 0 250 lastly the his of the predicted diluted effluents rhbs and bas samples were 0 0097 0 522 and 0 393 respectively table 2 5 discussion 5 1 estrogenic compounds and their removal efficiencies in wwtws for both tanilba bay and belmont wwtws influents were generally higher in carbon contaminants and the concentration of estrogenic compounds while concentrations significantly decreased post secondary treatment and then largely remained similar for the remainder of the treatment process and finally in receiving waters it is well established that the secondary treatment process can remove organic contaminants along with micropollutants like estrogenic compounds more specifically secondary biological treatment processes are the key treatment process to remove micropollutants through microbial degradation and or biotransformation koh et al 2008 our findings largely mirror what others have observed when estrogens have been assayed throughout the wastewater treatment process in a study of five wwtws in the uk estrogenic contaminants were observed to decrease markedly as wastewater progressed through the plants with most reductions occurring post secondary treatment kirk et al 2002 similarly in a study examining three municipal wastewater treatment plants in australia estrogenic compounds were observed to decline significantly post secondary treatment in all three plants bain et al 2014 in terms of removal efficiency both wwtws were efficient in removing natural estrogens while less successful at removing ee2 bpa and 4 np especially at tanilba bay wwtw since removal efficiency varies with the specificity of treatment technologies it appeared that both the idea at tanilba bay wwtw and the mle treatment process at belmont wwtw are efficient in removing natural estrogens but for synthetic estrogens both treatment processes showed moderate removal efficacy however for industrial chemicals particularly for bpa and 4 np the mle process at belmont wwtw showed relatively higher efficacy perhaps attributable to the combination of an anoxic and aerobic treatment process liu and wang 2017 tran and gin 2017 although little research is available examining the removal efficiency of estrogenic compounds by wwtws baronti et al 2000 revealed that the average removal efficiency of natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds through the activated sludge process was 12 94 78 92 and 68 84 for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively as evaluated by cargouet et al 2004 the removal efficiencies were 45 77 for e1 43 70 for e2 and 34 45 for ee2 at wwtws in which activated sludge process along with denitrification techniques were employed on the other hand schullerer et al 2002 found that activated sludge along with activated carbon processes in wwtws can remove e1 for 80 97 e2 for 65 96 and ee2 for 33 93 huang et al 2014 examined sewage treatment plants around dianchi lake in china where the natural estrogens were removed with high efficiency 75 92 and phenolic edcs were comparatively lower 62 85 archer et al 2017 assessed the daily loads and fate of a broad array of emerging chemicals including pharmaceuticals personal care products edcs illicit drugs and their metabolites along different stages of treatment in a wwtw in south africa and found that the average removal efficiency of bpa was 88 overall the findings of this study have similarities with the other studies globally with natural estrogens being removed with greater efficiency while the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bpa 4 t op and 4 np are more recalcitrant overall concentrations of estrogenic compounds in effluents at both wwtws were similar to effluents found in other australian wwtws although concentrations in receiving waters were generally lower than those observed in other australian studies table 1 differences are likely attributable to the fact that most australian data are from freshwater rivers with lower dilution rates than marine waters suggesting estuarine and marine release is likely to be of lower ecological concern 5 2 possible biodegradation pathways of estrogenic compounds two major findings of the current investigation are that secondary treatment where bacterial action is a feature in treatment significantly decreases estrogenic load further it was found that natural estrogens were more likely to be removed while the synthetic estrogen and industrial chemicals were less responsive to degradation at secondary treatment the bacterial consortia available at secondary treatment likely facilitate the degradation of estrogens but the variability in metabolic pathways used to degrade estrogens among taxa and compounds within taxa could explain lower removal efficiencies for xenoestrogens bacterial degradation and transformation of estrogens have species specific and compound specific pathways zhang et al 2016 islam et al 2020 possible biodegradation pathways of natural estrogens such as e2 can be degraded to 4 oh e2 intermediates and subsequent meta cleavage subsequent hydroxylation on base ring a is initiated and then meta cleavage occurs on the other hand an e2 degradation pathway of hydroxy e2 keto e1 keto e2 and 3 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyprop 2 enoic acid can be initiated dependent on bacterial strain kurisu et al 2010 the intermediate metabolite estra 1 3 5 10 16 tetraen 3 ol estratetraenol e0 can be produced from e2 by nitrosomonas europaea via dehydration on the d ring at position c 17 nakai et al 2011 more commonly e2 can be degraded to e1 by hydroxylation on d ring at c 17 then 4 oh e1 on a ring at c 4 and further meta cleavage yu et al 2013 finally e2 degradation pathways can also produce metabolites with lactone on the d ring in mixed sewage bacteria and then enter the tca cycle for further degradation in energy producing pathways yu et al 2013 lee and liu 2002 synthetic estrogens such as ee2 and industrial chemicals such as np op and bpa vary significantly in their degradation pathways which may contribute to their observed lower removal efficiencies observed in the current study ee2 for example converts to 2 oh ee2 at the c 2 position by hydroxylation on the a ring representing a co metabolic transformation by nitrifying bacteria yu et al 2013 sphingomonas sp ttnp3 can use np or its isomers and produce 3 5 dimethyl 3 heptanol 2 1 ethyl 1 3 dimethylpentyl 1 4 benzenediol or 4 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl phenol hydroxylated metabolites these can be further biodegraded to 2 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl 1 4 benzenediol and 4 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl oxy phenol as catabolite yields corvini et al 2006 on the other hand bpa is degraded by gram negative sphingomonas sp mv1 to produce phenonium ion intermediates which then undergo catabolism into two metabolites 1 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 propanol major and 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l propanol minor through hydroxylation zhang et al 2013 hence the differences in metabolic degradation pathways between natural estrogens and xenoestrogens could explain their differential removal efficiency throughout the wastewater treatment process 5 3 relationships among estrogenic compounds through principal components analysis pca tanilba bay wwtw revealed a pc representing 62 of the variability in the data and was highly correlated with the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemical 4 t op while a component representing 67 of the variability was true for the pca at belmont showing a strong correlation with the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 ee2 bpa and 4 t op in both cases a very strong correlation approx 93 97 was found among the natural estrogens and reflects their human origin and common mechanisms of degradation during wastewater treatment transit the strong relationship among the industrial chemicals bpa 4 np and 4 t op including high correlations and at times separate components describing their variability are largely attributable to their industrial origins and their recalcitrant nature during the wastewater treatment process pearson correlation rs analysis among the various estrogenic compounds showed almost similar patterns to the pca analysis besides toc was highly correlated with natural estrogens i e e1 e2 and e3 at both wwtws around 80 but a moderate relationship was found with the two industrial chemicals i e bpa and 4 t op and a lower relationship found with 4 np that was up to 46 interestingly no relationship was found with the synthetic estrogen ee2 5 4 ecological risk assessment the predicted estrogenic activity or ceeqs in estuarine receiving water for tanilba bay wwtw in terms of e screen and fish vtg estimations were very low in the shoreline estuarine receiving water and were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for e2 in both short term and long term assessments in belmont wwtw the ceeq for shoreline marine receiving water locations was also very low lower than short and long term pnecs caldwell et al 2012 jarošová et al 2014 tran et al 2019 in terms of risk quotient and hazard index the current study revealed that the predicted diluted effluent samples of tanilba bay wwtw exhibited very low to no risk rq 1 for all target estrogenic compounds further shoreline estuarine receiving waters did not show any significant risk the overall hi for the predicted diluted effluent hi 0 0218 and the receiving shoreline estuarine water hi 0 455 indicated no predicted risk similarly the predicted diluted effluents at belmont wwtw followed the same pattern with low rq values for all target compounds and low hazard index hi 0 0097 the shoreline receiving ocean water at belmont exhibited the same pattern of relative risk with quotients 1 for all estrogens and the overall hazard index for the belmont shorelines also very low hi 0 393 to 0 522 theoretical modeling should be interpreted alongside monitoring data given that modeled contaminants do not necessarily behave in the same way as tracers and their solubility and thus dilution may be considerably different although very few studies to date report the ecological risk of typical estrogenic compounds sun et al 2013 explored rq values for natural estrogens ee2 and xenoestrogens in sewage effluents from several municipal sewage plants in beijing china and observed much greater risk quotients than the current study risk quotients rarely exceeded 1 for the natural estrogens e1 and e2 while the rq of ee2 was highest and ranged from 10 to 1 000 the rq values of e3 were the lowest with only 9 of samples greater than 1 whereas the 10 and 60 of the values were greater than 1 respectively for bpa and np indicating the high to moderate ecological risk of specific estrogenic compounds in that study similarly tan et al 2018 estimated the rq and the σrq hi for selected edcs in the xi river daliao river and hun river in china and 64 7 of the surface water sampling sites were evaluated as high risk largely associated with the high concentrations of ee2 and e1 overall values observed in effluents and receiving waters in this study in nsw australia generally posed a lower risk for biological effects compared to concentrations detected globally with a low to moderate risk detected for most samples in both wwtws 5 5 limitations as no bioassays were conducted in this study the estrogenic activities ceeqs presented here are only predicted values computed based on the measured concentrations and eeqs of the individual estrogenic compounds because these target compounds are considered the main contributors to estrogenic activity in wastewater jarošová et al 2014 it is reasonable to believe that these predicted values are useful for evaluating the removal efficiency of estrogenicity at the studied wwtws and the ecological risk of the receiving waters however it should be acknowledged that the estrogenic compounds studied here represent only a subset of edcs that are present in complex mixtures of chemical contaminants in sewage and aquatic systems considering the potential interactions amongst edcs such as competition for binding to hormone receptors it is possible that the predicted estrogenic activities reported here are under estimated or over estimated compared to those measured by bioassays depending on the composition and proportions of chemicals in the mixture previously ihara et al 2014 measured estrogenic activities of wwtw samples using erα reporter assays and compared the results with those predicted from chemical analysis of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 the authors found that all samples in which measured estrogenic activity was lower than predicted exhibited strong antiestrogenic activity likely caused by estrogen receptor er antagonists that coexist in wastewater these antagonists competitive and non competitive are able to suppress agonist mediated activation of the er in the reporter bioassays leading to a lowered net measured estrogenicity when they are present in appreciable concentrations examples of antiestrogenic compounds in effluents include disinfection by products dbps formed during chlorination wu et al 2009 2010 textile dyes bazin et al 2012 and other man made chemicals such as pfos and pfoa henry and fair 2013 as chlorination is not used by any of the studied wwtws dbps are unlikely a significant contributor to antiestrogenicity if any in the final effluents or receiving waters examined in this study however due to the lack of bioassay results we cannot exclude that other antiestrogenic compounds if present could partially mask the effect of the target estrogenic compounds and therefore the predicted estrogenic activities reported here may represent overestimation of the actual values this highlights a need for further research to quantify the effect of antiestrogenic compounds in wastewater 6 conclusions this study measured seven estrogenic compounds at various stages along the treatment process at two 3 wwtws and their individual marine and estuarine receiving waters in the lower hunter nsw australia in summary although significant quantities of estrogenic compounds were loaded at both wwtws the treatment processes especially secondary treatment largely removed most of these compounds wwtws were more effective at remediating natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and moderate to less effective for synthetic estrogen and industrial chemicals with the lowest removal efficiencies for ee2 and np besides correlation matrices and pca revealed similar declines in natural and synthetic estrogens along with bpa and 4 t op with the treatment process but did not show any relationship with 4 np it was found that toc was highly correlated with natural estrogens moderately correlated with industrial chemicals bpa and 4 t op barely correlated with 4 np and not correlated with the synthetic estrogen ee2 the ceeqs were relatively low and the rqs and his were all below 1 indicating minimal risk for adverse reproductive effects being elicited in aquatic taxa residing in receiving waters overall the wastewater treatment process at both locations removed the majority of estrogenic compounds in effluents and thus no upgrades to the treatment process are recommended to deal with estrogenic compounds such as membrane filtration activated carbon and ozonation treatment technologies further studies are required to explore the role of specific microbes in the biodegradation pathways of estrogenic compounds in wwtws credit authorship contribution statement rafiquel islam

16935,estrogenic compounds enter waterways via effluents from wastewater treatment works wwtw thereby indicating a potential risk to organisms inhabiting adjacent receiving waters however little is known about the loads or concentrations of estrogenic compounds that enter australian wwtws the efficiency of removing estrogenic compounds throughout the various stages of tertiary wwtw processes which are common in australia nor the concentrations released into estuarine or marine receiving waters and the associated risk for aquatic taxa residing in these environments therefore seven estrogenic compounds comprising the natural estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bisphenol a bpa 4 t octyl phenol 4 t op and 4 nonyl phenol 4 np in wastewater samples were quantified via liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry lc ms after solid phase extraction at different stages of wastewater treatment and associated receiving waters the concentrations of the target compounds in wastewater ranged from loq limit of quantification to 158 ng l for tanilba bay wwtw and loq to 162 ng l for belmont wwtw most target compounds significantly declined after the secondary treatment phase appreciable removal efficiency throughout the treatment process was observed with removal from 39 21 to 99 98 of influent values at both wwtws the reduction of the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and 4 t op were significantly greater than ee2 bpa and 4 np in both wwtws risk quotients rqs were calculated to assess potential ecological risks from individual estrogenic compounds in predicted diluted effluents no targeted compounds showed any ecological risk rq 1 65 10 2 at both wwtws similarly all rqs for shore samples at both wwtws were below 1 finally the hazard index hi which represents combined estrogenic contaminants ecological risk indicated no mentionable risk for predicted diluted effluents hi 0 0097 to 0 0218

efficiency ecological risk assessment 1 introduction endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system arising from both natural and man made origins estrogens either natural or synthetic and xenoestrogens industrial chemicals with structural similarity to estrogens derived from municipal and industrial sources are released into aquatic environments via wastewater treatment works wwtws effluents exposure to estrogenic chemicals has been reported to cause reproductive abnormalities in aquatic animals exemplified by intersex in males altered oogenesis in females jobling et al 1998 andrew et al 2010 baumann et al 2013 and induction of vitellogenin in oviparous species tran et al 2019 humans and animals produce natural estrogens such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 from cholesterol and pregnenolone mosa et al 2015 synthetic estrogens e g 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 originate from the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies aris et al 2014 du et al 2020 xenoestrogens or industrial chemicals such as bisphenol a bpa 4 t octyl phenol 4 t op and 4 nonyl phenol 4 np originate from industrial manufacturing practice including the production of plastic and epoxy resins lubricating oil additives emulsifiers solubilisers the inner coatings of many food and beverage products surfactants laundry detergents dish detergents and personal care products husain and qayyum 2013 diao et al 2017 humans and livestock can metabolise natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds to produce water soluble and biologically inactive sulfate or glucuronide conjugates that are excreted through urine liu et al 2015 whereas escherichia coli in the gut can deconjugate estrogens via β glucuronidase and sulfatase activities resulting in free estrogens excreted through faeces aris et al 2014 ervin et al 2019 however bacteria in wwtws can convert the inactive conjugates to free estrogens aris et al 2014 thus in wwtws most of the natural and synthetic estrogens are deconjugated or in free form some are conjugated and some are further biodegraded through bacterial action liu et al 2015 conventionally urban and rural authorities use primary 1 secondary 2 or tertiary 3 wastewater treatment processes that are not comprehensibly designed and well suited to remove all estrogenic compounds from wastewater atkinson et al 2012 andrew priestley et al 2012 in brief the pretreatment process removes medium to large suspended solids primary treatment removes grit oil or grease through primary clarifiers and then a subsequent sedimentation process is sequentially followed by an adsorption mechanism however most estrogenic compounds are polar and hydrophilic and thus removal efficiency is low for primary treatment secondary treatment is the key process to reduce micropollutants along with other organic pollutants via microbial degradation processes i e aerobic and anaerobic using either naturally recruited or specifically cultured strains or by abiotic techniques i e chemical or modern physicochemical separation such as membrane bioreactor mbbr activated sludge

mno2 feo4 2 etc before discharging treated effluents into nearby waterways koh et al 2008 ting and praveena 2017 conventional wastewater treatment techniques can significantly reduce edcs in effluents however considerable loads of estrogenic compounds including pharmaceuticals still enter nearby waterways via effluent release liu et al 2015 archer et al 2017 borea et al 2019 for example cargouet et al 2004 found that the removal efficiency of natural and synthetic estrogens in wwtws with an activated sludge process and denitrification was 45 77 for e1 43 70 for e2 and 34 45 for ee2 huang et al 2014 revealed that natural estrogens were removed with high efficiency 75 92 and removal of phenolic edcs was comparatively lower 62 85 through the anoxic anaerobic anoxic membrane bioreactor ambr and anaerobic anoxic oxic a a o technologies most research examining the presence of estrogenic chemicals in wastewater and receiving waters internationally has been conducted in freshwater where the treatment processes and release of effluent differ markedly compared to estuarine and marine wwtws which generally have high to moderate salinity greater anticipated dilution rates and service larger catchment sizes further most published studies to date have examined estrogenic chemicals in effluent and receiving waters with little examination of removal efficiencies from influents to post secondary and tertiary treatment steps thus the aims of this study were to i determine the concentrations and predicted estrogenic activities i e calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs of seven common estrogenic compounds e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np at different stages of wastewater treatment in two wwtws that differ in their treatment strategies and in their marine and estuarine receiving waters in the hunter region along the new south wales nsw south east coast of australia ii assess the removal efficiency of the target compounds throughout the entire treatment process at both wwtws iii quantify the associations among the target compounds at various stages of the treatment process and their relationship to total organic carbon toc and finally iv conduct an ecological risk assessment for effluents and receiving waters based on the determined ceeqs and the risk factors risk quotients rqs and hazard indices his derived by comparing observed concentrations to established predicted no effects concentrations pnecs for adverse biological effects of estrogenic compounds to aquatic taxa 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 tanilba bay wwtw tanilba bay wwtw is a 3 treatment plant located next to tilligerry creek on the inner port of port stephens nsw and services a population of approximately 20 000 people the plant has a flow of 1 5 megalitres d that is treated using an intermittent decant extended aeration idea process with uv disinfection and release of effluents into four infiltration ponds in brief after physical screening and sedimentation in primary treatment the effluents are transferred to an extended aeration tank to oxidise volatile organic chemicals these steps also include a sequencing batch reactor sbr configuration to manage high intermittent ammonia loads during high rainfall events and microbiological action the aeration is stopped regularly to settle the sludge and microorganisms and to decant clear effluents this process can create an affable condition to promote certain nitrifying bacteria enabling the conversion of nitrates into nitrogen gas finally activated sludge and solids are removed via sludge lagoons then the secondary effluents are treated by uv disinfection to destroy microorganisms including pathogens and facilitate oxidation of benzene ring containing organic compounds to produce shorter carbonyl groups koh et al 2008 as an extra polishing step effluent passes through infiltration ponds before migration towards the estuary via the groundwater table and re emergence in tilligerry creek 2 1 2 belmont wwtw belmont wwtw is also a 3 treatment plant located on the eastern side of lake macquarie in newcastle nsw australia this wwtw processes 29 megalitres d of residential wastewater for an estimated population of 115 000 people the plant uses a modified ludzack ettinger mle process for biological nitrogen removal and comprises an inlet works five bioreactors and four secondary clarifiers the mle process is the combination of an anoxic and aerobic treatment ammonia removal occurs as nitrate is formed in the aerobic zone through nitrification followed by recycling the nitrate rich mixed liquor to the anoxic zone for denitrification liu and wang 2017 in brief after physical screening and grit removal in primary treatment the effluents move to an aeration tank to remove co2 oxidise volatile organic chemicals and remove dissolved metals and hydrogen sulfide by supplying air and water then the secondary effluents are transferred to clarifiers to remove suspended solids activated sludge a trickling filter process is employed as a post sedimentation step this mle process employs nitrifying bacteria for the removal of bod ammonia and nitrate nitrite treated effluent from belmont wwtw is combined with treated effluent from edgeworth toronto and dora creek wwtws before discharging to ocean water a combined discharge of 44 megalitres d enters the pacific ocean through an extended ocean outfall approximately 1 500 m offshore at a depth of 25m in soft sandy sediments a total of 168 diffusers are located along the terminal 187 m length of the outfall 2 2 sample collection and processing in both wwtws samples were collected from several stages of the treatment process along with the receiving waters weekly over six weeks from november 2019 to january 2020 for tanilba bay wwtw the samples were collected from raw influents secondary effluents after uv treatment final effluents infiltration pond 4 and tilligerry creek farm road in the estuarine environment fig 1 at belmont wwtw samples were collected from raw influents secondary effluents final effluents and beach water from redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal street fig 1 the sequential treatment processes within the two wwtws are displayed in fig 2 on each sampling occasion at each sampling point 1l of sample was collected and instantly ph adjusted ph 2 via the addition of 10 fold diluted 32 hydrochloric acid hcl the whole sample was then passed through a cellulose acetate syringe filter 0 45 µm to remove any particulate matter subsequently the following steps were carried out i 30 ml of each sample was used to measure total carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic and the total organic carbon toc using a toc l analyzer shimadzu japan following standard protocols mosquera corral et al 2005 and ii before the extraction of water samples 500 ml for target estrogenic compounds silica based c18 dionex solex 6 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges were preconditioned and proceeded for final extraction followed by optimised protocols to capture the target compounds zhu et al 2015 2 3 solid phase extraction spe and lcms analysis target chemical standards e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np uhplc grade sigma aldrich were dissolved in appropriate organic solvents viz meoh dmso and used for optimisation on the lc ms system in negative ion mode esi see supplementary fig s1 and table s2 spike tests and method validation were undertaken through solid phase extraction using milli q and ocean water samples using dionex c18 silica based spe cartridges followed by standard methods with modifications see supplementary fig s2 zhu et al 2015 subsequently the environmental samples from the various stages of both wwtws and the receiving marine and estuarine waters were filtered through spe cartridges the cartridges extracted following optimised protocols zhu 2015 islam et al 2021 and finally run through the lc ms system with matrix matched chemical standards see supplementary materials materials and methods for the names of the chemical standards and the experimental details of spe extraction and lcms analysis 2 4 removal efficiencies res of estrogenic compounds removal efficiencies res were calculated based on the concentrations of the target compounds in raw influents and treated effluents using the following equation 1 re c inf c eff c inf 100 where re is removal efficiency cinf and ceff are the influent and effluent concentrations of individual estrogenic compounds respectively target compound concentrations of individual sampling days or replicates each day s sample considered as one replicate at various stages of treatment were employed to calculate the re when chemical concentrations were below the limit of quantification loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used for re calculation environmental protection agency 2017 2 5 ecological risk assessment for aquatic taxa 2 5 1 calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs the calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs of samples were computed based on eq 2 using the estradiol equivalency factors eefs and the detected concentrations of the seven target estrogenic compounds eef is defined as the quotient of ec50e2 ec50compound representing the ratio of the ec50 of e2 and that of the target compound liu et al 2020 rather than our own bioassay results the eefs of the target compounds were previously reported in the literature by studies employing either the in vitro e screen cell proliferation assay or the in vivo fish vtg vitellogenin induction assay leusch et al 2009 followed by comparing the ec50 results of the compounds with that of e2 2 ceeq i 1 n c i ee f i n 1 2 7 here ci is the concentration ng l detected for a target compound and eefi is the estradiol equivalency factor of the target compound when chemical concentrations were below the loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used in our ceeq calculation environmental protection agency 2017 2 5 2 risk quotients rqs and hazard indices his the risk quotient rq is the ratio of the individual compound concentration and the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec derived based on the noecs no observed effect concentrations for chronic reproductive effects reported in multiple aquatic species reviewed in tran et al 2019 eq 3 the sum of the rqs forms the hazard index hi eq 4 these two indices are widely employed for the ecological risk assessment of estrogenic compounds in the aquatic environment liu et al 2020 and are calculated as follows 3 rq c i pne c i 4 hi i 1 n r q i n 1 2 7 where ci the concentration ng l detected for a target estrogenic compound and pneci is the respective predicted no effect concentration pnec derived from the noecs no observed effect concentrations for chronic reproductive toxicity reported in multiple aquatic taxa or the extrapolation based on the compound s potency to cause vitellogenin induction relative to e2 as measured in a fish vtg assay see pnecs long term effects in table 1 also tran et al 2019 for a summary of different methodological approaches used for pnec determination when sample concentrations were below the loq 0 05 ng l 50 of the loq i e 0 025 ng l was used for rq calculation environmental protection agency 2017 along with sampling environmental waters at shoreline sites in tanilba bay and belmont rqs and his in the immediate receiving waters of the wwtws were estimated employing dilution factors for effluents from hydrodynamic modelling hydrodynamic modelling studies have been undertaken for the receiving environments of tanilba bay and belmont wwtws which involved the use of fluorescein tracers to estimate conservative worst case dilution factors accounting for hydrodynamic mixing processes including tides currents and depth for tanilba bay wwtw which discharges into tilligerry creek a minimum dilution factor of 0 01 100 1 is achieved as groundwater moves out into the estuary at 100 m from shore in a depth of 3 m jacobs 2017 for belmont wwtw a dilution factor of 0 02 50 1 is achieved within 300 m of the outfall diffuser 95 of the time ghd 2019 thus effluent estrogen concentrations were multiplied by dilution factors before calculating rqs and his for these receiving environments single chemical exposure effects are expressed as rqs and the chemical mixture effects are expressed as σrq or hi to interpret rq results risk rankings relative to the pnecs are divided into very low to no risk rq 1 0 and at risk rq 1 0 negative reproductive effects predicted to aquatic taxa the same risk rankings were employed for interpreting hi results goumenou and tsatsakis 2019 liu et al 2020 it is known that edcs may display non monotonic dose response relationships nmdrs experimentally especially in in vitro tests and in vivo mechanistic studies matthiessen et al 2017 for this reason there is concern over the reliability of the concentration based approach for risk assessment of edcs however given that nmdrs are not expected to be translated to adverse apical endpoints matthiessen et al 2017 which include the chronic reproductive endpoints at the individual level used to derive pnecs caldwell et al 2012 also reviewed in tran et al 2019 it is unlikely that the risk quotients rq and thus the hazard indices σrq or hi derived here would be impacted by nmdrs 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted in the spss statistical software package version 22 0 spss inc firstly differences in toc tic and tc among stages of the wwtws were assessed via a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test similarly the comparison of the target compounds at different sampling points of wwtws were analysed via a one way anova with tukey s hsd post hoc test all data were assessed for normality using the shapiro wilks test and further assessed for homogeneity of variance using levene s test data were transformed if significant deviations from normality or heterogeneous variance were observed prior to undertaking anova log10 transformation prior to analysis quinn and keough 2002 to reject the null hypothesis outcomes of statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 principal components analysis pca is a multivariate ordination method in which samples from different wwtw stages are plotted on principal components pcs which are low dimensional solutions of correlated independent variables i e target estrogenic compounds the coefficients are termed eigenvectors and represent the strength of the relationship between the individual compounds and the pc loadings greater than 0 7 were considered strongly correlated with the pc the extent to which the pcs represent the true relationship between the samples in the high dimensional space was summarised by the variance explained a percentage from eigenvalues data were log x 1 transformed and normalised prior to entry into pca anderson 2008 in primer 7 primer e version 7 a pearson bivariate correlation rs matrix with all compounds along with toc at different sampling points of the wwtw process was also performed spss statistical software package version 22 0 spss inc 3 results 3 1 measurement of carbon contaminants in wastewater samples the raw influent of tanilba bay wwtw contained 59 24 5 07 mg l of toc which significantly declined after secondary treatment post uv but remained almost similar in final effluent and infiltration pond waters 9 58 0 41 to 10 33 0 58 mg l and finally experienced a further significant decline in tilligerry creek receiving waters 4 68 0 66 mg l fig 3 a also see supplementary table s1 the overall removal efficiency re of toc was 83 84 similar removal efficiencies were observed for tic and tc which were 85 26 and 84 39 respectively thus it is reasonable to infer that the idea tertiary treatment process at tanilba bay wwtw is effective in reducing carbon based contamination fig 3c in belmont wwtw the toc of the raw influent was 52 62 6 57 mg l which significantly declined in secondary effluents 11 97 0 61 mg l and final effluents 7 78 0 45 mg l further significant declines were observed in redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal street containing 2 19 0 41 and 2 37 0 56 mg l respectively fig 3b also see supplementary table s1 the re of toc was at 85 21 through the influences of the mle treatment process implying that belmont wwtw was effective in removing carbon contamination similar removal efficiency patterns were observed for tic 90 10 and tc 87 09 fig 3d removal efficiencies were slightly

water were used to assess methodological recovery and matrix effects integrated with solvents throughout the extraction procedure triplicate n 3 spike tests were performed using a mixture of the target compounds previously optimised in lcms system also see supplementary table s2 and fig s1 at environmentally relevant concentrations i e e1 20 ng l e2 10 ng l e3 5 ng l ee2 5 ng l bpa 500 ng l 4

water samples were determined to be 123 106 136 108 96 0 85 6 and 60 3 for e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np respectively supplementary table 3 however lower recovery rates were found for the ocean water spike with 81 5 110 49 0 87 0 82 0 61 6 and 39 6 for e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np respectively supplementary table s3 most spiked recoveries were satisfactory except for low recoveries of two target compounds e3 and 4 np in the ocean water samples lower recoveries in seawater may be attributable to seawater matrix components and the hydrophilic nature of residual components of inorganic salts and their resultant polarity effects 3 2 2 concentrations of estrogenic compounds the concentrations of the target compounds were similar between influents of the two wwtws despite significant differences in catchment size and volume of water processed daily table 1 exceptions were e1 e2 bpa and np which were 2 3 times higher in concentration in belmont wwtw than in tanilba bay wwtw the concentrations of most estrogenic compounds were higher in the raw influents and significantly lower post secondary treatment concentrations remained largely similar throughout the remainder of the treatment process as well as in receiving waters in tanilba bay wwtw all target compounds except ee2 and bpa were generally higher in influents than in effluents secondary and tertiary and receiving waters e1 concentrations were 24 71 3 14 ng l 8 69 4 19 ng l 5 09 3 36 ng l 2 54 1 67 ng l and 0 64 0 32 ng l for raw influent secondary effluent after uv infiltration pond 4 final effluent and tilligerry creek farm road tcfr respectively the estrogenic compound load in the raw influent was significantly higher than those in the final effluent and tcfr f 6 684 df 4 p 0 001 e2 was determined to be 7 88 1 56 ng l for raw influent which significantly declined at all subsequent sampling points f 6 720 df 4 p 0 001 with the final effluents and tcfr points below the limit of

f 7 541 df 4 p 0 001 for ee2 no significant differences were found among the sampling points although there was a trend for the influent concentration 7 72 5 41 ng l to be higher than the other sampling points similarly bpa concentrations also showed no significant difference among the sampling points ranging from influent at 52 28 6 60 ng l to receiving waters tcfr at 16 52 6 05 ng l for 4 t op the raw influent concentration 158 12 ng l was significantly greater than the other sampling points f 27 130 df 4 p 0 001 in the case of 4 np the concentration detected for influent 28 57 1 30 ng l was significantly higher than that detected for receiving waters 12 15 2 02 ng l but did not significantly differ from those detected for any of the other sampling points including effluents at belmont wwtw similar declines during the treatment process were observed with lower target compound concentrations in secondary and tertiary effluents and receiving waters than in initial influents the e1 concentration in the influent 46 11 28 1 ng l was significantly higher than all other sampling points the final effluent was 0 72 0 30 ng l while redhead beach sampling rhbs and blacksmiths awabakal st bas were lower than loq 0 05 ng l f 16 017 df 4 p 0 001 in a similar trend the concentration of e2 was detected to be significantly higher in influent 13 84 7 80 ng l than in the samples

counterparts e3 was detected at a higher concentration in influent 92 13 15 77 ng l than in any of the samples collected downstream f 15 185 df 4 p 0 001 similar to tanilba bay wwtw ee2 concentrations in belmont wwtw remained relatively constant throughout the treatment process although a trend existed for the influents 6 82 6 72 ng l to be greater than the effluent and both beach samples at loq f 0 824 df 4 p 0 05 in terms of the industrial chemicals the bpa concentration in influent 117 19 ng l was significantly higher than those in final effluent 10 75 4 97 ng l rhbs 11 40 4 14 ng l and bas 7 61 0 91 ng l f 4 874 df 4 p 0 05 the same trend was observed for 4 t op f 5 672 df 4 p 0 01 however 4 np did not decline during the wwtw process nor in receiving waters due to greater temporal variability among samples f 0 622 df 4 p 0 05 3 2 3 multivariate analysis for tanilba bay wwtw the pca revealed two principal components fig 4 a the first component factor explained 62 of the variability in data and was highly positively correlated with e1 e2 e3 ee2 and 4 t op the second component factor explained 14 of the variability in the data and was positively loaded with bpa similar to the findings from anova pca ordination diagrams revealed that influent samples were associated with higher concentrations of the natural estrogens and bpa and were dissimilar to all other stages of the treatment process finally receiving waters were most dissimilar exhibiting the lowest concentrations of estrogenic compounds fig 4a also see supplementary table s4 for belmont wwtw the pca also revealed two principal components fig 4b the first component factor explained 67 of the variability in data and was highly positively correlated with e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa and 4 t op the second component factor explained 16 of the variability in the data and was positively loaded with 4 np pca ordination diagrams indicated that influent samples were associated with higher concentrations of the natural estrogens ee2 4 t op bpa and 4 np and were dissimilar to other stages of the treatment process finally receiving waters were most dissimilar exhibiting the lowest concentrations of estrogens and xenoestrogens excepting 4 np which was elevated fig 4b also see supplementary table s4 pearson correlation rs analysis among the various estrogenic compounds supplementary table s5 showed similar patterns to the pca analysis the three natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and 4 op were all highly correlated in tanilba bay samples suggesting similar patterns of decline throughout the wastewater treatment process bpa and 4 np were moderately correlated with other estrogenic compounds while ee2 was uncorrelated with other estrogenic compounds in belmont wwtw e1 e2 e3 4 t op and bpa were all highly correlated exhibiting similar patterns of decline throughout the treatment process in contrast ee2 and 4 np concentrations were uncorrelated to other estrogenic compounds exhibiting elevations in oceanic water post treatment also toc was highly correlated with the three natural estrogens at both wwtws but a moderate correlation was found with bpa and 4 t op and a weaker correlation found with 4 np interestingly no correlation was found with ee2 3 2 4 removal efficiency of estrogenic compounds in wwtws the res of both wwtws ranged from 39 21 to 99 98 fig 5 in tanilba bay wwtw the three natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and the industrial chemical 4 t op were removed with the highest efficiency at 89 72 99 62 99 98 and 95 28 respectively while the res of the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bpa and 4 np were much lower at 77 49 44 85 and 39 21 respectively at belmont wwtw similar trends occurred for the three natural estrogens bpa and 4 t op with res ranging from 89 75 to 99 97 while lower res were observed for ee2 and 4 np 75 67 and 77 96 respectively overall belmont wwtw was more efficacious at removing natural estrogens and industrial chemicals with lower removal efficiencies for ee2 bpa and 4 np at tanilba bay wwtp in summary all three natural estrogens were effectively removed via tertiary treatment but low to moderate removal efficiency was observed for the synthetic estrogen and the industrial edcs 4 ecological risk assessment 4 1 calculated estradiol equivalents ceeqs ceeqs as a measure of predicted estrogenic activity calculated based on the concentrations of the target compounds and their eefs were computed for the environmental samples collected at different stages of the wastewater treatment process at both tanilba bay and belmont wwtws among the different sampling points at tanilba bay wwtw ceeqs were highest in influent e screen 25 65 ng l fish vtg 245 ng l dramatically reduced in final effluent e screen 0 27 ng l fish vtg 6 82 ng l and lowest in receiving waters e screen 0 07 ng l fish vtg 1 28 ng l table 1 and supplementary table s6 a similar decline in ceeqs was also observed along the wastewater treatment process at belmont wwtw ceeqs were highest in influent e screen 29 47 ng l fish vtg 244 13 ng l substantially reduced in secondary e screen 5 83 ng l fish vtg 84 90 ng l and final e screen 0 08 ng l fish vtg 1 49 ng l effluents and lowest in receiving waters e screen 0 08 ng l for both beach sampling points fish vtg 0 98 and 0 94 ng l for redhead beach and blacksmiths awabakal st respectively collectively at both wwtws ceeqs generally declined with the stage of the treatment process 4 2 rqs and his for tanilba bay wwtw the rqs of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np in predicted diluted effluent sample were evaluated to be 4 23 10 3 1 25 10 4 4 17 10 6 1 65 10 2 1 75 10 5 6 09 10 4 and 3 50 10 4 respectively whereas these values were 0 106 0 013 0 00 0 250 0 001 0 067 and 0 018 respectively for tcfr estuarine receiving waters table 2 the overall his were 0 0218 for predicted diluted effluents and 0 455 for receiving waters table 2 for the belmont wwtw effluents the rqs of e1 e2 e3 ee2 bpa 4 t op and 4 np were 2 39 10 3 2 50 10 3 8 33 10 6 5 0 10 3 1 34 10 5 1 99 10 3 and 5 22 10 5 respectively table 2 the rqs of marine receiving waters for the target compounds ranged from 0 001 to 0 250 lastly the his of the predicted diluted effluents rhbs and bas samples were 0 0097 0 522 and 0 393 respectively table 2 5 discussion 5 1 estrogenic compounds and their removal efficiencies in wwtws for both tanilba bay and belmont wwtws influents were generally higher in carbon contaminants and the concentration of estrogenic compounds while concentrations significantly decreased post secondary treatment and then largely remained similar for the remainder of the treatment process and finally in receiving waters it is well established that the secondary treatment process can remove organic contaminants along with micropollutants like estrogenic compounds more specifically secondary biological treatment processes are the key treatment process to remove micropollutants through microbial degradation and or biotransformation koh et al 2008 our findings largely mirror what others have observed when estrogens have been assayed throughout the wastewater treatment process in a study of five wwtws in the uk estrogenic contaminants were observed to decrease markedly as wastewater progressed through the plants with most reductions occurring post secondary treatment kirk et al 2002 similarly in a study examining three municipal wastewater treatment plants in australia estrogenic compounds were observed to decline significantly post secondary treatment in all three plants bain et al 2014 in terms of removal efficiency both wwtws were efficient in removing natural estrogens while less successful at removing ee2 bpa and 4 np especially at tanilba bay wwtw since removal efficiency varies with the specificity of treatment technologies it appeared that both the idea at tanilba bay wwtw and the mle treatment process at belmont wwtw are efficient in removing natural estrogens but for synthetic estrogens both treatment processes showed moderate removal efficacy however for industrial chemicals particularly for bpa and 4 np the mle process at belmont wwtw showed relatively higher efficacy perhaps attributable to the combination of an anoxic and aerobic treatment process liu and wang 2017 tran and gin 2017 although little research is available examining the removal efficiency of estrogenic compounds by wwtws baronti et al 2000 revealed that the average removal efficiency of natural and synthetic estrogenic compounds through the activated sludge process was 12 94 78 92 and 68 84 for e1 e2 and ee2 respectively as evaluated by cargouet et al 2004 the removal efficiencies were 45 77 for e1 43 70 for e2 and 34 45 for ee2 at wwtws in which activated sludge process along with denitrification techniques were employed on the other hand schullerer et al 2002 found that activated sludge along with activated carbon processes in wwtws can remove e1 for 80 97 e2 for 65 96 and ee2 for 33 93 huang et al 2014 examined sewage treatment plants around dianchi lake in china where the natural estrogens were removed with high efficiency 75 92 and phenolic edcs were comparatively lower 62 85 archer et al 2017 assessed the daily loads and fate of a broad array of emerging chemicals including pharmaceuticals personal care products edcs illicit drugs and their metabolites along different stages of treatment in a wwtw in south africa and found that the average removal efficiency of bpa was 88 overall the findings of this study have similarities with the other studies globally with natural estrogens being removed with greater efficiency while the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemicals bpa 4 t op and 4 np are more recalcitrant overall concentrations of estrogenic compounds in effluents at both wwtws were similar to effluents found in other australian wwtws although concentrations in receiving waters were generally lower than those observed in other australian studies table 1 differences are likely attributable to the fact that most australian data are from freshwater rivers with lower dilution rates than marine waters suggesting estuarine and marine release is likely to be of lower ecological concern 5 2 possible biodegradation pathways of estrogenic compounds two major findings of the current investigation are that secondary treatment where bacterial action is a feature in treatment significantly decreases estrogenic load further it was found that natural estrogens were more likely to be removed while the synthetic estrogen and industrial chemicals were less responsive to degradation at secondary treatment the bacterial consortia available at secondary treatment likely facilitate the degradation of estrogens but the variability in metabolic pathways used to degrade estrogens among taxa and compounds within taxa could explain lower removal efficiencies for xenoestrogens bacterial degradation and transformation of estrogens have species specific and compound specific pathways zhang et al 2016 islam et al 2020 possible biodegradation pathways of natural estrogens such as e2 can be degraded to 4 oh e2 intermediates and subsequent meta cleavage subsequent hydroxylation on base ring a is initiated and then meta cleavage occurs on the other hand an e2 degradation pathway of hydroxy e2 keto e1 keto e2 and 3 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyprop 2 enoic acid can be initiated dependent on bacterial strain kurisu et al 2010 the intermediate metabolite estra 1 3 5 10 16 tetraen 3 ol estratetraenol e0 can be produced from e2 by nitrosomonas europaea via dehydration on the d ring at position c 17 nakai et al 2011 more commonly e2 can be degraded to e1 by hydroxylation on d ring at c 17 then 4 oh e1 on a ring at c 4 and further meta cleavage yu et al 2013 finally e2 degradation pathways can also produce metabolites with lactone on the d ring in mixed sewage bacteria and then enter the tca cycle for further degradation in energy producing pathways yu et al 2013 lee and liu 2002 synthetic estrogens such as ee2 and industrial chemicals such as np op and bpa vary significantly in their degradation pathways which may contribute to their observed lower removal efficiencies observed in the current study ee2 for example converts to 2 oh ee2 at the c 2 position by hydroxylation on the a ring representing a co metabolic transformation by nitrifying bacteria yu et al 2013 sphingomonas sp ttnp3 can use np or its isomers and produce 3 5 dimethyl 3 heptanol 2 1 ethyl 1 3 dimethylpentyl 1 4 benzenediol or 4 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl phenol hydroxylated metabolites these can be further biodegraded to 2 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl 1 4 benzenediol and 4 1 1 5 trimethylhexyl oxy phenol as catabolite yields corvini et al 2006 on the other hand bpa is degraded by gram negative sphingomonas sp mv1 to produce phenonium ion intermediates which then undergo catabolism into two metabolites 1 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 propanol major and 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l propanol minor through hydroxylation zhang et al 2013 hence the differences in metabolic degradation pathways between natural estrogens and xenoestrogens could explain their differential removal efficiency throughout the wastewater treatment process 5 3 relationships among estrogenic compounds through principal components analysis pca tanilba bay wwtw revealed a pc representing 62 of the variability in the data and was highly correlated with the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 the synthetic estrogen ee2 and the industrial chemical 4 t op while a component representing 67 of the variability was true for the pca at belmont showing a strong correlation with the natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 ee2 bpa and 4 t op in both cases a very strong correlation approx 93 97 was found among the natural estrogens and reflects their human origin and common mechanisms of degradation during wastewater treatment transit the strong relationship among the industrial chemicals bpa 4 np and 4 t op including high correlations and at times separate components describing their variability are largely attributable to their industrial origins and their recalcitrant nature during the wastewater treatment process pearson correlation rs analysis among the various estrogenic compounds showed almost similar patterns to the pca analysis besides toc was highly correlated with natural estrogens i e e1 e2 and e3 at both wwtws around 80 but a moderate relationship was found with the two industrial chemicals i e bpa and 4 t op and a lower relationship found with 4 np that was up to 46 interestingly no relationship was found with the synthetic estrogen ee2 5 4 ecological risk assessment the predicted estrogenic activity or ceeqs in estuarine receiving water for tanilba bay wwtw in terms of e screen and fish vtg estimations were very low in the shoreline estuarine receiving water and were lower than the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs for e2 in both short term and long term assessments in belmont wwtw the ceeq for shoreline marine receiving water locations was also very low lower than short and long term pnecs caldwell et al 2012 jarošová et al 2014 tran et al 2019 in terms of risk quotient and hazard index the current study revealed that the predicted diluted effluent samples of tanilba bay wwtw exhibited very low to no risk rq 1 for all target estrogenic compounds further shoreline estuarine receiving waters did not show any significant risk the overall hi for the predicted diluted effluent hi 0 0218 and the receiving shoreline estuarine water hi 0 455 indicated no predicted risk similarly the predicted diluted effluents at belmont wwtw followed the same pattern with low rq values for all target compounds and low hazard index hi 0 0097 the shoreline receiving ocean water at belmont exhibited the same pattern of relative risk with quotients 1 for all estrogens and the overall hazard index for the belmont shorelines also very low hi 0 393 to 0 522 theoretical modeling should be interpreted alongside monitoring data given that modeled contaminants do not necessarily behave in the same way as tracers and their solubility and thus dilution may be considerably different although very few studies to date report the ecological risk of typical estrogenic compounds sun et al 2013 explored rq values for natural estrogens ee2 and xenoestrogens in sewage effluents from several municipal sewage plants in beijing china and observed much greater risk quotients than the current study risk quotients rarely exceeded 1 for the natural estrogens e1 and e2 while the rq of ee2 was highest and ranged from 10 to 1 000 the rq values of e3 were the lowest with only 9 of samples greater than 1 whereas the 10 and 60 of the values were greater than 1 respectively for bpa and np indicating the high to moderate ecological risk of specific estrogenic compounds in that study similarly tan et al 2018 estimated the rq and the σrq hi for selected edcs in the xi river daliao river and hun river in china and 64 7 of the surface water sampling sites were evaluated as high risk largely associated with the high concentrations of ee2 and e1 overall values observed in effluents and receiving waters in this study in nsw australia generally posed a lower risk for biological effects compared to concentrations detected globally with a low to moderate risk detected for most samples in both wwtws 5 5 limitations as no bioassays were conducted in this study the estrogenic activities ceeqs presented here are only predicted values computed based on the measured concentrations and eeqs of the individual estrogenic compounds because these target compounds are considered the main contributors to estrogenic activity in wastewater jarošová et al 2014 it is reasonable to believe that these predicted values are useful for evaluating the removal efficiency of estrogenicity at the studied wwtws and the ecological risk of the receiving waters however it should be acknowledged that the estrogenic compounds studied here represent only a subset of edcs that are present in complex mixtures of chemical contaminants in sewage and aquatic systems considering the potential interactions amongst edcs such as competition for binding to hormone receptors it is possible that the predicted estrogenic activities reported here are under estimated or over estimated compared to those measured by bioassays depending on the composition and proportions of chemicals in the mixture previously ihara et al 2014 measured estrogenic activities of wwtw samples using erα reporter assays and compared the results with those predicted from chemical analysis of e1 e2 e3 and ee2 the authors found that all samples in which measured estrogenic activity was lower than predicted exhibited strong antiestrogenic activity likely caused by estrogen receptor er antagonists that coexist in wastewater these antagonists competitive and non competitive are able to suppress agonist mediated activation of the er in the reporter bioassays leading to a lowered net measured estrogenicity when they are present in appreciable concentrations examples of antiestrogenic compounds in effluents include disinfection by products dbps formed during chlorination wu et al 2009 2010 textile dyes bazin et al 2012 and other man made chemicals such as pfos and pfoa henry and fair 2013 as chlorination is not used by any of the studied wwtws dbps are unlikely a significant contributor to antiestrogenicity if any in the final effluents or receiving waters examined in this study however due to the lack of bioassay results we cannot exclude that other antiestrogenic compounds if present could partially mask the effect of the target estrogenic compounds and therefore the predicted estrogenic activities reported here may represent overestimation of the actual values this highlights a need for further research to quantify the effect of antiestrogenic compounds in wastewater 6 conclusions this study measured seven estrogenic compounds at various stages along the treatment process at two 3 wwtws and their individual marine and estuarine receiving waters in the lower hunter nsw australia in summary although significant quantities of estrogenic compounds were loaded at both wwtws the treatment processes especially secondary treatment largely removed most of these compounds wwtws were more effective at remediating natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and moderate to less effective for synthetic estrogen and industrial chemicals with the lowest removal efficiencies for ee2 and np besides correlation matrices and pca revealed similar declines in natural and synthetic estrogens along with bpa and 4 t op with the treatment process but did not show any relationship with 4 np it was found that toc was highly correlated with natural estrogens moderately correlated with industrial chemicals bpa and 4 t op barely correlated with 4 np and not correlated with the synthetic estrogen ee2 the ceeqs were relatively low and the rqs and his were all below 1 indicating minimal risk for adverse reproductive effects being elicited in aquatic taxa residing in receiving waters overall the wastewater treatment process at both locations removed the majority of estrogenic compounds in effluents and thus no upgrades to the treatment process are recommended to deal with estrogenic compounds such as membrane filtration activated carbon and ozonation treatment technologies further studies are required to explore the role of specific microbes in the biodegradation pathways of estrogenic compounds in wwtws credit authorship contribution statement rafiquel islam

16936,sequential extraction and in situ diffusive gradients in thin films dgt techniques were used to determine phosphorus p fractions and high resolution 2d fluxes of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt in sediment systems the diffusion fluxes were subsequently calculated for different scenarios dynamic diffusion parameters between solid sediment and solution were also fitted using the difs dgt induced fluxes in sediments model the results suggested that fe bound p fe p was the dominant pool which contributed to the resupply potential of p in the water sediment continuum significant upward decreases of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt fluxes were detected in pristine and incubated microcosms this dominance indicated the more obvious immobilization of labile p via oxidation of both fe2 and s2 in oxidic conditions additionally these labile analytes in the microcosms obviously decreased after a 30 day incubation period indicating that water level fluctuations can significantly regulate adsorption desorption processes of the p bound to fe containing minerals within a short time higher concentrations of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt were measured at the shallow lake region where more drastic water level variation occurred this demonstrates that frequent adsorption desorption of phosphate from the sediment particles to the aqueous solution can result in looser binding on the solid sediment surface and easier desorption in aerobic conditions via the regulation of water levels higher r values fitted with difs model suggested that more significant desorption and replenishment effect of labile p to the aqueous solution would occur in lake regions with more dramatic water level variations finally a significant positive correlation between s2 dgt and fe2 dgt in the sediment indicated that the s2 oxidization under the conditions of low water level can trigger the reduction of fe iii and subsequent release of active p in general speaking frequent water level fluctuations in the lake over time facilitated the formation and retention of the fe ii phase in the sediment and desorption of fe coupled p into the aqueous solution when the water level was high keywords high resolution evidence regulation effect phosphorus water sediment interface water level fluctuation lake 1 introduction eutrophication induced by extensive nutrients inputs in aquatic ecosystems arises more and more frequently and attracts attention worldwide mooney et al 2020 phosphorus p is considered to be crucial in the deterioration of water quality adjustment of ecosystem functions and harmful algal blooms in lacustrine ecosystems carpenter 2008 large amounts of p containing water and agricultural fertilizer are discharged into the lakes via tributary rivers and terrigenous runoff which further facilitates phytoplankton growth quinlan et al 2021 the dynamics of p in lake ecosystems are dominantly regulated by the balance between sources and sinks change in environmental conditions can release endogenous source of p in the sediment back into the overlying water column shinohara et al 2012 this process is comparable to the exogenous discharge and potentially fuels primary production in lacustrine ecosystems traditional analytical methods based on total concentrations can give useful information about the p transfer processes between the water and sediment additionally sequential chemical extractions using various extractants can differentiate the p phase bound to different metallic hydrogen oxides and organic matter om in the sediment kim et al 2003 the varying forms of sequestered p in the sediment can substantially affect their potential for remobilization and resupply in the lakes however visual assessments of the dynamic processes of p between water and sediment are scarce accurate understanding of the occurrence and diagenesis features of p in the sediment and the interactions of p between the water and the solid sediment is important for the management of p sources and the recovery of eutrophic lakes the boundary layer near the sediment is a crucial site in connection with external and internal exchanges of p in lacustrine ecosystems riber and wetzel 1987 the water sediment interface often features steep physical and chemical gradients such as dissolved oxygen do ph redox potential eh and dissolved ions po4 3 fe2 s2 etc within narrow distances xu et al 2012 the oxidized microzones in bottom sediments of lakes okeechobee and apopka usa vary in depth from a few mm to about 2 cm olila and reddy 1997 dissolved oxygen do is one of the predominant controlling factors of p cycling in aquatic environments cesbron et al 2014 dynamic processes of p including transformations in speciation and mobility that occur at the sediment surface are regulated by do penetration depth of the water sediment continuum simpson et al 2019 the concentration and dynamic effects of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the water sediment continuum are predominantly influenced by the balance between adsorption and desorption to p containing minerals chen et al 2018 labile p in the solid sediment can be released into the interstitial water from the binding sites of solid sedimentary particles and consequently upwardly diffuse into overlying water as seen in increased concentration gradients near the boundary layer which further fuels the eutrophication in lakes ding et al 2015 these redox mediated processes in the thin oxidized microzone underlain by a large scale reduced layer of surficial sediment dominate the remobilization and resupply of p in water hydrological characteristics such as water level can alter the aeration of bottom waters and surficial sediment and further influence the p dynamics in aquatic ecosystems which are susceptible to meteorological conditions morphology and exogenous discharge vollenweider 1975 water quality is influenced by water level fluctuations in aquatic systems wang et al 2020 for example seasonal fluctuations between high water level and low water level can result in active changes in energy and matter including the forms and distribution of p mooney et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the observation performed by qin et al 2020 suggested that water depth plays a critical role in lake eutrophication and p limitation especially in deep lakes the seasonal resuspension and settling of particulates depending on water level fluctuation can determine the eh status at the water sediment interface and subsequently affect the uptake and release of p especially in fe rich systems olila and reddy 1997 water level fluctuations mitigate eutrophication status in some lakes reservoirs due to the alternation of redox conditions and has been the focus of attention worldwide bao et al 2015 gao et al 2020 however previous research focused mainly on ex situ measurements of p containing compounds that can induce the change of physical and chemical characteristics the study of dynamic processes of p in water sediment systems during water sediment fluctuations in lakes is limited due to the lack of high resolution in situ testing technologies in aquatic environment ferric iron fe3 and sulfate so4 2 as terminal electron acceptors can be simultaneously reduced by heterotrophic bacteria and anaerobic episodes azzoni et al 2001 the integration of p with fe oxy hydr oxides is critical for the immobilization of the labile p fraction in sediment norgbey et al 2020 the reductive dissolution of p bound to fe containing minerals in the sediment particles in anoxic conditions plays a key role in releasing p into interstitial water and its subsequent diffusion into overlying water cosmidis et al 2014 additionally the reduction of so4 2 to s2 can influence p bound to fe containing minerals which can stimulate po4 3 and fe cycling and eutrophication in lakes zhao et al 2019 to explore the lability and occurrence of p fe2 and s2 in the sediment previous work has principally focused on ex situ chemical extraction methods egger et al 2016 chen et al 2018 simultaneous in situ detection of these chemical components at high resolution is required to reveal the distribution and dynamic behaviors of these contaminants due to the spatial heterogeneity in the sediment advanced and maneuverable high resolution techniques are pivotal for the exact exploration of the dynamics of fe p s across the water sediment interface of lakes diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is a technique for the in situ visual assessment of the resupply

layer diffusive gel and binding gel layer ding et al 2018 dgt can enable high resolution two dimensional 2d images of analytes and can supply visual heterogeneity in sediment microstructures at a small or even micro scale han et al 2017 a steady state linear concentration gradient of labile forms of analytes is established between the binding gel and the solution and maintains the flux of the solute controlled by diffusion harper et al 2000 the dgt measured fractions are composed of both solute from interstitial water and the further resupply of the solid sediment as a comparative evaluation of measurements the diffusion processes of dgt simulate the interaction of labile analytes between solid and solution in the sediment and reflect the actual dynamic behaviors in natural environments price et al 2013 double sided dgt techniques combined with traditional analysis methods are used for the synchronous detection of heterogeneous changes of labile p fe2 and s2 in the water sediment continuum in a representative lake undergoing intense water level fluctuation over time the main objectives of this study are to 1 characterize in situ 2d flux changes of labile p fe2 and s2

three representative regions 1 2 and 3 in shijiuhu lake 31 23 31 33 n 118 46 118 58 e a freshwater shallow lake located in the lower yangtze river basin eastern china fig 1 using columnar sampler in october 2020 this lake is connected to the yangtze river the third largest river in the world through the guxi river and the water level frequently varies because of the variation in irrigation of the yangtze river along with seasonal rainfall the lake has its highest water depth of more than 6 m in the wet season and can dry up in some regions in low water seasons chi et al 2016 excessive nutrients including p are discharged into this lake through runoff and or river inputs due to increasing anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices wastewater discharge and aquaculture overlying water samples were collected simultaneously from the sampling sites one set of collected sediment columns was carefully sliced into pieces at 1 cm intervals after sampling the sub samples were placed in a cooler and transferred to the laboratory where they were kept at 4 c after freeze drying with a vacuum freeze dryer and grinding with an agate mortar the sediment particles were sieved using a 100 mesh sieve before subsequent analysis additionally two other undisturbed sediment columns were transferred to the lab and used for dgt deployment and incubation experiments respectively physicochemical parameters of the lake water were observed simultaneously by using a portable water quality analyzer hach sl1000 japan in field these included values of water depth wd temperature t ph do eh and electrical conductivity ec the concentrations of srp and total phosphorus tp in the overlying water were detected by using molybdenum blue colorimetry ruban et al 2001 obtained data are listed in table 1 2 2 extraction of p fractions different p fractions in pristine sediment cores were extracted based on the sequential extraction method using the operationally defined standards measurements and testing programme smt for its ease of use and reproducible results ruban 1999 2001 this procedure has been developed based on the comparisons of existing schemes and interlaboratory studies ruban et al 2001 briefly 0 2 g of freeze dried sediment was vibrated and extracted with different chemical extractants step by step at a constant solid solution ratio 1 100 fig s1 the modified smt protocol categorized the sedimentary p phases in the sediment into six independent pools as follows mgcl2 p labile p pool fe p p bound to fe and al oxy hydr oxides ca p p associated with ca pi total inorganic p po total organic p and tp total p all the phosphate concentrations in the extractant of the six pools were measured using molybdenum blue colorimetry finally interstitial water in the pristine sediment cores was obtained using centrifugation at 2500 g for 30 min the concentrations of srp in pore water filtered through 0 45 μm gf c filter membrane whatman usa were immediately detected using molybdenum blue colorimetry ruban et al 2001 2 3 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy for the identification and assessment of solid fe phases the 57fe mössbauer spectra of pristine solid sediment were detected at room temperature rt at various depth intervals the spectra were obtained using a liquid helium bath cryostat connected to a conventional spectrometer wissel ms 500 germany a 57co rh source was used with an activity of 25 mci the result was obtained by comparing with a 25 μm α fe absorber at room temperature transmitted radiation was observed using an ar kr proportional counter finally a 512 channel analyzer was used to document the generated signal 2 4 analysis of toc tn and stable isotopes approximately 0 5 g of dried sediment was digested using extractant of mixed nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl and perchloric acid hclo4 subsequently the total concentrations of elements al fe ca and mn were measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes profile dv usa another 1 g of freeze dried sediment sample was treated using 5 hcl solution for the removal of carbonates following freeze drying the ground sediment was packaged in high purity tin capsules and the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were simultaneously detected with a chns o elemental analyzer connected to a thermal conductivity detector eurovector euro ea 3000 italy the mass ratio of toc and tn c n in each sediment layer was subsequently calculated in addition values of stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n in the pristine sediment core were acquired by using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer 253plus thermo fisher scientific usa combined with an elemental analyzer flash ea 1112 thermo scientific usa ground dried sediment samples about 20 mg were put into ultra pure tin capsules the prepared samples were successively combusted at 1020 c in the front furnace and at 700 c in the rear furnace respectively the generated co2 and n2 were isolated from the combustion products for subsequent measurement of isotope values the δ13c and δ15n of the samples were calculated by comparing to international standards vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for c and atmospheric nitrogen for n respectively abreu et al 2006 2 5 incubation experiment with controlling water depth manipulation experiments were performed in the laboratory to explore the dynamic variation of analytes in lake water sediment interfaces of lakes that are undergoing water level fluctuation a set of undisturbed sediment cores were plugged using rubber plugs drilled with small holes to avoid the evaporation of overlying water the depth of sediment column s overlying water was preserved at low water level 60 cm which is much lower than the water depth of the lake in the field the columns were wrapped in foil to stop light entering and preserved at room temperature without disturbance for 30 days physicochemical parameters from the incubation microcosm including do t and ph values of overlying water were measured with a portable water quality analyzer hach sl1000 japan after the incubation period the concentrations of total p and srp in the overlying water were detected with molybdenum blue colorimetry after filtration through 045um filter membrane 2 6 dgt deployment the pristine sediment collected from shijiuhu lake and the 30 day incubated sediment cores were analyzed using dgt techniques to measure labile srp s2 and fe2 fluxes and concentrations across the water sediment interface in brief the integrated double sided zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices easysensor china were aerated using pure n2 flow for 12 h for deoxidation then the devices were perpendicularly penetrated into sediment cores without disturbing the water sediment interface and experienced an equilibrium period of 24 h for diffusion in the microcosm relative to independent zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices this integrated double sided dgt device has the advantage of synchronous measurement and thus less destruction to the pristine sediment samples these assemblies were used for high resolution in situ measurement of labile p using zr oxide dgt and s2 and fe2 fluxes using zro ca dgt respectively after the equilibrium period the dgt devices were removed from the microcosms the gel surfaces were carefully rinsed using deionized di water to remove the affixed particles the temperature of the overlying water was synchronously measured for the calculation of diffusive fluxes of the analytes at the water sediment continuum the dgt equipment was then separated into independent zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices after rinsing the masses of elements p and s that had accumulated in the binding gels were determined separately according to the modified coloration cid method proposed by ding et al 2015 in brief the gel surface of the zro ca dgt device was carefully dried with filter paper and then scanned with a flat bed scanner canon 5600f japan at 600 dpi resolution equal to a pixel size of 42 μm 42 μm the obtained image was subsequently converted into grayscale intensity for the acquisition of high resolution 2d s2 dgt fluxes subsequently the surface of the gel was immediately washed again using di water and then cut into small strips at 2 mm intervals these strips were placed into the centrifuge tubes and subsequently extracted using 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 for 24 h chen et al 2017 the fe2 dgt concentration in each extract was measured using phenanthroline colorimetric methods xu et al 2013 additionally each gel of zr oxide dgt was heated using a hot plate at 80 c for 24 h then moistened using the mixed molybdenum reagent for coloration for 1 h at 35 c the dgt staining assembly was then rinsed and soaked with cool di water at 4 c to avoid the development of color the surface of the dyed hybrid film was subsequently scanned at 600 dpi resolution using the flat bed scanner described above to obtain high resolution 2d flux images of labile pdgt the grayscale intensities of the images following conversion into monochrome were acquired with imagej software finally the calibration curves of the coloration cid were calculated by analyzing dgt pistons containing s2 and po4 3 p in different concentrations han et al 2017 the calibration curves between accumulated masses of p and s in the gel films and grayscale intensities of corresponding analytes were fitted as exponential equations xu et al 2013 finally the grayscale intensities of scanned images from sediment samples were used to calculate accumulation mass of s2 and srp for each pixel according to the observed calibration equations 2 7 apparent diffusive flux calculation the apparent diffusive flux across the water sediment interface can represent the diffusion extent and direction of ions between the surficial sediment and overlying water ding et al 2015 the total diffusive flux was calculated as the sum of the fluxes from the sediments and the overlying water toward the water sediment interface respectively this total flux can be calculated as in eq 1 1 j j w j s d w c d g t x w x 0 φ d s c d g t

simulation a one dimensional 1d difs model can be used to explore the diffusion kinetics of contaminants in the sediment system and exchange processes between pellets and dgt devices hypothetical dimensionless r values eq 2 can describe the resupply capacity of the analytes at the solid solution interface the difs model can also characterize the dependence extent of r values on diffusion capacity of labile p from solid particle toward the solution lehto et al 2008 this resupply process is composed of both the diffusion of labile p to the dgt surface and its further accumulation into

originlab inc usa spss 20 for windows spss inc usa was used for statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 physicochemical parameters in sediment and pore water the values of common physicochemical parameters including tp and srp concentrations in overlying water did not show significant change between pristine and incubated water sediment systems table 1 fig 2 depicts the metal elements fe al ca and mn toc and tn concentrations and 13c 15n isotope values in pristine sediment particles the srp concentrations in pristine pore water and the c n values of solid sediment are also given in fig 2 generally the concentrations of metal elements decreased in the order al fe ca mn across the sediment profiles relatively unordered variation of these metal elements existed in the majority of the layers of the sediment columns especially for fe al and ca except for few outliers significant upward increases of toc and tn concentrations were found for all the sampling sites through the entire set of sediment columns c n varied from 8 0 11 0 and had an adverse variation trend that decreased upwards toward the upper layer the values of δ13c and δ15n for all three sediment columns were 40 0 to 22 7 and 3 0 to 8 1 respectively and these overall reduced upward from the bottom layer additionally srp concentrations in pore water fluctuated in the range of 013 0 44 mg l 1 which was about 10 orders of magnitude higher than in the overlying lake water 3 2 variation of p fractions in the sediment profiles fig 3 presents the concentrations and variation of different p fractions in the profiles of pristine sediment from different sites of the lake extracted using the improved smt method in general tp concentrations at the three sites varied from 292 1 to 644 5 mg kg 1 across the whole profiles more significant fluctuation of tp values were found at sites 2 and 3 than at 1 generally total pi with values varying from about 160 490 mg kg 1 was higher than total po in all sediment profiles a similar change in trend of pi to tp existed at all three sites the po concentrations on the sediment profiles except that from site 1 displayed an obvious increase from the bottom upward toward the top layer the pi pools in the three sampling sites represented the relatively homologous variation among the entire profiles that is mgcl2 p fe p ca p meanwhile ca p concentrations accounted for the largest fraction of the tp at 30 0 80 0 fe p constituted a second largest pi pool with about 14 6 28 8 of tp concentration labile mgcl2 p contributed the fraction less than 3 of tp significantly a stable ratio of fe p accounting for tp was measured at site 1 compared with the two other sites especially site 2 which had increasing values from the bottom toward the upper layers also at site 2 significant upward increases of mgcl2 p and fe p were found from the bottom layer to about 10 cm depth then concentrations of these two pools did not obviously fluctuate until the surface layer however these two p pools at sites 1 and 3 with lower water depth kept relatively stable across the entire sediment depth adverse variation of ca p at site 2 was detected below 10 cm depth except for a few outliers generally the mgcl2 p fe p and ca p at site 1 which underwent intensive water level fluctuation relative to the two other sampling sites maintained more analogous concentrations across the entire sedimentary profiles 3 3 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy for solid sediment particles the result of mössbauer spectroscopy at room temperature for different sediment depths are shown in fig 4 modeling was implemented using the lorentzian line shape model the proportion of fe fraction was calculated as area of individual peak compared with total fe phases the obtained data about solid fe mineralogy phases are presented in table 3 the main fe minerals including fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and phyllosilicate concomitant fe ii minerals siderite and or chlorite were distinguished in all the sediment samples murad and cashion 2004 yuan et al 2019 fe iii phase concentrations were approximately 2 5 orders of magnitude higher than fe ii phase concentrations similar fe ii percentages 70 2 74 7 accounting for total fe kept relatively stable at different sedimentary depths except for a few outliers generally comparable ratios of fe ii percentages were found at all three different research sites although slight variations also existed between different sites and depths 3 4 variation of 2 d patterns of pdgt and s2 dgt through the water sediment interface before and after incubation high resolution in situ 2d and 1d images gained by using the double sided dgt technique of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes across the water sediment interface before and after incubation are shown in figs 5 and 6 a f greater fluxes were simultaneously detected in the water sediment continuum at site 1 compared with the other two sites the lowest fluxes of pdgt and s2 dgt were found at site 2 note that generally significant variation in gradients of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes across the sediment column were detected at approximately 5 cm depth in addition pdgt concentrations kept relatively stable at about 0 064 0 006 0 053 0 006 and 0 031 0 006 mg l 1 at sites 1 2 and 3 respectively from the bottom sedimentary layer upwards to about 5 cm depth then sharply decreased to about 0 002 mg l 1 until the water sediment interface s2 dgt concentrations maintained relatively stable at about 0 16 0 02 0 17 0 04 and 0 13 0 01 mg l 1 respectively at the three sampling sites again until about 5 cm depth then rapidly decreased to about 0 013 0 05 and 0 05 mg l 1 in the top sediment layer the variation measured by dgt indicated that the fluxes and concentrations of pdgt and s2 dgt significantly decreased in the three microcosms after incubation with low water levels especially in the top 5 cm depth layer of sites 1 and 3 between 5 cm depth and the water sediment interface pdgt concentrations experiencing incubation fell to less than half those of the pristine sediment columns s2 dgt concentrations decreased to less than 0 1 mg l 1at about 5 cm layer and further reduced to 0 01 mg l 1 at the water sediment interface 3 5 variation of 1d distributions of fe2 through the water sediment interface before and after incubation fluxes of analytes can be converted to concentration in binding gel cdgt according to fick s first law and reflected diffusive potential in sediment pore water and dgt binding gel alexa et al 2009 fig 6g i illustrates the 1d variation of fe2 dgt concentrations through the water sediment interface similar to the variations of pdgt and s2 dgt the fe2 dgt concentrations generally remained stable below 5 cm depth with average values of 4 9 3 2 and 2 6 mg l 1 respectively at the sampling sites 1 l 2 l and 3 the concentrations drastically decreased to 0 5 0 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively from about the 5 cm layer upward to the top layer the fe2 dgt values obviously decreased to 2 9 2 6 and 1 4 mg l 1 below 5 cm depth and kept relatively steady toward the 5 cm sedimentary depth at all of the sampling sites then the concentrations dramatically reduced to 0 4 0 2 and 0 03 mg l 1 respectively upward towards the top layer of the sediment additionally the fe2 dgt concentrations in overlying water at site 1 were distinctly higher than those of the other two sediment cores generally roughly analogous changes were measured in all of the sampling sites however site 1 with high fluctuations of water level displayed more significant variations of fe2 dgt concentrations compared with the two other sites with relatively high water depth 3 6 diffusion fluxes of srp s2 and fe2 through the water sediment interface apparent diffusion fluxes of pdgt s2 dgt and fe2 dgt across the water sediment continuum of the three sampling sites of the lake are shown in fig 7 obviously positive flux values of these parameters were determined at all the research sites the highest fluxes of pdgt and fe2 dgt in pristine sediment cores up to 0 015 and 1 3 µg cm2 s 1 respectively were found in sampling site 1 higher s2 dgt fluxes were also monitored at site 1 it is noteworthy that the diffusion fluxes of all the parameters through the water sediment interface distinctly decreased with the execution of the incubation experiments for all the sampling sites 4 discussion 4 1 fe bound p dominates the mobility of p in the sediment partition of p fractions indicates the different mobility and resupply potential of p from the solid sediment to the aqueous solution mgcl2 p which is associated with the solid surface and the compound by weak physical and chemical interactions can be directly adsorbed by aquatic organisms as the most labile p pool aminot and andrieux 1996 this implies the resupply potential of labile p to the solution phases even when the concentrations of this pool are relatively low compared with other p fractions gradually increasing mgcl2 p concentrations from the bottom toward the top layer especially at sites 1 and 3 suggested the accumulation of this kind of p phase in the upper layer of sediment this tendency was also observed in other aquatic environments such as lake erken rydin 2000 lake taihu yuan et al 2019 and the peru margin jaisi and blake 2010 however inverse decreasing trends on the sediment profiles were detected in other water bodies such as chesapeake bay etc joshi et al 2015 these results may be attributed to differences in resupply dynamics of labile p pools additionally research site 1 displayed relative stability and homogeneity of labile mgcl2 p concentrations across the whole sediment column except for a few outliers all these variation characteristics suggested different bonding effects on the surface of sediment particles between free phosphate and fixed p containing minerals which consequently controlled sorption desorption processes under various conditions including fluctuating water depth significant increases of fe p upward from the bottom layer were observed in site 2 which had the highest water level indicating it was the most stable burial environment in this lake low values of fe p suggested a reduced layer with low redox potential under the thin oxidized zone where p bound to ferric oxy hydroxides feo oh may be released due to the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions inducing the decrease of particle p borch et al 2007 an upward increasing trend of this kind of p phase was normally investigated in aquatic ecosystems without dramatic variations of water level ruban et al 1999 liu et al 2019 under anoxic anaerobic conditions fe iii can be reduced to fe ii as electron acceptor and consequently dissolves in the water phase together with the release of phosphate in the deep layer of the sediment aminot and andrieux 1996 the most significant positive correlations r2 0 927 p 0 01 were observed between mgcl2 p and fe p compared with ca p in sediment of site 2 indicating that the fe p phase potentially contributes to the deposition of labile p in steady anoxic conditions with deeper overlying water it is interesting that the sites 1 and 3 having relatively lower overlying water levels than site 2 displayed homogeneity in fe p concentration across the whole sedimentary depth weak correlation between mgcl2 p and fe p was discovered in sites 1 and 3 do can penetrate into surficial sediment when the water is shallow which may result in the more extensive oxidation of sediment kreling et al 2017 this process favors the re oxidation of labile fe ii into fe iii and the corresponding dissociation of phosphate in oxic episodes which can further lead to the immobilization of p as solid particle p phase in lacustrine ecosystems higher srp concentrations fig 2j were also detected in pore water of sediment from site 2 indicating that the fe p was mobilized to be desorbed into the aquatic phase into the deep water environment in anoxic episodes however these notions need further direct evidence ca p accounted for higher ratios 50 of pi except for a few outliers across the whole profile in all the sampling sites compared with potentially mobilizable phases including mgcl2 p and fe p however detrital and authigenic origin ca p tended to remain relatively stable in accumulation characteristics during the sedimentation history ruttenberg and berner 1993 measurements of phosphate oxygen isotopes δ18op in the sediment from different aquatic environments also revealed that ca p possessed lighter isotope values joshi et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 this demonstrated that ca p was locked in and remained largely unaltered after its formation and precipitation as ca containing minerals in the sediment weaker correlation detected between ca p and mobile mgcl2 p r2 0 429 p 0 05 in site 2 with more stable sedimentary conditions further suggested the inconspicuous contribution to the mobile p fraction additionally po in the sediment from these lake regions accounted for between 5 49 of tp increasing po proportion from the top layer downward indicated the preferential degradation and mineralization into pi in deeper layers po compounds were often considered as part of the refractory p however po compounds were composed of labile fractions which can re mineralize into the pi fraction and played a significant role in p cycling pant et al 2002 po was often present in natural om from various sources bedrock et al 1995 c n can be used to speculate the source of om in the sedimentary particles settling into the lakes xia et al 2021 plant groups mainly contribute to the lake om and display different ranges of c n ratios algae derived om phytoplankton typically possesses c n mass ratios of 4 to 10 while aquatic macrophytes range from 10 to 50 and vascular terrestrial plants generally have values higher than 20 contreras et al 2018 therefore c n varying from 8 0 11 0 in this research suggests the predominantly algae derived source of om in the sediment the decreased trend toward the upper layer suggested the aggravation of algae biomass following the anthropogenic activities around the lake the low toc values in the deeper sediment layer might be due to the greater degradation rates of om under aerobic scenario rather than anaerobic conditions pant et al 2002 which induced the degradation of po in the sediment especially at site 1 having deeper water furthermore c and n stable isotopes 13c and 15n are also frequently used to identify the source of om deposited in the lakes li et al 2018 the decreasing upwards trend of δ13c and δ15n values also indicated the alternation of om sources during sedimentation processes the δ13c values of endogenous algae in the lakes normally ranged from 31 to 24 meyers 2003 the δ15n values of macroalgae commonly varied between 0 5 and 13 8 cole et al 2004 generally c n along with δ13c and δ15n illustrated that the increasing algae detritus induced the accumulation of biogenic p containing om in the sediment the degradation of om and reduction of fe oxy hydr oxides could simultaneously trigger the release of phosphate into the pore water from po and fe p in sediments during the diagenetic processes egger et al 2015 however it should be noted that the relatively long half life several to dozens of years of po compounds indicated that the resupply potential of labile p fraction was inconspicuous in the sediment ahlgren et al 2005 2006 reitzel et al 2006 ding et al 2013 yuan et al 2020 the predominance of fe p release within a short time in lacustrine sediment systems contributing to the increase of the labile p fraction in the lakes deserves further consideration and explicit evidence 4 2 re mobilization dynamics of srp evaluated using the difs model the output values of dynamic parameters for labile p fraction in 5 cm sediment depths including r kd tc k1 and k 1 were obtained using the difs model and are listed in table 4 the general downward increase of r values at all three sampling sites indicated that phosphate depletion in pore water was supplemented by solid phases for dgt uptake owing to higher labile p concentrations controlled by the reduction of fe p in the deeper layers higher r values indicated more significant resupply efficiency and potential bio availability of labile p in the sediment which further contributed to higher labile p concentrations in the pore water in deeper layers monbet et al 2008 response time tc generally decreased with depth downward at site 1 with its low water depth tc values are sensitive to the variation of r values in the difs model lehto et al 2008 lower tc values together with larger r values in this study further demonstrated the significant resupply capacity of labile p from sediment particles to interstitial water when the sediment tends to be anaerobic fig 8 plots the time dependence curves of r values for labile p in the 5 cm sediment depth layer which were principally dominated by both the desorption of sediment particles into the pore water and the accompanying diffusion efficiency to the diffusive layer of the dgt device harper et al 2000 sochaczewski et al 2007 the initial increase of r curves may be attributed to the dramatically steep linear diffusion of labile p from the interstitial water toward the diffusion layer of the devices lehto et al 2008 progressive decline after the peak value of r occurred due to the limit to the resupply induced by the consumption of labile p near the dgt device along with the low desorption rate from the solid sediment phase heidari et al 2017 guan et al 2017 r accumulation curves confirmed the considerable re mobilization and transport capacity of mobile p fractions including fe p from the solid sediment to the pore water as well as overlying water via dynamic diffusion additionally kd can also exert influence on the r values together with tc obvious positive correlation was found between kd and r r2 0 688 p 0 01 which further reflected the remarkable influence of solid sediment exchanging with the solution in the sediment system obviously higher k1 than k 1 values suggested stronger adsorption potential rather than desorption for the solid sediment across the whole sediment profiles of the research sites heidari et al 2017 generally higher r values combined with other dynamic parameters indicated that continuous resupply of labile phosphate at deep layers influenced the concentration gradient of labile p especially at site 1 this effect was driven by both desorption of mobilizable mgcl2 p and reduction of fe p in sediment especially under anaerobic conditions in deep sediment this dynamic process was responsible for the increasing concentrations of srp in overlying water of lacustrine ecosystems it is noteworthy that lower r values and higher tc at similar sediment layers were found at sites 2 and 3 both having higher water levels this indicated that more significant fluctuations of water depth potentially contributed to the desorption and resupply of labile p from the solid phase to the aqueous solution however this speculation needs further research and evidence 4 3 potential regulation of fe p by water level fluctuation fig 5 shows the high resolution 2d variations of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes at the water sediment interface before and after incubation significant decreases of these two analytes were detected after incubation fig 6a f also depicts the variations of pdgt and s2 dgt concentrations through the water sediment continuum and exhibits the distinctly reduced trend especially at sites 1 and 3 with relatively low water depth concentrations of pdgt and s2 dgt decreased by more than half compared with the pristine sediment columns within a short time 30 days which was obviously quicker than the known po mineralization rates several to dozens of years in natural environments for the resupply of labile p fractions from solid phase to aqueous solution in addition fe2 dgt concentrations also significantly decreased by more than half in each microcosm after the incubation relative to the pristine sediment cores fig 6g i this clearly indicated the rapid re oxidation of fe ii ions into fe iii and the existence of the solid particle phase due to the reduction of water depth together with an increase of penetration depth of do in the water sediment continuum synchronous sorption and immobilization of labile phosphate accompanied the shift of fe iii and fe ii phases due to the oxidation of sediment modified by water depth note that more obvious fluctuations in pdgt and fe2 dgt concentrations werefound at about 1 5 cm depth indicating that the desorption activity principally happened in this sedimentary layer this active layer depth was slightly deeper than in the existing data ca 0 5 10 mm stockdale et al 2009 gao et al 2016 han et al 2017 indicating the larger range of resupply source of labile analytes from the deeper layer of sediment that is mediated by water level it is interesting that the generally higher pdgt and fe2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were found at site 1 which had the lowest water depth and highest do concentration relative to the other sites before and after the incubation experiments mössbauer measurements indicated that a relatively higher fe ii fraction was generally detected in the sediment column from site 1 table 3 it is speculated that more frequent water level fluctuations due to hydrological and meteorological conditions of the lake basin exerted stronger influence on the fe phases in those lake regions having shallow water depth dijkstra et al 2014 the comparable fe iii fe ii phase ratios to total fe at different sediment depths supported the frequent fluctuations of water level in this lake which was significantly different from findings at taihu lake which had downward increasing fe ii concentrations toward the deeper sediment layer yuan et al 2019 comparable fe p concentrations across the whole sediment profile from site 1 further supported this inference nriagu and dell 1974 proposed that crystalline fe containing minerals are remarkably more stable than amorphous ferric phosphate however amorphous fe ii containing minerals in association with p such as chlorite and or siderite were formed and preserved in the sediment via the transition of aerobic and anoxic episodes the investigation of rozan et al 2002 indicated that significant amounts of phosphate could be sequestered in amorphous iron phases this was corroborated by the inconspicuous fluctuation of total fe concentrations fig 2a across the whole sediment column this enrichment action predominantly controlled by oxygen resupply conditions during the diagenetic process may have led to higher proportions of both labile p and fe ii phase at site 1 experiencing multiple variations even at low water levels a higher proportion of crystal fe ii containing minerals existed at sites 2 and 3 with their relatively stabilized deposition environments which was responsible for the low concentrations of reducible fe p and labile fe ii phase these processes contributed to the occurrence of high fe ii concentration and subsequent reductive dissolution in the sediment when the do values in the microcosms were high under low water level conditions lucotte et al 1994 anschutz et al 1998 the incubation experiments proved that fe ii mineral coating by the oxide with p can be desorbed and released into water within a short time which resulted in the high labile fe ii concentration when the water depth became high and caused the reduction scenario house and denison 2000 this desorption and resupply effect for the labile p in the lake water was notably faster than the po degradation and mineralization effect mentioned in section 4 1 finally significant decreases of diffusion fluxes of labile pdgt and s2 dgt across the water sediment interface was detected at each microcosm with low overlying water depth after the 30 day incubation compared with pristine sediment fig 5 high resolution dgt measurements and kinetics calculation demonstrated that the variation of water level can modulate the occurrence of p and fe phases within a short time scale the incubation experiments revealed that higher water depth induced the desorption of p bound to fe containing minerals into pore water and its accompanying diffusion upward into overlying water which potentially facilitated the enrichment of labile p mass and fueled the eutrophication in the lake 4 4 synergistic regulation of sulfide on p regulation controlled by water depth furthermore obvious decreases of s2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were also observed in the sediment suggesting the rapid re oxidation of s2 into s following by so4 2 in oxic episodes at shallow water depth in the microcosm reductive dissolution of fe iii phases through reactions with sulfide can result in the diffusion of labile p bound to fe iii containing minerals and fe ii ions eq 7 küster heins et al 2010 li et al 2016 reduced diffusion fluxes of s2 dgt fig 5 from the sediment toward the overlying water at all the research locations further suggested the oxidization and fixation of a higher valence state of sulfur due to the decreased water depth similar to the results proposed by sun et al 2016 remarkable accumulation of s2 with sedimentary depth was detected at about 5 cm depth in the pristine sediment columns indicating the preferable enrichment of s2 under anoxic conditions the incubation experiments demonstrated the obvious oxidation of s2 under low water level conditions and its converse reduction in high water depth episodes on a short time scale sulfide in interstitial water was principally generated from so4 2 reduction as electron acceptor in anaerobic episodes naylor et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 the so4 2 reduction can trigger the production of fes and the acidification of the sediment system which furthers the activation and desorption of p bound to fe iii oxy hydroxides in deep layers eq 8 o connell et al 2015 norgbey et al 2020 7 2feooh 3s2 4h 2fes s0 4h2o 8 fe3 po4 2 nh2o 3s2 6h 3fes 2h2po4 nh2o similarly by comparing the pristine and incubated microcosms high resolution 2d and 1d images of s2 fluxes and concentrations show that the shift from s2 to so4 2 was also accelerated in the sediment water system via the do content variation caused by water depth fluctuation higher s2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were found at site 1 at the surficial sediment within about 5 cm depth where the chemical action and or microbial actions including sulfate reducing bacteria or sulfur oxidizing bacteria at different do conditions varied with water depth wu et al 2019 additionally the occurrence of s2 in the sediment facilitated the reduction dissolution under hypoxic conditions with the increase of lake water level in general our investigations indicated that frequent fluctuations of water depth in the lake over time stimulated the formation and retention of sulfide in the sediment and the subsequent acceleration of the desorption of the labile p fraction associated to the fe iii oxy hydroxides into the aqueous solution under the low do scenario fig 9 5 conclusions high resolution in situ fluxes of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt were determined using novel dgt techniques which displayed significant differences at the water sediment interface in the various regions of a lake with frequent water level fluctuations these analytes in microcosms with low water depth and high do concentrations obviously decreased after incubation of 30 days indicating that water level fluctuation significantly influences adsorption desorption processes of the p bound to fe containing minerals within a short time higher labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt concentrations were detected at the shallow lake region with more drastic water depth variations compared with the lake regions with relatively stable water levels this might be due to the frequent adsorption desorption of phosphate from the sediment particles to aqueous solution dominated by the variation in oxygen supply the water level fluctuations resulted in looser binding on the solid sediment and easier desorption under aerobic conditions even when the water depth was lower than in other lake regions generally speaking frequent fluctuations of water depth in the lake over time facilitated the formation and retention of sulfide and fe ii in the sediment and the subsequent desorption of the labile p fraction associated to the fe iii oxy hydroxides into the aqueous solution when the water depth became high these findings improve insights into the resupply of labile p from fe p due to water level fluctuation in hypereutrophic lakes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

16936,sequential extraction and in situ diffusive gradients in thin films dgt techniques were used to determine phosphorus p fractions and high resolution 2d fluxes of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt in sediment systems the diffusion fluxes were subsequently calculated for different scenarios dynamic diffusion parameters between solid sediment and solution were also fitted using the difs dgt induced fluxes in sediments model the results suggested that fe bound p fe p was the dominant pool which contributed to the resupply potential of p in the water sediment continuum significant upward decreases of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt fluxes were detected in pristine and incubated microcosms this dominance indicated the more obvious immobilization of labile p via oxidation of both fe2 and s2 in oxidic conditions additionally these labile analytes in the microcosms obviously decreased after a 30 day incubation period indicating that water level fluctuations can significantly regulate adsorption desorption processes of the p bound to fe containing minerals within a short time higher concentrations of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt were measured at the shallow lake region where more drastic water level variation occurred this demonstrates that frequent adsorption desorption of phosphate from the sediment particles to the aqueous solution can result in looser binding on the solid sediment surface and easier desorption in aerobic conditions via the regulation of water levels higher r values fitted with difs model suggested that more significant desorption and replenishment effect of labile p to the aqueous solution would occur in lake regions with more dramatic water level variations finally a significant positive correlation between s2 dgt and fe2 dgt in the sediment indicated that the s2 oxidization under the conditions of low water level can trigger the reduction of fe iii and subsequent release of active p in general speaking frequent water level fluctuations in the lake over time facilitated the formation and retention of the fe ii phase in the sediment and desorption of fe coupled p into the aqueous solution when the water level was high keywords high resolution evidence regulation effect phosphorus water sediment interface water level fluctuation lake 1 introduction eutrophication induced by extensive nutrients inputs in aquatic ecosystems arises more and more frequently and attracts attention worldwide mooney et al 2020 phosphorus p is considered to be crucial in the deterioration of water quality adjustment of ecosystem functions and harmful algal blooms in lacustrine ecosystems carpenter 2008 large amounts of p containing water and agricultural fertilizer are discharged into the lakes via tributary rivers and terrigenous runoff which further facilitates phytoplankton growth quinlan et al 2021 the dynamics of p in lake ecosystems are dominantly regulated by the balance between sources and sinks change in environmental conditions can release endogenous source of p in the sediment back into the overlying water column shinohara et al 2012 this process is comparable to the exogenous discharge and potentially fuels primary production in lacustrine ecosystems traditional analytical methods based on total concentrations can give useful information about the p transfer processes between the water and sediment additionally sequential chemical extractions using various extractants can differentiate the p phase bound to different metallic hydrogen oxides and organic matter om in the sediment kim et al 2003 the varying forms of sequestered p in the sediment can substantially affect their potential for remobilization and resupply in the lakes however visual assessments of the dynamic processes of p between water and sediment are scarce accurate understanding of the occurrence and diagenesis features of p in the sediment and the interactions of p between the water and the solid sediment is important for the management of p sources and the recovery of eutrophic lakes the boundary layer near the sediment is a crucial site in connection with external and internal exchanges of p in lacustrine ecosystems riber and wetzel 1987 the water sediment interface often features steep physical and chemical gradients such as dissolved oxygen do ph redox potential eh and dissolved ions po4 3 fe2 s2 etc within narrow distances xu et al 2012 the oxidized microzones in bottom sediments of lakes okeechobee and apopka usa vary in depth from a few mm to about 2 cm olila and reddy 1997 dissolved oxygen do is one of the predominant controlling factors of p cycling in aquatic environments cesbron et al 2014 dynamic processes of p including transformations in speciation and mobility that occur at the sediment surface are regulated by do penetration depth of the water sediment continuum simpson et al 2019 the concentration and dynamic effects of soluble reactive phosphorus srp in the water sediment continuum are predominantly influenced by the balance between adsorption and desorption to p containing minerals chen et al 2018 labile p in the solid sediment can be released into the interstitial water from the binding sites of solid sedimentary particles and consequently upwardly diffuse into overlying water as seen in increased concentration gradients near the boundary layer which further fuels the eutrophication in lakes ding et al 2015 these redox mediated processes in the thin oxidized microzone underlain by a large scale reduced layer of surficial sediment dominate the remobilization and resupply of p in water hydrological characteristics such as water level can alter the aeration of bottom waters and surficial sediment and further influence the p dynamics in aquatic ecosystems which are susceptible to meteorological conditions morphology and exogenous discharge vollenweider 1975 water quality is influenced by water level fluctuations in aquatic systems wang et al 2020 for example seasonal fluctuations between high water level and low water level can result in active changes in energy and matter including the forms and distribution of p mooney et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the observation performed by qin et al 2020 suggested that water depth plays a critical role in lake eutrophication and p limitation especially in deep lakes the seasonal resuspension and settling of particulates depending on water level fluctuation can determine the eh status at the water sediment interface and subsequently affect the uptake and release of p especially in fe rich systems olila and reddy 1997 water level fluctuations mitigate eutrophication status in some lakes reservoirs due to the alternation of redox conditions and has been the focus of attention worldwide bao et al 2015 gao et al 2020 however previous research focused mainly on ex situ measurements of p containing compounds that can induce the change of physical and chemical characteristics the study of dynamic processes of p in water sediment systems during water sediment fluctuations in lakes is limited due to the lack of high resolution in situ testing technologies in aquatic environment ferric iron fe3 and sulfate so4 2 as terminal electron acceptors can be simultaneously reduced by heterotrophic bacteria and anaerobic episodes azzoni et al 2001 the integration of p with fe oxy hydr oxides is critical for the immobilization of the labile p fraction in sediment norgbey et al 2020 the reductive dissolution of p bound to fe containing minerals in the sediment particles in anoxic conditions plays a key role in releasing p into interstitial water and its subsequent diffusion into overlying water cosmidis et al 2014 additionally the reduction of so4 2 to s2 can influence p bound to fe containing minerals which can stimulate po4 3 and fe cycling and eutrophication in lakes zhao et al 2019 to explore the lability and occurrence of p fe2 and s2 in the sediment previous work has principally focused on ex situ chemical extraction methods egger et al 2016 chen et al 2018 simultaneous in situ detection of these chemical components at high resolution is required to reveal the distribution and dynamic behaviors of these contaminants due to the spatial heterogeneity in the sediment advanced and maneuverable high resolution techniques are pivotal for the exact exploration of the dynamics of fe p s across the water sediment interface of lakes diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is a technique for the in situ visual assessment of the resupply potential of labile analytes such as metal ions po4 3 fe2 and s2 from solid phase to aqueous phase alexa et al 2009 as an in situ dynamic speciation technique a dgt unit consists of diffusive boundary layer diffusive gel and binding gel layer ding et al 2018 dgt can enable high resolution two dimensional 2d images of analytes and can supply visual heterogeneity in sediment microstructures at a small or even micro scale han et al 2017 a steady state linear concentration gradient of labile forms of analytes is established between the binding gel and the solution and maintains the flux of the solute controlled by diffusion harper et al 2000 the dgt measured fractions are composed of both solute from interstitial water and the further resupply of the solid sediment as a comparative evaluation of measurements the diffusion processes of dgt simulate the interaction of labile analytes between solid and solution in the sediment and reflect the actual dynamic behaviors in natural environments price et al 2013 double sided dgt techniques combined with traditional analysis methods are used for the synchronous detection of heterogeneous changes of labile p fe2 and s2 in the water sediment continuum in a representative lake undergoing intense water level fluctuation over time the main objectives of this study are to 1 characterize in situ 2d flux changes of labile p fe2 and s2 using a novel high resolution dgt technique in the water sediment continuum that experiences the change of water depth 2 elaborate the resupply mechanisms of labile p that vary from the solid sediment phase to the solution phase due to the water level fluctuations and 3 clarify the influence mechanism of lake water level variation on the remobilization of labile p controlled by fe2 and s2 variation in sediment which can potentially deteriorate the water quality 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collecting and processing sediment cores beneath undisturbed overlying water were carefully taken from three representative regions 1 2 and 3 in shijiuhu lake 31 23 31 33 n 118 46 118 58 e a freshwater shallow lake located in the lower yangtze river basin eastern china fig 1 using columnar sampler in october 2020 this lake is connected to the yangtze river the third largest river in the world through the guxi river and the water level frequently varies because of the variation in irrigation of the yangtze river along with seasonal rainfall the lake has its highest water depth of more than 6 m in the wet season and can dry up in some regions in low water seasons chi et al 2016 excessive nutrients including p are discharged into this lake through runoff and or river inputs due to increasing anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices wastewater discharge and aquaculture overlying water samples were collected simultaneously from the sampling sites one set of collected sediment columns was carefully sliced into pieces at 1 cm intervals after sampling the sub samples were placed in a cooler and transferred to the laboratory where they were kept at 4 c after freeze drying with a vacuum freeze dryer and grinding with an agate mortar the sediment particles were sieved using a 100 mesh sieve before subsequent analysis additionally two other undisturbed sediment columns were transferred to the lab and used for dgt deployment and incubation experiments respectively physicochemical parameters of the lake water were observed simultaneously by using a portable water quality analyzer hach sl1000 japan in field these included values of water depth wd

obtained data are listed in table 1 2 2 extraction of p fractions different p fractions in pristine sediment cores were extracted based on the sequential extraction method using the operationally defined standards measurements and testing programme smt for its ease of use and reproducible results ruban 1999 2001 this procedure has been developed based on the comparisons of existing schemes and interlaboratory studies ruban et al 2001 briefly 0 2 g of freeze dried sediment was vibrated and extracted with different chemical extractants step by step at a constant solid solution ratio 1 100 fig s1 the modified smt protocol categorized the sedimentary p phases in the sediment into six independent pools as follows mgcl2 p labile p pool fe p p bound to fe and al oxy hydr oxides ca p p associated with ca pi total inorganic p po total organic p and tp total p all the phosphate concentrations in the extractant of the six pools were measured using molybdenum blue colorimetry finally interstitial water in the pristine sediment cores was obtained using centrifugation at 2500 g for 30 min the concentrations of srp in pore water filtered through 0 45 μm gf c filter membrane whatman usa were immediately detected using molybdenum blue colorimetry ruban et al 2001 2 3 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy for the identification and assessment of solid fe phases the 57fe mössbauer spectra of

500 germany a 57co rh source was used with an activity of 25 mci the result was obtained by comparing with a 25 μm α fe absorber at room temperature transmitted radiation was observed using an ar kr proportional counter finally a 512 channel analyzer was used to document the generated signal 2 4 analysis of toc tn and stable isotopes approximately 0 5 g of dried sediment was digested using extractant of mixed nitric acid hno3 hydrochloric acid hcl and perchloric acid hclo4 subsequently the total concentrations of elements al fe ca and mn were measured with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes profile dv usa another 1 g of freeze dried sediment sample was treated using 5 hcl solution for the removal of carbonates following freeze drying the ground sediment was packaged in high purity tin capsules and the concentrations of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were simultaneously detected with a chns o elemental analyzer connected to a thermal conductivity detector eurovector euro ea 3000 italy the mass ratio of toc and tn c n in each sediment layer was subsequently calculated in addition values of stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n in

scientific usa ground dried sediment samples about 20 mg were put into ultra pure tin capsules the prepared samples were successively combusted at 1020 c in the front furnace and at 700 c in the rear furnace respectively the generated co2 and n2 were isolated from the combustion products for subsequent measurement of isotope values the δ13c and δ15n of the samples were calculated by comparing to international standards vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for c and atmospheric nitrogen for n respectively abreu et al 2006 2 5 incubation experiment with controlling water depth manipulation experiments were performed in the laboratory to explore the dynamic variation of analytes in lake water sediment interfaces of lakes that are undergoing water level fluctuation a set of undisturbed sediment cores were plugged using rubber plugs drilled with small holes to avoid the evaporation of overlying water the depth of sediment column s overlying water was preserved at low water level 60 cm which is much lower than the water depth of the lake in the field the columns were wrapped in foil to stop light entering and preserved at room temperature without disturbance for 30 days physicochemical parameters from the incubation microcosm including do t and ph values of overlying water were measured with a portable water quality analyzer hach sl1000 japan after the incubation period the concentrations of total p and srp in the overlying water were detected with molybdenum blue colorimetry after filtration through 045um filter membrane 2 6 dgt deployment the pristine sediment collected from shijiuhu lake and the 30 day incubated sediment cores were analyzed using dgt techniques to measure labile srp s2 and fe2 fluxes and concentrations across the water sediment interface in brief the integrated double sided zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices easysensor china were aerated using pure n2 flow for 12 h for deoxidation then the devices were perpendicularly penetrated into sediment cores without disturbing the water sediment interface and experienced an equilibrium period of 24 h for diffusion in the microcosm relative to independent zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices this integrated double sided dgt device has the advantage of synchronous measurement and thus less destruction to the pristine sediment samples these assemblies were used for high resolution in situ measurement of labile p using zr oxide dgt and s2 and fe2 fluxes using zro ca dgt respectively after the equilibrium period the dgt devices were removed from the microcosms the gel surfaces were carefully rinsed using deionized di water to remove the affixed particles the temperature of the overlying water was synchronously measured for the calculation of diffusive fluxes of the analytes at the water sediment continuum the dgt equipment was then separated into independent zr oxide dgt and zro ca dgt devices after rinsing the masses of elements p and s that had accumulated in the binding gels were determined separately according to the modified coloration cid method proposed by ding et al 2015 in brief the gel surface of the zro ca dgt device was carefully dried with filter paper and then scanned with a flat bed scanner canon 5600f japan at 600 dpi resolution equal to a pixel size of 42 μm 42 μm the obtained image was subsequently converted into grayscale intensity for the acquisition of high resolution 2d s2 dgt fluxes subsequently the surface of the gel was immediately washed again using di water and then cut into small strips at 2 mm intervals these strips were placed into the centrifuge tubes and subsequently extracted using 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 for 24 h chen et al 2017 the fe2 dgt concentration in each extract was measured using phenanthroline colorimetric methods xu et al 2013 additionally each gel of zr oxide dgt was heated using a hot plate at 80 c for 24 h then moistened using the mixed molybdenum reagent for coloration for 1 h at 35 c the dgt staining assembly was then rinsed and soaked with cool di water at 4 c to avoid the development of color the surface of the dyed hybrid film was subsequently scanned at 600 dpi resolution using the flat bed scanner described above to obtain high resolution 2d flux images of labile pdgt the grayscale intensities of the images following conversion into monochrome were acquired with imagej software finally the calibration curves of the coloration cid were calculated by analyzing dgt pistons containing s2 and po4 3 p in different concentrations han et al 2017 the calibration curves between accumulated masses of p and s in the gel films and grayscale intensities of corresponding analytes were fitted as exponential equations xu et al 2013 finally the grayscale intensities of scanned images from sediment samples were used to calculate accumulation mass of s2 and srp for each pixel according to the observed calibration equations 2 7 apparent diffusive flux calculation the apparent diffusive flux across the water sediment interface can represent the diffusion extent and direction of ions between the surficial sediment and overlying water ding et al 2015 the total diffusive flux was calculated as the

simulation a one dimensional 1d difs model can be used to explore the diffusion kinetics of contaminants in the sediment system and exchange processes between pellets and dgt devices hypothetical dimensionless r values eq 2 can describe the resupply capacity of the analytes at the solid solution interface the difs model can also characterize the dependence extent of r values on diffusion capacity of labile p from solid particle toward the solution lehto et al 2008 this resupply process is composed of both the diffusion of labile p to the dgt surface and its further accumulation into

toc and tn concentrations and 13c 15n isotope values in pristine sediment particles the srp concentrations in pristine pore water and the c n values of solid sediment are also given in fig 2 generally the concentrations of metal elements decreased in the order al fe ca mn across the sediment profiles relatively unordered variation of these metal elements existed in the majority of the layers of the sediment columns especially for fe al and ca except for few outliers significant upward increases of toc and tn concentrations were found for all the sampling sites through the entire set of sediment columns c n varied from 8 0 11 0 and had an adverse variation trend that decreased upwards toward the upper layer the values of δ13c and δ15n for all three sediment columns were 40 0 to 22 7 and 3 0 to 8 1 respectively and these overall reduced upward from the bottom layer additionally srp concentrations in pore water fluctuated in the range of 013 0 44 mg l 1 which was about 10 orders of magnitude higher than in the overlying lake water 3 2 variation of p fractions in the sediment profiles fig 3 presents the concentrations and variation of different p fractions in the profiles of pristine sediment from different sites of the lake extracted using the improved smt method in general tp concentrations at the three sites varied from 292 1 to 644 5 mg kg 1 across the whole profiles more significant fluctuation of tp values were found at sites 2 and 3 than at 1 generally total pi with values varying from about 160 490 mg kg 1 was higher than total po in all sediment profiles a similar change in trend of pi to tp existed at all three sites the po concentrations on the sediment profiles except that from site 1 displayed an obvious increase from the bottom upward toward the top layer the pi pools in the three sampling sites represented the relatively homologous variation among the entire profiles that is mgcl2 p fe p ca p meanwhile ca p concentrations accounted for the largest fraction of the tp at 30 0 80 0 fe p constituted a second largest pi pool with about 14 6 28 8 of tp concentration labile mgcl2 p contributed the fraction less than 3 of tp significantly a stable ratio of fe p accounting for tp was measured at site 1 compared with the two other sites especially site 2 which had increasing values from the bottom toward the upper layers also at site 2 significant upward increases of mgcl2 p and fe p were found from the bottom layer to about 10 cm depth then concentrations of these two pools did not obviously fluctuate until the surface layer however these two p pools at sites 1 and 3 with lower water depth kept relatively stable across the entire sediment depth adverse variation of ca p at site 2 was detected below 10 cm depth except for a few outliers generally the mgcl2 p fe p and ca p at site 1 which underwent intensive water level fluctuation relative to the two other sampling sites maintained more analogous concentrations across the entire sedimentary profiles 3 3 57fe mössbauer spectroscopy for solid sediment particles the result of mössbauer spectroscopy at room temperature for different sediment depths are shown in fig 4 modeling was implemented using the lorentzian line shape model the proportion of fe fraction was calculated as area of individual peak compared with total fe phases the obtained data about solid fe mineralogy phases are presented in table 3 the main fe minerals including fe iii minerals ferrihydrite and phyllosilicate concomitant fe ii minerals siderite and or chlorite were distinguished in all the sediment samples murad and cashion 2004 yuan et al 2019 fe iii phase concentrations were approximately 2 5 orders of magnitude higher than fe ii phase concentrations similar fe ii percentages 70 2 74 7 accounting for total fe kept relatively stable at different sedimentary depths except for a few outliers generally comparable ratios of fe ii percentages were found at all three different research sites although slight variations also existed between different sites and depths 3 4 variation of 2 d patterns of pdgt and s2 dgt through the water sediment interface before and after incubation high resolution in situ 2d and 1d images gained by using the double sided dgt technique of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes across the water sediment interface before and after incubation are shown in figs 5 and 6 a f greater fluxes were simultaneously detected in the water sediment continuum at site 1 compared with the other two sites the lowest fluxes of pdgt and s2 dgt were found at site 2 note that generally significant variation in gradients of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes across the sediment column were detected at approximately 5 cm depth in addition pdgt concentrations kept relatively stable at about 0 064 0 006 0 053 0 006 and 0 031 0 006 mg l 1 at sites 1 2 and 3 respectively from the bottom sedimentary layer upwards to about 5 cm depth then sharply decreased to about 0 002 mg l 1 until the water sediment interface s2 dgt concentrations maintained relatively stable at about 0 16 0 02 0 17 0 04 and 0 13 0 01 mg l 1 respectively at the three sampling sites again until about 5 cm depth then rapidly decreased to about 0 013 0 05 and 0 05 mg l 1 in the top sediment layer the variation measured by dgt indicated that the fluxes and concentrations of pdgt and s2 dgt significantly decreased in the three microcosms after incubation with low water levels especially in the top 5 cm depth layer of sites 1 and 3 between 5 cm depth and the water sediment interface pdgt concentrations experiencing incubation fell to less than half those of the pristine sediment columns s2 dgt concentrations decreased to less than 0 1 mg l 1at about 5 cm layer and further reduced to 0

concentrations through the water sediment interface similar to the variations of pdgt and s2 dgt the fe2 dgt concentrations generally remained stable below 5 cm depth with average values of 4 9 3 2 and 2 6 mg l 1 respectively at the sampling sites 1 l 2 l and 3 the concentrations drastically decreased to 0 5 0 1 and 0 01 mg l 1 respectively from about the 5 cm layer upward to the top layer the fe2 dgt values obviously decreased to 2 9 2 6 and 1 4 mg l 1 below 5 cm depth and kept relatively steady toward the 5 cm sedimentary depth at all of the sampling sites then the concentrations dramatically reduced to 0 4 0 2 and 0 03 mg l 1 respectively upward towards the top layer of the sediment additionally the fe2 dgt concentrations in overlying water at site 1 were distinctly higher than those of the other two sediment cores generally roughly analogous changes were measured in all of the sampling sites however site 1 with high fluctuations of water level displayed more significant variations of fe2 dgt concentrations compared with the two other sites with relatively high water depth 3 6 diffusion fluxes of srp s2 and fe2 through the water sediment interface apparent diffusion fluxes of pdgt s2 dgt and fe2 dgt across the water sediment continuum of the three sampling sites of the lake are shown in fig 7 obviously positive flux values of these parameters were determined at all the research sites the highest fluxes of pdgt and fe2 dgt in pristine sediment cores up to 0 015 and 1 3 µg cm2 s 1 respectively were found in sampling site 1 higher s2 dgt fluxes were also monitored at site 1 it is noteworthy that the diffusion fluxes of all the parameters through the water sediment interface distinctly decreased with the execution of the incubation experiments for all the sampling sites 4 discussion 4 1 fe bound p dominates the mobility of p in the sediment partition of p fractions indicates the different mobility and resupply potential of p from the solid sediment to the aqueous solution mgcl2 p which is associated with the solid surface and the compound by weak physical and chemical interactions can be directly adsorbed by aquatic organisms as the most labile p pool aminot and andrieux 1996 this implies the resupply potential of labile p to the solution phases even when the concentrations of this pool are relatively low compared with other p fractions gradually increasing mgcl2 p concentrations from the bottom toward the top layer especially at sites 1 and 3 suggested the accumulation of this kind of p phase in the upper layer of sediment this tendency was also observed in other aquatic environments such as lake erken rydin 2000 lake taihu yuan et al 2019 and the peru margin jaisi and blake 2010 however inverse decreasing trends on the sediment profiles were detected in other water bodies such as chesapeake bay etc joshi et al 2015 these results may be attributed to differences in resupply dynamics of labile p pools additionally research site 1 displayed relative stability and homogeneity of labile mgcl2 p concentrations across the whole sediment column except for a few outliers all these variation characteristics suggested different bonding effects on the surface of sediment particles between free phosphate and fixed p containing minerals which consequently controlled sorption desorption processes under various conditions including fluctuating water depth significant increases of fe p upward from the bottom layer were observed in site 2 which had the highest water level indicating it was the most stable burial environment in this lake low values of fe p suggested a reduced layer with low redox potential under the thin oxidized zone where p bound to ferric oxy hydroxides feo oh may be released due to the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions inducing the decrease of particle p borch et al 2007 an upward increasing trend of this kind of p phase was normally investigated in aquatic ecosystems without dramatic variations of water level ruban et al 1999 liu et al 2019 under anoxic anaerobic conditions fe iii can be reduced to fe ii as electron acceptor and consequently dissolves in the water phase together with the release of phosphate in the deep layer of the sediment aminot and andrieux 1996 the most significant positive correlations r2 0 927 p 0 01 were observed between mgcl2 p and fe p compared with ca p in sediment of site 2 indicating that the fe p phase potentially contributes to the deposition of labile p in steady anoxic conditions with deeper overlying water it is interesting that the sites 1 and 3 having relatively lower overlying water levels than site 2 displayed homogeneity in fe p concentration across the whole sedimentary depth weak correlation between mgcl2 p and fe p was discovered in sites 1 and 3 do can penetrate into surficial sediment when the water is shallow which may result in the more extensive oxidation of sediment kreling et al 2017 this process favors the re oxidation of labile fe ii into fe iii and the corresponding dissociation of phosphate in oxic episodes which can further lead to the immobilization of p as solid particle p phase in lacustrine ecosystems higher srp concentrations fig 2j were also detected in pore water of sediment from site 2 indicating that the fe p was mobilized to be desorbed into the aquatic phase into the deep water environment in anoxic episodes however these notions need further direct evidence ca p accounted for higher ratios 50 of pi except for a few outliers across the whole profile in all the sampling sites compared with potentially mobilizable phases including mgcl2 p and fe p however detrital and authigenic origin ca p tended to remain relatively stable in accumulation characteristics during the sedimentation history ruttenberg and berner 1993 measurements of phosphate oxygen isotopes δ18op in the sediment from different aquatic environments also revealed that ca p possessed lighter isotope values joshi et al 2015 yuan et al 2019 this demonstrated that ca p was locked in and remained largely unaltered after its formation and precipitation as ca containing minerals in the sediment weaker correlation detected between ca p and mobile mgcl2 p r2 0 429 p 0 05 in site 2 with more stable sedimentary conditions further suggested the inconspicuous contribution to the mobile p fraction additionally po in the sediment from these lake regions accounted for between 5 49 of tp increasing po proportion from the top layer downward indicated the preferential degradation and mineralization into pi in deeper layers po compounds were often considered as part of the refractory p however po compounds were composed of labile fractions which can re mineralize into the pi fraction and played a significant role in p cycling pant et al 2002 po was often present in natural om from various sources bedrock et al 1995 c n can be used to speculate the source of om in the sedimentary particles settling into the lakes xia et al 2021 plant groups mainly contribute to the lake om and display different ranges of c n ratios algae derived om phytoplankton typically possesses c n mass ratios of 4 to 10 while aquatic macrophytes range from 10 to 50 and vascular terrestrial plants generally have values higher than 20 contreras et al 2018 therefore c n varying from 8 0 11 0 in this research suggests the predominantly algae derived source of om in the sediment the decreased trend toward the upper layer suggested the aggravation of algae biomass following the anthropogenic activities around the lake the low toc values in the deeper sediment layer might be due to the greater degradation rates of om under aerobic scenario rather than anaerobic conditions pant et al 2002 which induced the degradation of po in the sediment especially at site 1 having deeper water furthermore c and n stable isotopes 13c and 15n are also frequently used to identify the source of om deposited in the lakes li et al 2018 the decreasing upwards trend of δ13c and δ15n values also indicated the alternation of om sources during sedimentation processes the δ13c values of endogenous algae in the lakes normally ranged from 31 to 24 meyers 2003 the δ15n values of macroalgae commonly varied between 0 5 and 13 8 cole et al 2004 generally c n along with δ13c and δ15n illustrated that the increasing algae detritus induced the accumulation of biogenic p containing om in the sediment the degradation of om and reduction of fe oxy hydr oxides could simultaneously trigger the release of phosphate into the pore water from po and fe p in sediments during the diagenetic processes egger et al 2015 however it should be noted that the relatively long half life several to dozens of years of po compounds indicated that the resupply potential of labile p fraction was inconspicuous in the sediment ahlgren et al 2005 2006 reitzel et al 2006 ding et al 2013 yuan et al 2020 the predominance of fe p release within a short time in lacustrine sediment systems contributing to the increase of the labile p fraction in the lakes deserves further consideration and explicit evidence 4 2 re mobilization dynamics of srp evaluated using the difs model the output values of dynamic parameters for labile p fraction in 5 cm sediment depths including r kd tc k1 and k 1 were obtained using the difs model and are listed in table 4 the general downward increase of r values at all three sampling sites indicated that phosphate depletion in pore water was supplemented by solid phases for dgt uptake owing to higher labile p concentrations controlled by the reduction of fe p in the deeper layers higher r values indicated more significant resupply efficiency and potential bio availability of labile p in the sediment which further contributed to higher labile p concentrations in the pore water in deeper layers monbet et al 2008 response time tc generally decreased with depth downward at site 1 with its low water depth tc values are sensitive to the variation of r values in the difs model lehto et al 2008 lower tc values together with larger r values in this study further demonstrated the significant resupply capacity of labile p from sediment particles to interstitial water when the sediment tends to be anaerobic fig 8 plots the time dependence curves of r values for labile p in the 5 cm sediment depth layer which were principally dominated by both the desorption of sediment particles into the pore water and the accompanying diffusion efficiency to the diffusive layer of the dgt device harper et al 2000 sochaczewski et al 2007 the initial increase of r curves may be attributed to the dramatically steep linear diffusion of labile p from the interstitial water toward the diffusion layer of the devices lehto et al 2008 progressive decline after the peak value of r occurred due to the limit to the resupply induced by the consumption of labile p near the dgt device along with the low desorption rate from the solid sediment phase heidari et al 2017 guan et al 2017 r accumulation curves confirmed the considerable re mobilization and transport capacity of mobile p fractions including fe p from the solid sediment to the pore water as well as overlying water via dynamic diffusion additionally kd can also exert influence on the r values together with tc obvious positive correlation was found between kd and r r2 0 688 p 0 01 which further reflected the remarkable influence of solid sediment exchanging with the solution in the sediment system obviously higher k1 than k 1 values suggested stronger adsorption potential rather than desorption for the solid sediment across the whole sediment profiles of the research sites heidari et al 2017 generally higher r values combined with other dynamic parameters indicated that continuous resupply of labile phosphate at deep layers influenced the concentration gradient of labile p especially at site 1 this effect was driven by both desorption of mobilizable mgcl2 p and reduction of fe p in sediment especially under anaerobic conditions in deep sediment this dynamic process was responsible for the increasing concentrations of srp in overlying water of lacustrine ecosystems it is noteworthy that lower r values and higher tc at similar sediment layers were found at sites 2 and 3 both having higher water levels this indicated that more significant fluctuations of water depth potentially contributed to the desorption and resupply of labile p from the solid phase to the aqueous solution however this speculation needs further research and evidence 4 3 potential regulation of fe p by water level fluctuation fig 5 shows the high resolution 2d variations of pdgt and s2 dgt fluxes at the water sediment interface before and after incubation significant decreases of these two analytes were detected after incubation fig 6a f also depicts the variations of pdgt and s2 dgt concentrations through the water sediment continuum and exhibits the distinctly reduced trend especially at sites 1 and 3 with relatively low water depth concentrations of pdgt and s2 dgt decreased by more than half compared with the pristine sediment columns within a short time 30 days which was obviously quicker than the known po mineralization rates several to dozens of years in natural environments for the resupply of labile p fractions from solid phase to aqueous solution in addition fe2 dgt concentrations also significantly decreased by more than half in each microcosm after the incubation relative to the pristine sediment cores fig 6g i this clearly indicated the rapid re oxidation of fe ii ions into fe iii and the existence of the solid particle phase due to the reduction of water depth together with an increase of penetration depth of do in the water sediment continuum synchronous sorption and immobilization of labile phosphate accompanied the shift of fe iii and fe ii phases due to the oxidation of sediment modified by water depth note that more obvious fluctuations in pdgt and fe2 dgt concentrations werefound at about 1 5 cm depth indicating that the desorption activity principally happened in this sedimentary layer this active layer depth was slightly deeper than in the existing data ca 0 5 10 mm stockdale et al 2009 gao et al 2016 han et al 2017 indicating the larger range of resupply source of labile analytes from the deeper layer of sediment that is mediated by water level it is interesting that the generally higher pdgt and fe2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were found at site 1 which had the lowest water depth and highest do concentration relative to the other sites before and after the incubation experiments mössbauer measurements indicated that a relatively higher fe ii fraction was generally detected in the sediment column from site 1 table 3 it is speculated that more frequent water level fluctuations due to hydrological and meteorological conditions of the lake basin exerted stronger influence on the fe phases in those lake regions having shallow water depth dijkstra et al 2014 the comparable fe iii fe ii phase ratios to total fe at different sediment depths supported the frequent fluctuations of water level in this lake which was significantly different from findings at taihu lake which had downward increasing fe ii concentrations toward the deeper sediment layer yuan et al 2019 comparable fe p concentrations across the whole sediment profile from site 1 further supported this inference nriagu and dell 1974 proposed that crystalline fe containing minerals are remarkably more stable than amorphous ferric phosphate however amorphous fe ii containing minerals in association with p such as chlorite and or siderite were formed and preserved in the sediment via the transition of aerobic and anoxic episodes the investigation of rozan et al 2002 indicated that significant amounts of phosphate could be sequestered in amorphous iron phases this was corroborated by the inconspicuous fluctuation of total fe concentrations fig 2a across the whole sediment column this enrichment action predominantly controlled by oxygen resupply conditions during the diagenetic process may have led to higher proportions of both labile p and fe ii phase at site 1 experiencing multiple variations even at low water levels a higher proportion of crystal fe ii containing minerals existed at sites 2 and 3 with their relatively stabilized deposition environments which was responsible for the low concentrations of reducible fe p and labile fe ii phase these processes contributed to the occurrence of high fe ii concentration and subsequent reductive dissolution in the sediment when the do values in the microcosms were high under low water level conditions lucotte et al 1994 anschutz et al 1998 the incubation experiments proved that fe ii mineral coating by the oxide with p can be desorbed and released into water within a short time which resulted in the high labile fe ii concentration when the water depth became high and caused the reduction scenario house and denison 2000 this desorption and resupply effect for the labile p in the lake water was notably faster than the po degradation and mineralization effect mentioned in section 4 1 finally significant decreases of diffusion fluxes of labile pdgt and s2 dgt across the water sediment interface was detected at each microcosm with low overlying water depth after the 30 day incubation compared with pristine sediment fig 5 high resolution dgt measurements and kinetics calculation demonstrated that the variation of water level can modulate the occurrence of p and fe phases within a short time scale the incubation experiments revealed that higher water depth induced the desorption of p bound to fe containing minerals into pore water and its accompanying diffusion upward into overlying water which potentially facilitated the enrichment of labile p mass and fueled the eutrophication in the lake 4 4 synergistic regulation of sulfide on p regulation controlled by water depth furthermore obvious decreases of s2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were also observed in the sediment suggesting the rapid re oxidation of s2 into s following by so4 2 in oxic episodes at shallow water depth in the microcosm reductive dissolution of fe iii phases through reactions with sulfide can result in the diffusion of labile p bound to fe iii containing minerals and fe ii ions eq 7 küster heins et al 2010 li et al 2016 reduced diffusion fluxes of s2 dgt fig 5 from the sediment toward the overlying water at all the research locations further suggested the oxidization and fixation of a higher valence state of sulfur due to the decreased water depth similar to the results proposed by sun et al 2016 remarkable accumulation of s2 with sedimentary depth was detected at about 5 cm depth in the pristine sediment columns indicating the preferable enrichment of s2 under anoxic conditions the incubation experiments demonstrated the obvious oxidation of s2 under low water level conditions and its converse reduction in high water depth episodes on a short time scale sulfide in interstitial water was principally generated from so4 2 reduction as electron acceptor in anaerobic episodes naylor et al 2004 zhao et al 2019 the so4 2 reduction can trigger the production of fes and the acidification of the sediment system which furthers the activation and desorption of p bound to fe iii oxy hydroxides in deep layers eq 8 o connell et al 2015 norgbey et al 2020 7 2feooh 3s2 4h 2fes s0 4h2o 8 fe3 po4 2 nh2o 3s2 6h 3fes 2h2po4 nh2o similarly by comparing the pristine and incubated microcosms high resolution 2d and 1d images of s2 fluxes and concentrations show that the shift from s2 to so4 2 was also accelerated in the sediment water system via the do content variation caused by water depth fluctuation higher s2 dgt fluxes and concentrations were found at site 1 at the surficial sediment within about 5 cm depth where the chemical action and or microbial actions including sulfate reducing bacteria or sulfur oxidizing bacteria at different do conditions varied with water depth wu et al 2019 additionally the occurrence of s2 in the sediment facilitated the reduction dissolution under hypoxic conditions with the increase of lake water level in general our investigations indicated that frequent fluctuations of water depth in the lake over time stimulated the formation and retention of sulfide in the sediment and the subsequent acceleration of the desorption of the labile p fraction associated to the fe iii oxy hydroxides into the aqueous solution under the low do scenario fig 9 5 conclusions high resolution in situ fluxes of labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt were determined using novel dgt techniques which displayed significant differences at the water sediment interface in the various regions of a lake with frequent water level fluctuations these analytes in microcosms with low water depth and high do concentrations obviously decreased after incubation of 30 days indicating that water level fluctuation significantly influences adsorption desorption processes of the p bound to fe containing minerals within a short time higher labile pdgt fe2 dgt and s2 dgt concentrations were detected at the shallow lake region with more drastic water depth variations compared with the lake regions with relatively stable water levels this might be due to the frequent adsorption desorption of phosphate from the sediment particles to aqueous solution dominated by the variation in oxygen supply the water level fluctuations resulted in looser binding on the solid sediment and easier desorption under aerobic conditions even when the water depth was lower than in other lake regions generally speaking frequent fluctuations of water depth in the lake over time facilitated the formation and retention of sulfide and fe ii in the sediment and the subsequent desorption of the labile p fraction associated to the fe iii oxy hydroxides into the aqueous solution when the water depth became high these findings improve insights into the resupply of labile p from fe p due to water level fluctuation in hypereutrophic lakes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

16937,electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have emerged as a promising water treatment alternative but major breakthroughs are still needed in order for eaops to be competitive with traditional treatment technologies in terms of energy cost most existing studies have been conducted at high potentials to generate the powerful hydroxyl radical oxidant aqueous oh while adsorbed hydroxyl radicals oh may form at a much lower energy cost their possible utilization is limited due to the poor mass transfer of this highly reactive species on solid electrodes in this report we describe a novel flow anode system using 4 16 μm magnéli phase titanium suboxide particles as the anode material which enables the generation of a high steady state oh concentration 5 4 10 12 mol m 2

radicals magnéli phase titanium suboxide water treatment 1 introduction the increasing gap between water demand and supply highlights the need for exploitation of non conventional water resources and development of viable and high efficiency treatment technologies for household level to community level water security chaplin 2019 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are a promising suite of water treatment technologies aiming at such an accomplishment martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the most beneficial aspect of eaops is that they can produce powerful oxidants oh aq for disinfection and decontamination from a very green reagent water moreira 2017 water oxidation occurs at the anode of an electrochemical reactor via one two or four electron transfer reactions resulting in formation respectively of either oh aq h2o2 or o2 siahrostami et al 2017 in all cases the adsorbed oh radical oh is firstly formed as a result of the cleavage of the ho h bond on the anode with the free energy of this process δg oh influenced by the nature of the material viswanathan et al 2015 in order to render the one electron transfer reaction more thermodynamically favourable than the two or four electron transfer processes δg oh should be as close to the equilibrium potential of the water oxidation reaction eq 1 2 38 ev as possible that is once oh is formed it is readily desorbed and transforms to the solvated hydroxyl radical oh aq siahrostami et al 2020 2017 since δg oh is difficult to determine experimentally and there appears to be an intrinsic relationship between the o and oh radical adsorption energies siahrostami et al 2020 anode materials of high oxygen evolution potential e g boron doped diamond bdd at 2 80 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she xia

innovations that might render this technology cost competitive with conventional decontamination and disinfection techniques such as ozonation and uv h2o2 miklos et al 2018 essentially the energy barrier to produce oh aq in eaops is associated with the desorption of oh eq 1b as the generation of oh is recognized to occur at a much lower potential e g the δg oh values of iro2 and rho2 are 0 2 and 1 1 ev respectively malik et al 2020 shi et al 2017 siahrostami et al 2017 it has long been accepted that desorption of oh to form oh aq or physically adsorbed oh is necessary in water treatment by eaop fig 1 c brillas and martínez huitle 2015 martínez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 however the cleavage of the ho h bond and resultant generation of oh occurs at the electrode surface liu et al 2019 siahrostami et al 2020 with the oxidation of contaminants by surface located oh being a distinct possibility fig 1c kim et al 2012 shvets and kazansky 1972 song et al 2018 turro 2000 wang et al 2018 xiang et al 2010 yu et al 2004 zhu et al 2019 consistent with this hypothesis contaminant degradation at conventional planar electrodes is limited because of the relatively long mass transfer distance 100 µm chaplin 2014 higher energy efficiency has been reported for flow through configuration electrodes in eaops for which the mass transfer distance is two orders of magnitude lower garcia segura et al 2020 therefore it is assumed that oh could be more efficiently utilized if the mass transfer distance is further decreased fluidized bed electrochemical reactors in which the area between the anode and cathode is filled with conducting particles have been shown to exhibit enhanced mass transfer properties ghanbarlou et al 2020 shen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however these highly conductive particles are likely to cause short circuiting of the system ghanbarlou et al 2020 nekoueian et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 leading to a reduction in the energy efficiency here a flow anode system where particle electrodes are only added into the anode tank is proposed with a cation exchange membrane used as both a salt bridge and separator for the anode current collector pt coated ti mesh and cathode ti mesh meng et al 2019b zou et al 2019 the presence of the cation exchange membrane lowers the cell resistance substantially thereby facilitating charge transfer even in low ionic strength wastewaters meng et al 2019b zou et al 2019 we show in this work that a flow anode made of magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 particles can be charged via contact with the anode current collector enabling oxidation of h2o to adsorbed oh at only 1 5 v vs she a charge percolating network of the polarized flow particles operating in a monopolar mode i

prepared and agitated for 3 h afterwards the prepared slurry was evenly coated on a cleaned ti plate over an area of 4 cm 4 cm finally the obtained electrode was dried at 110 c overnight 2 2 experimental setup experiments were conducted in a homemade flow anode reactor fig 1 using a chi 660e electrochemical workstation in a three electrode system a photograph of the homemade flow anode reactor is provided in fig s1 cation exchange membrane cem type ii fujifilm europe was used to separate the anode tank where pt coated titanium mesh with an effective area of 16 cm2 and percentage of

used as the cathode an ag agcl electrode 197 mv vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe located 5 mm away from the pt coated titanium mesh was used as the reference electrode in the anode tank 1 5 or 50 mm kh2po4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte magnetic stirring rate was fixed at 120 rpm the anode current collector was immersed in the anodic solution where flow anode particles were maintained in suspension by a magnetic stirrer once a potential is applied to the anode current collector the flow anode particles can be polarized via contact with the anode current collector and or with one another in a manner identical to that by which particle electrodes are charged in a fluidized bed electrochemical reactor li et al 2019 meng et al 2019a furthermore electrons are expected to transfer between flow anode particles via contact with each other with charge transfer facilitated by the high concentration of particles in the flow anode in essence a charge percolating network is formed in the anodic tank once potential is applied the applied potential was converted to she by using e she e ag agcl 0 059 ph e o ag agcl oa and tpa were chosen as the target organic compounds to assess the direct electron transfer det process and oh mediated oxidation process respectively since oa has a low reaction rate with oh k oa oh 1 4 106 m 1 s 1 tpa which is a particularly selective oh

stirring was stopped such that the tixo2x 1 particles settled to the bottom of the reactor an appropriate volume of supernatant was then extracted and the corresponding volume of 5 mm kh2po4 solution

determined at predetermined time intervals the energy cost of removal per order of water contaminants eeo can be obtained according to eq 2 2 e e o u i d t v t log c 0 c t where t is the time v is the solution volume 100 ml u is the total cell voltage the total charge idt c is obtained by integrating the corresponding current i and c 0 and c t are the initial concentration of target organic compound and that at time t respectively pseudo first order rate constants were calculated using eq 3 3 c t c 0 exp k app t where k app represents the apparent rate constant min 1 since 2 oh tpa has low stability and can be further oxidized to other products the minimum steady state concentrations of oh oh s normalized to the section area was calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 oh s k tpa k tpa oh where k tpa oh is the second order reaction rate constant for reaction between tpa and oh 4 106 m3 mol 1 s 1 and k tpa is the nominal surface area normalized observed rate constant for tpa oxidation which is calculated by eq 5 5 k tpa k app v 60 s where s is the maximum contact surface area between tixo2x 1 particles and the anode current collector 16 cm2 when calculating the actual steady state concentration of oh the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of 2 g tixo2x 1 powder 1 7 m2 was used instead of the maximum contact surface area 16 cm2 as aforementioned since the concentration of oh aq was expected to be zero at 1 5 v vs she all radical concentrations mentioned in this study were considered to be associated with oh the mass transfer coefficient km was calculated using eq 6 li et al 2021 although the rate constants were not determined at the limiting current i e the current achieved when reactant concentration at the electrode surface is zero they are comparable to those reported in previous studies e g 10 5 10 4 m s 1 chaplin 2014 trellu et al 2018 6 ln c 0 c t k m s v t to further confirm the efficacy of oh with respect to target compound oxidation fluorescence microscopy image fmi analyses were conducted using an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ckx53 with excitation in the uv achieved using a mercury lamp cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2019 to investigate the production of radicals at the solid liquid interface of tixo2x 1 particles and avoid the interference of pt coated titanium mesh 100 ml solution containing 20 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 5 mm kh2po4 was added in the anode tank and 1 5 v vs she was applied on the pt coated titanium mesh 1 ml samples were withdrawn at various distances from the anode current collector after 20 mins reaction followed by immediately mixing with 1 ml solution containing 0 1 mm tpa and 5 mm kh2po4 afterwards 2 ml mixed solutions were transferred to a glass slide for image capturing 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the tixo2x 1 anode material and pt coated titanium anode current collector anode catalyst materials of high activity for 1e water oxidation and chemical stability are a prerequisite to achieve efficient conversion magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 was chosen as the starting flow anode material because of its excellent conductivity tominaka et al 2011 high catalytic activity for h2o to oh conversion chaplin 2019 zaky and chaplin 2013 and much lower cost compared to the state of the art boron doped diamond catalyst a pt coated titanium mesh is used as the anode current collector as this material is relatively inexpensive and resistant to oxidation at the 1 5 v anodic polarization used in these studies the methods for the characterization of the anode materials can be seen in secction s1 the sizes of tixo2x 1 particles are in a range of 4 16 μm fig 2 a with only ti and o elements detected on the surface fig s2b and s2c quantitative analysis of the phase identification results show that ti4o7 in the form of rutile blocks interleaved with corundum like layers is the dominant species 92 with ti3o5 and tio2 present at low abundances fig 2b the valence states of ti in magnéli ti4o7 were further investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the main sharp peak located at 458 2 ev is assignable to ti4 of rutile tio2 while the tails located at 456 4 ev for ti 2p3 2 can be attributed to the presence of ti3 in ti2o3 fig 2d geng and chen 2016 such interleaved structure results in the existence of vacant sites and the allowance of electric conduction geng and chen 2016 tominaka et al 2011 the specific surface area of tixo2x 1 0 85 m2 g 1 was determined from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3 and pore size distributions were calculated using the bjh model fig 2c resulting in an average pore diameter of 8 1 nm and a pore volume of 0 003 cm3 g 1 to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the flow anode system linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements were conducted over a range of conditions in order to determine the oxygen evolution reaction oer potentials of tixo2x 1 and pt coated titanium electrodes as shown in fig 2e the oer potentials of pt coated titanium mesh increased with an increase in solution conductivity fig 2e in accord with an increase in the values of taffel equation parameters in high conductivity solutions note that the oer potential of the pt coated titanium mesh in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions 1 76 v vs she was higher than the potential of 1 5 v vs she at which most experiments were conducted in order to investigate the generation of hydroxyl radicals moreover while the tixo2x 1 fixed electrode has a high overpotential 3 0 v vs she for oh aq and o2 evolution fig 2e chaplin 2014 le et al 2019 we found the heterogenous structural design of the tixo2x 1 flow anode and anodic current collector pt δg oh 0 2 ev intikhab et al 2017 led to a lower overpotential 1 76 v vs she fig 2e which can be attributed to the relatively low oer potential of the pt coated titanium electrode 3 2 oxidation performance and the impacts of operating conditions in traditional fluidized bed electrochemical reactors the particles are directly added into the area between the anode and cathode and operate in bipolar mode with both oxidation and reduction reactions occurring at particle surfaces for example meng et al 2019a placed granular sludge carbon particles between a ti ruo2 iro2 anode and a titanium plate cathode and observed effective removal of rhodamine b and low energy consumption li et al 2019 added cufe2o4 magnetic nanoparticles into the area between a ti ruo2 iro2 anode and a stainless steel cathode to catalyze the activation of persulfate achieving a 99 degradation efficiency and 22 1 toc removal of atrazine however in the case of the flow anode system described here particles are only added to the anode tank and thus unable to contact the cathode as such the flow anode particles will be positively charged only and may be considered to operate in monopolar mode terephthalic acid tpa was used as the target organic compound to assess the total production of oh a general term for both oh aq in the bulk solution and oh on the electrode in the flow anode system because of its high standard reduction potential for direct electron transfer that avoids false positive detection of oh jing and chaplin 2017 as evident from the open circuit potential ocp which is the potential established between the working electrode and the environment with respect to a reference electrode and polarity reversal results shown in figs s4 and s5 while an increase in the particle load increases the sorptive removal of tpa it is clear that adsorption plays a minor role in tpa removal compared to the removal achieved when a potential is applied fig s6a shows time course results of tpa oxidation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no tixo2x 1 in the anolyte while the flow anode mass 2 0 g was much less than that of the anodic current collector 7 8 g the addition of tixo2x 1 surprisingly improved the eaop performance at only 1 5 v vs she with the apparent rate constant increasing by 700 the influence of the quantity of tixo2x 1 particles on the oxidation performance was investigated at 1 5 v vs she in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions fig s6b with the results showing that the apparent rate constant for tpa oxidation increases with increase in the quantity of tixo2x 1 particles present though plateaus at higher tixo2x 1 loads 20 g l 1 fig 3 a reasons for the plateauing in rate of degradation at higher tixo2x 1 loads include the possibility that 1 the overall reaction was controlled by the charge transfer between the current collector and the flow anode at 1 5 v vs she at high tixo2x 1 loads fig s7 and or 2 the magnetic stirrer used in this study was unable to maintain all the particles in suspension at high tixo2x 1 doses indeed it was observed that there was some particle settling at 50 g l 1 tixo2x 1 at the fixed magnetic stirring rate of 120 rpm used these precipitated particles would not contribute to the removal of tpa as they were no longer in contact with either the anode or other charged particles therefore subsequent experiments were conducted at 20 g l 1 tixo2x 1 if not otherwise stated it should be noted that oxidation of phosphate to perphosphate has been observed to occur at bdd electrodes polarized at 2 4 v or more vs she and current densities of 20 to 130 ma cm 2 in 0 2 m phosphate solutions weiss et al 2008 and in similar solutions at average cell voltages of 5 12 v and current densities of 25 to 100 ma cm 2 by costa et al 2009 no oxidation peak was observed in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions in which the ti4o7 anode used in this study was polarized at 1 5 v vs she fig 2e as such we consider that the phosphate buffer is stable under the conditions used in this study particularly at the low current density of 0 1 ma cm 2 used eaops have been criticized due to their limited efficiency in treating low ionic strength streams in this study we evaluated the influence of solution conductivity over a range of kh2po4 concentrations 1 50 mm fig 3a with comparable rate constants obtained in 1 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions i e k app 0 034 and 0 047 min 1 respectively fig 3b moreover tpa oxidation in the flow anode reactor is not ph dependent over the ph range 4 5 12 0 with this result indicating that this process commences with h2o oxidation rather than oh oxidation fig 3c it is apparent that a charge percolating network is formed on polarization of the relatively concentrated suspension of flow anode particles these highly conductive and mutually interacting particles significantly reduce the effect of solution conductivity on oxidative performance a schematic of the charge percolating network that is formed is provided in fig s8 in order to measure the current flowing through the charge percolating network of flow anode particles an additional pt coated titanium mesh has been used to intercept the electrons transferring through the charge percolating network with an ammeter used to measure the current between the newly inserted pt coated titanium mesh and the cathode ti mesh a current of 0 9 ma which was lower than that of whole flow anode system 1 6 ma since the current resulting from reactions occurring at the surface of the anode current collector was excluded was observed when 1 5 v vs she was applied fig s8 in the presence of tixo2x 1 particles unsurprisingly in view of the well mixed nature of the flow anode the measured current was not affected by the location of the additional pt coated titanium mesh in comparison the current value was zero in the absence of tixo2x 1 particles with this result confirming that the presence of the conducting tixo2x 1 particles was critical to charge transfer in the anode tank in summary with the presence of anode particles in the electrolyte the overall resistance of the flow electrode was insignificantly influenced by the concentration of the electrolyte overall the charge percolating network of the flow anode can maintain its high efficiency over a wide range of conditions it should be noted that the removal of tpa began to decrease at the end of the experiments with this effect possibly ascribed to the formation of intermediates that compete with tpa in reacting with oh fig s9 shows that the total organic carbon concentation of the solution constantly decreases over the experiment indicating that the tixo2x 1 particles used in this study were not passivated during anodic polarization in addition the anode potential used in this study was also optimized for the current design because a further increase to 2 0 v vs she inevitably resulted in substantial o2 evolution and loss in current conversion to oh figs 3d and s10 3 3 mechanistic insight to oh generation in the flow anode system that tpa was indeed oxidized by oh in the flow anode system was confirmed by detection of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2 oh tpa a product from the reaction between tpa and oh fig 4 a the enhanced oh production was not associated with any current amplification effect due to decreased electrical resistance as a result of the addition of tixo2x 1 as the impedance spectra showed that the presence of tixo2x 1 in the anolyte had no effect on the charge transfer impedance of the system fig 4b and table s1 which is simulated according to the model circuit shown in fig s11 any false positive impact from direct electron transfer due to current amplification if any on the removal of tpa was further excluded by assessing the oxidation of oxalate which is a strong lewis base and used as a det probe xie et al 2020 fig 4c shows that the presence of tixo2x 1 had minimal impact on oxalate oxidation thus the removal of tpa by the det process is not important at least under the conditions used in this study we ascribe the enhanced oh production to the following possible processes firstly the oh production rate will be primarily determined by the number of active surface sites at particular potentials the use of tixo2x 1 in the flow anode reactor provides many more active surface sites compared to the traditional solid electrodes and results in a comparable steady state concentration of oh e g a minimum concentration of 5 4 10 12 mol m 2 at 1 5 v vs she to those formed in ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membranes rems at higher anode potentials 2 1 3 5 v in table s2 gayen et al 2018 nayak and chaplin 2018 song et al 2018 in addition the conversion of tpa 62 6 3 6 at 1 5 v vs she in the flow anode system is higher than that using a ti4o7 rem 18 7 0 91 at 2 1 v vs she indicating a higher oh utilization efficiency table s2 the real steady state concentration of oh in the flow anode system 5 1 10 14 mol m 2 at 1 a m 2 was also calculated based on the bet surface area and is quite comparable to those of bdd plate electrodes based on easa liu et al 2018 6 4 10 16 1 4 10 14 mol m 2 at 1 a m 2 indicating that the oh generation capacity of tixo2x 1 is similar to bdd with the particularly effective generation of oh attributable to the high surface area of the flowing particles secondly oh is produced principally in the form of surface bound oh which enhances the selectivity of the 1e water oxidation to oh over the 2e pathway to h2o2 and or the 4e pathway to o2 siahrostami et al 2020 results in fig s12 show that there is no h2o2 generated in the flow anode at 1 5 v vs she indicating the inhibition of the 2e pathway to h2o2 substantial generation of o2 at the surface of tixo2x 1 particles via 4e pathway will not occur until the anode potential is increased to 3 0 v vs she fig 2e thirdly the enhanced mass transfer in the flow anode system also plays a critical role with the mass transfer rate constant increasing from 0 62 10 5 to 4 48 10 5 m s 1 following the addition of tixo2x 1 particles to the anode tank fluorescence microscopy with signal mapping was introduced to assess the spatial location of oh zhang et al 2017 at open circuit potential no fluorescence response from hydroxylation of tpa by oh was observed fig 5 a in comparison the fluorescence response increased dramatically at 1 5 v vs she fig 5b with the mapping region confined to the solid liquid interface with this result providing clear evidence of the presence of surface 2 oh tpa notably the fluorescence signals at the tixo2x 1 surface were independent of the distance of tixo2x 1 particles from the current collector with oh production at the tixo2x 1 particle water interfaces occurring throughout the flow anode fig 5c this result suggests that the flow anode was either well mixed such that all particles came in contact with the current collector and or that the presence of the charge percolating network of flow anode particles enabled effective charge transfer between particles that oh is generated in the flow anode device has been further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr and radical quenching tests section s2 although the detection of hydroxyl radicals by the epr method has been questioned due to the false positive detection of oh caused by inverted spin trapping associated with the forrester hepburn mechanism jing and chaplin 2017 the experimental conditions can be optimized to guarantee the effectiveness of the method pei et al 2020 including the use of control measures and supporting methods such as the fluorescence microscopy and scavenging tests as was the case in this study there were no 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo oh signals in the bulk solution while the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were observed near the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles fig 5d with hyperfine coupling constants of αn 14 95 g and αβ h 14 95 g li et al 2015 indicating the generation of oh in the device to further validate oh generation on the surface of the flow anode three oh scavengers with distinct features were used methanol k meoh oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butyl alcohol k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 which mainly quench free oh either in solution or the particle diffusion boundary layer due to their low molecular affinity toward hydrophilic tixo2x 1 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 exerted no influence on tpa oxidation and 2 oh tpa generation fig 4a and d in contrast the addition of ki which can react with surface bound radicals zhu et al 2019 significantly depressed the oxidation of tpa and the formation of 2 oh tpa fig 4a and d since the i ion concention is much higher than that of tpa the i ions occupied the active sites that would otherwise be used for tpa degradation and reacted with surface bound oh to inhibit the surface mediated tpa oxidation process while the generation of oh has been shown to occur in fixed electrode photochemical and anodic oxidation processes ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the utilization efficiency of these surface bound radicals has not been quantified presumedly as a result of the limited surface area and poor mass transfer of the static electrodes the tpa oxidation and oh generation results reported here support the hypothesis that the efficient conversion of h2o to oh can be achieved at low anode potential via a charge percolating network of flow anode particles with the oh generated at the charged particle surfaces capable of oxidatively transforming aqueous contaminants at substantially lower energy than can be achieved by conventional eaop methods as shown in fig 6 the flow anode device maintained consistent performance with respect to tpa removal in successive operation over 20 cycles there were no changes in the chemical state of ti according to xps ti 2p3 2 spectra fig s13 and x ray diffractometer xrd patterns fig s14 obtained before and after polarization at 1 5 v vs she for 48 h indicating high electrochemical stability while the reuse of the anode materials in a heterogeneously dispersed particles system could be a challenge for practical applications the size of the tixo2x 1 particles used in our flow anode system is at micrometer level 4 16 μm and based on our experience with flow electrodes zhang et al 2020 a microfiltration module can be introduced to realize the solid liquid separation and continuous operation at low cost 3 4 application of the flow anode system to oxidation of tetracycline and orange ii as a demonstration of potential application we used the flow anode device to treat water containing the biorefractory organic compounds tetracycline tc and orange ii as shown in fig 7 a the conversion of tc increased from 46 to 82 with the apparent rate constant increasing from 0 010 to 0 029 min 1 on applying a potential of 1 5 v vs she compared to the control experiment with no tixo2x 1 particles present fig s15 the first order tc degradation rate constant at 1 5 v cell voltage anode potential 1 5 v vs she was significantly higher than that 0 016 min 1 achieved using solid electrodes at 4 4 v cell voltage liang et al 2018 physical adsorption and electrosorption contributed insignificantly to the removal of tc fig 7a and fig s16 similarly the orange ii apparent rate constants increased from 0 013 fig s17 to 0 03 min 1 and complete color removal of orange ii could be achieved after 180 min reaction at 1 5 v vs she fig 7c the energy consumption per order of magnitude removal eeo of tc 6 7 wh m 3 and orange ii 1 5 wh m 3 achieved by the flow anode system are compared with eeo values for other decontamination techniques in fig 7b d and table 1 aleboyeh et al 2008 chen et al 2003 chou et al 2011 helaïli et al 2009 hou et al 2016 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2015 oturan et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 in addition the energy costs per mmol for orange ii 54 wh mmol 1 and tc 39 wh mmol 1 removal were also calculated table 1 the energy consumption of the flow anode system is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than other techniques with this comparison highlighting the commercial opportunities of this novel flow anodic oxidation electrochemical technology while the low ionic strength of environmental samples typically limits the use of electrochemical technologies our work shows that the flow anode system is highly efficient even in a dilute 5 mm matrix moreover a flow electrode was used in the anode tank in this study to oxidize water pollutants in the cathodic compartment h2 and h2o2 production xia et al 2019 and or co2 reduction chang et al 2016 have been considered for energy exploitation and anti climate change purposes with the introduction of a flow cathode expected to significantly improve the efficiency of these complementary processes the solution composition will have a significant effect on the removal of target organic compounds since inorganic ions such as hco3 co3 2 and natural organic matter that are typically present in real wastewater are active hydroxyl radical scavengers chaplin 2014 in addition attention should be paid to the possible formation of toxic byproducts such as clo4 chaplin 2014 though the formation of such products is unlikely in the present system in view of the low operating voltage used 4 conclusions in this study a novel flow anode system in which tixo2x 1 flow anode particles are charged via contact with the anode current collector has been shown to result in the efficient oxidation of h2o to adsorbed oh at the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles while the flow anode mass was much less than that of the anodic current collector the addition of tixo2x 1 improved the oxidation performance at only 1 5 v vs she with the tpa apparent rate constant increasing by 700 compared to that in the absence of tixo2x 1 mechanistic insight into the generation of oh has been obtained using fluorescence microscopy epr spectroscopy and scavenging methods with adsorbed oh confirmed to play a dominant role in flow anode oxidation a charge percolating network of polarized flow anode particles was created in the anode tank which can efficiently generate the surface radical oh with subsequent degradation of particular organic compounds the eeo of tc and orange ii are 6 7 wh m 3 and 1 5 wh m 3 respectively which are 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than other techniques such as photocatalysis and electron fenton moreover our device demonstrates stable performance in a dilute matrix as such we are of the view based on the results

16937,electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have emerged as a promising water treatment alternative but major breakthroughs are still needed in order for eaops to be competitive with traditional treatment technologies in terms of energy cost most existing studies have been conducted at high potentials to generate the powerful hydroxyl radical oxidant aqueous oh while adsorbed hydroxyl radicals oh may form at a much lower energy cost their possible utilization is limited due to the poor mass transfer of this highly reactive species on solid electrodes in this report we describe a novel flow anode system using 4 16 μm magnéli phase titanium suboxide particles as the anode material which enables the generation of a high steady state oh concentration 5 4 10 12 mol m 2 at only 1 5 v vs she in a dilute electrolyte 5 mm kh2po4 the energy cost of removal per order of selected water contaminants tetracycline and orange ii in this study using the flow anode is 1 5 6 7 wh

provide new insight into a high efficiency low cost water treatment technology for organic contaminant degradation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow anode adsorbed hydroxyl radicals magnéli phase titanium suboxide water treatment 1 introduction the increasing gap between water demand and supply highlights the need for exploitation of non conventional water resources and development of viable and high efficiency treatment technologies for household level to community level water security chaplin 2019 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are a promising suite of water treatment technologies aiming at such an accomplishment martínez huitle and panizza 2018 the most beneficial aspect of eaops is that they can produce powerful oxidants oh aq for disinfection and decontamination from a very green reagent water moreira 2017 water oxidation occurs at the anode of an electrochemical reactor via one two or four electron transfer reactions resulting in formation respectively of either oh aq h2o2 or o2 siahrostami et al 2017 in all cases the adsorbed oh radical oh is firstly formed as a result of the cleavage of the ho h bond on the anode with the free energy of this process δg oh influenced by the nature of the material viswanathan et al 2015 in order to render the one electron transfer reaction more thermodynamically favourable than the two or four electron transfer processes δg oh should be as close to the equilibrium potential of the water oxidation reaction eq 1 2 38 ev as possible that is once oh is formed it is readily desorbed and transforms to the solvated hydroxyl radical oh aq siahrostami et al 2020 2017 since δg oh is difficult to determine experimentally and there appears to be an intrinsic relationship between the o and oh radical adsorption energies siahrostami et al 2020 anode materials of high oxygen evolution potential e g boron doped diamond bdd at 2 80 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she xia et al 2019 sno2 at 1 90 2 20 v vs she martínez huitle et al 2015 and ti4o7 at 2 20 2 60 vs she chaplin 2014 are typically used in eaop 1 h 2 o o h aq h e e 2 38 v she 1a h 2 o oh h e 1b oh o h aq where represents an anode surface site however operation at such high anode potentials inevitably results in high energy consumption usually at a level of 103 104 wh m 3 per order of contaminant removed garcia segura et al 2018 martínez huitle and panizza 2018 while recent progress in material development and process optimization of eaop is promising le et al 2019 there are few revolutionary innovations that might render this technology cost competitive with conventional decontamination and disinfection techniques such as ozonation and uv h2o2 miklos et al 2018 essentially the energy barrier to produce oh aq in eaops is associated with the desorption of oh eq 1b as the generation of oh is recognized to occur at a much lower potential e g the δg oh values of iro2 and rho2 are 0 2 and 1 1 ev respectively malik et al 2020 shi et al 2017 siahrostami et al 2017 it has long been accepted that desorption of oh to form oh aq or physically adsorbed oh is necessary in water treatment by eaop fig 1 c brillas and martínez huitle 2015 martínez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 however the cleavage of the ho h bond and resultant generation of oh occurs at the electrode surface liu et al 2019 siahrostami et al 2020 with the oxidation of contaminants by surface located oh being a distinct possibility fig 1c kim et al 2012 shvets and kazansky 1972 song et al 2018 turro 2000 wang et al 2018 xiang et al 2010 yu et al 2004 zhu et al 2019 consistent with this hypothesis contaminant degradation at conventional planar electrodes is limited because of the relatively long mass transfer distance 100 µm chaplin 2014 higher energy efficiency has been reported for flow through configuration electrodes in eaops for which the mass transfer distance is two orders of magnitude lower garcia segura et al 2020 therefore it is assumed that oh could be more efficiently utilized if the mass transfer distance is further decreased fluidized bed electrochemical reactors in which the area between the anode and cathode is filled with conducting particles have been shown to exhibit enhanced mass transfer properties ghanbarlou et al 2020 shen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however these highly conductive particles are likely to cause short circuiting of the system ghanbarlou et al 2020 nekoueian et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 leading to a reduction in the energy efficiency here a flow anode system where particle electrodes are only added into the anode tank is proposed with a cation exchange membrane used as both a salt bridge and separator for the anode current collector pt coated ti mesh and cathode ti mesh meng et al 2019b zou et al 2019 the presence of the cation exchange membrane lowers the cell resistance substantially thereby facilitating charge transfer even in low ionic strength wastewaters meng et al 2019b zou et al 2019 we show in this work that a flow anode made of magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 particles can be charged via contact with the anode current collector enabling oxidation of h2o to adsorbed oh at only 1 5 v vs she a charge percolating network of the polarized flow particles operating in a monopolar mode i e anodic only is formed in the anode tank with the efficient utilization of the surface radicals oh in this flow anode system resulting in the oxidation of water pollutants at a very low energy cost 1 5 6 7 wh m 3 as such our results indicate that flow anodic oxidation represents a viable electrochemical technology for water decontamination 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents tixo2x 1 powder 4 16

acid 2 oh tpa oxalate oa tetracycline tc and orange ii c16h11n2nao4s were purchased from sigma aldrich to investigate the electrochemical properties of the tixo2x 1 powder a static electrode was prepared on a ti plate 4 cm 6 cm that was cleaned with milli q water millipore and ethanol in brief a slurry consisting of 0 1 g tixo2x 1 powders and 5 mg polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf binder was prepared and agitated for 3 h afterwards the prepared slurry was evenly coated on a cleaned ti plate over an area of 4 cm 4 cm finally the obtained electrode was dried at 110 c overnight 2 2 experimental setup experiments were conducted in a homemade flow anode reactor fig 1 using a chi 660e electrochemical workstation in a three electrode system a photograph of the homemade flow anode reactor is provided in fig s1 cation exchange membrane cem type ii fujifilm europe was used to separate the anode tank where pt coated titanium mesh with an effective area of 16 cm2 and percentage of opening of 35 and tixo2x 1 were used as the current collector and the anode materials respectively and the cathode tank where ti mesh with an effective area of 16 cm2 at a percentage of opening 20 was used as the cathode an ag agcl electrode 197 mv vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe located 5 mm away from the pt coated titanium mesh was used as the reference electrode in the anode tank 1 5 or 50 mm kh2po4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte magnetic stirring rate was fixed at 120 rpm the anode current collector was immersed in the anodic solution where flow anode particles were maintained in suspension by a magnetic stirrer once a potential is applied to the anode current collector the flow anode particles can be polarized via contact with the anode current collector and or with one another in a manner identical to that by which particle electrodes are charged in a fluidized bed electrochemical reactor li et al 2019 meng et al 2019a furthermore electrons are expected to transfer between flow anode particles via contact with each other with charge transfer facilitated by the high concentration of particles in the flow anode in essence a charge percolating network is formed in the anodic tank once potential is applied the applied potential was converted to she by using e she e ag agcl 0 059 ph e o ag agcl oa and tpa were chosen as the target organic compounds to

stirring was stopped such that the tixo2x 1 particles settled to the bottom of the reactor an appropriate volume of supernatant was then extracted and the corresponding volume of 5 mm kh2po4 solution containing 1 mm tpa was added into the anode tank to maintain the same initial concentration of tpa 0 05 mm the above approach was repeated 20 times 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of oa tc orange ii 2 oh tpa and tpa present in solution were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a c18 column a uv detector and a fluorescent detector λex 315 nm and λem 435 nm for 2 oh tpa the uv wavelength detection was set to 355 nm for tc 210 nm for oa 254 nm for tpa and 485 nm for orange ii the mobile phases consisted of oxalic acid 0 01 m in di water methanol at 53 47 v v for tc h3po4 ph 2 5 acetonitrile at 80 20 v v for oa ammonium acetate ph 7 and acetonitrile at 70 30 v v for orange ii and methanol 0 1 formic acid in di water at 60 40 v v for tpa and 2 oh tpa with a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 chen et al 2018 jing and chaplin 2017 xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 all standards were prepared in the corresponding background electrolyte i e 1 5 or 50 mm kh2po4 the concentrations of h2o2 were measured by a fluorescence photometer λex 560 nm and λem 580 nm using amplex red h2o2 method kudin et al 2012 tretter et al 2007 the organic compound concentrations were determined at predetermined time intervals the energy cost of removal per order of water contaminants eeo can be obtained according to eq 2 2 e e o u i d t v t log c 0 c t where t is the time v is the solution volume 100 ml u is the total cell voltage the total charge idt c is obtained by integrating the corresponding current i and c 0 and c t are the initial concentration of target organic compound and that at time t respectively pseudo first order rate constants were calculated using eq 3 3 c t c 0 exp k app t where k app represents the apparent rate constant min 1 since 2 oh tpa has low stability and can be further oxidized to other products the minimum steady state concentrations of oh oh s normalized to the section area was calculated using eqs 4 and 5 4 oh s k tpa k tpa oh where k tpa oh is the second order reaction rate constant for reaction between tpa and oh 4 106 m3 mol 1 s 1 and k tpa is the nominal surface area normalized observed rate constant for tpa oxidation which is calculated by eq 5 5 k tpa k app v 60 s where s is the maximum contact surface area between tixo2x 1 particles and the anode current collector 16 cm2 when calculating the actual steady state concentration of oh the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of 2 g tixo2x 1 powder 1 7 m2 was used instead of the maximum contact surface area 16 cm2 as aforementioned since the concentration of oh aq was expected to be zero at 1 5 v vs she all radical concentrations mentioned in this study were considered to be associated with oh the mass transfer coefficient km was calculated using eq 6 li et al 2021 although the rate constants were not determined at the limiting current i e the current achieved when reactant concentration at the electrode surface is zero they are comparable to those reported in previous studies e g 10 5 10 4 m s 1 chaplin 2014 trellu et al 2018 6 ln c 0 c t k m s v t to further confirm the efficacy of oh with respect to target compound oxidation fluorescence microscopy image fmi analyses were conducted using an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ckx53 with excitation in the uv achieved using a mercury lamp cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2019 to investigate the production of radicals at the solid liquid interface of tixo2x 1 particles and avoid the interference of pt coated titanium mesh 100 ml solution containing 20 g l 1 tixo2x 1 and 5 mm kh2po4 was added in the anode tank and 1 5 v vs she was applied on the pt coated titanium mesh 1 ml samples were withdrawn at various distances from the anode current collector after 20 mins reaction followed by immediately mixing with 1 ml solution containing 0 1 mm tpa and 5 mm kh2po4 afterwards 2 ml mixed solutions were transferred to a glass slide for image capturing 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the tixo2x 1 anode material and pt coated titanium anode current collector anode catalyst materials of high activity for 1e water oxidation and chemical stability are a prerequisite to achieve efficient conversion magnéli phase titanium suboxide tixo2x 1 was chosen as the starting flow anode material because of its excellent conductivity tominaka et al 2011 high catalytic activity for h2o to oh conversion chaplin 2019 zaky and chaplin 2013 and much lower cost compared to the state of the art boron doped diamond catalyst a pt coated titanium mesh is used as the anode current collector as this material is relatively inexpensive and resistant to oxidation at the 1 5 v anodic polarization used in these studies the methods for the characterization of the anode materials can be seen in secction s1 the sizes of tixo2x 1 particles are in a range of 4 16 μm fig 2 a with only ti and o elements detected on the surface fig s2b and s2c quantitative analysis of the phase identification results show that ti4o7 in the form of rutile blocks interleaved with corundum like layers is the dominant species 92 with ti3o5 and tio2 present at low abundances fig 2b the valence states of ti in magnéli ti4o7 were further investigated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the main sharp peak located at 458 2 ev is assignable to ti4 of rutile tio2 while the tails located at 456 4 ev for ti 2p3 2 can be attributed to the presence of ti3 in ti2o3 fig 2d geng and chen 2016 such interleaved structure results in the existence of vacant sites and the allowance of electric conduction geng and chen 2016 tominaka et al 2011 the specific surface area of tixo2x 1 0 85 m2 g 1 was determined from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3 and pore size distributions were calculated using the bjh model fig 2c resulting in an average pore diameter of 8 1 nm and a pore volume of 0 003 cm3 g 1 to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the flow anode system linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements were conducted over a range of conditions in order to determine the oxygen evolution reaction oer potentials of tixo2x 1 and pt coated titanium electrodes as shown in fig 2e the oer potentials of pt coated titanium mesh increased with an increase in solution conductivity fig 2e in accord with an increase in the values of taffel equation parameters in high conductivity solutions note that the oer potential of the pt coated titanium mesh in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions 1 76 v vs she was higher than the potential of 1 5 v vs she at which most experiments were conducted in order to investigate the generation of hydroxyl radicals moreover while the tixo2x 1 fixed electrode has a high overpotential 3 0 v vs she for oh aq and o2 evolution fig 2e chaplin 2014 le et al 2019 we found the heterogenous structural design of the tixo2x 1 flow anode and anodic current collector pt δg oh 0 2 ev intikhab et al 2017 led to a lower overpotential 1 76 v vs she fig 2e which can be attributed to the relatively low oer potential of the pt coated titanium electrode 3 2 oxidation performance and the impacts of operating conditions in traditional fluidized bed electrochemical reactors the particles are directly added into the area between the anode and cathode and operate in bipolar mode with both oxidation and reduction reactions occurring at particle surfaces for example meng et al 2019a placed granular sludge carbon particles between a ti ruo2 iro2 anode and a titanium plate cathode and observed effective removal of rhodamine b and low energy consumption li et al 2019 added cufe2o4 magnetic nanoparticles into the area between a ti ruo2 iro2 anode and a stainless steel cathode to catalyze the activation of persulfate achieving a 99 degradation efficiency and 22 1 toc removal of atrazine however in the case of the flow anode system described here particles are only added to the anode tank and thus unable to contact the cathode as such the flow anode particles will be positively charged only and may be considered to operate in monopolar mode terephthalic acid tpa was used as the target organic compound to assess the total production of oh a general term for both oh aq in the bulk solution and oh on the electrode in the flow anode system because of its high standard reduction potential for direct electron transfer that avoids false positive detection of oh jing and chaplin 2017 as evident from the open circuit potential ocp which is the potential established between the working electrode and the environment with respect to a reference electrode and polarity reversal results shown in figs s4 and s5 while an increase in the particle load increases the sorptive removal of tpa it is clear that adsorption plays a minor role in tpa removal compared to the removal achieved when a potential is applied fig s6a shows time course results of tpa oxidation in the flow anode reactor and the control i e no tixo2x 1 in the anolyte while the flow anode mass 2 0 g was much less than that of the anodic current collector 7 8 g the addition of tixo2x 1 surprisingly improved the eaop performance at only 1 5 v vs she with the apparent rate constant increasing by 700 the influence of the quantity of tixo2x 1 particles on the oxidation performance was investigated at 1 5 v vs she in 5 mm kh2po4 solutions fig s6b with the results showing that the apparent rate constant for tpa oxidation increases with increase in the quantity of tixo2x 1 particles present though plateaus at higher tixo2x 1 loads 20 g l 1 fig 3 a reasons for the plateauing in rate of degradation at higher tixo2x 1 loads include the possibility that 1 the overall reaction was controlled by the charge transfer between the current collector and the flow anode at 1 5 v vs she at high tixo2x 1 loads fig s7 and or 2 the magnetic stirrer used in this study was unable to maintain all the particles in suspension at high tixo2x 1 doses indeed it was observed that there was some particle settling at 50 g l 1 tixo2x 1 at the fixed magnetic stirring rate of 120 rpm used these precipitated particles would not contribute to the removal of tpa as they were no longer in contact with either the anode or other charged particles therefore subsequent experiments were conducted at 20 g l 1 tixo2x 1 if not otherwise stated it should be noted that oxidation of phosphate to perphosphate has been observed to occur at bdd electrodes polarized at 2 4 v or more vs she and current densities of 20 to 130 ma cm 2 in 0 2 m phosphate solutions weiss et al 2008 and in similar solutions at average cell voltages of 5 12 v and current densities of 25 to 100 ma cm 2 by costa et al 2009 no oxidation peak was observed in 50 mm kh2po4 solutions in which the ti4o7 anode used in this study was polarized at 1 5 v vs she fig 2e as such we consider that the phosphate buffer is stable under the conditions used in this study particularly at the low current density of 0 1 ma cm 2 used eaops have been criticized due to their limited efficiency in treating low ionic strength streams in this study we evaluated the influence of solution conductivity over a range of kh2po4 concentrations 1 50 mm fig 3a with comparable rate constants obtained in 1 and 50 mm kh2po4 solutions i e k app 0 034 and 0 047 min 1 respectively fig 3b moreover tpa oxidation in the flow anode reactor is not ph dependent over the ph range 4 5 12 0 with this result indicating that this process commences with h2o oxidation rather than oh oxidation fig 3c it is apparent that a charge percolating network is formed on polarization of the relatively concentrated suspension of flow anode particles these highly conductive and mutually interacting particles significantly reduce the effect of solution conductivity on oxidative performance a schematic of the charge percolating network that is formed is provided in fig s8 in order to measure the current flowing through the charge percolating network of flow anode particles an additional pt coated titanium mesh has been used to intercept the electrons transferring through the charge percolating network with an ammeter used to measure the current between the newly inserted pt coated titanium mesh and the cathode ti mesh a current of 0 9 ma which was lower than that of whole flow anode system 1 6 ma since the current resulting from reactions occurring at the surface of the anode current collector was excluded was observed when 1 5 v vs she was applied fig s8 in the presence of tixo2x 1 particles unsurprisingly in view of the well mixed nature of the flow anode the measured current was not affected by the location of the additional pt coated titanium mesh in comparison the current value was zero in the absence of tixo2x 1 particles with this result confirming that the presence of the conducting tixo2x 1 particles was critical to charge transfer in the anode tank in summary with the presence of anode particles in the electrolyte the overall resistance of the flow electrode was insignificantly influenced by the concentration of the electrolyte overall the charge percolating network of the flow anode can maintain its high efficiency over a wide range of conditions it should be noted that the removal of tpa began to decrease at the end of the experiments with this effect possibly ascribed to the formation of intermediates that compete with tpa in reacting with oh fig s9 shows that the total organic carbon concentation of the solution constantly decreases over the experiment indicating that the tixo2x 1 particles used in this study were not passivated during anodic polarization in addition the anode potential used in this study was also optimized for the current design because a further increase to 2 0 v vs she inevitably resulted in substantial o2 evolution and loss in current conversion to oh figs 3d and s10 3 3 mechanistic insight to oh generation in the flow anode system that tpa was indeed oxidized by oh in the flow anode system was confirmed by detection of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2 oh tpa a product from the reaction between tpa and oh fig 4 a the enhanced oh production was not associated with any current amplification effect due to decreased electrical resistance as a result of the addition of tixo2x 1 as the impedance spectra showed that the presence of tixo2x 1 in the anolyte had no effect on the charge transfer impedance of the system fig 4b and table s1 which is simulated according to the model circuit shown in fig s11 any false positive impact from direct electron transfer due to current amplification if any on the removal of tpa was further excluded by assessing the oxidation of oxalate which is a strong lewis base and used as a det probe xie et al 2020 fig 4c shows that the presence of tixo2x 1 had minimal impact on oxalate oxidation thus the removal of tpa by the det process is not important at least under the conditions used in this study we ascribe the enhanced oh production to the following possible processes firstly the oh production rate will be primarily determined by the number of active surface sites at particular potentials the use of tixo2x 1 in the flow anode reactor provides many more active surface sites compared to the traditional solid electrodes and results in a comparable steady state concentration of oh e g a minimum concentration of 5 4 10 12 mol m 2 at 1 5 v vs she to those formed in ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membranes rems at higher anode potentials 2 1 3 5 v in table s2 gayen et al 2018 nayak and chaplin 2018 song et al 2018 in addition the conversion of tpa 62 6 3 6 at 1 5 v vs she in the flow anode system is higher than that using a ti4o7 rem 18 7 0 91 at 2 1 v vs she indicating a higher oh utilization efficiency table s2 the real steady state concentration of oh in the flow anode system 5 1 10 14 mol m 2 at 1 a m 2 was also calculated based on the bet surface area and is quite comparable to those of bdd plate electrodes based on easa liu et al 2018 6 4 10 16 1 4 10 14 mol m 2 at 1 a m 2 indicating that the oh generation capacity of tixo2x 1 is similar to bdd with the particularly effective generation of oh attributable to the high surface area of the flowing particles secondly oh is produced principally in the form of surface bound oh which enhances the selectivity of the 1e water oxidation to oh over the 2e pathway to h2o2 and or the 4e pathway to o2 siahrostami et al 2020 results in fig s12 show that there is no h2o2 generated in the flow anode at 1 5 v vs she indicating the inhibition of the 2e pathway to h2o2 substantial generation of o2 at the surface of tixo2x 1 particles via 4e pathway will not occur until the anode potential is increased to 3 0 v vs she fig 2e thirdly the enhanced mass transfer in the flow anode system also plays a critical role with the mass transfer rate constant increasing from 0 62 10 5 to 4 48 10 5 m s 1 following the addition of tixo2x 1 particles to the anode tank fluorescence microscopy with signal mapping was introduced to assess the spatial location of oh zhang et al 2017 at open circuit potential no fluorescence response from hydroxylation of tpa by oh was observed fig 5 a in comparison the fluorescence response increased dramatically at 1 5 v vs she fig 5b with the mapping region confined to the solid liquid interface with this result providing clear evidence of the presence of surface 2 oh tpa notably the fluorescence signals at the tixo2x 1 surface were independent of the distance of tixo2x 1 particles from the current collector with oh production at the tixo2x 1 particle water interfaces occurring throughout the flow anode fig 5c this result suggests that the flow anode was either well mixed such that all particles came in contact with the current collector and or that the presence of the charge percolating network of flow anode particles enabled effective charge transfer between particles that oh is generated in the flow anode device has been further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr and radical quenching tests section s2 although the detection of hydroxyl radicals by the epr method has been questioned due to the false positive detection of oh caused by inverted spin trapping associated with the forrester hepburn mechanism jing and chaplin 2017 the experimental conditions can be optimized to guarantee the effectiveness of the method pei et al 2020 including the use of control measures and supporting methods such as the fluorescence microscopy and scavenging tests as was the case in this study there were no 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo oh signals in the bulk solution while the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh with intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were observed near the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles fig 5d with hyperfine coupling constants of αn 14 95 g and αβ h 14 95 g li et al 2015 indicating the generation of oh in the device to further validate oh generation on the surface of the flow anode three oh scavengers with distinct features were used methanol k meoh oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and tert butyl alcohol k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 which mainly quench free oh either in solution or the particle diffusion boundary layer due to their low molecular affinity toward hydrophilic tixo2x 1 feng et al 2017 liu et al 2019 exerted no influence on tpa oxidation and 2 oh tpa generation fig 4a and d in contrast the addition of ki which can react with surface bound radicals zhu et al 2019 significantly depressed the oxidation of tpa and the formation of 2 oh tpa fig 4a and d since the i ion concention is much higher than that of tpa the i ions occupied the active sites that would otherwise be used for tpa degradation and reacted with surface bound oh to inhibit the surface mediated tpa oxidation process while the generation of oh has been shown to occur in fixed electrode photochemical and anodic oxidation processes ding et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 the utilization efficiency of these surface bound radicals has not been quantified presumedly as a result of the limited surface area and poor mass transfer of the static electrodes the tpa oxidation and oh generation results reported here support the hypothesis that the efficient conversion of h2o to oh can be achieved at low anode potential via a charge percolating network of flow anode particles with the oh generated at the charged particle surfaces capable of oxidatively transforming aqueous contaminants at substantially lower energy than can be achieved by conventional eaop methods as shown in fig 6 the flow anode device maintained consistent performance with respect to tpa removal in successive operation over 20 cycles there were no changes in the chemical state of ti according to xps ti 2p3 2 spectra fig s13 and x ray diffractometer xrd patterns fig s14 obtained before and after polarization at 1 5 v vs she for 48 h indicating high electrochemical stability while the reuse of the anode materials in a heterogeneously dispersed particles system could be a challenge for practical applications the size of the tixo2x 1 particles used in our flow anode system is at micrometer level 4 16 μm and based on our experience with flow electrodes zhang et al 2020 a microfiltration module can be introduced to realize the solid liquid separation and continuous operation at low cost 3 4 application of the flow anode system to oxidation of tetracycline and orange ii as a demonstration of potential application we used the flow anode device to treat water containing the biorefractory organic compounds tetracycline tc and orange ii as shown in fig 7 a the conversion of tc increased from 46 to 82 with the apparent rate constant increasing from 0 010 to 0 029 min 1 on applying a potential of 1 5 v vs she compared to the control experiment with no tixo2x 1 particles present fig s15 the first order tc degradation rate constant at 1 5 v cell voltage anode potential 1 5 v vs she was significantly higher than that 0 016 min 1 achieved using solid electrodes at 4 4 v cell voltage liang et al 2018 physical adsorption and electrosorption contributed insignificantly to the removal of tc fig 7a and fig s16 similarly the orange ii apparent rate constants increased from 0 013 fig s17 to 0 03 min 1 and complete color removal of orange ii could be achieved after 180 min reaction at 1 5 v vs she fig 7c the energy consumption per order of magnitude removal eeo of tc 6 7 wh m 3 and orange ii 1 5 wh m 3 achieved by the flow anode system are compared with eeo values for other decontamination techniques in fig 7b d and table 1 aleboyeh et al 2008 chen et al 2003 chou et al 2011 helaïli et al 2009 hou et al 2016 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2015 oturan et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 in addition the energy costs per mmol for orange ii 54 wh mmol 1 and tc 39 wh mmol 1 removal were also calculated table 1 the energy consumption of the flow anode system is 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than other techniques with this comparison highlighting the commercial opportunities of this novel flow anodic oxidation electrochemical technology while the low ionic strength of environmental samples typically limits the use of electrochemical technologies our work shows that the flow anode system is highly efficient even in a dilute 5 mm matrix moreover a flow electrode was used in the anode tank in this study to oxidize water pollutants in the cathodic compartment h2 and h2o2 production xia et al 2019 and or co2 reduction chang et al 2016 have been considered for energy exploitation and anti climate change purposes with the introduction of a flow cathode expected to significantly improve the efficiency of these complementary processes the solution composition will have a significant effect on the removal of target organic compounds since inorganic ions such as hco3 co3 2 and natural organic matter that are typically present in real wastewater are active hydroxyl radical scavengers chaplin 2014 in addition attention should be paid to the possible formation of toxic byproducts such as clo4 chaplin 2014 though the formation of such products is unlikely in the present system in view of the low operating voltage used 4 conclusions in this study a novel flow anode system in which tixo2x 1 flow anode particles are charged via contact with the anode current collector has been shown to result in the efficient oxidation of h2o to adsorbed oh at the surface of the tixo2x 1 particles while the flow anode mass was much less than that of the anodic current collector the addition of tixo2x 1 improved the oxidation performance at only 1 5 v vs she with the tpa apparent rate constant increasing by 700 compared to that in the absence of tixo2x 1 mechanistic insight into the generation of oh has been obtained using fluorescence microscopy epr spectroscopy and scavenging methods with adsorbed oh confirmed to play a dominant role in flow anode oxidation a charge percolating network of polarized flow anode particles was created in the anode tank which can efficiently generate the surface radical oh with subsequent degradation of particular organic compounds the eeo of tc and orange ii are 6 7 wh m 3 and 1 5 wh m 3 respectively which are 1 4 orders of magnitude lower than other techniques such as photocatalysis and electron fenton moreover our device demonstrates stable performance in a dilute matrix as such we are of the view based on the results

16938,a novel catalyst mt emr used for sr aops with high removal efficiency toward roxarsone rox 90 96 within 60 min was prepared for the first time by ball milling multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts with electrolytic manganese residue emr the incorporation of mwcnts could improve the adsorption capacity and accelerate the transformation of metals in emr with partial mass loss to facilitate the pds activation additionally ph test quenching experiment and electrochemical test verified a two electron pathway involving surface activated complex contributed to the directly rox oxidization benefit from the introduction of mwcnts the degradation rate k obs of catalytic reaction was increased by 10 1 times compared with that of single emr additionally the m o c m fe or mn bonds in mt emr making the catalyst more stable than emr this work provided a novel and effective strategy to establish waste solid based catalysts for green preparation and expanded the adsorption oxidation technology to solve the problem of organoarsenic pollution keywords carbon nanotubes electron transfer electrolytic manganese residue peroxydisulfate radical 1 introduction in recent decades sulphate radical based aops sr aops have been proved to be an effective technology to remove various refractory contaminants in water lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 heterogenous activations based on transition metals e g fe mn co and cu etc are the most availably and general methods to stimulate peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds due to their recognized merits such as beneficial to recovery and lower energy demanded bao et al 2019 however the intricate preparation processes and both expensive and poisonous chemicals used have rigorously restrained their practical applications electrolytic manganese residue emr is the ultimately metallurgical waste of electrolytic manganese process about 120 130 million tons of emr has been deposited in china with approximately 11 million tons was produced annually shu et al 2019 the surface water and surrounding soil were seriously polluted due to the open stacking of emr the components of emr mainly include calcium silicon aluminum iron and manganese oxide design and synthesis of the emr based catalysts are not only conductive to emr recycling but also beneficial to the promotion of the practical catalyst applications in view of the concept waste to wealth most recently our group have synthesized a bimetallic aops catalyst through a green simple short cut method by applying emr as fe and mn sources li et al 2020b but its performance is still impeded by its insufficient transition metal contents and low generation speed from high valance to low valance indicating the catalyst should need additional treatment the preparation of composite materials with suitable carriers has been reported as an useful method to enhance the degradation efficiency of most metal based catalysts su et al 2019 while carbon based nanomaterials including activated carbon huang et al 2020 biochar yu et al 2020a carbon nanotubes yao et al 2016 graphene oxide wu et al 2020 and their functionalized products are found to possess plentiful electrons large specific surface areas ssa and excellent electron conductivity these unique characteristics have made them as superior catalyst carriers among them multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts with large amounts of oxygen containing groups have shown great potential in improving the heterogeneous catalytic reactivity lu and wey 2007 yang et al 2018a many researchers have made their efforts to explore the roles of mwcnts in composite some studies proposed that mwcnts could serve as an electron transfer catalyst referring the haber weiss mechanism involved in multi states of catalyst tang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 but others found carbon materials also could play a role as the sacrifice to accelerate the transition metal redox cycles with partial decomposition of themselves during the reaction zubir et al 2015 on the other hand ternary system might be formed in sr aops in the presence of carbon materials because they acted as the electron transfer mediators to promote the electrons transfer from contaminants to pds pms in which no radicals were involved in this process tang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 thus the essential roles of mwcnts still remain blurred and controversial and have not been fully illustrated yet which still require deepgoing study roxarsone rox 3 nitro 4 hydroxyphenylarsenic acid are organoarsenic feed additives which was extensively used in swine and poultry production acuña et al 2017 chen and huang 2012 xie et al 2016 researchers estimate that thousands of tons of rox were consumed worldwide per year while 14 54 mg kg of rox was found in poultry manure they have strong water solubility and are easy to leach out from feces and result in surface water and soils pollution which have rendered rox a rigorous threat to both ecosystem and human health adak et al 2015 yang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 previous studies have put much attentions to the toxic inorganic arsenic species treatment neppolian et al 2010 tabelin et al 2019 wang et al 2014 but few studies have concerned the organoarsenic elimination in environment while sr aops might be an effective approach for rox removal in order to prepare a bi functional catalyst in pds aop for rox removal we combined emr with multi walled cnts through ball milling method the structural characteristics of the as synthesized catalysts were first evaluated and the effects of m o c bonds on composite surface were discussed in details the in situ catalytic oxidation of rox and adsorption properties toward as v of the composite were then explored additionally the relevant degradation mechanism was disclosed by the capture experiments spectrum detection and electrochemical examination the essential roles of mwcnts in the composites were clarified furthermore the by products of rox were analyzed and the possible oxidation pathway was proposed 2 experiment the details information including materials and reagents catalyst preparation and characterizations and degradation experiments were shown in the text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns of different catalysts are shown in fig 1 a the sintered multi walled mwcnts had two distinct peaks at 26 06 and 43 02 which could be assigned to the 002 and 100 diffraction planes of mwcnts respectively ma et al 2015 the main phases of emr were matched to caso4 h2o 2 pdf 21 0816 sio2 pdf 46 1054 α fe2o3 pdf 33 0664 and mn3o4 pdf 24 0734 hua et al 2020 after combination the xrd patterns of all mt emr composites showed no significant difference compared with raw emr except for the appearance of the reflective properties of carbon nanotubes the amplified xrd patterns are shown in fig s1 the successful combination of mwcnts and emr was further confirmed by the ftir spectra text s2 fig s2a the ssa of all as prepared materials were obtained by bet analysis and the corresponding information is displayed in table s2 the ssa of these composites were significantly higher than those of both raw mt 79 4 m2 g and emr 47 5 m2 g besides the porosities of mt emr were enhanced as the mwcnts dosage increased from 0 01 g to 0 1 g but decreased when the mt content exceeded 0 1 g when variant amount of mt was introduced in the ssa of compounded materials were 82 5 m2 g 91 7 m2 g 99 6 m2 g 109 8 m2 g and 103 2 m2 g respectively the enhancement of ssa could be attributed to the micro or mesopores formed after mt and emr combination which conductive to the pollutants elimination however the total surface area of the composites decreased when the carbon content reached to a certain value the reason of which should be due to the excessive carbon occupying a considerable space of emr particles which would then inhibit its degradation performance yu et al 2019 the surface chemistry before and after modification was explored by xps analysis fe 2p3 2 and mn 2p3 2 xps spectra of emr and 0 1 mt emr were compared firstly as shown in fig 1b three peaks located at 710 39 fe ⅱ 711 59 fe iii and 713 14 ev fe iii could be deconvoluted on emr wilson and langell 2014 after introducing mt these three peaks shifted to 710 85 ev 711 95 ev and 713 45 ev respectively similarly three peaks at 641 14 ev 642 29 ev and 643 35 ev on emr belonging to mn ⅳ mn iii mn ⅱ shifted to 641 65 ev 642 75 ev and 644 00 ev in the 0 1 mt emr spectra respectively tang et al 2014 fig 1c the shifts of these peaks should be ascribed by the electrons transfer from mwcnts to emr which also indicated that new bonds might be formed in the composite pan et al 2019 xu et al 2016 have prepared fullerol modified ferrihydrite and proved that a covalent bond was formed between hydroxyl groups and the ferrihydrite zhu et al 2020 have synthesized mwcnts ferrihydrite composite by co precipitation method and they found that the surface complexes formed between the oxygen containing functional groups of mwcnts and ferrihydrite thus it s rational to speculate that m o c m fe or mn would form between carbon materials and emr particles to determine the production of chemical bonds between mt and emr the high resolution scans of o 1 s of emr and 0 1 mt emr were compared and shown in fig 1d the o1s xps spectrum of emr can be separated into three peaks including m o 530 05 ev m oh 531 9 ev and adsorbed h2o 532 7 ev after combining mt with emr new peak located at 532 85 ev appeared which could be assigned to co c and co h yu et al 2020a remarkably the peak at 530 6 ev occurred in the o1s xps spectrum of 0 1 mt emr which was corresponded to the m o c bonds according to other carbon metal oxide composites reported combellas et al 2005 yu et al 2021 further the zeta potential values ℑ of mt emr and 0 1 mt emr were measured to demonstrate the strong interactions between carbon tube and emr fig s2b mwcnts exhibited negative charge at the whole tested ph range while the ℑ of emr was about 4 22 the ℑ of emr combinated with mwcnts 3 68 was slightly lower than that of raw emr confirming the chemical bonds formed after combination the intuitive morphologies of emr mt and 0 1 mt emr are exhibited in fig 2 the sem images show the emr particles were in bulky with irregular shapes and the mwcnts were under the integrated tubular structures fig 2a after combining mwcnts with emr the emr particles were loaded onto the long mwcnts by m o c bonds the microstructure of 0 1 mt emr was then characterized by tem and hrtem it was found that the mwcnts and emr particles were combined tightly which were in accordance with sem images the hrtem image of 0 1 mt emr shows clear fringes with lattice spacing of ca 0 255 nm on mwcnts and both ca 0 213 nm and ca 0 152 nm on emr corresponding to the 002 basal planes of carbon layer 110 plane of α fe2o3 and 215 plane of mn3o4 fig 2b respectively these results were in good accordance with the xrd patterns the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern indicating the 0 1 mt emr was polycrystalline then the fast fourier transform fft was calculated under hrtem to identify the extent of crystallinity the blurred spots broad peaks of the fft image indicate low crystallinity of materials as shown in fig 2b the mwcnts was highly crystalized as the fft of mt consisted of sharp spots the reason that mwcnts used in this study was in highly crystalized might be that the raw mwcnts was sintered at 750 before use as it was reported that sintering could improve the degree of crystallization of carbon materials while the fft image of emr revealed the low crystallinity of metal oxides zhang et al 2017 the composites with both high crystallinity and amorphous state might show better catalytic performance in pms pds system yu et al 2020b in addition line scans and elemental mapping further revealed the evenly distributions of fe mn o and c elements on the composites thus both the sem and tem results revealed the potent combination of 0 1 mt emr which was ascribed by the formation of m o c bonds between mwcnts and emr this combination resulted in large ssa values and created more active sites on the catalyst surface 3 2 rox degradation under various mt emr activated pds systems the removal efficiencies of rox by different mt emr activated pds systems were examined fig 3 a the degradation efficiency of pure pds on rox was only 1 59 nearly 26 32 of rox can be adsorbed by mwcnts within 30 min which was in accordance with the superior adsorption property of mwcnts reported in some studies su et al 2019 yang et al 2018a the mt emr exhibited considerable adsorption capacity toward rox than emr alone 41 7 vs 26 32 which might be ascribed by the larger ssa of mt emr accompanied with higher the adsorption rate more information about the adsorption performance was displayed in text s1 fig s3 and table s3 in order to eliminate the influence of adsorption pds was injected after adsorption desorption equilibrium in 30 min in the following experiments after pds was added the mwcnts could poorly activate pds and showed a rather low catalytical rates 8 12 on rox as for pristine emr only 25 73 9 94 by adsorption and 15 79 by degradation of rox could be removed after the addition of pds while the degradation efficiency of rox was dramatically enhanced after having introduced mwcnts onto emr noticeably the degradation efficiency of rox was firstly increased with the rise of mwcnts amount from 0 to 0 1 g and then began to decline with the further increase of mwcnts amount 0 1 g fig s4a the treatment efficiencies of different mt emr composites ranged from 64 88 to 90 96 indicating a synergistic combination between mwcnts and emr the reduction of ssa and the decrease in emr content resulted in the deterioration of catalytic ability for all catalysts tested the 0 1 mt emr exhibited the superior catalytic activity with a removal rate of 90 96 toward rox within 60 min the pseudo first order equation was applied to fit the degradation kinetics fig 3b and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs was obtained from the equation ln c c0 k obst the k obs r2 0 99 of 0 1 mt emr was nearly 10 1 times as high as that of raw emr 0 02991 min 1 vs 0 00296 min 1 the results further confirmed that introducing mt onto emr could effectively improve the catalytic performance towards rox the toc removal efficiency and mass balance of arsenic were calculated text s3 and fig s4b the removal process of rox could be roughly described as follow the as c bond was destroyed and the generated as iii could be rapidly oxidized to pentavalent oxyanion by reactive oxygen species then the produced as v was subsequently adsorbed by 0 1 mt emr the effect of pre adsorption of rox on catalyst was also investigated more details information are shown in text s3 and fig s4 results found pre adsorption was essential to the oxidation process and showed that the large amount of degradation product of as v would be simultaneously adsorbed onto the catalyst and cover the active sites during the degradation process the recycle properties of emr and 0 1 mt emr are shown in fig s5 the removal ratio of rox after each cycle decreased in both adsorption and degradation and the adsorption capacity was reduced by 9 6 in total for rox removal after four cycles of 0 1 mt emr which was lower than that of raw emr 16 5 this might be attributed to the m o c bonds in mt emr making the composite more stable than raw emr the obviously decreased ssa and as v covered on catalyst active sites should be responsible for the reduced activating performance of used 0 1 mt emr to pds for rox oxidation ph is an important parameter affecting the interface characteristics of catalyst matrix and the existence of active species in aops qin et al 2020 the influence of different ph values on pollution removal is displayed in fig 3d the degradation efficiency of rox 90 96 reached the highest at initial ph 3 04 and the degradation rate was reduced with the increase of initial ph from 3 04 to 10 05 which was similar with the previous studies fang et al 2017 zubir et al 2015 in the degradation process the final ph value decreased significantly to about 3 10 when the initial ph value was in the range of 3 04 8 04 which was probably attributed to the abundant so4 radicals generated during the degradation process but when the initial ph value was 10 05 the final solution ph value only declined to 6 40 suggesting that oh might be the primary radicals in that case huang et al 2017 in fact the zeta potential of the 0 1 mt emr was 3 68 and the 0 1 mt emr was negatively charged when the ph was higher than this value thus the low ph was favorable for the electrostatic adsorption of s2o8 2 and rox onto 0 1 mt emr which facilitated the oxidation reactions between target organics and oxidants on the contrary electrostatic repulsion occurred as the ph value increased which would restrict the adsorption of both rox and s2o8 2 then the production of active species decreased and the oxidation capacity of 0 1 mt emr pds system was gradually inhibited it was noted that when the initial ph value was 10 04 the final solution ph value reached to 6 81 a much higher value when compared with most of reported sulphate radical based aops studies but the degradation efficiency 73 4 remained satisfactory when at the initial ph of 10 04 which indicated the generation of non free radicals with less ph dependence or the existence of other degradation pathways during rox decomposition in 0 1 mt emr pds system this hypothesis was further explored by quenching experiment and electrochemical test in this study additionally the degradation experiments at different ph values were also carried out in buffering systems results show that although there was no significant drop in the final ph after reaction the degradation efficiencies in buffer solution had no obvious differences on the performance of rox degradation in the ph range of 3 0 8 0 fig s6 when compared with those in unbuffered systems fig 5d moreover as displayed in fig 3d and fig s6 the adsorption efficiency decreased obviously when the ph increased from 3 0 to 10 while the degradation efficiency was reduced slightly which indicated the ph value mainly affected the sorption capacity rather than degradation of mt emr further typical systems including fe2 pds 92 8 goethite pds 78 2 hematite pds 66 1 ac pds 80 9 cp pds 55 2 and graphene pds systems 83 2 fig s7 were used to degrade rox under the same experimental condition as that of 0 1 mt emr pds system it was found that only fe2 pds system had a higher removal efficiency than 0 1 mt emr pds system while other systems showed poorer oxidation ability but homogeneous ferrite ions could easily cause secondary pollution of iron sludge ren et al 2020 thus the 0 1 mt emr could be considered as an efficient catalyst for pds activation it was significantly important to explore why the 0 1 mt emr had superior performance on organoarsenic removal thus the catalytic mechanisms were carried out and the contribution of mwcnts during the oxidation were fully investigated in this study 3 3 ros detection in general pds can be activated to produce free radicals to oxidize organic contaminants the radicals generated in 0 1 mt emr pds system were determined by quenching experiments etoh and tba were applied for capturing so4 and oh radicals fig 4 a generally the etoh has comparatively capture ability for both so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while the tba shows a relatively sensitive reaction to oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 as depicted in fig 4a the presence of both etoh etoh pds 200 or 1000 and tba tba pds 200 or 1000 showed little influences on the removal efficiency the unobvious inhibitory effect for the catalytic reaction indicated the common free radicals so4 and oh played an unimportant role in rox degradation previous studies have demonstrated that o2 radicals might present in catalyst pds system therefore 10 μm of sod were employed to verify the existence of the o2 radicals during the activation of pds by 0 1 mt emr wang et al 2017 it was found that only 77 62 rox was degraded in the presence of 10 μm sod and the obvious inhibition effects indicated that the o2 has participated in the degradation process then the dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was applied as a probe for indirect detection of surface bonded radicals and possible production of fe ⅳ guo et al 2021a zhu et al 2018 the weak effect on reaction manifested the surface bonded radicals and high valent iron were not generated and took part in the reaction process the existence of active species was then verified by electron spin resonance esr spectra using the dmpo as trapping agent for so4 oh and o2 scavenger as displayed in fig 4b the emergence of dmpo so4 peaks six lines with relative intensities of 1 1 1 1 1 1 an ah 14 9 g and dmpo oh peaks four lines with intensities of 1 2 2 1 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g suggested the formation of so4 and oh radicals respectively and these values were consistent well with some previously reported meanwhile the observation of dmpo o2 have verified that o2 radical was also generated in 0 1 mt emr pds system recent studies have proposed that the degradation pathway of sr aops also involved singlet oxygenation attack the non radical 1o2 as final product of o2 was then determined by using ffa or tryptophan as scavenger li et al 2018 wang et al 2016 results showed that nearly 68 23 and 63 77 of rox was removed when 4 mm ffa and tryptophan were added fig 4a respectively suggesting 1o2 has participated in the reaction and played a relatively important role compared with other reactive species the temp 1o2 signals found in esr spectra confirmed 1o2 formation during rox degradation fig 4b however some studies have demonstrated the formation of temp 1o2 signal peaks might be resulted from the electron transfer from temp to pds pms which was mediated by the catalyst and caused the generation of temp yun et al 2018 in order to further verify the generation of 1o2 d2o was used as solvent for pds activating reaction theoretically the solvent exchange could accelerate the catalytic reaction involving 1o2 due to the fact that the lifetime of 1o2 is prolonged by 10 times in d2o solution compared with that in h2o if the 1o2 was produced in the catalytical system the degradation rate would be enhanced in d2o solvent on the contrary if no significant effects of d2o the occurring of false positive signals temp 1o2 might be the result of temp yun et al 2018 as shown in fig 4a the rox degradation process was accelerated in d2o system and the calculated k obs in this system was increased from 0 0124 min 1 to 0 029 min 1 after replacing h2o with d2o which further verified the formation of 1o2 3 4 ros generation mechanism from the above analysis four type of ros including both free radicals so4 oh and o2 and non radical 1o2 involved in rox decomposition the xps spectra of 0 1 mt emr before and after being used were employed to investigate the mechanisms of ros generation their survey spectra fe 2p mn 2p and as 3d spectra are shown in fig 4c f the characteristic peaks of fe 2p mn 2p o 1 s and c 1 s could be obviously observed in the scan spectra before reaction confirming that 0 1 mt emr contained c o fe and s after rox degradation the peaks of as auger and as 3d could be clearly found indicating the rox have been decomposed and as adsorbed onto 0 1 mt emr fig 4c the fe 2p3 2 binding energy for the spin orbit splitting peaks at 710 85 ev 711 95 ev and 713 5 ev can be assigned to the fe ii and fe ⅲ respectively peng et al 2017 after reaction the relative content of fe ⅱ increased from 30 45 to 44 27 with the corresponding decrease in fe ⅲ indicating the reduction of fe iii fig 4d besides the high resolution spectrum of mn 2p3 2 was also provided and the peaks located at 641 45 ev 642 80 ev and 644 00 ev belong to mn ii mn iii and mn ⅳ respectively joshi et al 2017 the peaks intensity ratio of mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ changed from 39 43 32 98 27 59 for pristine 0 1 mt emr to 55 43 14 64 29 93 after having been used fig 4e the changes in fe 2p and mn 2p binding energy manifested the effective redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ in the 0 1 mt emr pds rox system the strong characteristic peak of as 3d at binding energy of 45 65 ev was found which was corresponded to the as v xie et al 2016 fig 4f besides the deconvoluted peaks of as v spectrum were provided and the peaks at 45 0 ev 45 5 ev 45 9 ev and 46 3 ev could be assigned to fe al si as v o fe as v o and as v o oh tabelin et al 2019 respectively manifesting the catalyst have high affinity toward as v and the as v could be well immobilized the formation of amorphous feaso4 h2o further indicating the 0 1 mt emr pds system was suitable for rox removal because it can avoid the risk of secondary pollution in solution caused by the production of inorganic arsenic after the degradation reaction the surface concentrations of c and m m represent fe or mn had slight variations and the data are shown in table s4 the ratio of c m increased from 5 97 to 6 79 was ascribed by the adsorption of degradation by products on catalyst surface further indicating the efficient decomposition of rox by this system the xps analysis has demonstrated the efficient electron transfer on catalyst surface a large amount of ros was produced during pds activation process the contributions of o2 and 1o2 were superior to those of both so4 and oh which might be caused by the rapid transformation between these reactive species hu et al 2020 li et al 2019 guo et al 2021b electrons could easily transfer between mn to mn 1 of transition metals fe and mn because they have unique valence electron structures resulting the formation of so4 via one electron transfer mechanism eq s1 and s2 meanwhile so4 radicals could interact with oh and h2o in the solution to produce oh radicals eq s3 and s4 on the other hand the pds was hydrolyzed in the solution generating a lot of ho2 eq s5 and the ho2 could be easily oxidized by another pds molecule and contributed to the production of o2 and so4 radicals eq s6 then 1o2 would also be formed after o2 has reacted with h2o or h eq s7 and s8 the generated so4 oh o2 along with 1o2 would then take part in the oxidation of rox here a synergistic effect of electron transfer happened between mn and fe where mn ⅲ and mn ⅳ could be reduced by fe ⅱ as it was thermodynamically favorable eq s9 and s10 besides homogeneous reaction might occur as metals would be released into the solution along with reaction process thus the influence of leaching metals fe and mn on the removal of rox was revealed it was found that 0 173 mg l of fe and 0 035 mg l of mn leached out had little effects to pds stimulation table s4 which was consistent well with previous study hua et al 2020 thus the impact of homogeneous reaction during the rox removal process could be eliminated 3 5 confirmation of direct electron transfer pathway several interesting phenomena have been unexpectedly observed in this study firstly a small fraction of pds was consumed in the reaction fig s8a generally a large amount of oxidants might be decomposed in the radical based degradation reactions but the consumption of pds was only 4 or 8 in the single system of rox or 0 1 mt emr respectively the amount of consumed pds increased in the presence of both rox and 0 1 mt emr but was still just only 33 6 this might imply that the existence of electron transfer pathway mediated and the oxidation of rox could still proceed in the absence of active species tang et al 2018 to confirm this hypothesis eis and lsv analysis were applied to explore the electron transfer process the eis diagram was shown in fig 5 a raw emr had large semicircle diameter suggesting a high resistance while the 0 1 mt emr had a smaller semicircle diameter than emr and the esi plot was almost a straight line indicating a superior electronic conductivity and higher charge transfer efficiency of 0 1 mt emr which could be further proved by the enhancive current in lsv plot when 0 1 mt emr was used as the working electrode the current increases slightly when adding pds or rox which may be due to the weak electron transfer between the pds or rox and the 0 1 mt emr fig 5b however when both pds and rox were added a prominent oxidation peak accompanied by an obvious current raise could be found manifesting the expedited oxidation reaction and rapid electron transfer on 0 1 mt emr surface caused by the formation of ternary system this demonstrated the crucial role of all components 0 1 mt emr pds and rox in the reaction and demonstrated the direct reduction of pds in 0 1 mt emr surface by abstracting two electrons which was another solid evidence for the direct electron transfer pathway thus a two electron pathway did contribute to the degradation of rox as discussed above when rox with sufficient electrons closed to the stimulated pds molecules a ternary system including 0 1 mt emr pds and rox was formed however in our previous study on levofloxacin degradation in emr pms system no obvious current response could be found in the pms lvf solution when using emr as electrode which indicated that electron transfer was prolonged in this study when replacing the working electrode 0 1 mt emr with emr the significant decrease in current manifested the two electron pathway did not exist in the emr pds rox system which highlighted the essence of introducing mwcnts into emr and the addition of mwcnts could endow the catalyst with large ssa and satisfactory conductivity with the help of 0 1 mt emr the activated pds could directly oxidize rox through two electron conduction eq 1 1 s 2 o 82 2 e 2 so 42 the role of mwcnts was further investigated by xps analysis the high resolution xps spectra of c1s of 0 1 mt emr before and after use are provided in fig 5c three peaks located at 284 74 ev 285 13 ev and 285 98 ev were obtained which were belonged to the sp2 hybridized graphite like carbon atoms c c the cc species in a sp3 hybridization state and both the co h and co c respectively the fitting results implied the presence of abundant oxygen functional groups on the mt after reaction the relative intensity ratio of c c peak decreased from 61 53 to 45 68 the cc group increased slightly from 24 86 from 26 14 and the co h co c groups increased significantly from 13 6 to 28 16 respectively indicating partial of mwcnts were oxidized in the reaction process which was in accordance well with the reduction of removal performance after having been used in reflected by recycle experiments the obviously changes of c c and co h co c manifested the transformation between these two groups which was well consistent with the previous reported study yu et al 2020a combining the c1s xps spectra results with the reusability tests results we proposed that mwcnts acted as a sacrifice of which c c groups could serve as electron donating groups by transferring their unpaired π electrons to low valent transition metal which would accelerate the redox cycles of metal i e fe ii fe iii cycle this might be the strong evidence for why introducing mwcnt could endow emr with high degradation efficiency the decomposition of pds in various systems was measured during the oxidation process fig s8b the pure mwcnts and raw emr could slightly decompose pds with the decomposition ratio of 8 9 and 10 7 within 60 min respectively after having introduced mwcnts to emr the consumption of pds increased significantly and the 0 1 mt emr showed the largest decomposition efficiency with nearly 33 6 of pds decomposed within 60 min the acceleration of the pds consumption rate further confirmed that mwcnts could donate electrons to the transition metals in emr in summary both ros and electron transfer mediated processes were involved in this system and worked together for rox decomposition scheme 1 as mentioned the degradation efficiency was 50 26 except for the 41 7 rox adsorbed while the o2 and 1o2 could remove nearly 40 of rox from scavenging experiments thus about 10 of rox was decomposed by activated pds these results indicated the ros played the dominant role in rox degradation 3 6 rox evolution the uv vis spectra variations of rox in 0 1 mt emr pds system over time are displayed in fig 6 a the dominant peaks at 267 and 338 nm are corresponded to the aromatic ring the peaks located at 222 nm mainly derived from the nitroso group the intensities of these peaks decreased as degradation goes on and disappeared after 120 min this indicated the fully breakage of the nitro as c bonds and the aromatic rings of rox caused by the oxidation which was further proved by lc ms analysis the rox was ultimately disintegrated into as v anions and small organic molecules in order to deeply understand the catalytical reactions 3d eem technique was applied to probe the behavior of rox molecules in the whole degradation process as shown in fig 6b three fluorescence peaks could be observed in these samples with the fluorescence center located at the ex em 300 360 350 410 nm peak i ex em 290 340 410 470 nm peak ⅱ and ex em 340 410 410 500 nm peak ⅲ these three peaks are corresponded to the humic acid like v regions after adsorption process fig 6c the peak i disappeared while the location ex em and shape of peak ⅱ and peak ⅲ were basically unchanged with a decrease in their intensities indicating that partial rox was adsorbed by the catalyst during this period of time and confirmed the excellent adsorption ability of 0 1 mt emr to rox after adding pds the fluorescence intensity of the two signals reduced in 10 min fig 6d and 30 min fig 6e after 60 min of reaction fig 6f the peaks area became faded and the intensity reduced dramatically manifesting that most of rox have been removed the data analyzed here imply that the 0 1 mt emr can be served as a promising candidate for the treatment of antibiotic contamination the by products of rox were then determined by lc ms analysis and the results are displayed in fig 7 in the degradation process the aromatic ring in rox was firstly oxidized by reactive species and transformed into 2 nitrohydroquinone product ⅰ m z 154 01 da fig 7b li et al 2020a and arsenic the arsenic could be directly in situ adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and the 2 nitrohydroquinone was further oxidized to product ⅱ which could be identified as hydroquinone m z 112 84 da fig 7c with the degradation process proceeded the product ⅲ showed an intense signal with a m z 80 9 da could be observed we speculate this product was propionic acid product ⅲ m z 112 84 da fig 7d a product resulted from the ring cleavage of aromatic therefore we deduced that a series of short chain carboxylic acids might be formed during catalytic reaction the oxidation by products of rox indicated a typical electrophilic addition reaction of aromatic compounds fig 7e 4 conclusion in this work highly effective sr aops catalysts were successfully prepared by ball milling emr with multi walled mwcnts for the first time the results showed 0 1 mt emr pds system had great application potential with 90 96 of rox removed owing to the high adsorption capacity and excellent catalytical ability the large adsorption capacity of 0 1 mt emr was ascribed by the introduction of mt the combination of mt would further accelerate the electron transfer between high and low valance of metals in emr which was favorable for pds activation and thus resulted in the generation of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 the k obs of degradation in 0 1 mt emr pds system was nearly 10 1 times higher than that in emr pds system on the other hand mechanism explorations have found a two electron pathway also contributed to the degradation by which a ternary system including 0 1 mt emr pds and rox was formed and directly oxidized the rox in the absence of free radicals highlighting the significant importance of pre adsorption simultaneously the short chain carboxylic acids and amorphous feaso4 h2o were formed during catalytic reaction this work provided a strong technical support for the treatment of organoarsenic based on sr aops in water declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16938,a novel catalyst mt emr used for sr aops with high removal efficiency toward roxarsone rox 90 96 within 60 min was prepared for the first time by ball milling multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts with electrolytic manganese residue emr the incorporation of mwcnts could improve the adsorption capacity and accelerate the transformation of metals in emr with partial mass loss to facilitate the pds activation additionally ph test quenching experiment and electrochemical test verified a two electron pathway involving surface activated complex contributed to the directly rox oxidization benefit from the introduction of mwcnts the degradation rate k obs of catalytic reaction was increased by 10 1 times compared with that of single emr additionally the m o c m fe or mn bonds in mt emr making the catalyst more stable than emr this work provided a novel and effective strategy to establish waste solid based catalysts for green preparation and expanded the adsorption oxidation technology to solve the problem of organoarsenic pollution keywords carbon nanotubes electron transfer electrolytic manganese residue peroxydisulfate radical 1 introduction in recent decades sulphate radical based aops sr aops have been proved to be an effective technology to remove various refractory contaminants in water lee et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 heterogenous activations based on transition metals e g fe mn co and cu etc are the most availably and general methods to stimulate peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds due to their recognized merits such as beneficial to recovery and lower energy demanded bao et al 2019 however the intricate preparation processes and both expensive and poisonous chemicals used have rigorously restrained their practical applications electrolytic manganese residue emr is the ultimately metallurgical waste of electrolytic manganese process about 120 130 million tons of emr has been deposited in china with approximately 11 million tons was produced annually shu et al 2019 the surface water and surrounding soil were seriously polluted due to the open stacking of emr the components of emr mainly include calcium silicon aluminum iron and manganese oxide design and synthesis of the emr based catalysts are not only conductive to emr recycling but also beneficial to the promotion of the practical catalyst applications in view of the concept waste to wealth most recently our group have synthesized a bimetallic aops catalyst through a green simple short cut method by applying emr as fe and mn sources li et al 2020b but its performance is still impeded by its insufficient transition metal contents and low generation speed from high valance to low valance indicating the catalyst should need additional treatment the preparation of composite materials with suitable carriers has been reported as an useful method to enhance the degradation efficiency of most metal based catalysts su et al 2019 while carbon based nanomaterials including activated carbon huang et al 2020 biochar yu et al 2020a carbon nanotubes yao et al 2016 graphene oxide wu et al 2020 and their functionalized products are found to possess plentiful electrons large specific surface areas ssa and excellent electron conductivity these unique characteristics have made them as superior catalyst carriers among them multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts with large amounts of oxygen containing groups have shown great potential in improving the heterogeneous catalytic reactivity lu and wey 2007 yang et al 2018a many researchers have made their efforts to explore the roles of mwcnts in composite some studies proposed that mwcnts could serve as an electron transfer catalyst referring the haber weiss mechanism involved in multi states of catalyst tang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 but others found carbon materials also could play a role as the sacrifice to accelerate the transition metal redox cycles with partial decomposition of themselves during the reaction zubir et al 2015 on the other hand ternary system might be formed in sr aops in the presence of carbon materials because they acted as the electron transfer mediators to promote the electrons transfer from contaminants to pds pms in which no radicals were involved in this process tang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 thus the essential roles of mwcnts still remain blurred and controversial and have not been fully illustrated yet which still require deepgoing study roxarsone rox 3 nitro 4 hydroxyphenylarsenic acid are organoarsenic feed additives which was extensively used in swine and poultry production acuña et al 2017 chen and huang 2012 xie et al 2016 researchers estimate that thousands of tons of rox were consumed worldwide per year while 14 54 mg kg of rox was found in poultry manure they have strong water solubility and are easy to leach out from feces and result in surface water and soils pollution which have rendered rox a rigorous threat to both ecosystem and human health adak et al 2015 yang et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 previous studies have put much attentions to the toxic inorganic arsenic species treatment neppolian et al 2010 tabelin et al 2019 wang et al 2014 but few studies have concerned the organoarsenic elimination in environment while sr aops might be an effective approach for rox removal in order to prepare a bi functional catalyst in pds aop for rox removal we combined emr with multi walled cnts through ball milling method the structural characteristics of the as synthesized catalysts were first evaluated and the effects of m o c bonds on composite surface were discussed in details the in situ catalytic oxidation of rox and adsorption properties toward as v of the composite were then explored additionally the relevant degradation mechanism was disclosed by the capture experiments spectrum detection and electrochemical examination the essential roles of mwcnts in the composites were clarified furthermore the by products of rox were analyzed and the possible oxidation pathway was proposed 2 experiment the details information including materials and reagents catalyst preparation and characterizations and degradation experiments were shown in the text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns of different catalysts are shown in fig 1 a the sintered multi walled mwcnts had two distinct peaks at 26 06 and 43 02 which could be assigned to the 002 and 100 diffraction planes of mwcnts respectively ma et al 2015 the main phases of emr were matched to caso4 h2o 2 pdf 21 0816 sio2 pdf 46 1054 α fe2o3 pdf 33 0664 and mn3o4 pdf 24 0734 hua et al 2020 after combination the xrd patterns of all mt emr composites showed no significant difference compared with raw emr except for the appearance of the reflective properties of carbon nanotubes the amplified xrd patterns are shown in fig s1 the successful combination of mwcnts and emr was further confirmed by the ftir spectra text s2 fig s2a the ssa of all as prepared materials were obtained by bet analysis and the corresponding information is displayed in table s2 the ssa of these composites were significantly higher than those of both raw mt 79 4 m2 g and emr 47 5 m2 g besides the porosities of mt emr were enhanced as the mwcnts dosage increased from 0 01 g to 0 1 g but decreased when the mt content exceeded 0 1 g when variant amount of mt was introduced in the ssa of compounded materials were 82 5 m2 g 91 7 m2 g 99 6 m2 g 109 8 m2 g and 103 2 m2 g respectively the enhancement of ssa could be attributed to the micro or mesopores formed after mt and emr combination which conductive to the pollutants elimination however the total surface area of the composites decreased when the carbon content reached to a certain value the reason of which should be due to the excessive carbon occupying a considerable space of emr particles which would then inhibit its degradation performance yu et al 2019 the surface chemistry before and after modification was explored by xps analysis fe 2p3 2 and mn 2p3 2 xps spectra of emr and 0 1 mt emr were compared firstly as shown in fig 1b three peaks located at 710 39 fe ⅱ 711 59 fe iii and 713 14 ev fe iii could be deconvoluted on emr wilson and langell 2014 after introducing mt these three peaks shifted to 710 85 ev 711 95 ev and 713 45 ev respectively similarly three peaks at 641 14 ev 642 29 ev and 643 35 ev on emr belonging to mn ⅳ mn iii mn ⅱ shifted to 641 65 ev 642 75 ev and 644 00 ev in the 0 1 mt emr spectra respectively tang et al 2014 fig 1c the shifts of these peaks should be ascribed by the electrons transfer from mwcnts to emr which also indicated that new bonds might be formed in the composite pan et al 2019 xu et al 2016 have prepared fullerol modified ferrihydrite and proved that a covalent bond was formed between hydroxyl groups and the ferrihydrite zhu et al 2020 have synthesized mwcnts ferrihydrite composite by co precipitation method and they found that the surface complexes formed between the oxygen containing functional groups of mwcnts and ferrihydrite thus it s rational to speculate that m o c m fe or mn would form between carbon materials and emr particles to determine the production of chemical bonds between mt and emr the high resolution scans of o 1 s of emr and 0 1 mt emr were compared and shown in fig 1d the o1s xps spectrum of emr can be separated into three peaks including m o 530 05 ev m oh 531 9 ev and adsorbed h2o 532 7 ev after combining mt with emr new peak located at 532 85 ev appeared which could be assigned to co c and co h yu et al 2020a remarkably the peak at 530 6 ev occurred in the o1s xps spectrum of 0 1 mt emr which was corresponded to the m o c bonds according to other carbon metal oxide composites reported combellas et al 2005 yu et al 2021 further the zeta potential values ℑ of mt emr and 0 1 mt emr were measured to demonstrate the strong interactions between carbon tube and emr fig s2b mwcnts exhibited negative charge at the whole tested ph range while the ℑ of emr was about 4 22 the ℑ of emr combinated with mwcnts 3 68 was slightly lower than that of raw emr confirming the chemical bonds formed after combination the intuitive morphologies of emr mt and 0 1 mt emr are exhibited in fig 2 the sem images show the emr particles were in bulky with irregular shapes and the mwcnts were under the integrated tubular structures fig 2a after combining mwcnts with emr the emr particles were loaded onto the long mwcnts by m o c bonds the microstructure of 0 1 mt emr was then characterized by tem and hrtem it was found that the mwcnts and emr particles were combined tightly which were in accordance with sem images the hrtem image of 0 1 mt emr shows clear fringes with lattice spacing of ca 0 255 nm on mwcnts and both ca 0 213 nm and ca 0 152 nm on emr corresponding to the 002 basal planes of carbon layer 110 plane of α fe2o3 and 215 plane of mn3o4 fig 2b respectively these results were in good accordance with the xrd patterns the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern indicating the 0 1 mt emr was polycrystalline then the fast fourier transform fft was calculated under hrtem to identify the extent of crystallinity the blurred spots broad peaks of the fft image indicate low crystallinity of materials as shown in fig 2b the mwcnts was highly crystalized as the fft of mt consisted of sharp spots the reason that mwcnts used in this study was in highly crystalized might be that the raw mwcnts was sintered at 750 before use as it was reported that sintering could improve the degree of crystallization of carbon materials while the fft image of emr revealed the low crystallinity of metal oxides zhang et al 2017 the composites with both high crystallinity and amorphous state might show better catalytic performance in pms pds system yu et al 2020b in addition line scans and elemental mapping further revealed the evenly distributions of fe mn o and c elements on the composites thus both the sem and tem results revealed the potent combination of 0 1 mt emr which was ascribed by the formation of m o c bonds between mwcnts and emr this combination resulted in large ssa values and created more active sites on the catalyst surface 3 2 rox degradation under various mt emr activated pds systems the removal efficiencies of rox by different mt emr activated pds systems were examined fig 3 a the degradation efficiency of pure pds on rox was only 1 59 nearly 26 32 of rox can be adsorbed by mwcnts within 30 min which was in accordance with the superior adsorption property of mwcnts reported in some studies su et al 2019 yang et al 2018a the mt emr exhibited considerable adsorption capacity toward rox than emr alone 41 7 vs 26 32 which might be ascribed by the larger ssa of mt emr accompanied with higher the adsorption rate more information about the adsorption performance was displayed in text s1 fig s3 and table s3 in order to eliminate the influence of adsorption pds was injected after adsorption desorption equilibrium in 30 min in the following experiments after pds was added the mwcnts could poorly activate pds and showed a rather low catalytical rates 8 12 on rox as for pristine emr only 25 73 9 94 by adsorption and 15 79 by degradation of rox could be removed after the addition of pds while the degradation efficiency of rox was dramatically enhanced after having introduced mwcnts onto emr noticeably the degradation efficiency of rox was firstly increased with the rise of mwcnts amount from 0 to 0 1 g and then began to decline with the further increase of mwcnts amount 0 1 g fig s4a the treatment efficiencies of different mt emr composites ranged from 64 88 to 90 96 indicating a synergistic combination between mwcnts and emr the reduction of ssa and the decrease in emr content resulted in the deterioration of catalytic ability for all catalysts tested the 0 1 mt emr exhibited the superior catalytic activity with a removal rate of 90 96 toward rox within 60 min the pseudo first order equation was applied to fit the degradation kinetics fig 3b and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs was obtained from the equation ln c c0 k obst the k obs r2 0 99 of 0 1 mt emr was nearly 10 1 times as high as that of raw emr 0 02991 min 1 vs 0 00296 min 1 the results further confirmed that introducing mt onto emr could effectively improve the catalytic performance towards rox the toc removal efficiency and mass balance of arsenic were calculated text s3 and fig s4b the removal process of rox could be roughly described as follow the as c bond was destroyed and the generated as iii could be rapidly oxidized to pentavalent oxyanion by reactive oxygen species then the produced as v was subsequently adsorbed by 0 1 mt emr the effect of pre adsorption of rox on catalyst was also investigated more details information are shown in text s3 and fig s4 results found pre adsorption was essential to the oxidation process and showed that the large amount of degradation product of as v would be simultaneously adsorbed onto the catalyst and cover the active sites during the degradation process the recycle properties of emr and 0 1 mt emr are shown in fig s5 the removal ratio of rox after each cycle decreased in both adsorption and degradation and the adsorption capacity was reduced by 9 6 in total for rox removal after four cycles of 0 1 mt emr which was lower than that of raw emr 16 5 this might be attributed to the m o c bonds in mt emr making the composite more stable than raw emr the obviously decreased ssa and as v covered on catalyst active sites should be responsible for the reduced activating performance of used 0 1 mt emr to pds for rox oxidation ph is an important parameter affecting the interface characteristics of catalyst matrix and the existence of active species in aops qin et al 2020 the influence of different ph values on pollution removal is displayed in fig 3d the degradation efficiency of rox 90 96 reached the highest at initial ph 3 04 and the degradation rate was reduced with the increase of initial ph from 3 04 to 10 05 which was similar with the previous studies fang et al 2017 zubir et al 2015 in the degradation process the final ph value decreased significantly to about 3 10 when the initial ph value was in the range of 3 04 8 04 which was probably attributed to the abundant so4 radicals generated during the degradation process but when the initial ph value was 10 05 the final solution ph value only declined to 6 40 suggesting that oh might be the primary radicals in that case huang et al 2017 in fact the zeta potential of the 0 1 mt emr was 3 68 and the 0 1 mt emr was negatively charged when the ph was higher than this value thus the low ph was favorable for the electrostatic adsorption of s2o8 2 and rox onto 0 1 mt emr which facilitated the oxidation reactions between target organics and oxidants on the contrary electrostatic repulsion occurred as the ph value increased which would restrict the adsorption of both rox and s2o8 2 then the production of active species decreased and the oxidation capacity of 0 1 mt emr pds system was gradually inhibited it was noted that when the initial ph value was 10 04 the final solution ph value reached to 6 81 a much higher value when compared with most of reported sulphate radical based aops studies but the degradation efficiency 73 4 remained satisfactory when at the initial ph of 10 04 which indicated the generation of non free radicals with less ph dependence or the existence of other degradation pathways during rox decomposition in 0 1 mt emr pds system this hypothesis was further explored by quenching experiment and electrochemical test in this study additionally the degradation experiments at different ph values were also carried out in buffering systems results show that although there was no significant drop in the final ph after reaction the degradation efficiencies in buffer solution had no obvious differences on the performance of rox degradation in the ph range of 3 0 8 0 fig s6 when compared with those in unbuffered systems fig 5d moreover as displayed in fig 3d and fig s6 the adsorption efficiency decreased obviously when the ph increased from 3 0 to 10 while the degradation efficiency was reduced slightly which indicated the ph value mainly affected the sorption capacity rather than degradation of mt emr further typical systems including fe2 pds 92 8 goethite pds 78 2 hematite pds 66 1 ac pds 80 9 cp pds 55 2 and graphene pds systems 83 2 fig s7 were used to degrade rox under the same experimental condition as that of 0 1 mt emr pds system it was found that only fe2 pds system had a higher removal efficiency than 0 1 mt emr pds system while other systems showed poorer oxidation ability but homogeneous ferrite ions could easily cause secondary pollution of iron sludge ren et al 2020 thus the 0 1 mt emr could be considered as an efficient catalyst for pds activation it was significantly important to explore why the 0 1 mt emr had superior performance on organoarsenic removal thus the catalytic mechanisms were carried out and the contribution of mwcnts during the oxidation were fully investigated in this study 3 3 ros detection in general pds can be activated to produce free radicals to oxidize organic contaminants the radicals generated in 0 1 mt emr pds system were determined by quenching experiments etoh and tba were applied for capturing so4 and oh radicals fig 4 a generally the etoh has comparatively capture ability for both so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while the tba shows a relatively sensitive reaction to oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 as depicted in fig 4a the presence of both etoh etoh pds 200 or 1000 and tba tba pds 200 or 1000 showed little influences on the removal efficiency the unobvious inhibitory effect for the catalytic reaction indicated the common free radicals so4 and oh played an unimportant role in rox degradation previous studies have demonstrated that o2 radicals might present in catalyst pds system therefore 10 μm of sod were employed to verify the existence of the o2 radicals during the activation of pds by 0 1 mt emr wang et al 2017 it was found that only 77 62 rox was degraded in the presence of 10 μm sod and the obvious inhibition effects indicated that the o2 has participated in the degradation process then the dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was applied as a probe for indirect detection of surface bonded radicals and possible production of fe ⅳ guo et al 2021a zhu et al 2018 the weak effect on reaction manifested the surface bonded radicals and high valent iron were not generated and took part in the reaction process the existence of active species was then verified by electron spin resonance esr spectra using the dmpo as trapping agent for so4 oh and o2 scavenger as displayed in fig 4b the emergence of dmpo so4 peaks six lines with relative intensities of 1 1 1 1 1 1 an ah 14 9 g and dmpo oh peaks four lines with intensities of 1 2 2 1 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g suggested the formation of so4 and oh radicals respectively and these values were consistent well with some previously reported meanwhile the observation of dmpo o2 have verified that o2 radical was also generated in 0 1 mt emr pds system recent studies have proposed that the degradation pathway of sr aops also involved singlet oxygenation attack the non radical 1o2 as final product of o2 was then determined by using ffa or tryptophan as scavenger li et al 2018 wang et al 2016 results showed that nearly 68 23 and 63 77 of rox was removed when 4 mm ffa and tryptophan were added fig 4a respectively suggesting 1o2 has participated in the reaction and played a relatively important role compared with other reactive species the temp 1o2 signals found in esr spectra confirmed 1o2 formation during rox degradation fig 4b however some studies have demonstrated the formation of temp 1o2 signal peaks might be resulted from the electron transfer from temp to pds pms which was mediated by the catalyst and caused the generation of temp yun et al 2018 in order to further verify the generation of 1o2 d2o was used as solvent for pds activating reaction theoretically the solvent exchange could accelerate the catalytic reaction involving 1o2 due to the fact that the lifetime of 1o2 is prolonged by 10 times in d2o solution compared with that in h2o if the 1o2 was produced in the catalytical system the degradation rate would be enhanced in d2o solvent on the contrary if no significant effects of d2o the occurring of false positive signals temp 1o2 might be the result of temp yun et al 2018 as shown in fig 4a the rox degradation process was accelerated in d2o system and the calculated k obs in this system was increased from 0 0124 min 1 to 0 029 min 1 after replacing h2o with d2o which further verified the formation of 1o2 3 4 ros generation mechanism from the above analysis four type of ros including both free radicals so4 oh and o2 and non radical 1o2 involved in rox decomposition the xps spectra of 0 1 mt emr before and after being used were employed to investigate the mechanisms of ros generation their survey spectra fe 2p mn 2p and as 3d spectra are shown in fig 4c f the characteristic peaks of fe 2p mn 2p o 1 s and c 1 s could be obviously observed in the scan spectra before reaction confirming that 0 1 mt emr contained c o fe and s after rox degradation the peaks of as auger and as 3d could be clearly found indicating the rox have been decomposed and as adsorbed onto 0 1 mt emr fig 4c the fe 2p3 2 binding energy for the spin orbit splitting peaks at 710 85 ev 711 95 ev and 713 5 ev can be assigned to the fe ii and fe ⅲ respectively peng et al 2017 after reaction the relative content of fe ⅱ increased from 30 45 to 44 27 with the corresponding decrease in fe ⅲ indicating the reduction of fe iii fig 4d besides the high resolution spectrum of mn 2p3 2 was also provided and the peaks located at 641 45 ev 642 80 ev and 644 00 ev belong to mn ii mn iii and mn ⅳ respectively joshi et al 2017 the peaks intensity ratio of mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ changed from 39 43 32 98 27 59 for pristine 0 1 mt emr to 55 43 14 64 29 93 after having been used fig 4e the changes in fe 2p and mn 2p binding energy manifested the effective redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and mn ii mn iii mn ⅳ in the 0 1 mt emr pds rox system the strong characteristic peak of as 3d at binding energy of 45 65 ev was found which was corresponded to the as v xie et al 2016 fig 4f besides the deconvoluted peaks of as v spectrum were provided and the peaks at 45 0 ev 45 5 ev 45 9 ev and 46 3 ev could be assigned to fe al si as v o fe as v o and as v o oh tabelin et al 2019 respectively manifesting the catalyst have high affinity toward as v and the as v could be well immobilized the formation of amorphous feaso4 h2o further indicating the 0 1 mt emr pds system was suitable for rox removal because it can avoid the risk of secondary pollution in solution caused by the production of inorganic arsenic after the degradation reaction the surface concentrations of c and m m represent fe or mn had slight variations and the data are shown in table s4 the ratio of c m increased from 5 97 to 6 79 was ascribed by the adsorption of degradation by products on catalyst surface further indicating the efficient decomposition of rox by this system the xps analysis has demonstrated the efficient electron transfer on catalyst surface a large amount of ros was produced during pds activation process the contributions of o2 and 1o2 were superior to those of both so4 and oh which might be caused by the rapid transformation between these reactive species hu et al 2020 li et al 2019 guo et al 2021b electrons could easily transfer between mn to mn 1 of transition metals fe and mn because they have unique valence electron structures resulting the formation of so4 via one electron transfer mechanism eq s1 and s2 meanwhile so4 radicals could interact with oh and h2o in the solution to produce oh radicals eq s3 and s4 on the other hand the pds was hydrolyzed in the solution generating a lot of ho2 eq s5 and the ho2 could be easily oxidized by another pds molecule and contributed to the production of o2 and so4 radicals eq s6 then 1o2 would also be formed after o2 has reacted with h2o or h eq s7 and s8 the generated so4 oh o2 along with 1o2 would then take part in the oxidation of rox here a synergistic effect of electron transfer happened between mn and fe where mn ⅲ and mn ⅳ could be reduced by fe ⅱ as it was thermodynamically favorable eq s9 and s10 besides homogeneous reaction might occur as metals would be released into the solution along with reaction process thus the influence of leaching metals fe and mn on the removal of rox was revealed it was found that 0 173 mg l of fe and 0 035 mg l of mn leached out had little effects to pds stimulation table s4 which was consistent well with previous study hua et al 2020 thus the impact of homogeneous reaction during the rox removal process could be eliminated 3 5 confirmation of direct electron transfer pathway several interesting phenomena have been unexpectedly observed in this study firstly a small fraction of pds was consumed in the reaction fig s8a generally a large amount of oxidants might be decomposed in the radical based degradation reactions but the consumption of pds was only 4 or 8 in the single system of rox or 0 1 mt emr respectively the amount of consumed pds increased in the presence of both rox and 0 1 mt emr but was still just only 33 6 this might imply that the existence of electron transfer pathway mediated and the oxidation of rox could still proceed in the absence of active species tang et al 2018 to confirm this hypothesis eis and lsv analysis were applied to explore the electron transfer process the eis diagram was shown in fig 5 a raw emr had large semicircle diameter suggesting a high resistance while the 0 1 mt emr had a smaller semicircle diameter than emr and the esi plot was almost a straight line indicating a superior electronic conductivity and higher charge transfer efficiency of 0 1 mt emr which could be further proved by the enhancive current in lsv plot when 0 1 mt emr was used as the working electrode the current increases slightly when adding pds or rox which may be due to the weak electron transfer between the pds or rox and the 0 1 mt emr fig 5b however when both pds and rox were added a prominent oxidation peak accompanied by an obvious current raise could be found manifesting the expedited oxidation reaction and rapid electron transfer on 0 1 mt emr surface caused by the formation of ternary system this demonstrated the crucial role of all components 0 1 mt emr pds and rox in the reaction and demonstrated the direct reduction of pds in 0 1 mt emr surface by abstracting two electrons which was another solid evidence for the direct electron transfer pathway thus a two electron pathway did contribute to the degradation of rox as discussed above when rox with sufficient electrons closed to the stimulated pds molecules a ternary system including 0 1 mt emr pds and rox was formed however in our previous study on levofloxacin degradation in emr pms system no obvious current response could be found in the pms lvf solution when using emr as electrode which indicated that electron transfer was prolonged in this study when replacing the working electrode 0 1 mt emr with emr the significant decrease in current manifested the two electron pathway did not exist in the emr pds rox system which highlighted the essence of introducing mwcnts into emr and the addition of mwcnts could endow the catalyst with large ssa and satisfactory conductivity with the help of 0 1 mt emr the activated pds could directly oxidize rox through two electron conduction eq 1 1 s 2 o 82 2 e 2 so 42 the role of mwcnts was further investigated by xps analysis the high resolution xps spectra of c1s of 0 1 mt emr before and after use are provided in fig 5c three peaks located at 284 74 ev 285 13 ev and 285 98 ev were obtained which were belonged to the sp2 hybridized graphite like carbon atoms c c the cc species in a sp3 hybridization state and both the co h and co c respectively the fitting results implied the presence of abundant oxygen functional groups on the mt after reaction the relative intensity ratio of c c peak decreased from 61 53 to 45 68 the cc group increased slightly from 24 86 from 26 14 and the co h co c groups increased significantly from 13 6 to 28 16 respectively indicating partial of mwcnts were oxidized in the reaction process which was in accordance well with the reduction of removal performance after having been used in reflected by recycle experiments the obviously changes of c c and co h co c manifested the transformation between these two groups which was well consistent with the previous reported study yu et al 2020a combining the c1s xps spectra results with the reusability tests results we proposed that mwcnts acted as a sacrifice of which c c groups could serve as electron donating groups by transferring their unpaired π electrons to low valent transition metal which would accelerate the redox cycles of metal i e fe ii fe iii cycle this might be the strong evidence for why introducing mwcnt could endow emr with high degradation efficiency the decomposition of pds in various systems was measured during the oxidation process fig s8b the pure mwcnts and raw emr could slightly decompose pds with the decomposition ratio of 8 9 and 10 7 within 60 min respectively after having introduced mwcnts to emr the consumption of pds increased significantly and the 0 1 mt emr showed the largest decomposition efficiency with nearly 33 6 of pds decomposed within 60 min the acceleration of the pds consumption rate further confirmed that mwcnts could donate electrons to the transition metals in emr in summary both ros and electron transfer mediated processes were involved in this system and worked together for rox decomposition scheme 1 as mentioned the degradation efficiency was 50 26 except for the 41 7 rox adsorbed while the o2 and 1o2 could remove nearly 40 of rox from scavenging experiments thus about 10 of rox was decomposed by activated pds these results indicated the ros played the dominant role in rox degradation 3 6 rox evolution the uv vis spectra variations of rox in 0 1 mt emr pds system over time are displayed in fig 6 a the dominant peaks at 267 and 338 nm are corresponded to the aromatic ring the peaks located at 222 nm mainly derived from the nitroso group the intensities of these peaks decreased as degradation goes on and disappeared after 120 min this indicated the fully breakage of the nitro as c bonds and the aromatic rings of rox caused by the oxidation which was further proved by lc ms analysis the rox was ultimately disintegrated into as v anions and small organic molecules in order to deeply understand the catalytical reactions 3d eem technique was applied to probe the behavior of rox molecules in the whole degradation process as shown in fig 6b three fluorescence peaks could be observed in these samples with the fluorescence center located at the ex em 300 360 350 410 nm peak i ex em 290 340 410 470 nm peak ⅱ and ex em 340 410 410 500 nm peak ⅲ these three peaks are corresponded to the humic acid like v regions after adsorption process fig 6c the peak i disappeared while the location ex em and shape of peak ⅱ and peak ⅲ were basically unchanged with a decrease in their intensities indicating that partial rox was adsorbed by the catalyst during this period of time and confirmed the excellent adsorption ability of 0 1 mt emr to rox after adding pds the fluorescence intensity of the two signals reduced in 10 min fig 6d and 30 min fig 6e after 60 min of reaction fig 6f the peaks area became faded and the intensity reduced dramatically manifesting that most of rox have been removed the data analyzed here imply that the 0 1 mt emr can be served as a promising candidate for the treatment of antibiotic contamination the by products of rox were then determined by lc ms analysis and the results are displayed in fig 7 in the degradation process the aromatic ring in rox was firstly oxidized by reactive species and transformed into 2 nitrohydroquinone product ⅰ m z 154 01 da fig 7b li et al 2020a and arsenic the arsenic could be directly in situ adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and the 2 nitrohydroquinone was further oxidized to product ⅱ which could be identified as hydroquinone m z 112 84 da fig 7c with the degradation process proceeded the product ⅲ showed an intense signal with a m z 80 9 da could be observed we speculate this product was propionic acid product ⅲ m z 112 84 da fig 7d a product resulted from the ring cleavage of aromatic therefore we deduced that a series of short chain carboxylic acids might be formed during catalytic reaction the oxidation by products of rox indicated a typical electrophilic addition reaction of aromatic compounds fig 7e 4 conclusion in this work highly effective sr aops catalysts were successfully prepared by ball milling emr with multi walled mwcnts for the first time the results showed 0 1 mt emr pds system had great application potential with 90 96 of rox removed owing to the high adsorption capacity and excellent catalytical ability the large adsorption capacity of 0 1 mt emr was ascribed by the introduction of mt the combination of mt would further accelerate the electron transfer between high and low valance of metals in emr which was favorable for pds activation and thus resulted in the generation of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 the k obs of degradation in 0 1 mt emr pds system was nearly 10 1 times higher than that in emr pds system on the other hand mechanism explorations have found a two electron pathway also contributed to the degradation by which a ternary system including 0 1 mt emr pds and rox was

16939,elevated as iii and fe ii in shallow reducing groundwater can be frequently re oxidized by introducing o2 due to natural anthropogenic processes thus leading to oxidative precipitation of as as well as fe nevertheless the geochemical process may be impacted by co existing engineered black carbon due to its considerable applications which remains poorly understood taking rice husk derived biochar prepared at 500 c as an example we explored its impact on the process particularly for the as iii oxidation and im mobilization during the oxygenation the presence of the biochar had a negligible effect on the as iii oxidation and immobilization extents within 1 d while accelerating their rates however the immobilized as iii was significantly liberated from the formed fe iii minerals afterward within 21 d which was 2 2 fold higher than that in the absence of the biochar the enhanced as iii liberation was attributed to the presence of the surface silicon carbon structure consisting of the outer silicon and inner carbon layers of the rice husk derived biochar the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate primarily promoted the as iii release via ligand exchange while significantly impeding the transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite still resulted secondarily in the as iii release our findings reveal the possible impact of biochar on the environmental behavior and fate of as iii in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation this work highlights that biochar particularly for its structural features should be a concern in re mobilizing as in such scenarios when the oxygenation time reaches several days or weeks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater oxygenation arsenic remobilization iron minerals transformation engineered black carbon aging 1 introduction the naturally occurring high arsenic as in groundwater is relatively widely distributed worldwide and has become a global environmental issue that poses an enormous threat to human health karim 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in particular arsenicosis in bangladesh china vietnam etc remains ongoing with over 100 million of the rural population exposed to unsafe as levels 10 μg l by ingesting untreated groundwater fendorf et al 2010 xie et al 2017 numerous studies on the naturally occurring high as in groundwater have revealed the environmental behavior and fate of as in typically hydrogeologic scenarios e g fe ii rich reducing groundwater harvey et al 2002 islam et al 2004 michael 2013 schaefer et al 2017 wallis et al 2020 for example as one of the most important mechanisms for elevating as concentrations in groundwater microbially reductive dissolution of as bearing iron fe minerals via coupled microbial oxidation of organic matter om prefers to occur in reducing aquifers located in large river basins e g china and south and southeast asia countries michael 2013 schaefer et al 2017 also the microbial reduction of as v to more labile as iii stimulates the as liberation fendorf et al 2010 which is associated with a weakened affinity of as iii towards the fe minerals e g ferrihydrite and goethite particularly under acidic neutral conditions dixit and hering 2003 jain et al 1999 as a consequence considerable as iii and fe ii ions can be collectively released from these minerals into groundwater thus accumulating aqueous as iii to potentially toxic levels despite the microbial reduction process prevails the subsurface systems particularly for shallow unconfined aquifers are frequently disturbed by natural processes e g periodic fluctuations shifts of the water table ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a and or anthropogenic activities e g managed aquifer recharge and alternate wetting drying cycles luong et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 accordingly the subsurface redox conditions may change from reducing to progressively more oxidizing due to the invasion of o2 from surface water and vadose zone which thus may induce a series of new abiotic interactions between reduced components e g fe ii and as iii and o2 luong et al 2018 tong et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a for instance yuan and co workers recently monitored the dynamic h2o2 concentration in an unconfined aquifer with a 14 m water table fluctuation zhang et al 2020a they found that the dynamic h2o2 concentration elevated up to 123 nm at a rising water table stage in summer due to the occurence of the abiotic redox reactions between the reduced components e g fe ii and o2 but was negligible at a stable or falling water table stage in addition to h2o2 the abiotic fe ii oxidation by o2 can produce other reactive oxidizing species ros e g fe iv and oh that enable oxidation of contaminants e g as iii under circumneutral conditions katsoyiannis et al 2008 consequently the co existing as iii in the shallow unconfined aquifers can be re oxidized and re immobilized by coupled o2 induced fe ii oxidative precipitation when the groundwater table elevates this process can significantly lower aqueous as as well as fe concentrations and improve groundwater quality extensive evidence from field and laboratory researches conducted in south and southeast asia has demonstrated that om that is pervasively distributed in reducing aquifers perhaps as a dominant driver of anaerobic microbial reduction significantly elevates groundwater as levels harvey et al 2002 lawson et al 2013 mailloux et al 2013 neumann et al 2010 despite this abiotic om mediated reactions e g complexation competition and redox might exert increasing or even dominant effects in a localized newly oxidized zone of the reducing aquifers where the exotic o2 invades since the anaerobic microbial activities are gradually decreased or even terminated due to the microbes inactivation by ros zhang et al 2020b for instance om can bind as species to produce dissolved colloidal as fe om complexes and or compete with as species for adsorption sites on fe mineral surfaces both of which may enhance the as mobility sharma et al 2010 2011 in addition it can inhibit the as iii oxidation and precipitation during the o2 induced fe ii oxidative precipitation tong et al 2016 conversely highly reactive om is capable of abiotically oxidizing as iii and fe ii garg et al 2013 redman et al 2002 which may trigger their precipitation collectively these abiotic om mediated processes control the as iii oxidation and mobility under oxic conditions up to now there has been a significant body of knowledge regarding the impact of the well recognized om in contrast engineered black carbon perhaps less widespread but increasingly detected in subsurface environments lian and xing 2017 song et al 2002 zhong et al 2020 may be an alternative source of om but its environmental impact is less known biochar as a representative of engineered black carbon has been extensively applied in ground water soil remediation bortone et al 2013 he et al 2019 wei et al 2018 such extensive applications have led to a considerable introduction of biochar into natural environments as exemplified by ca 1 40 of biochar derived organic carbon detected in soils and sediments lian and xing 2017 zhong et al 2020 biochar that has been transported downward aquifers may regulate the as iii oxidation and mobility during the oxygenation incorporating insight from om that shares some similar physicochemical features e g oxygen functional groups and properties e g redox activity redman et al 2002 sharma et al 2011 tong et al 2016 although sharing similar features and properties biochar has much higher heterogeneities of elemental compositions phase components and surface properties as compared with the om xiao et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 as a result biochar is anticipated to exert more complicated impacts on the as iii oxidation and mobility for example niazi et al 2018 reported that perilla leaf derived biochar particles effectively immobilized as species via both surface complexation and precipitation with partial oxidation of as iii to as v however we recently found that rice husk derived biochar negligibly immobilized as species while being capable of oxidizing as iii via multiple pathways which highly depend on water chemistry e g o2 level and solution ph zhong et al 2019 we further revealed that undissolved or dissolved biochar fractions could synergistically immobilize as iii with co existing ca2 via contrasting mechanisms even under anoxic conditions zhong et al 2020 despite the potential significance to date the impact of biochar on the as iii oxidation and mobility in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation has not yet been reported especially for a relatively long term e g several weeks impact therefore this study aims to explore the impact of the biochar from pyrolysis of rice husk on the environmental behaviors and fates of as iii as well as fe ii during the oxygenation by exposing the system to air under circumneutral conditions here we chose the rice husk as the biochar precursor on the basis of 1 rice oryza sativa l is widely cultivated in china bangladesh vietnam etc where arsenicosis occurs xie et al 2017 2 rice processing brings enormous waste rice husk that can be used to produce value added biochar for ground water soil remediation o connor et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 2020 we performed batch experiments combining spectroscopic characterizations and wet chemical analyses to elucidate the mechanistic impact of the biochar on the as iii oxidation and im mobilization our findings can advance the understanding of the rice husk derived biochar s impact on the environmental behaviors and fate of as in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar production and characterization rice husk was collected from a local farm in suizhou city hubei province central china and washed by deionized water 18 2 mω cm followed by air dried at room temperature for several days biochar product was prepared by oxygen limited pyrolysis of the rice husk at 500 c for 1 h according to our recent studies zhong et al 2019 2020 once completion of the pyrolysis the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature and then washed by deionized water several times to remove impurities e g dissolvable biochar fraction following this the washed particles were dried under vacuum condition at 60 c for 24 h and ground to pass through a 0 075 mm sieve the obtained biochar sample was denoted as bc and stored at 4 c in the dark for later use the detailed spectroscopic characterizations including x ray diffraction xrd patterns fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning transmission electron microscopy sem of the samples are described in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 batch oxygenation experiments all batch oxygenation experiments were performed in wide mouth reactors 1000 ml covered with aluminum foil to avoid any photochemical reactions at room temperature 25 1 c each wide mouth reactor contained 500 ml reaction suspension and was completely equilibrated with atmospheric o2 under magnetically stirred conditions for a typical procedure 2 ml of 25 mm as iii stock solution was first added into 500 ml of 20 mm 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic acid mes buffer to create 100 μm as iii working solution and then adjusted to the desired ph value of 6 0 0 1 using 0 1 and or 1 m naoh solution a previous study has noted that mes does not form complexes with fe ii or fe iii under these conditions keenan and sedlak 2008 next 0 5 m fe ii stock solution i e 2 mm in the final reaction system was introduced into the as iii working solution at a fe as molar ratio of 20 that can be found in typical as contaminated groundwater sediments fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 after that 0 5 g of the bc sample i e 1 g

si figs s1 and s2 control experiments without the biochar sample were carried out under the same conditions above our batch oxygenation experiments were performed for 21 d since a seasonal ground water table rising that can bring eh elevation due to the introduction of o2 can last tens of days in central china as an example schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a for each sampling ca 4 ml of suspension sample was taken out for pretreatment and subsequent analysis at predetermined time intervals 0 21 d the suspension sample was immediately divided into two subsamples the first subsample was filtered through a 0 45 μm filtration membrane and further divided into two filtrates for as and fe species analyses similarly the unfiltered subsample was divided into two samples and digested by 1 m hcl after 24 h for measuring as and fe species concentrations according to a modified method liao et al 2017 more details on the samples pretreatments can be found in text s3 of si the total as as tot in each phase was acquired from the sum of as iii and as v the fe iii concentration in each phase was obtained by subtracting the fe ii concentration from the fe tot concentration the hcl extractable adsorbed precipitated fractions of as and fe species in the solid phase were calculated from the differences of the two measurements between the unfiltered and filtered samples considering the interference from the background mes buffer for the precise determination of dissolved labile organic carbon with a total organic carbon toc evaluation released from the biochar during aging we performed experiments with an automated ph stat titrator easyplus et 18 mettler toledo switzerland instead of mes that was used to control the system ph at 6 0 0 1 all the experiments were conducted in duplicate at least 2 3 wet chemical analysis the as iii and as v concentrations were measured by a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs sa7800 beijing bohui innovation

0 relative standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biochar on arsenic mobility during oxygenation 3 1 1 short time effect of biochar fig 1 a and 1b shows dynamic changes in the as species concentrations in the bc fe ii as iii and fe ii as iii systems during the oxygenation within 24 h or 1 d respectively with two characteristic stages based on the changes in the as tot aqueous concentration stage i i e 0 12 h vs 0 5 h and stage ii i e 12 24 h vs 5 24 h at stage i in the presence of the biochar the as iii aqueous concentration dropped sharply from 100 to 12 0 μm within the first 1 h and further decreased to a minimum value of 0 4 μm within 5 h and kept stable hereafter fig 1a in contrast our control experimental results without the biochar showed that the as iii aqueous concentration just decreased from 100 to 51 3 μm within the first 1 h and then to below as iii detection limit i e 0 002 μm within 5 h fig 1b this indicates that the presence of the biochar can accelerate the as iii removal it has been well recognized that fe ii or biochar can activate o2 to produce ros e g fe iv and or oh under circumneutral conditions thus leading to oxidation of as iii to as v katsoyiannis et al 2008 tong et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 accordingly we first tracked as v aqueous concentration as a function of the reaction time in both systems in line with these previous studies we observed the newly produced as v in solution regardless of the biochar presence specifically in the presence of the biochar the newly produced as v aqueous concentration elevated to a peak value of 11 6 μm within the first 1 h but then dropped to a minimum value of 0 9 μm within 12 h fig 1a by comparison the as v aqueous concentration just increased to a maximum value of 6 3 μm within the first 1 h but decreased to below as v detection limit i e 0 004 μm afterward within 5 h in the absence of the biochar fig 1b this comparison suggests that the presence of the biochar can induce a higher accumulative as v concentration in solution in this regard we attribute to a higher adsorbed fe ii concentration by the biochar instead of the biochar itself can activate o2 to produce a higher accumulative ros concentration for the as iii oxidation because of a lower reduction potential of the adsorbed fe ii compared with the aqueous one gorski et al 2016 this conclusion is further supported by both accelerated fe ii oxidation to fe iii in the presence of the biochar fig 1c and little as iii oxidation to as v at the limited time scale e g 12 h in the bc as iii system fig s3 for the as tot aqueous concentration in both systems it exhibited a monotonical decrease trend i e from 100 to a minimum value of 1 3 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system vs from 100 to 0 in the fe ii as iii system at stage i the results indicate that the biochar does not exert a positive effect on the as tot immobilization extent which is consistent with the negligible as tot immobilization in the bc as iii system fig s3 zhong et al 2019 instead the presence of the biochar slightly impeded the as species immobilization indicating a higher as risk also we observed a similar phenomenon in the bc fe ii as iii system with the low fe ii and as iii concentrations fig s2 in addition the presence of the biochar initially accelerated and then retarded the as tot immobilization rate these observations can be explained by the following reasons 1 at the initial stage i the biochar provides heterogeneous adsorption sites for free fe ii ions and then accelerates the adsorbed fe ii oxidation by o2 to form fe iii minerals see a larger fe ii oxidation rate from fig 1c the newly produced fe iii minerals in turn create new adsorption sites for the as species to promote their immobilization 2 at the middle and late stage i however the newly produced adsorption sites on the fe iii minerals that can immobilize the as species are increasingly occupied by the biochar e g its inherent components see a smaller slope from fig 2 c resulting in a slightly lower as tot immobilization extent subsequently we checked the change of the immobilized as species to further elucidate the effect of the biochar on the as iii oxidative precipitation at stage i in the presence of the biochar the as iii solid phase concentration first increased to a maximum value of 41 2 μm within the first 1 h but then decreased to 30 μm within 12 h fig 1a meanwhile the as v solid phase concentration monotonically increased to 68 9 μm within 12 h in the absence of the biochar however the as iii solid phase and as v solid phase concentrations just monotonically increased to 23 0 and 66 0 μm within 5 h at stage i respectively fig 1b a noteworthy point is only 89 0 of the as species extraction efficiency in the fe ii as iii system due to the formation of the more stable fe iii minerals e g crystalline lepidocrocite see section 3 1 2 and 3 2 this result indicates that a small amount of the as species cannot be extracted in the fe ii as iii system despite the incomplete extraction the extractable as v solid phase concentration i e 66 0 μm in the fe ii as iii system was comparable to that i e 68 9 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system this implies that the biochar plays a negligible role in the as iii oxidation extent during the process as verified by both a good correlation between the fe ii oxidation and as iii oxidation r 0 981 fig 2a and little as iii oxidation to as v in the bc as iii system fig s3 in agreement with previous studies katsoyiannis et al 2008 roberts et al 2004 there is an incomplete as iii oxidation regardless of the biochar presence this is because the consumption of the ros by a considerable amount of fe ii and or biochar which is confirmed by the far smaller ratio i e 34 8 1 and 17 5 1 μm mm of the as iii oxidation to fe ii oxidation than the theoretical ratio i e 500 1 μm mm fig 2a and 2b when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h the as species concentrations remained stable at stage ii for both systems fig 1a and 1b indicating that both systems undergo a relatively stable stage it has been recognized that the as iii oxidation and immobilization are highly dependent upon the oxidative precipitation of fe ii roberts et al 2004 tong et al 2014 xie et al 2017 thus we evaluated the fe species in both systems and the results are illustrated in fig 1c and 1d in the presence of the biochar the fe ii aqueous concentration dropped from 2 0 to 1 4 mm within the first 1 h subsequently to 0 1 mm within 5 h and ultimately to below fe ii detection limit i e 0 5 μm within 8 h fig 1c after that the fe ii aqueous concentration proceeded until 24 h also an identical trend was observed for the change in the fe tot aqueous concentration this indicates that the newly produced fe iii aqueous fails to be detected which is ascribed to its immediate precipitation adsorption at our experimental ph 6 0 fig s4 in contrast in the absence of the biochar the fe ii aqueous concentration just decreased from 2 0 to 1 8 mm within the initial 1 h then to 0 5 mm within 5 h and finally to below fe ii detection limit within 24 h fig 1d interestingly there was a good correlation between the fe tot precipitation and as tot immobilization within 5 h r 0 963 vs r 0 988 regardless of the presence of the biochar fig 2c and 2d this suggests that the fe species minerals but not the biochar are responsible for the as species immobilization in the bc fe ii as iii system which agrees with our previous observations figs 1a and s3 we further calculated that per mm fe tot could immobilize approximately 18 4 μm as tot in the presence of the biochar which was about 2 5 fold lower than that 46 9 μm in the absence of the biochar fig 2c and 2d the result suggests that the presence of the biochar is detrimental to the as tot immobilization by the fe species minerals supporting our previous result fig 1a in the solid phase the hcl extractable fe iii concentration elevated to 1 8 mm within 24 h in the bc fe ii as iii system whereas just increasing to 1 6 mm in the fe ii as iii system the results indicate the formation of more stable fe iii minerals in the absence of the biochar which is attributed to the slower fe ii oxidation and precipitation rates that prefer to form dense structured fe iii minerals fig 1d song et al 2015 in both systems we found no fe ii solid phase because of its immediate oxidation by o2 gorski et al 2016 to summarize the presence of the biochar can accelerate the as iii oxidation and immobilization rates by promoting the fe ii oxidation and precipitation but negligibly impact the as iii oxidation and immobilization extents 3 1 2 long time effect of biochar fig 1a shows that the as tot aqueous concentration rebounded from 1 3 to 11 8 μm at stage iii i e 1 21 d in the bc fe ii as iii system with a net increase of 10 5 μm which was 2 2 fold higher than that 4 7 μm in the fe ii as iii system fig 1b moreover the liberated as tot aqueous almost existed in the form of as iii aqueous i e 11 0 vs 4 2 μm with a slight as v aqueous i e 0 8 vs 0 5 μm in both systems the results suggest that the presence of the biochar can largely aggravate the as species mobility particularly for as iii during aging there are three possible mechanisms contributing to the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system 1 microbial reduction of as v to as iii and fe iii minerals reductive dissolution in the co presence of biochar and reducing bacteria 2 transformation of the fe iii minerals 3 competition of inherent components within the biochar with as species we first excluded the participation of the microbial reduction of as v to as iii and the fe iii minerals reductive dissolution for the biochar enhanced as species release based on our abiotic oxygenation conditions and the absence of the aqueous fe ii fig 1c fig 1a and 1c shows that both hcl extractable as tot and fe tot concentrations decreased from 100 to 80 4 μm and from 2 0 to 1 5 mm over 21 d in the presence of the biochar respectively the hcl extractable results indicate the transformation of the fresh fe iii minerals to more stable ones which contributes to the as species release via loss of the fe based active sites during aging in contrast our control system always had the lower hcl extractable as tot from 100 to 56 1 μm and fe tot concentrations from 2 0 to 1 4 mm over 21 d fig 1b and 1d the comparisons suggest the formation of more metastable fe iii minerals in the presence of the biochar it has been well recognized that transformation of fresh metastable fe iii minerals more precisely fe iii oxyhydr oxides to more stable ones with an increasing size but the decreasing surface area and adsorption sites thus liberating the already immobilized as species from the fresh fe iii oxyhydr oxides senn et al 2018 shi et al 2018 in other words more metastable fe iii minerals can retain capture a larger amount of as species to decrease their aqueous concentrations however this is contrary to our observation that there was a higher as species liberation in the presence of the biochar on the basis of these results and discussion we suggest that the enhanced as species liberation in the bc fe ii as iii system may be controlled by the fe iii mineralogical transformation and competitive interactions of inherent components within biochar 3 2 effect of iron minerals transformation on arsenic release during aging fig 3 a presents xrd patterns of the samples collected from the bc fe ii as iii system at the predetermined times in the presence of the biochar we only observed lepidocrocite over 21 d and there was a negligible crystallization growth of the lepidocrocite fig 3a similarly in the absence of the biochar the oxidative precipitation of fe ii led to the lepidocrocite generation over 21 d but with a slight increase in the xrd peak intensity of the lepidocrocite fig 3b this suggests that the lepidocrocite undergoes an increasing crystallization with aging furthermore new xrd patterns caused by goethite were found after 21 d fig 3b indicating that the lepidocrocite transforms into more stable goethite by comparing the xrd patterns we suggest that the presence of the biochar has no effect on the type of the nascent fe iii minerals e g lepidocrocite but can largely impede the transformation of these fe iii minerals which coincides with our previous hcl extractable observation fig 1 ftir spectroscopy was applied to further identify types of fe iii minerals and check their changes of amorphous minerals e g ferrihydrite for the samples collected from the bc fe ii as iii system the characteristic peaks appeared at 3207 and 554 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh and fe o in the ferrihydrite respectively an et al 2017 han et al 2016 song et al 2015 fig 3c the characteristic peak at 746 cm 1 represents the out plane bending vibration of oh in the lepidocrocite hug and leupin 2003 kinsela et al 2016 song et al 2015 it is important to note that all these characteristic peaks undergo negligible changes in the intensities and positions over 21 d these results indicate the formation of the ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite and their negligible transformations in the presence of the biochar during aging in addition we observed some characteristic peaks correlated with the biochar derived functional groups e g c o at 1706 cm 1 c c at 1618 cm 1 and co c at 1101 cm 1 zhong et al 2019 that had negligible or even no changes over 21 d this implies that the biochar has a relatively stable carbon based structure likewise we identified the same fe iii minerals i e ferrihydrite at 3205 and 548 cm 1 and lepidocrocite at 1157 1024 748 and 479 cm 1 in the fe ii as iii system over 21 d hug and leupin 2003 kinsela et al 2016 song et al 2015 fig 3d furthermore the intensity of the characteristic peak at 1157 cm 1 increased after 21 d indicating the lepidocrocite growth during aging a small peak at 817 cm 1 is correlated with the stretching vibration of as oh or fe o as in the formed as bearing fe iii minerals song et al 2015 more importantly we found two new characteristic peaks at 1728 and 503 cm 1 associated with the presence of the goethite song et al 2015 when the reaction time was prolonged to 14 or 21 d these changes in the characteristic peaks indicate the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite in the absence of the biochar over 21 d to visualize the morphologies of the fe iii minerals tem and sem characterizations were conducted on the selected samples collected from the two systems after 1 14 and 21 d fig 4 a c depicts that many amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals and needle like lepidocrocite were observed in the presence of the biochar over 21 d furthermore the needle like lepidocrocite was more and larger slightly with aging particularly after 21 d indicating a slow transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite in contrast in the absence of the biochar the needle like lepidocrocite was enlarged in size to a larger extent especially after 21 d during aging while the same fe iii minerals were present fig 4d f this comparison suggests that the presence of the biochar can significantly inhibit the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and further crystallization of the lepidocrocite from the sem images in fig 5 a c we observed a small amount of the particle like minerals and numerous tabular minerals in the bc fe ii as iii system over 21 d which should be assigned to the amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals and lepidocrocite respectively incorporating our previous characterization results i e ftir xrd and tem data and analyses these characteristic minerals underwent negligible changes during aging it is worth noting that the tabular minerals i e lepidocrocite prefer to grow on the surface of the biochar compared with the small particle like minerals i e ferrihydrite fig 5a c in general the slow fe ii oxidation and precipitation rates are in favor of forming high crystalline dense structured fe iii minerals song et al 2015 furthermore the silicate addition can slow the fe ii oxidation rate under near neutral conditions thus resulting in a transition of the fe ii oxidation product from ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite dam et al 2019 therefore the formation of the lepidocrocite on the surface of the biochar can be attributed to the presence of the surface silicon components e g silicate see section 3 3 below can decelerate the fe ii oxidation and precipitation after 14 d however we found new exuviations particularly for the tabular ones from the biochar surface fig 5b this indicates an increasing exposure of the biochar surface to the oxic water solution that potentially triggers the biochar decomposition with the further aging time to 21 d more tabular exuviations as well as the particle like ones were observed on the surface of the biochar fig 5c in contrast our control system without the biochar showed a faster transformation of the amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals to tabular lepidocrocite as indicated by sem analysis fig 5d f overall our characterization results suggest that the presence of the biochar can largely impede the transformation of the ferrihydrite fe as minerals to lepidocrocite and goethite over 21 d it has been well recognized that fe iii oxyhydr oxides generally have decreasing active sites towards as species particularly under acid neutral conditions ferrihydrite lepidocrocite goethite dixit and hering 2003 shi et al 2018 according to this and our results the presence of the biochar should enable our observed minerals i e ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite to retain more solid phase as species and decrease as species liberation considering a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals nevertheless such a hypothesis cannot explain our aquatic chemistry observation that a higher as tot aqueous concentration rebounded in the presence of the biochar fig 1a in addition we evaluated less than 44 8 i e 4 7 10 5 of the as species liberation caused by the transformation of the fe iii minerals in the bc fe ii as iii system considering a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals alternatively more than 55 2 of the as species liberation may be associated with the biochar itself and further investigations are conducted in the following section 3 3 inherent silicon driven arsenic release from iron minerals during aging we further investigated the effect of the rice husk derived biochar itself on the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system during aging silicon si is an essential nutrient for rice growth and is particularly deposited in its leaf straw and husk tissues accordingly the rice husk derived biochar regarded as si rich biochar generally has a considerable si content ranging from 16 1 to 33 4 which highly depends on the preparation conditions e g pyrolysis temperature and residence time wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 a the dissolved silicate concentration increased from 0 to 16 5 mg si l over 21 d this indicates the release dissolution of the surface silicon on the biochar during aging as implied by the newly produced exposure area of the biochar in the sem image fig 5b1 and 5b2 considering the competitive effect between silicate and as oxyanions towards the active sites on fe iii minerals due to their similar molecular structure holm 2002 meng et al 2000 we thus hypothesized that the released silicate may boost the as species liberation from the as bearing fe iii minerals on the biochar to verify this we performed batch experiments with the addition of the same equivalent silicate i e 16 5 mg si l into the fe ii as iii system after 10 d fig 6b depicts that the addition of the silicate in the fe ii as iii system led to the final as tot aqueous concentration up to 12 7 μm i e the sum of as iii aqueous concentration 12 2 μm and as v aqueous concentration 0 5 μm which was close to that 11 8 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system the result confirms that the dissolved silicate from the rice husk derived biochar can significantly result in the as species liberation this can be attributed to ligand exchange of the dissolved silicate with the surface bound see the hcl extractable as species in fig 1a and structural as species see the hcl nonextractable as species in fig 1a and a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals by the as species in the bc fe ii as iii system than that in the bc fe ii system in fig s5 on in the fe iii minerals aside from silicon carbon in the form of om primarily constitutes the rice husk derived biochar particularly under low and middle pyrolysis temperature conditions furthermore pyrolytic dissolved om released from biochar is reported to promote as species liberation from as bearing fe minerals during aging kim et al 2018 to do this we further checked the release of the pyrolytic dissolved om from the rice husk derived biochar with a toc evaluation in the bc fe ii as iii system and the result is shown in fig 6c nevertheless we found that the toc concentration always remained low over 21 d with only 1 5 2 4 mg c l this result suggests negligible surface pyrolytic om on the rice husk derived biochar that contributes to the enhanced as species unlike si poor biomass rice possesses a special cuticle wax silica layer located in its specific tissues including rice leaf and straw in previous studies chen et al proposed that rice straw and rice straw derived biochar had silicon carbon si c interaction structures and their structural evolutions were highly dependent upon pyrolysis temperature wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 moreover our dissolution experiments showed a high silicate concentration but a low toc concentration released from the biochar in the bc fe ii as iii system during aging on the basis of the literature and the observations we therefore hypothesized that the rice husk derived biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c had a si c structure consisting of the outer silicon layer and the inner carbon layer scheme 1 similar to that of the rice straw derived biochar wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 such a structure formation is further supported by a slight difference in the silicate release level regardless of the om removal from the rice husk derived biochar via incineration at 500 c in the air fig 6a for the proposed si c structure on one hand the outer silicon layer particularly for the dissolved silicate can have a good contact with the fe iii fe iii as minerals deposited on the surface of the biochar thus stimulating the as species liberation via ligand exchange during aging the outer silicon layer enables isolation of the om in the inner layer thus minimizing the om s effect on the as species release during aging on the other hand the outer silicon layer plays an important role in impeding the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite in summary we conclude that the outer silicon components on the rice husk derived biochar particularly for the dissolved silicate primarily promote the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system via ligand exchange besides this a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals by the silicon components on the biochar still contributes secondarily to the as species liberation during aging scheme 1 3 4 environmental significance elevated as iii levels predominantly via microbially reductive dissolution of as rich fe iii minerals in relatively steady state reducing aquifers can significantly accumulate to potentially toxic levels however some natural processes ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a and or anthropogenic activities luong et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 can often unbalance the relatively steady state redox conditions by introducing o2 as a response a series of abiotic interactions between the reduced components e g fe ii and as iii and o2 can be initiated thus lowering aqueous as to lower environmental risks to our knowledge engineered black carbon that is released into the environment has been reported to participate in geochemical processes lian and xing 2017 pignatello et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which thus might impact the fate of co existing contaminants e g as we demonstrate that the presence of rice husk derived biochar can significantly aggravate as iii remobilization in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation this is associated with the presence of the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate on the surface of the rice husk derived biochar this work extends our mechanistic understandings of the rice husk derived biochar s impact on the as fate as well as the subsequent transformation of the fe iii minerals in shallow as iii and fe ii rich groundwater our proposed mechanisms can supplement the overall conceptual framework for the as transformation and transport in shallow groundwater particularly in large river basins e g china and south and southeast asia countries in these regions the as contaminated groundwater may be impacted by rice husk derived pyrolytic chars due to intensive natural processes e g water table fluctuation and anthropogenic farming e g rice straw and husk burning into paddy soil this also highlights the significance of the biochar structural features in aggravating as mobility in such groundwater when the oxygenation time lasts several days or even weeks 4 conclusions in this work we report that the environmental impact of the rice husk derived biochar in the as iii and fe ii groundwater during the oxygenation under circumneutral conditions the presence of the biochar could accelerate as iii oxidation and immobilization rates by facilitating the fe ii oxidation and precipitation but had a negligible effect on the as iii oxidation and immobilization levels within 24 h with extending the oxygenation time to 21 d however the presence of the biochar stimulated the enhanced release of the immobilized as iii from the fe iii minerals into solution thus rebounding to a higher as iii concentration the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate on the rice husk derived biochar primarily promoted the as iii release via ligand exchange while a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals induced by the silicon components accounted secondarily our findings provide new insight into the environmental impact of the biochar on the as iii fate and fe iii minerals transformation in groundwater containing as iii and fe ii during the oxygenation this study points out that the introduction of the biochar needs to be paid attention to the as iii im mobilization in redox fluctuation environments such as shallow subsurface systems declaration of

16939,elevated as iii and fe ii in shallow reducing groundwater can be frequently re oxidized by introducing o2 due to natural anthropogenic processes thus leading to oxidative precipitation of as as well as fe nevertheless the geochemical process may be impacted by co existing engineered black carbon due to its considerable applications which remains poorly understood taking rice husk derived biochar prepared at 500 c as an example we explored its impact on the process particularly for the as iii oxidation and im mobilization during the oxygenation the presence of the biochar had a negligible effect on the as iii oxidation and immobilization extents within 1 d while accelerating their rates however the immobilized as iii was significantly liberated from the formed fe iii minerals afterward within 21 d which was 2 2 fold higher than that in the absence of the biochar the enhanced as iii liberation was attributed to the presence of the surface silicon carbon structure consisting of the outer silicon and inner carbon layers of the rice husk derived biochar the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate primarily promoted the as iii release via ligand exchange while significantly impeding the transformation of ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite still resulted secondarily in the as iii release our findings reveal the possible impact of biochar on the environmental behavior and fate of as iii in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation this work highlights that biochar particularly for its structural features should be a concern in re mobilizing as in such scenarios when the oxygenation time reaches several days or weeks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater oxygenation arsenic remobilization iron minerals transformation engineered black carbon aging 1 introduction the naturally occurring high arsenic as in groundwater is relatively widely distributed worldwide and has become a global environmental issue that poses an enormous threat to human health karim 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in particular arsenicosis in bangladesh china vietnam etc remains ongoing with over 100 million of the rural population exposed to unsafe as levels 10 μg l by ingesting untreated groundwater fendorf et al 2010 xie et al 2017 numerous studies on the naturally occurring high as in groundwater have revealed the environmental behavior and fate of as in typically hydrogeologic scenarios e g fe ii rich reducing groundwater harvey et al 2002 islam et al 2004 michael 2013 schaefer et al 2017 wallis et al 2020 for example as one of the most important mechanisms for elevating as concentrations in groundwater microbially reductive dissolution of as bearing iron fe minerals via coupled microbial oxidation of organic matter om prefers to occur in reducing aquifers located in large river basins e g china and south and southeast asia countries michael 2013 schaefer et al 2017 also the microbial reduction of as v to more labile as iii stimulates the as liberation fendorf et al 2010 which is associated with a weakened affinity of as iii towards the fe minerals e g ferrihydrite and goethite particularly under acidic neutral conditions dixit and hering 2003 jain et al 1999 as a consequence considerable as iii and fe ii ions can be collectively released from these minerals into groundwater thus accumulating aqueous as iii to potentially toxic levels despite the microbial reduction process prevails the subsurface systems particularly for shallow unconfined aquifers are frequently disturbed by natural processes e g periodic fluctuations shifts of the water table ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a and or anthropogenic activities e g managed aquifer recharge and alternate wetting drying cycles luong et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 accordingly the subsurface redox conditions may change from reducing to progressively more oxidizing due to the invasion of o2 from surface water and vadose zone which thus may induce a series of new abiotic interactions between reduced components e g fe ii and as iii and o2 luong et al 2018 tong et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a for instance yuan and co workers recently monitored the dynamic h2o2 concentration in an unconfined aquifer with a 14 m water table fluctuation zhang et al 2020a they found that the dynamic h2o2 concentration elevated up to 123 nm at a rising water table stage in summer due to the occurence of the abiotic redox reactions between the reduced components e g fe ii and o2 but was negligible at a stable or falling water table stage in addition to h2o2 the abiotic fe ii oxidation by o2 can produce other reactive oxidizing species ros e g fe iv and oh that enable oxidation of contaminants e g as iii under circumneutral conditions katsoyiannis et al 2008 consequently the co existing as iii in the shallow unconfined aquifers can be re oxidized and re immobilized by coupled o2 induced fe ii oxidative precipitation when the groundwater table elevates this process can significantly lower aqueous as as well as fe concentrations and improve groundwater quality extensive evidence from field and laboratory researches conducted in south and southeast asia has demonstrated that om that is pervasively distributed in reducing aquifers perhaps as a dominant driver of anaerobic microbial reduction significantly elevates groundwater as levels harvey et al 2002 lawson et al 2013 mailloux et al 2013 neumann et al 2010 despite this abiotic om mediated reactions e g complexation competition and redox might exert increasing or even dominant effects in a localized newly oxidized zone of the reducing aquifers where the exotic o2 invades since the anaerobic microbial activities are gradually decreased or even terminated due to the microbes inactivation by ros zhang et al 2020b for instance om can bind as species to produce dissolved colloidal as fe om complexes and or compete with as species for adsorption sites on fe mineral surfaces both of which may enhance the as mobility sharma et al 2010 2011 in addition it can inhibit the as iii oxidation and precipitation during the o2 induced fe ii oxidative precipitation tong et al 2016 conversely highly reactive om is capable of abiotically oxidizing as iii and fe ii garg et al 2013 redman et al 2002 which may trigger their precipitation collectively these abiotic om mediated processes control the as iii oxidation and mobility under oxic conditions up to now there has been a significant body of knowledge regarding the impact of the well recognized om in contrast engineered black carbon perhaps less widespread but increasingly detected in subsurface environments lian and xing 2017 song et al 2002 zhong et al 2020 may be an alternative source of om but its environmental impact is less known biochar as a representative of engineered black carbon has been extensively applied in ground water soil remediation bortone et al 2013 he et al 2019 wei et al 2018 such extensive applications have led to a considerable introduction of biochar into natural environments as exemplified by ca 1 40 of biochar derived organic carbon detected in soils and sediments lian and xing 2017 zhong et al 2020 biochar that has been transported downward aquifers may regulate the as iii oxidation and mobility during the oxygenation incorporating insight from om that shares some similar physicochemical features e g oxygen functional groups and properties e g redox activity redman et al 2002 sharma et al 2011 tong et al 2016 although sharing similar features and properties biochar has much higher heterogeneities of elemental compositions phase components and surface properties as compared with the om xiao et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 as a result biochar is anticipated to exert more complicated impacts on the as iii oxidation and mobility for example niazi et al 2018 reported that perilla leaf derived biochar particles effectively immobilized as species via both surface complexation and precipitation with partial oxidation of as iii to as v however we recently found that rice husk derived biochar negligibly immobilized as species while being capable of oxidizing as iii via multiple pathways which highly depend on water chemistry e g o2 level and solution ph zhong et al 2019 we further revealed that undissolved or dissolved biochar fractions could synergistically immobilize as iii with co existing ca2 via contrasting mechanisms even under anoxic conditions zhong et al 2020 despite the potential significance to date the impact of biochar on the as iii oxidation and mobility in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation has not yet been reported especially for a relatively long term e g several weeks impact therefore this study aims to explore the impact of the biochar from pyrolysis of rice husk on the environmental behaviors and fates of as iii as well as fe ii during the oxygenation by exposing the system to air under circumneutral conditions here we chose the rice husk as the biochar precursor on the basis of 1 rice oryza sativa l is widely cultivated in china bangladesh vietnam etc where arsenicosis occurs xie et al 2017 2 rice processing brings enormous waste rice husk that can be used to produce value added biochar for ground water soil remediation o connor et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 2020 we performed batch experiments combining spectroscopic characterizations and wet chemical analyses to elucidate the mechanistic impact of the biochar on the as iii oxidation and im mobilization our findings can advance the understanding of the rice husk derived biochar s impact on the environmental behaviors and fate of as in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar production and characterization rice husk was collected from a local farm in suizhou city hubei province central china and washed by deionized water 18 2 mω cm followed by air dried at room temperature for several days biochar product was prepared by oxygen limited pyrolysis of the rice husk at 500 c for 1 h according to our recent studies zhong et al 2019 2020 once completion of the pyrolysis the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature and then washed by deionized water several times to remove impurities e g dissolvable biochar fraction following this the washed particles were dried under vacuum condition at 60 c for 24 h and ground to pass through a 0 075 mm sieve the obtained biochar sample was denoted as bc and stored at 4 c in the dark for later use the detailed spectroscopic characterizations including x ray diffraction xrd patterns fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning transmission electron microscopy sem of the samples are described in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 batch oxygenation experiments all batch oxygenation experiments were performed in wide mouth reactors 1000 ml covered with aluminum foil to avoid any photochemical reactions at room temperature 25 1 c each wide mouth reactor contained 500 ml reaction suspension and was completely equilibrated with atmospheric o2 under magnetically stirred conditions for a typical procedure 2 ml of 25 mm as iii stock solution was first added into 500 ml of 20 mm 2 morpholinoethanesulfonic acid mes buffer to create 100 μm as iii working solution and then adjusted to the desired ph value of 6 0 0 1 using 0 1 and or 1 m naoh solution a previous study has noted that mes does not form complexes with fe ii or fe iii under these conditions keenan and sedlak 2008 next 0 5 m fe ii stock solution i e 2 mm in the final reaction system was introduced into the as iii working solution at a fe as molar ratio of 20 that can be found in typical as contaminated groundwater sediments fendorf et al 2010 guo et al 2014 after that 0 5 g of the bc sample i e 1 g

meter germany over the whole oxygenation period reasons for the high concentrations of as iii fe ii and bc beyond environmentally relevant concentrations used in this work are provided in test s2 of si figs s1 and s2 control experiments without the biochar sample were carried out under the same conditions above our batch oxygenation experiments were performed for 21 d since a seasonal ground water table rising that can bring eh elevation due to the introduction of o2 can last tens of days in central china as an example schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a for each sampling ca 4 ml of suspension sample was taken out for pretreatment and subsequent analysis at predetermined time intervals 0 21 d the suspension sample was immediately divided into two subsamples the first subsample was filtered through a 0 45 μm filtration membrane and further divided into two filtrates for as and fe species analyses similarly the unfiltered subsample was divided into two samples and digested by 1 m hcl after 24 h for measuring as and fe species concentrations according to a modified method liao et al 2017 more details on the samples pretreatments can be found in text s3 of si the total as as tot in each phase was acquired from the sum of as iii and as v the fe iii concentration in each phase was obtained by subtracting the fe ii concentration from the fe tot concentration the hcl extractable adsorbed precipitated fractions of as and fe species in the solid phase were calculated from the differences of the two measurements between the unfiltered and filtered samples considering the interference from the background mes buffer for the precise determination of dissolved labile organic carbon with a total organic carbon toc evaluation released from the biochar during aging we performed experiments with an automated ph stat titrator easyplus et 18 mettler toledo switzerland instead of mes that was used to control the system ph at 6 0 0 1 all the experiments were conducted in duplicate at least 2 3 wet chemical analysis the as iii and as v concentrations were measured by a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs sa7800 beijing bohui innovation

found in our recent studies zhong et al 2019 2020 the fe ii and fe tot concentrations were measured by a modified 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method with lod of 0 03 mg l liao et al 2017 the

0 relative standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of biochar on arsenic mobility during oxygenation 3 1 1 short time effect of biochar fig 1 a and 1b shows dynamic changes in the as species concentrations in the bc fe ii as iii and fe ii as iii systems during the oxygenation within 24 h or 1 d respectively with two characteristic stages based on the changes in the as tot aqueous concentration stage i i e 0 12 h vs 0 5 h and stage ii i e 12 24 h vs 5 24 h at stage i in the presence of the biochar the as iii aqueous concentration dropped sharply from 100 to 12 0 μm within the first 1 h and further decreased to a minimum value of 0 4 μm within 5 h and kept stable hereafter fig 1a in contrast our control experimental results without the biochar showed that the as iii aqueous concentration just decreased from 100 to 51 3 μm within the first 1 h and then to below as iii detection limit i e 0 002 μm within 5 h fig 1b this indicates that the presence of the biochar can accelerate the as iii removal it has been well recognized that fe ii or biochar can activate o2 to produce ros e g fe iv and or oh under circumneutral conditions thus leading to oxidation of as iii to as v katsoyiannis et al 2008 tong et al 2016 zhong et al 2019 accordingly we first tracked as v aqueous concentration as a function of the reaction time in both systems in line with these previous studies we observed the newly produced as v in solution regardless of the biochar presence specifically in the presence of the biochar the newly produced as v aqueous concentration elevated to a peak value of 11 6 μm within the first 1 h but then dropped to a minimum value of 0 9 μm within 12 h fig 1a by comparison the as v aqueous concentration just increased to a maximum value of 6 3 μm within the first 1 h but decreased to below as v detection limit i e 0 004 μm afterward within 5 h in the absence of the biochar fig 1b this comparison suggests that the presence of the biochar can induce a higher accumulative as v concentration in solution in this regard we attribute to a higher adsorbed fe ii concentration by the biochar instead of the biochar itself can activate o2 to produce a higher accumulative ros concentration for the as iii oxidation because of a lower reduction potential of the adsorbed fe ii compared with the aqueous one gorski et al 2016 this conclusion is further supported by both accelerated fe ii oxidation to fe iii in the presence of the biochar fig 1c and little as iii oxidation to as v at the limited time scale e g 12 h in the bc as iii system fig s3 for the as tot aqueous concentration in both systems it exhibited a monotonical decrease trend i e from 100 to a minimum value of 1 3 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system vs from 100 to 0 in the fe ii as iii system at stage i the results indicate that the biochar does not exert a positive effect on the as tot immobilization extent which is consistent with the negligible as tot immobilization in the bc as iii system fig s3 zhong et al 2019 instead the presence of the biochar slightly impeded the as species immobilization indicating a higher as risk also we observed a similar phenomenon in the bc fe ii as iii system with the low fe ii and as iii concentrations fig s2 in addition the presence of the biochar initially accelerated and then retarded the as tot immobilization rate these observations can be explained by the following reasons 1 at the initial stage i the biochar provides heterogeneous adsorption sites for free fe ii ions and then accelerates the adsorbed fe ii oxidation by o2 to form fe iii minerals see a larger fe ii oxidation rate from fig 1c the newly produced fe iii minerals in turn create new adsorption sites for the as species to promote their immobilization 2 at the middle and late stage i however the newly produced adsorption sites on the fe iii minerals that can immobilize the as species are increasingly occupied by the biochar e g its inherent components see a smaller slope from fig 2 c resulting in a slightly lower as tot immobilization extent subsequently we checked the change of the immobilized as species to further elucidate the effect of the biochar on the as iii oxidative precipitation at stage i in the presence of the biochar the as iii solid phase concentration first increased to a maximum value of 41 2 μm within the first 1 h but then decreased to 30 μm within 12 h fig 1a meanwhile the as v solid phase concentration monotonically increased to 68 9 μm within 12 h in the absence of the biochar however the as iii solid phase and as v solid phase concentrations just monotonically increased to 23 0 and 66 0 μm within 5 h at stage i respectively fig 1b a noteworthy point is only 89 0 of the as species extraction efficiency in the fe ii as iii system due to the formation of the more stable fe iii minerals e g crystalline lepidocrocite see section 3 1 2 and 3 2 this result indicates that a small amount of the as species cannot be extracted in the fe ii as iii system despite the incomplete extraction the extractable as v solid phase concentration i e 66 0 μm in the fe ii as iii system was comparable to that i e 68 9 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system this implies that the biochar plays a negligible role in the as iii oxidation extent during the process as verified by both a good correlation between the fe ii oxidation and as iii oxidation r 0 981 fig 2a and little as iii oxidation to as v in the bc as iii system fig s3 in agreement with previous studies katsoyiannis et al 2008 roberts et al 2004 there is an incomplete as iii oxidation regardless of the biochar presence this is because the consumption of the ros by a considerable amount of fe ii and or biochar which is confirmed by the far smaller ratio i e 34 8 1 and 17 5 1 μm mm of the as iii oxidation to fe ii oxidation than the theoretical ratio i e 500 1 μm mm fig 2a and 2b when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h the as species concentrations remained stable at stage ii for both systems fig 1a and 1b indicating that both systems undergo a relatively stable stage it has been recognized that the as iii oxidation and immobilization are highly dependent upon the oxidative precipitation of fe ii roberts et al 2004 tong et al 2014 xie et al 2017 thus we evaluated the fe species in both systems and the results are illustrated in fig 1c and 1d in the presence of the biochar the fe ii aqueous concentration dropped from 2 0 to 1 4 mm within the first 1 h subsequently to 0 1 mm within 5 h and ultimately to below fe ii detection limit i e 0 5 μm within 8 h fig 1c after that the fe ii aqueous concentration proceeded until 24 h also an identical trend was observed for the change in the fe tot aqueous concentration this indicates that the newly produced fe iii aqueous fails to be detected which is ascribed to its immediate precipitation adsorption at our experimental ph 6 0 fig s4 in contrast in the absence of the biochar the fe ii aqueous concentration just decreased from 2 0 to 1 8 mm within the initial 1 h then to 0 5 mm within 5 h and finally to below fe ii detection limit within 24 h fig 1d interestingly there was a good correlation between the fe tot precipitation and as tot immobilization within 5 h r 0 963 vs r 0 988 regardless of the presence of the biochar fig 2c and 2d this suggests that the fe species minerals but not the biochar are responsible for the as species immobilization in the bc fe ii as iii system which agrees with our previous observations figs 1a and s3 we further calculated that per mm fe tot could immobilize approximately 18 4 μm as tot in the presence of the biochar which was about 2 5 fold lower than that 46 9 μm in the absence of the biochar fig 2c and 2d the result suggests that the presence of the biochar is detrimental to the as tot immobilization by the fe species minerals supporting our previous result fig 1a in the solid phase the hcl extractable fe iii concentration elevated to 1 8 mm within 24 h in the bc fe ii as iii system whereas just increasing to 1 6 mm in the fe ii as iii system the results indicate the formation of more stable fe iii minerals in the absence of the biochar which is attributed to the slower fe ii oxidation and precipitation rates that prefer to form dense structured fe iii minerals fig 1d song et al 2015 in both systems we found no fe ii solid phase because of its immediate oxidation by o2 gorski et al 2016 to summarize the presence of the biochar can accelerate the as iii oxidation and immobilization rates by promoting the fe ii oxidation and precipitation but negligibly impact the as iii oxidation and immobilization extents 3 1 2 long time effect of biochar fig 1a shows that the as tot aqueous concentration rebounded from 1 3 to 11 8 μm at stage iii i e 1 21 d in the bc fe ii as iii system with a net increase of 10 5 μm which was 2 2 fold higher than that 4 7 μm in the fe ii as iii system fig 1b moreover the liberated as tot aqueous almost existed in the form of as iii aqueous i e 11 0 vs 4 2 μm with a slight as v aqueous i e 0 8 vs 0 5 μm in both systems the results suggest that the presence of the biochar can largely aggravate the as species mobility particularly for as iii during aging there are three possible mechanisms contributing to the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system 1 microbial reduction of as v to as iii and fe iii minerals reductive dissolution in the co presence of biochar and reducing bacteria 2 transformation of the fe iii minerals 3 competition of inherent components within the biochar with as species we first excluded the participation of the microbial reduction of as v to as iii and the fe iii minerals reductive dissolution for the biochar enhanced as species release based on our abiotic oxygenation conditions and the absence of the aqueous fe ii fig 1c fig 1a and 1c shows that both hcl extractable as tot and fe tot concentrations decreased from 100 to 80 4 μm and from 2 0 to 1 5 mm over 21 d in the presence of the biochar respectively the hcl extractable results indicate the transformation of the fresh fe iii minerals to more stable ones which contributes to the as species release via loss of the fe based active sites during aging in contrast our control system always had the lower hcl extractable as tot from 100 to 56 1 μm and fe tot concentrations from 2 0 to 1 4 mm over 21 d fig 1b and 1d the comparisons suggest the formation of more metastable fe iii minerals in the presence of the biochar it has been well recognized that transformation of fresh metastable fe iii minerals more precisely fe iii oxyhydr oxides to more stable ones with an increasing size but the decreasing surface area and adsorption sites thus liberating the already immobilized as species from the fresh fe iii oxyhydr oxides senn et al 2018 shi et al 2018 in other words more metastable fe iii minerals can retain capture a larger amount of as species to decrease their aqueous concentrations however this is contrary to our observation that there was a higher as species liberation in the presence of the biochar on the basis of these results and discussion we suggest that the enhanced as species liberation in the bc fe ii as iii system may be controlled by the fe iii mineralogical transformation and competitive interactions of inherent components within biochar 3 2 effect of iron minerals transformation on arsenic release during aging fig 3 a presents xrd patterns of the samples collected from the bc fe ii as iii system at the predetermined times in the presence of the biochar we only observed lepidocrocite over 21 d and there was a negligible crystallization growth of the lepidocrocite fig 3a similarly in the absence of the biochar the oxidative precipitation of fe ii led to the lepidocrocite generation over 21 d but with a slight increase in the xrd peak intensity of the lepidocrocite fig 3b this suggests that the lepidocrocite undergoes an increasing crystallization with aging furthermore new xrd patterns caused by goethite were found after 21 d fig 3b indicating that the lepidocrocite transforms into more stable goethite by comparing the xrd patterns we suggest that the presence of the biochar has no effect on the type of the nascent fe iii minerals e g lepidocrocite but can largely impede the transformation of these fe iii minerals which coincides with our previous hcl extractable observation fig 1 ftir spectroscopy was applied to further identify types of fe iii minerals and check their changes of amorphous minerals e g ferrihydrite for the samples collected from the bc fe ii as iii system the characteristic peaks appeared at 3207 and 554 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh and fe o in the ferrihydrite respectively an et al 2017 han et al 2016 song et al 2015 fig 3c the characteristic peak at 746 cm 1 represents the out plane bending vibration of oh in the lepidocrocite hug and leupin 2003 kinsela et al 2016 song et al 2015 it is important to note that all these characteristic peaks undergo negligible changes in the intensities and positions over 21 d these results indicate the formation of the ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite and their negligible transformations in the presence of the biochar during aging in addition we observed some characteristic peaks correlated with the biochar derived functional groups e g c o at 1706 cm 1 c c at 1618 cm 1 and co c at 1101 cm 1 zhong et al 2019 that had negligible or even no changes over 21 d this implies that the biochar has a relatively stable carbon based structure likewise we identified the same fe iii minerals i e ferrihydrite at 3205 and 548 cm 1 and lepidocrocite at 1157 1024 748 and 479 cm 1 in the fe ii as iii system over 21 d hug and leupin 2003 kinsela et al 2016 song et al 2015 fig 3d furthermore the intensity of the characteristic peak at 1157 cm 1 increased after 21 d indicating the lepidocrocite growth during aging a small peak at 817 cm 1 is correlated with the stretching vibration of as oh or fe o as in the formed as bearing fe iii minerals song et al 2015 more importantly we found two new characteristic peaks at 1728 and 503 cm 1 associated with the presence of the goethite song et al 2015 when the reaction time was prolonged to 14 or 21 d these changes in the characteristic peaks indicate the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite in the absence of the biochar over 21 d to visualize the morphologies of the fe iii minerals tem and sem characterizations were conducted on the selected samples collected from the two systems after 1 14 and 21 d fig 4 a c depicts that many amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals and needle like lepidocrocite were observed in the presence of the biochar over 21 d furthermore the needle like lepidocrocite was more and larger slightly with aging particularly after 21 d indicating a slow transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite in contrast in the absence of the biochar the needle like lepidocrocite was enlarged in size to a larger extent especially after 21 d during aging while the same fe iii minerals were present fig 4d f this comparison suggests that the presence of the biochar can significantly inhibit the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and further crystallization of the lepidocrocite from the sem images in fig 5 a c we observed a small amount of the particle like minerals and numerous tabular minerals in the bc fe ii as iii system over 21 d which should be assigned to the amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals and lepidocrocite respectively incorporating our previous characterization results i e ftir xrd and tem data and analyses these characteristic minerals underwent negligible changes during aging it is worth noting that the tabular minerals i e lepidocrocite prefer to grow on the surface of the biochar compared with the small particle like minerals i e ferrihydrite fig 5a c in general the slow fe ii oxidation and precipitation rates are in favor of forming high crystalline dense structured fe iii minerals song et al 2015 furthermore the silicate addition can slow the fe ii oxidation rate under near neutral conditions thus resulting in a transition of the fe ii oxidation product from ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite dam et al 2019 therefore the formation of the lepidocrocite on the surface of the biochar can be attributed to the presence of the surface silicon components e g silicate see section 3 3 below can decelerate the fe ii oxidation and precipitation after 14 d however we found new exuviations particularly for the tabular ones from the biochar surface fig 5b this indicates an increasing exposure of the biochar surface to the oxic water solution that potentially triggers the biochar decomposition with the further aging time to 21 d more tabular exuviations as well as the particle like ones were observed on the surface of the biochar fig 5c in contrast our control system without the biochar showed a faster transformation of the amorphous ferrihydrite fe as minerals to tabular lepidocrocite as indicated by sem analysis fig 5d f overall our characterization results suggest that the presence of the biochar can largely impede the transformation of the ferrihydrite fe as minerals to lepidocrocite and goethite over 21 d it has been well recognized that fe iii oxyhydr oxides generally have decreasing active sites towards as species particularly under acid neutral conditions ferrihydrite lepidocrocite goethite dixit and hering 2003 shi et al 2018 according to this and our results the presence of the biochar should enable our observed minerals i e ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite to retain more solid phase as species and decrease as species liberation considering a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals nevertheless such a hypothesis cannot explain our aquatic chemistry observation that a higher as tot aqueous concentration rebounded in the presence of the biochar fig 1a in addition we evaluated less than 44 8 i e 4 7 10 5 of the as species liberation caused by the transformation of the fe iii minerals in the bc fe ii as iii system considering a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals alternatively more than 55 2 of the as species liberation may be associated with the biochar itself and further investigations are conducted in the following section 3 3 inherent silicon driven arsenic release from iron minerals during aging we further investigated the effect of the rice husk derived biochar itself on the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system during aging silicon si is an essential nutrient for rice growth and is particularly deposited in its leaf straw and husk tissues accordingly the rice husk derived biochar regarded as si rich biochar generally has a considerable si content ranging from 16 1 to 33 4 which highly depends on the preparation conditions e g pyrolysis temperature and residence time wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 a the dissolved silicate concentration increased from 0 to 16 5 mg si l over 21 d this indicates the release dissolution of the surface silicon on the biochar during aging as implied by the newly produced exposure area of the biochar in the sem image fig 5b1 and 5b2 considering the competitive effect between silicate and as oxyanions towards the active sites on fe iii minerals due to their similar molecular structure holm 2002 meng et al 2000 we thus hypothesized that the released silicate may boost the as species liberation from the as bearing fe iii minerals on the biochar to verify this we performed batch experiments with the addition of the same equivalent silicate i e 16 5 mg si l into the fe ii as iii system after 10 d fig 6b depicts that the addition of the silicate in the fe ii as iii system led to the final as tot aqueous concentration up to 12 7 μm i e the sum of as iii aqueous concentration 12 2 μm and as v aqueous concentration 0 5 μm which was close to that 11 8 μm in the bc fe ii as iii system the result confirms that the dissolved silicate from the rice husk derived biochar can significantly result in the as species liberation this can be attributed to ligand exchange of the dissolved silicate with the surface bound see the hcl extractable as species in fig 1a and structural as species see the hcl nonextractable as species in fig 1a and a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals by the as species in the bc fe ii as iii system than that in the bc fe ii system in fig s5 on in the fe iii minerals aside from silicon carbon in the form of om primarily constitutes the rice husk derived biochar particularly under low and middle pyrolysis temperature conditions furthermore pyrolytic dissolved om released from biochar is reported to promote as species liberation from as bearing fe minerals during aging kim et al 2018 to do this we further checked the release of the pyrolytic dissolved om from the rice husk derived biochar with a toc evaluation in the bc fe ii as iii system and the result is shown in fig 6c nevertheless we found that the toc concentration always remained low over 21 d with only 1 5 2 4 mg c l this result suggests negligible surface pyrolytic om on the rice husk derived biochar that contributes to the enhanced as species unlike si poor biomass rice possesses a special cuticle wax silica layer located in its specific tissues including rice leaf and straw in previous studies chen et al proposed that rice straw and rice straw derived biochar had silicon carbon si c interaction structures and their structural evolutions were highly dependent upon pyrolysis temperature wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 moreover our dissolution experiments showed a high silicate concentration but a low toc concentration released from the biochar in the bc fe ii as iii system during aging on the basis of the literature and the observations we therefore hypothesized that the rice husk derived biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c had a si c structure consisting of the outer silicon layer and the inner carbon layer scheme 1 similar to that of the rice straw derived biochar wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 such a structure formation is further supported by a slight difference in the silicate release level regardless of the om removal from the rice husk derived biochar via incineration at 500 c in the air fig 6a for the proposed si c structure on one hand the outer silicon layer particularly for the dissolved silicate can have a good contact with the fe iii fe iii as minerals deposited on the surface of the biochar thus stimulating the as species liberation via ligand exchange during aging the outer silicon layer enables isolation of the om in the inner layer thus minimizing the om s effect on the as species release during aging on the other hand the outer silicon layer plays an important role in impeding the transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite in summary we conclude that the outer silicon components on the rice husk derived biochar particularly for the dissolved silicate primarily promote the as species release in the bc fe ii as iii system via ligand exchange besides this a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals by the silicon components on the biochar still contributes secondarily to the as species liberation during aging scheme 1 3 4 environmental significance elevated as iii levels predominantly via microbially reductive dissolution of as rich fe iii minerals in relatively steady state reducing aquifers can significantly accumulate to potentially toxic levels however some natural processes ramesh kumar and riyazuddin 2012 schaefer et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a and or anthropogenic activities luong et al 2018 prommer et al 2018 can often unbalance the relatively steady state redox conditions by introducing o2 as a response a series of abiotic interactions between the reduced components e g fe ii and as iii and o2 can be initiated thus lowering aqueous as to lower environmental risks to our knowledge engineered black carbon that is released into the environment has been reported to participate in geochemical processes lian and xing 2017 pignatello et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which thus might impact the fate of co existing contaminants e g as we demonstrate that the presence of rice husk derived biochar can significantly aggravate as iii remobilization in the fe ii rich groundwater during the oxygenation this is associated with the presence of the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate on the surface of the rice husk derived biochar this work extends our mechanistic understandings of the rice husk derived biochar s impact on the as fate as well as the subsequent transformation of the fe iii minerals in shallow as iii and fe ii rich groundwater our proposed mechanisms can supplement the overall conceptual framework for the as transformation and transport in shallow groundwater particularly in large river basins e g china and south and southeast asia countries in these regions the as contaminated groundwater may be impacted by rice husk derived pyrolytic chars due to intensive natural processes e g water table fluctuation and anthropogenic farming e g rice straw and husk burning into paddy soil this also highlights the significance of the biochar structural features in aggravating as mobility in such groundwater when the oxygenation time lasts several days or even weeks 4 conclusions in this work we report that the environmental impact of the rice husk derived biochar in the as iii and fe ii groundwater during the oxygenation under circumneutral conditions the presence of the biochar could accelerate as iii oxidation and immobilization rates by facilitating the fe ii oxidation and precipitation but had a negligible effect on the as iii oxidation and immobilization levels within 24 h with extending the oxygenation time to 21 d however the presence of the biochar stimulated the enhanced release of the immobilized as iii from the fe iii minerals into solution thus rebounding to a higher as iii concentration the outer silicon components particularly for the dissolved silicate on the rice husk derived biochar primarily promoted the as iii release via ligand exchange while a slower transformation of the fe iii minerals induced by the silicon components accounted secondarily our findings provide new insight into the environmental impact of the biochar on the as iii fate and fe iii minerals transformation in groundwater containing as iii and fe ii during the oxygenation this study points out that the introduction of the biochar needs to be paid attention to the as iii im mobilization in redox fluctuation environments such as shallow subsurface systems declaration of
