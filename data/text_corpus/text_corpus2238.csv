11190,one of the most vital parameters for the robust crop growth models performance is the crops root growth pattern however its reference measurement methods are laborious destructive and costly in this paper we determined the root growth pattern of cotton gossypium hirsutum in the 50 to 100 cm top soil layer using soil water content measurements from the cotton cultivating seasons of 2015 and 2016 in northern greece the estimated root growth pattern along with canopy cover biomass soil water content and final seed cotton yield measurements were then used to evaluate the capability of the fao aquacrop model to simulate a deficit irrigated cotton cultivated under real farming conditions to do so a number of existing cotton crop files from the literature were tested the results showed that the estimated root growth patterns were almost the same in 2015 and 2016 exhibiting root growing rates equal to 1 7 and 2 cm d respectively when the model was run in growing degree days mode it simulated root growth pattern canopy cover biomass and soil water content with fair accuracy for all the proposed crop files r2 0 93 modeling efficiency 0 91 but the seed cotton yield was simulated adequately only when the aquacrop s library file was used in calendar days mode the model failed to simulate root growth pattern satisfactorily but the simulation of canopy cover biomass and soil water content was fair r2 0 75 model efficiency 0 72 lastly the seed cotton yield in the calendar days mode was once again simulated accurately only when the model s default crop file was used keywords crop growth model canopy cover growing degree days dry biomass seed cotton yield 1 introduction presently there is a timeless need for farmers and agronomists to take a series of crucial actions decisions such as the choice of crop s optimum sowing planting date rauff and bello 2015 the creation of an irrigation schedule ensuring increased water productivity linker et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2018 the optimization of fertilization practices and the assessment of climate change impacts on crops yield voloudakis et al 2015 uncertainty in such decisions introduced the necessity for the development and continuous improvement of agricultural systems modeling this necessity led researchers to devise and propose a variety of crop growth models ranging from conceptual over mechanistic to stochastic rauff and bello 2015 from the early de wit s et al 1970 elementary crop growth simulator elcros which was based on the modeling of canopies photosynthetic rates nowadays there is an abundance of recently developed crop growth models such as aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 apex gassman et al 2009 mohid land simionesei et al 2016 daisy hansen et al 1991 simetaw mancosu et al 2015 etc these models are capable of simulating the soil water dynamics the soil plant nitrogen balance the aboveground crop biomass accumulation the roots growth pattern the final crop yield and other agronomic parameters with satisfactory accuracy for a variety of crops ahmadi et al 2015 battilani et al 2014 hansen et al 1991 paredes et al 2014 svendsen et al 1995 tsakmakis et al 2017 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 despite their similarities these models are built with different level of complexity philosophy input requirements as well as processes and cycles they simulate for instance aquacrop does not simulate the soil plant nitrogen balance while daisy does on the other hand the former incorporates the most novel concept of crop water productivity wp to convert the estimated crop transpiration to final crop yield steduto et al 2007 while the latter a mechanistic simulation combining the aspects of photosynthesis and respiration abrahamsen and hansen 2000 hansen et al 1991 a fundamental general assumption in crop growth modeling is that the agricultural atmosphere soil plant system can be represented as a one dimensional model abrahamsen and hansen 2000 in this approach the plant roots are represented by a single root which is assumed to be a line sink with uniform radius taylor and klepper 1975 in these early works the line sink root concept is considered to have an infinite length and uniform water and nutrients absorption properties on the other hand in the modern crop growth modeling e g aquacrop daisy a root growth rate and a maximum root depth should be imported by the user thus the infinite length assumption appears outdated moreover aiming to integrate the potential differences in the plant s root density with depth an option to define different absorption rates for separate root depth layers is implemented in some of the models nevertheless despite the overall robust crop growth models performance their validation framework is still rudimentary rauff and bello 2015 as except for a few parameters that are measured in the real field and compared to the simulations an additional substantial number of parameters should be defined through the trial and error approach in some extend this is attributed to the fact that while extensive measurements on the aboveground plants growth and development are relatively easy the root growth pattern within the soil profile is very difficult to determine coring and excavation stands as the traditional reference techniques for plants root measurement but they are laborious destructive and costly even though instruments like minirhizotrone mainiero 2006 rewald and ephrath 2013 taylor 1987 have been devised to simplify the measuring process their use and research reports are still limited alternatively researchers proposed that under limited water supply limited irrigation or rainfed conditions the maximum roots depth and roots downward penetration rate can be estimated through the soil water extraction patterns dardanelli et al 1997 gregory et al 1978 klepper 1991 monteith 1986 robertson et al 1993 according to this concept when the roots reach a certain layer and start to extract water the initial soil water content θ begins to drop exponentially passioura 1983 robertson et al 1993 monteith 1986 proposed that the roots downward growth rate can be estimated by plotting the time after emergence at which θ starts to decline exponentially below its initial constant value θa against depth there are two main publications in literature referring to the calibration and validation process for cotton gossypium hirsutum crop file in aquacrop model garcía vila et al 2009 farahani et al 2009 during these experiments researchers calibrated the crop file using results from one year s field experiment conducted under full irrigation strategy and then validated by applying it to at least two other data sets of different cultivation years and deficit irrigation schedules in both works the model s cotton crop file was validated in terms of green canopy cover cc dry aboveground biomass db soil water content balance swc evapotranspiration et and final seed cotton yield considering the potential differences on cotton crop files found in the literature the present study aims to evaluate aquacrop s performance using the different parameterization approaches including the model s default one under deficit irrigation schedules in this regard the different parameterizations are analyzed relative to cc db swc and seed cotton yield using calendar days cd and growing degree days gdd model modes moreover in addition to the abovementioned standard evaluation parameters the root growth pattern rgp estimated through the soil water extraction patterns is introduced as an additional model evaluation parameter 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data the data used in this paper were obtained from an extensive experiment carried out during the figaro project in a field located at the plain of xanthi province in northern greece 41 046 n 24 892 e 13 m altitude tsakmakis et al 2017 a side rectangle experimental plot covering an area of 3 3 ha 16 5 m width 200 m length was set in the field during 2015 and 2016 cultivation seasons may to september and treated uniformly throughout in terms of irrigation fertigation and field management practices within the plot three measuring stations replicates were established and cc db and swc measurements were conducted on them stations were placed in the center of the plot approximately 7 m away from left and right sides with 50 m distance from the plot top down sides and between them the cc was determined by taking photos of 1 m2 of field surface vertically from roughly 1 5 m height aboveground and then process them via photoshop and gimp software parallel to cc measurements cotton plants were cut during different growth cycle stages including harvest day transferred to the laboratory where they were further separated in fractions and placed in an oven at 65 c until constant weight for db determination on each of the three measuring stations one pvc tube was installed shortly after the sowing and the swc was measured through them with sentek s diviner 2000 gauge evett and steiner 1995 the instrument consisted of a metal rod with a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance sensor mounted on its lower end from its upper end and through a plug in the rod is connected via a cable to a data logger unit the rod was inserted through its lower end to the installed to the field pvc tubes and measured the swc in 10 cm intervals as it was descended and ascended from the tube up to 1 m depth the measurements were recorded to the data logger and successively transferred to a personal computer in accordance to the local farmer practices the field was plowed with a moldboard down to 30 35 cm depth in early march and then a week before sowing it was treated with disc harrows for bed preparation cotton pioneer hi bred st402 variety seeds were sowed on 11th of may in 2015 and 19th of april in 2016 the space between cotton plant rows was 0 9 m whilst the mean plant density for both years was roughly 12 plants per meter within the first week of july the space between the cotton rows was tilled with cultivator machinery to remove the weeds from the field in both seasons when the plants reached 0 50 cm height 500 ml ha of the plant growth regulator pix was applied followed by two applications of 500 ml ha each with a 10 days interval from the first application and between them additionally in the first week of october 2015 and last week of september 2016 300 g ha of ethephon plant growth regulator was sprayed to cotton plants combined with a defoliate spray cotton was harvested on oct 20 2015 and oct 3 2016 air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction solar radiation rs and rainfall height were measured during the experiment by a meteorological station installed on the field the reference daily evapotranspiration et0 was then calculated with fao s et0 calculator fao 2009 monthly maximum and minimum air temperature as well as rainfall depth for 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 1 in 2015 and until mid july irrigation was performed with a sprinkler irrigation system consisting of a single large nozzle that operates under pressure rotates and is self propelled while for the rest of the season a normal drip line system was installed on the field in 2016 only the gun sprinkler system was used the applied amounts of water were measured with a hydrometer placed to the drilling s pumping system and considered to be equal to the net amounts applied on the field the irrigation scheduling was based on the precision irrigation algorithm proposed by tsakmakis et al 2017 however limitations to the available drilling water in 2016 resulted in the partial implementation of the initial irrigation schedule and the application of just 184 mm of water the implemented irrigation schedules are presented in table 1 soil samples were collected from the depths of 30 60 80 and 100 cm at various sites within the field the textural analysis bouyoucos 1962 showed that the upper 30 cm was characterized as a sandy clay loam horizon according to the usda classification 52 4 sand 23 2 silt 24 4 clay while from 30 cm down to 100 cm the soil was characterized as clay 32 sand 22 silt 46 clay the organic matter content was found to be 1 2 and 0 7 in the upper and lower layers respectively the textural and organic matter info were inserted to spaw saxton and rawls 2006 and rosetta schaap et al 2001 models and soil saturation field capacity permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were estimated a representative bulk soil profile of the obtained soil s hydraulic properties is presented in table 2 despite the fact that no soil samples were taken below the depth of 100 cm a hypothesis was made that the soil structure and hydraulic properties remained the same until the depth of 150 cm a soil analysis for the determination of the optimum required amounts of n p and k was carried out for both years in march in bulk soil samples collected from surface to 50 cm depth the results showed that the required amounts for the optimum plant growth were 150 20 and 80 kg ha n p k respectively however aiming to eliminate any potential impact of fertigation in the cotton plants growth an over fertigation program was followed in both seasons 300 kg ha of 30 10 5 n p k and 250 kg ha 0 0 30 n p k granular fertilizers were applied into the field during sowing basic fertigation followed up by two batches of 100 kg ha 33 5 n 16 5 nh4 n 17 no3 n fertigation applying in total 157 30 and 90 kg ha n p k respectively the first n batch was implemented when the first squares started to form and the second when the first cotton bolls were observed 2 2 root growth pattern estimation the rgp was determined for the soil layer between 50 and 100 cm depth the first 40 cm of soil were excluded from the process for three main reasons a the effect of evaporation in the upper soil layer b the impact of irrigated water in the swc measurements of this layer and c the potential diffusion of water towards surface due to the increasing water deficit monteith 1986 the swc measurements of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm soil layers at each measuring station and year were plotted against time then an exponential curve passioura 1983 was fitted to measurements describing the decline in soil water content to do so initially the non linear regression fit for all datasets was applied and the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated successively the non linear regression run for all the dataset but the first measurement then for all dataset but the first two measurements etc until a r2 above 0 9 was achieved the date that the water extraction started first point of the exponential curve was considered to be the time that cotton roots reached this layer dardanelli et al 1997 monteith 1986 continuously the dates after emergence dae that signaled the arrival of the roots start of swc decline at each soil layer were plotted against depth and the rgp of each tube for 2015 and 2016 were obtained lastly a linear regression was fitted to the data describing the root growth pattern of each year allowing the calculation of the root growth rates curve s slope a soil sampling campaign conducted with a hand operated auger few days after the beginning of senescence period showed that the cotton roots were present down to the depth of 1 15 m and 1 1 m in 2015 and 2016 respectively these depths were considered to be the maximum root depths for each season as there is literature evidence that the cotton root elongation is slowed once the maximum cc is achieved and the boll ripening started and halted at the beginning of canopy senescence coelho et al 2000 taylor and klepper 1974 an extrapolation based on the root growth rates obtained from the linear regression was performed till dae 88 in 2015 and dae 89 in 2016 and the dates that the maximum root depth was reached in each year were estimated the dae used as extrapolation ending dates was the time that signaled the beginning of senescence in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 aquacrop model description aquacrop v 5 0 calculates growth from evapotranspiration and the model incorporates four main subroutines a the soil water balance subroutine swc b the crop growth cycle subroutine cc db rgp yield c the atmosphere subroutine rainfall evapotranspiration co2 concentration gdd and d the management subroutine irrigation technology irrigation schedule mulching soil bunds moreover during the calculation process the model uses water stress fertility stress and salinity stress functions to integrate the impact of these adverse conditions to the cc development root expansion db accumulation and in particular to the final crop yield water stress function is further divided to leaf expansion stomatal closure and early senescence sub functions these sub functions are triggered successively as the total available water in the root zone keeps dropping and some critical limits are reached lastly the root zone expansion stress is activated in parallel with the stomatal closure stress meaning that the model incorporates the same water threshold for both stresses the root expansion stress becomes increasingly severe as the available water in the rootzone keeps dropping until permanent wilting point is reached and the root development is halted the dual crop coefficient concept allen et al 1998 is incorporated by aquacrop and the actual crop s transpiration is calculated as 1 t r c a d j k s c c k c t r x e t 0 where ks is the dimensionless soil water stress coefficient equal to 1 when the soil is at field capacity and 0 at permanent wilting point cc is the canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects kctr x is the maximum crop transpiration coefficient mm and et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm the db accumulation is calculated in daily basis as 2 d b w p i 1 n t r c a d j e t 0 where db is the daily increase of aboveground dry biomass in day after sowing das tn ha d and wp is the crop s water productivity adjusted for atmospheric co2 concentration and climate g m2 lastly the crop s yield is derived as 3 y h i b where y is the crop production tn ha and hi is the harvest index a deficit irrigation strategy may substantially enhance the water productivity of cotton fereres and soriano 2007 in aquacrop this aspect is integrated with three intuitive parameters a the positive water stress impact on the hi when applied before flowering b the potentially positive effect of water stress on leaf expansion and in turn on hi during yield formation and c the potentially adverse effect of water stress induced stomatal closure on hi during yield formation thus a decrease in db production due to a deficit irrigation schedule may be compensated by an increase in hi resulting in increased water productivity 2 4 parameterization of cotton crop parameters and model validation the parameters required as inputs in the aquacrop s crop file may be separated into two distinct categories ahmadi et al 2015 raes et al 2009 paredes et al 2014 a the non conservative parameters taking values that could vary significantly from year to year around the globe or between different varieties and b the conservative parameters with values that change marginally in time and place the values of non conservative parameters should be observed measured in the field while the values of the conservative parameters are mainly determined through the trial and error approach table 3 in this study the values of non conservative parameters were obtained from the field observations of 2015 and 2016 cotton cultivation seasons the time period from cotton sowing to emergence was found to be 9 and 30 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively additionally the corresponding das needed for maximum canopy cover senescence and maturity development stages were 86 99 160 in 2015 and 103 118 170 in 2016 maximum root depth was estimated to 1 15 m in 2015 and 1 1 m in 2016 reached roughly in 99 and 112 das respectively the minimum effective rooting depth was set to 0 1 m flowering triggered 63 and 81 das in 2015 and 2016 while it s duration lasted almost 40 days in both years the gdd needed for each cotton growing stage was calculated based on 2015 season s observations and measurements the base temperature used for the calculations was 15 c kerby et al 1987 it was found that 70 675 853 and 1 273 gdd c were needed for emergence max canopy senescence and maturity growing stages respectively it is noteworthy to mention that the duration of the growing stages reported in this paper included the use of the two cotton plant growth regulators which are widely used by the farmers in the area the first one pix was used to halt the vegetative growth in the end of july while the second one ethephon was used some weeks before harvest to promote cotton maturity taking into account that cotton in central greece needs 1 450 gdd to complete its growing cycle danalatos 2007 the latter one seems to be mandatory for the crops cultivation in northern greece 2 4 1 model evaluation criteria with the aim of evaluating the applicability of sets of cotton conservative parameters proposed by farahani et al 2009 garcía vila et al 2009 and the default aquacrop cotton crop file for both cd and gdd model modes six cotton crop files were devised by merging the cotton development observations of this work non conservative parameters with the set of conservative parameters proposed on the abovementioned crop files table 4 in those cases where some of the conservative parameters were not reported by the researchers it was assumed that they used the default file values then the model was executed using each of the cotton crop files for both years the aquacrop s performance for each file was assessed through a statistical analysis utilizing the coefficient of determination r2 as a measure of the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated data the root mean square error rmse eq 4 as an indicator of the residual error moriasi et al 2007 4 r m s e i 1 n s i o i n 0 5 and the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modeling efficiency ef eq 5 as a model performance indicator paredes et al 2014 5 e f 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o m 2 where oi the observed data at the three measuring stations and si the corresponding simulated values respectively om the observed mean value and n the number of measurements the model s performance is considered to be satisfactory when ef and r2 values are close to 1 while values close to 0 indicate unrealistic simulation results on the contrary rmse values close to zero indicate a good agreement between measured and simulated data 3 results and discussion 3 1 root depth development the dae that the water extraction started in the depths of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm in 2015 and 2016 in measuring station 3 are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 respectively no fluctuations were observed in the swc till july 1 dae 40 in all depths in 2015 fig 2 then from july 3 dae 42 the swc in the depth of 50 cm started to drop and continued to decline exponentially until august 15 fig 2a successively the swc in the 60 cm depth started to decline a few days later on july 8 dae 47 fig 2b the dae that the swc started to decline in the depths of 70 80 90 and 100 cm were found to be 55 60 68 and 74 respectively the lower swc value in the depths of 50 60 70 and 80 cm was reached approximately on august 15 while in the depths of 90 and 100 cm on september 1 once the swc reached its lower value it remained almost constant till the end of the season in all depths almost the same swc declining patterns were observed in 2016 but the dae that the reduction was initiated in the various depths were different from those in 2015 for the depths of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm the swc reduction initiated at 52 59 63 73 80 and 88 dae respectively it is noteworthy that this year the swc reduction curve at the depth of 100 cm fig 3f showed a linear form this is attributed to the fact that the swc measurements stopped on august 26 when the swc was still 26 observing more closely the swc reduction curves of both years figs 2 and 3 it is obvious that the exponential curve was formed once the swc drops below 20 whilst from 40 to 20 the swc reduction was linear the patterns were similar for measuring stations 1 and 2 the mean dae needed by the roots in the three measuring stations to reach the abovementioned soil depths in 2015 and 2016 were averaged and plotted against depth the derived curves are illustrated in fig 4 the regression analysis showed that the average root growth rate was 1 7 cm d in 2015 but slightly higher in 2016 equal to 2 cm d in terms of thermal days the average root growth rate in 2015 and 2016 were 0 17 and 0 19 cm gdd respectively an average standard deviation of 5 3 days was observed in 2015 with a maximum equal to 6 days for the depth of 70 cm indicating potential differences in cotton plants root growth within the field this deviation was moderately lower in 2016 equal to 3 7 days showing that the total root growth was more homogeneous this year the roots reached the depth of 1 m almost 77 dae or after 652 gdds in 2015 and 77 dae or 565 gdds in 2016 furthermore the extrapolation of the obtained root growth rates showed that the maximum effective root depth of 1 15 m and 1 1 m was reached in 87 dae and 82 dae or in 791 gdd and 727 gdd during 2015 and 2016 respectively a few days before the start of the canopy senescence in an experimental work bassett et al 1970 found that the cotton roots kept growing for 77 dae with an average rate of 2 5 cm day and maximum depth equal to 1 3 m while in a fine texture silty clay loam study lysimeter bland and dugas 1989 indicated a growth rate equal to 3 5 cm day farahani et al 2009 in a study conducted in a well drained clay field identified a maximum root depth equal to 1 3 m which was reached roughly 103 dae right before the starting of crop senescence with an average growth rate equal to 1 26 cm d moreover garcía vila et al 2009 suggested for a clay loam textured field a maximum rooting depth of cotton equal to 1 5 m which was reached approximately 90 97 dae representing a growth rate equal to 1 5 1 67 cm d considering that the experimental field in this study was dominated by clay the maximum root depth found here is lower than that reported by farahani et al 2009 and garcía vila et al 2009 on the contrary the root growth rates found here were moderately higher than those proposed by farahani et al 2009 but very close to the root growth rates reported by garcía vila et al 2009 these discrepancies between the effective maximum root depth as well as the root growth rates reported by the different research studies can be attributed to a the initial soil water conditions and the irrigation strategy followed during these experiments as under drought conditions the plants tend to develop a deeper root system trying to access water and nutrients stored in the deeper soil layers or away from the sowing planting row while a loose root system seems to be developed in abundance of water and nutrients abdelhamid 2010 bengough et al 2011 xiao tang et al 2009 b the soil mechanical properties resulted in high soil impedance i e compacted soil layers which may reduce the root growth rate or even halt the cotton root growth bar yosef and lambert 1981 coelho et al 2000 lowry et al 1970 taylor and ratliff 1969 and c the use of plant growth regulators i e pix although their exact impact on the root system has not yet been studied thoroughly moreover hsiao et al 2009 stated that roots development is site specific depending on soil mechanical and hydrological properties and chemical characteristics taking into account all the above mentioned the model s parameters related to rgp should always be adjusted to local specific measurements and not be considered as conservative relatively constant between different soils and varieties for no reason 3 2 model performance under the different cotton crop files 3 2 1 root growth pattern for the same year and the same mode i e gdd or cd the three different sets of conservative parameters resulted in almost similar rgps fig 5 until das 60 in 2015 and das 40 in 2016 no stomatal closure effect was observed using the crop files shown in table 4 and consequently no stress in root growth development was expected during these periods fig 6 a b in 2015 from das 70 and to das 99 the day that the maximum effective root depth was reached a rapid increase in stomata closure effect is simulated fig 6a in the case of crop file 4 table 4 the average stomata closure effect was 2 3 5 and 4 in 70 80 90 and 100 das the corresponding values for the same dates when the crop files 5 and 6 were used was found to be 3 4 6 and 7 and 2 4 6 and 7 respectively despite the differences observed in the simulated stomata closure effect values among the three crop files no noteworthy differences in the root growth development was observed fig 5b the average water stress stomata effect in 2016 at 90 100 and 110 das were 0 3 6 1 7 10 and 3 8 11 for the crop files 1 2 and 3 respectively but still no differences in root growth development were observed fig 5c for all examined cases the aquacrop simulated satisfactorily the date that roots reached the depth of 1 m fig 5 nevertheless the cd mode simulated too early root penetration right after the cotton plants emergence as a result the model simulated root growth rate was lower than the estimated the rmse was found to be 10 4 and 10 1 days for 2015 and 2016 respectively table 5 with striking discrepancies between the estimated and simulated data especially in the first 50 70 das moreover the ef index confirmed the low model s performance in cd mode by exhibiting negative values in 2015 and values below 0 3 in 2016 table 5 the root growth pattern simulated by cd mode has as a result the early access of cotton roots to the available soil water stored between the 0 1 0 9 m soil layer it is indicative that in 2016 when only 184 mm of water were irrigated table 1 70 das the root depth in cd mode was 0 63 m while on gdd mode 0 48 m at the same das the estimated by the model average adverse effect of water stress on leaf expansion was 3 and 10 for cd and gdd modes fig 6a respectively meaning that during this period the cd mode simulated a cc 7 higher than gdd mode did on the contrary in the gdd mode the derived data showed a fine correlation between the simulated and the estimated root growth patterns for both years with r2 values 0 98 for crop files 1 2 and 3 fig 5a c in 2015 the ef was slightly better for crop file 1 equal to 0 97 when compared with crop files 2 and 3 where it was found to be 0 94 for both of them no differences were observed on ef in 2016 found to be 0 98 for all the abovementioned crop files in terms of residual error in 2015 the rmse was slightly lower in the case of crop file 1 1 85 days but in 2016 the index was almost the same for crop files 1 2 and 3 1 7 days overall the simulated rgp under gdd mode was satisfactory regardless which crop file was used 3 2 2 canopy cover in the gdd mode aquacrop simulated satisfactorily the cc development when crop files 1 2 and 3 were used for both cultivation seasons fig 7 a c in 2015 the r2 was marginally higher in the case of crop file 3 0 97 compared to crop files 1 and 2 0 95 for both whilst in 2016 the r2 found to be equal to 1 00 for all crop files the highest rmse was exhibited by crop file 2 equal to 7 65 and 8 11 in 2015 and 2016 respectively these rmse values are very close to those reported by farahani et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 at 9 5 and 6 5 respectively moreover garcía vila et al 2009 found the difference in measured and simulated by aquacrop maximum cc to vary between 6 and 8 when different irrigation strategies were implemented the slightly elevated rmse found when the crop file 2 was used seems attributed to the overestimation in cc simulation observed from das 60 to das 130 in 2015 fig 7a and from das 80 to the end of the season in 2016 fig 7c this overestimation was the result of the set of values proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop file 2 crop file 5 regarding the leaf expansion water stress upper and lower thresholds and the water stress curve shape factor table 3 the combination of these values renders the cotton leaf expansion in crop file 2 more resilient to water stress this is clearly illustrated in fig 6c and d where the set of conservative parameters proposed by farahani et al 2009 showed a lower simulated leaf expansion stress effect over cotton growth cycle at both in gdd and cd modes on the other hand no striking differences in simulated leaf expansion stress effect were observed when crop files 1 and 3 were used due to this cc overestimation crop file 2 resulted in an ef equal to 0 94 while the corresponding values in the cases of crop file 1 and 3 were marginally higher at 0 95 and 0 97 respectively when the model was run in cd mode the simulated cc in both 2015 and 2016 was substantially higher than that simulated on gdd mode for all the sets of conservative parameters in 2015 this trend was more obvious in the first 80 das fig 7b this is confirmed by fig 7c where it is clearly illustrated that in the first 80 das the simulated leaf expansion stress was moderately higher in the case of gdd mode similarly in 2016 between das 40 and 80 fig 6d the simulated leaf expansion stress was constantly lower in the case of cd mode resulting in higher cc simulated values figs 7c d to some extent the reason for this overestimation in the first 70 80 das is the wrong rgp simulation as previously mentioned i e 3 2 1 root growth pattern section this wrong simulation led to the overestimation of access of cotton roots to the available soil water stored in the upper soil layers thus allowing simulation of stronger cc development than found in reality this effect in combination with the cd mode s weakness to integrate in its calculation process the non optimum temperature conditions meaning that every calendar day is equal to one growing degree day resulted in the cc overestimation consequently the rmse under cd mode in 2015 was 13 09 16 33 and 13 34 for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively considerably higher than the corresponding values under gdd mode in 2015 for the same year and the abovementioned crop files the r2 found to be 0 84 while ef 0 82 in 2016 the r2 was 1 00 and ef 0 98 for all the three crop files at this year the lower rmse exhibited by crop file 6 and was equal to 3 8 while for crop files 4 and 5 the corresponding residual errors were 4 9 and 8 1 the model s better performance in 2016 in cd mode could be attributed to the only 3 cc measurements from das 70 to the end of the cotton s growing cycle a period when the cc is constantly overestimated in cd mode garcía vila et al 2009 and farahani et al 2009 when using the same root growth parameters for fully irrigated and deficit irrigated cotton found that aquacrop overestimated slightly the cc in the case of deficit irrigation according to the conclusions of previous works abdelhamid 2010 bengough et al 2006 xiao tang et al 2009 regarding the plants root growth it was found that cotton plants may exhibit different rgps in terms of maximum active rooting depth growth rate and root density under different irrigation strategies and thus maybe a crop file modification is required when considerably different irrigation strategies are implemented the results of this study sustain this argument as it was found that when the rgp was not simulated correctly an overestimation in the cc simulation was observed 3 2 3 dry aboveground biomass the correspondence between the measured and simulated db values in both gdd and cd mode and for all crop files was found to be fair for both 2015 and 2016 r2 0 93 fig 8 in gdd mode the rmse was 0 85 tn ha 1 54 tn ha and 0 88 tn ha for crop files 1 2 and 3 while these values in 2016 were 0 61 1 16 0 73 tn ha the 18 8 g m2 proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop files 2 5 as wp reference value seems to result in a moderately higher residual error than the default 15 g m2 i e crop files 1 3 4 5 moreover when crop files 2 and 5 were used an overestimation of db on harvesting day was observed fig 8 in the case of crop files 1 and 3 the residual error is attributed especially in 2015 to the discrepancies between the db measurements and simulations from das 80 to das 140 where the measured db exceeds the simulated values a similar behavior was observed by farahani et al 2009 who reported an underestimation in db from das 80 and until the end of the cultivation period especially under a full irrigation strategy however in our study the db measurements after das 140 were again very close to the simulations while the last measured db value harvest day was marginally lower than the simulated for both seasons to some extent this finding could be attributed to the use of the plant growth regulator ethephon in combination with a defoliant spray which were applied to the cotton approximately in das 150 the regulator in combination with the defoliant results in the fast withering and drop of cotton leaves with a parallel boost in cotton bolls ripening and opening this intervention most likely decreased the db values at harvest under cd mode the r2 exhibited values 0 94 when crop files 4 5 and 6 were used for both years however crop file 5 resulted in ef values equal to 0 65 and 0 47 in 2015 and 2016 respectively while for crop files 1 and 3 these values were 0 9 the rmse in 2015 showed moderately higher values when compared to the corresponding errors calculated under gdd mode table 5 but in 2016 when the crop file 3 was used the rmse found to be 0 48 tn ha considerably lower than the 0 73 tn ha calculated under gdd mode in 2015 these increased rmse values under cd mode could be attributed to the error introduced during db calculation process through equation 1 and equation 2 and originate from the too early rgp simulation such error increases model s weakness to integrate temperature fluctuations and foremost to cc overestimation during 2015 cultivation season when cd mode was used similarly when ahmadi et al 2015 used aquacrop to simulate the growing cycle of maize they found that the model failed to simulate the final grain yield and biomass satisfactorily when a moderate of severe water stress occurred and suggested that the reason behind this poor model performance may be related to the wrong rgp simulation moreover when razzaghi et al 2017 tried to simulate potato db with aquacrop implementing deficit irrigation and no irrigation schedules they observed a wrong model overestimation in db simulation especially from mid to late season and they mentioned that some crop water stress parameters may need further calibration the residual errors found in the current study are within the range of the residual errors reported by garcía vila et al 2009 and voloudakis et al 2015 1 01 tn ha and 0 49 tn ha respectively while hussein et al 2011 reported for 2007 2008 and 2009 rmse values equal to 0 48 tn ha 0 38 tn ha and 0 48 tn ha 3 2 4 soil water content the average standard deviation among the swc measurements conducted in the tubes installed in the three measuring stations was 21 7 mm and 24 1 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the deviation in the swc measurements is attributed to the slight spatial differences in soil hydraulic characteristics within the field while their similarity among the cultivation seasons indicates that both drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies resulted in almost the same water distribution around the tubes the model running in gdd mode simulated the fluctuations of the swc satisfactorily for both cultivating seasons it resulted in r2 0 98 in 2015 and r2 0 95 in 2016 while the model performance indicator ef was 0 9 for both years exceeding the limits of 0 8 and 0 7 for r2 and ef respectively as proposed by ma et al 2011 for good crop model performance looking more thoroughly in the swc fluctuation during 2015 cultivation season fig 9 a it s noteworthy that crop file 3 underestimated the swc from das 50 to das 80 and overestimated it from das 80 until the end of the season crop files 1 and 3 followed closely the measured swc changes until das 110 but then the crop file 3 overestimated the swc until the end of the season these trends are clearly reflected in rmse values which were found to be 7 57 mm 9 74 mm and 17 04 mm for crop files 1 2 and 3 respectively for the same year but under cd mode fig 9b a consistent swc underestimation was observed between das 50 and das 80 by all thee crop files 4 5 and 6 during this period and for the same mode there was a simultaneous low leaf expansion stress fig 6c and an overestimation in cc contributing to the overestimation of the actual crop transpiration through eq 1 since das 80 the crop files 2 and 3 overestimated the swc while crop file 1 kept close track of the measured swc changes as a result of the swc underestimation during the early cotton growing stage the rmse was 14 32 mm 14 99 mm and 16 29 mm for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively no striking differences were observed between the model s performance under gdd and cd modes regarding swc simulation in 2016 in brief crop files 4 5 and 6 kept close track of the swc changes until das 70 then the swc was overestimated till day 110 but from this day on an underestimation was observed the goodness of fit indicator r2 was 0 96 and the model performance indicator ef 0 91 when crop files 4 5 and 6 were used for both model modes in gdd mode the rmse was 13 75 mm 11 54 mm and 12 35 mm for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively whilst in cd mode the corresponding values were 12 17 mm 11 68 mm and 10 86 mm paredes et al 2014 used aquacrop model to simulate the swc fluctuations in fields cultivated with maize and they reported rmse values ranging from 5 1 mm to 10 2 mm additionally farahani et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 reported that the model had a tendency to overpredict the swc but in this study that was not always the case 3 2 5 seed cotton yield the seed cotton yield at harvest was 3 974 tn ha 0 45 in 2015 and 3 35 tn ha 0 397 in 2016 aquacrop default set of conservative parameters crop files 1 4 achieved to simulate the seed cotton yield accurately in both gdd and cd modes for both years fig 10 in 2015 the model overpredicted slightly the seed cotton yield production by 0 018 tn ha and 0 026 tn ha in gdd and cd modes respectively on the contrary in 2016 the model underestimated marginally the seed cotton yield production by 0 06 tn ha under gdd mode and 0 046 tn ha under cd mode the worst model s performance was observed when the crop files 2 and 5 were used resulting in the case of crop file 2 in an underestimation of seed cotton yield 0 69 tn ha in 2015 and 1 207 tn ha in 2016 while for these years and crop file 4 the seed cotton yield underestimation was 0 855 tn ha and 1 271 tn ha respectively when the set of parameters proposed by garcía vila et al 2009 crop files 3 6 was used the results were not satisfactory when using this set of parameters in 2015 the model underestimated the seed cotton yield 0 250 tn ha whilst in 2016 that underestimation was significantly higher 0 7 tn ha the values proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop files 2 5 for the reference hi 30 and for the subgroup of conservative parameters defining the effect of water stress on hi table 3 resulted in a hi 28 6 and 25 4 in 2015 and 2016 respectively with a corresponding negative effect during yield formation of 5 and 15 on the other hand the reference hi used by aquacrop file 35 in combination with the proposed values for the parameters defining the effect of water stress on hi showed a positive before flowering effect on hi equal to 5 and continuously an additional positive 18 effect during yield formation in 2015 no positive effect before flowering occurred in 2016 but was followed by a positive effect of 31 during yield formation the combining effects of these hi building processes resulted in a hi equal to 43 5 in 2015 and 45 5 in 2016 this fundamental difference in hi building during different crop development stages has as a result the accurate seed cotton yield prediction only by the default aquacrop cotton crop file the hi values found at the harvest day in 2015 and 2016 were 51 2 and 54 9 respectively these values are approximately 10 higher than those estimated by aquacrop when the default crop file was used this overestimation is attributed again to the use of the plant growth regulator ethephon in combination with a defoliant spray a week before the harvest as already mentioned in sub section 3 3 2 dry aboveground biomass this intervention most likely decreased the db values at harvest resulting in increased hi values 4 conclusions in the present study we assessed aquacrop model s capability to simulate satisfactorily the crop growth cycle of cotton under deficit schedules when different sets of conservative parameters proposed in the literature including model s default were used the results showed that when the model run in gdd mode the accuracy of simulated rgp cc db and swc was fair for all the proposed sets r2 0 93 ef 0 91 but seed cotton yield was simulated adequately only when the aquacrop s library file was used similarly in cd mode the cc db and swc were simulated quiet accurately r2 0 75 ef 0 72 but the rgp simulation for the first 80 das was poor resulting in high rmse and very low ef values in 2016 and negative ef values in 2015 this wrong rgp simulation is attributed to the fact that under cd mode the model failed to change and adopt rgp on the non optimum temperature conditions prevailed in the area during this period and simulated too early root penetration right after cotton plants emergence overall in gdd mode and with the proper set of conservative parameters aquacrop seems to be a reliable and useful tool for irrigation scheduling management of cotton crop on the contrary cd mode renders the model as inadequate for simulating growth and water use under non optimum temperature conditions or predictions under climate change scenarios lastly the use of rgp as model s evaluation parameter could contribute considerably to the better understanding and explanation of potential discrepancies observed on simulation of cc db and final crop yield acknowledgements the research leading to these results received funding from the european community s seventh framework program fp7 2007 2013 under grant agreement 311903 figaro flexible and precise irrigation platform to improve farm scale water productivity http www figaro irrigation net authors wish to thank pioneer hi bred hellas for providing the cotton seeds for this experiment 
11190,one of the most vital parameters for the robust crop growth models performance is the crops root growth pattern however its reference measurement methods are laborious destructive and costly in this paper we determined the root growth pattern of cotton gossypium hirsutum in the 50 to 100 cm top soil layer using soil water content measurements from the cotton cultivating seasons of 2015 and 2016 in northern greece the estimated root growth pattern along with canopy cover biomass soil water content and final seed cotton yield measurements were then used to evaluate the capability of the fao aquacrop model to simulate a deficit irrigated cotton cultivated under real farming conditions to do so a number of existing cotton crop files from the literature were tested the results showed that the estimated root growth patterns were almost the same in 2015 and 2016 exhibiting root growing rates equal to 1 7 and 2 cm d respectively when the model was run in growing degree days mode it simulated root growth pattern canopy cover biomass and soil water content with fair accuracy for all the proposed crop files r2 0 93 modeling efficiency 0 91 but the seed cotton yield was simulated adequately only when the aquacrop s library file was used in calendar days mode the model failed to simulate root growth pattern satisfactorily but the simulation of canopy cover biomass and soil water content was fair r2 0 75 model efficiency 0 72 lastly the seed cotton yield in the calendar days mode was once again simulated accurately only when the model s default crop file was used keywords crop growth model canopy cover growing degree days dry biomass seed cotton yield 1 introduction presently there is a timeless need for farmers and agronomists to take a series of crucial actions decisions such as the choice of crop s optimum sowing planting date rauff and bello 2015 the creation of an irrigation schedule ensuring increased water productivity linker et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2018 the optimization of fertilization practices and the assessment of climate change impacts on crops yield voloudakis et al 2015 uncertainty in such decisions introduced the necessity for the development and continuous improvement of agricultural systems modeling this necessity led researchers to devise and propose a variety of crop growth models ranging from conceptual over mechanistic to stochastic rauff and bello 2015 from the early de wit s et al 1970 elementary crop growth simulator elcros which was based on the modeling of canopies photosynthetic rates nowadays there is an abundance of recently developed crop growth models such as aquacrop raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 apex gassman et al 2009 mohid land simionesei et al 2016 daisy hansen et al 1991 simetaw mancosu et al 2015 etc these models are capable of simulating the soil water dynamics the soil plant nitrogen balance the aboveground crop biomass accumulation the roots growth pattern the final crop yield and other agronomic parameters with satisfactory accuracy for a variety of crops ahmadi et al 2015 battilani et al 2014 hansen et al 1991 paredes et al 2014 svendsen et al 1995 tsakmakis et al 2017 wang et al 2008 yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2018 despite their similarities these models are built with different level of complexity philosophy input requirements as well as processes and cycles they simulate for instance aquacrop does not simulate the soil plant nitrogen balance while daisy does on the other hand the former incorporates the most novel concept of crop water productivity wp to convert the estimated crop transpiration to final crop yield steduto et al 2007 while the latter a mechanistic simulation combining the aspects of photosynthesis and respiration abrahamsen and hansen 2000 hansen et al 1991 a fundamental general assumption in crop growth modeling is that the agricultural atmosphere soil plant system can be represented as a one dimensional model abrahamsen and hansen 2000 in this approach the plant roots are represented by a single root which is assumed to be a line sink with uniform radius taylor and klepper 1975 in these early works the line sink root concept is considered to have an infinite length and uniform water and nutrients absorption properties on the other hand in the modern crop growth modeling e g aquacrop daisy a root growth rate and a maximum root depth should be imported by the user thus the infinite length assumption appears outdated moreover aiming to integrate the potential differences in the plant s root density with depth an option to define different absorption rates for separate root depth layers is implemented in some of the models nevertheless despite the overall robust crop growth models performance their validation framework is still rudimentary rauff and bello 2015 as except for a few parameters that are measured in the real field and compared to the simulations an additional substantial number of parameters should be defined through the trial and error approach in some extend this is attributed to the fact that while extensive measurements on the aboveground plants growth and development are relatively easy the root growth pattern within the soil profile is very difficult to determine coring and excavation stands as the traditional reference techniques for plants root measurement but they are laborious destructive and costly even though instruments like minirhizotrone mainiero 2006 rewald and ephrath 2013 taylor 1987 have been devised to simplify the measuring process their use and research reports are still limited alternatively researchers proposed that under limited water supply limited irrigation or rainfed conditions the maximum roots depth and roots downward penetration rate can be estimated through the soil water extraction patterns dardanelli et al 1997 gregory et al 1978 klepper 1991 monteith 1986 robertson et al 1993 according to this concept when the roots reach a certain layer and start to extract water the initial soil water content θ begins to drop exponentially passioura 1983 robertson et al 1993 monteith 1986 proposed that the roots downward growth rate can be estimated by plotting the time after emergence at which θ starts to decline exponentially below its initial constant value θa against depth there are two main publications in literature referring to the calibration and validation process for cotton gossypium hirsutum crop file in aquacrop model garcía vila et al 2009 farahani et al 2009 during these experiments researchers calibrated the crop file using results from one year s field experiment conducted under full irrigation strategy and then validated by applying it to at least two other data sets of different cultivation years and deficit irrigation schedules in both works the model s cotton crop file was validated in terms of green canopy cover cc dry aboveground biomass db soil water content balance swc evapotranspiration et and final seed cotton yield considering the potential differences on cotton crop files found in the literature the present study aims to evaluate aquacrop s performance using the different parameterization approaches including the model s default one under deficit irrigation schedules in this regard the different parameterizations are analyzed relative to cc db swc and seed cotton yield using calendar days cd and growing degree days gdd model modes moreover in addition to the abovementioned standard evaluation parameters the root growth pattern rgp estimated through the soil water extraction patterns is introduced as an additional model evaluation parameter 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data the data used in this paper were obtained from an extensive experiment carried out during the figaro project in a field located at the plain of xanthi province in northern greece 41 046 n 24 892 e 13 m altitude tsakmakis et al 2017 a side rectangle experimental plot covering an area of 3 3 ha 16 5 m width 200 m length was set in the field during 2015 and 2016 cultivation seasons may to september and treated uniformly throughout in terms of irrigation fertigation and field management practices within the plot three measuring stations replicates were established and cc db and swc measurements were conducted on them stations were placed in the center of the plot approximately 7 m away from left and right sides with 50 m distance from the plot top down sides and between them the cc was determined by taking photos of 1 m2 of field surface vertically from roughly 1 5 m height aboveground and then process them via photoshop and gimp software parallel to cc measurements cotton plants were cut during different growth cycle stages including harvest day transferred to the laboratory where they were further separated in fractions and placed in an oven at 65 c until constant weight for db determination on each of the three measuring stations one pvc tube was installed shortly after the sowing and the swc was measured through them with sentek s diviner 2000 gauge evett and steiner 1995 the instrument consisted of a metal rod with a frequency domain reflectometry capacitance sensor mounted on its lower end from its upper end and through a plug in the rod is connected via a cable to a data logger unit the rod was inserted through its lower end to the installed to the field pvc tubes and measured the swc in 10 cm intervals as it was descended and ascended from the tube up to 1 m depth the measurements were recorded to the data logger and successively transferred to a personal computer in accordance to the local farmer practices the field was plowed with a moldboard down to 30 35 cm depth in early march and then a week before sowing it was treated with disc harrows for bed preparation cotton pioneer hi bred st402 variety seeds were sowed on 11th of may in 2015 and 19th of april in 2016 the space between cotton plant rows was 0 9 m whilst the mean plant density for both years was roughly 12 plants per meter within the first week of july the space between the cotton rows was tilled with cultivator machinery to remove the weeds from the field in both seasons when the plants reached 0 50 cm height 500 ml ha of the plant growth regulator pix was applied followed by two applications of 500 ml ha each with a 10 days interval from the first application and between them additionally in the first week of october 2015 and last week of september 2016 300 g ha of ethephon plant growth regulator was sprayed to cotton plants combined with a defoliate spray cotton was harvested on oct 20 2015 and oct 3 2016 air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction solar radiation rs and rainfall height were measured during the experiment by a meteorological station installed on the field the reference daily evapotranspiration et0 was then calculated with fao s et0 calculator fao 2009 monthly maximum and minimum air temperature as well as rainfall depth for 2015 and 2016 are illustrated in fig 1 in 2015 and until mid july irrigation was performed with a sprinkler irrigation system consisting of a single large nozzle that operates under pressure rotates and is self propelled while for the rest of the season a normal drip line system was installed on the field in 2016 only the gun sprinkler system was used the applied amounts of water were measured with a hydrometer placed to the drilling s pumping system and considered to be equal to the net amounts applied on the field the irrigation scheduling was based on the precision irrigation algorithm proposed by tsakmakis et al 2017 however limitations to the available drilling water in 2016 resulted in the partial implementation of the initial irrigation schedule and the application of just 184 mm of water the implemented irrigation schedules are presented in table 1 soil samples were collected from the depths of 30 60 80 and 100 cm at various sites within the field the textural analysis bouyoucos 1962 showed that the upper 30 cm was characterized as a sandy clay loam horizon according to the usda classification 52 4 sand 23 2 silt 24 4 clay while from 30 cm down to 100 cm the soil was characterized as clay 32 sand 22 silt 46 clay the organic matter content was found to be 1 2 and 0 7 in the upper and lower layers respectively the textural and organic matter info were inserted to spaw saxton and rawls 2006 and rosetta schaap et al 2001 models and soil saturation field capacity permanent wilting point and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were estimated a representative bulk soil profile of the obtained soil s hydraulic properties is presented in table 2 despite the fact that no soil samples were taken below the depth of 100 cm a hypothesis was made that the soil structure and hydraulic properties remained the same until the depth of 150 cm a soil analysis for the determination of the optimum required amounts of n p and k was carried out for both years in march in bulk soil samples collected from surface to 50 cm depth the results showed that the required amounts for the optimum plant growth were 150 20 and 80 kg ha n p k respectively however aiming to eliminate any potential impact of fertigation in the cotton plants growth an over fertigation program was followed in both seasons 300 kg ha of 30 10 5 n p k and 250 kg ha 0 0 30 n p k granular fertilizers were applied into the field during sowing basic fertigation followed up by two batches of 100 kg ha 33 5 n 16 5 nh4 n 17 no3 n fertigation applying in total 157 30 and 90 kg ha n p k respectively the first n batch was implemented when the first squares started to form and the second when the first cotton bolls were observed 2 2 root growth pattern estimation the rgp was determined for the soil layer between 50 and 100 cm depth the first 40 cm of soil were excluded from the process for three main reasons a the effect of evaporation in the upper soil layer b the impact of irrigated water in the swc measurements of this layer and c the potential diffusion of water towards surface due to the increasing water deficit monteith 1986 the swc measurements of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm soil layers at each measuring station and year were plotted against time then an exponential curve passioura 1983 was fitted to measurements describing the decline in soil water content to do so initially the non linear regression fit for all datasets was applied and the coefficient of determination r2 was calculated successively the non linear regression run for all the dataset but the first measurement then for all dataset but the first two measurements etc until a r2 above 0 9 was achieved the date that the water extraction started first point of the exponential curve was considered to be the time that cotton roots reached this layer dardanelli et al 1997 monteith 1986 continuously the dates after emergence dae that signaled the arrival of the roots start of swc decline at each soil layer were plotted against depth and the rgp of each tube for 2015 and 2016 were obtained lastly a linear regression was fitted to the data describing the root growth pattern of each year allowing the calculation of the root growth rates curve s slope a soil sampling campaign conducted with a hand operated auger few days after the beginning of senescence period showed that the cotton roots were present down to the depth of 1 15 m and 1 1 m in 2015 and 2016 respectively these depths were considered to be the maximum root depths for each season as there is literature evidence that the cotton root elongation is slowed once the maximum cc is achieved and the boll ripening started and halted at the beginning of canopy senescence coelho et al 2000 taylor and klepper 1974 an extrapolation based on the root growth rates obtained from the linear regression was performed till dae 88 in 2015 and dae 89 in 2016 and the dates that the maximum root depth was reached in each year were estimated the dae used as extrapolation ending dates was the time that signaled the beginning of senescence in 2015 and 2016 respectively 2 3 aquacrop model description aquacrop v 5 0 calculates growth from evapotranspiration and the model incorporates four main subroutines a the soil water balance subroutine swc b the crop growth cycle subroutine cc db rgp yield c the atmosphere subroutine rainfall evapotranspiration co2 concentration gdd and d the management subroutine irrigation technology irrigation schedule mulching soil bunds moreover during the calculation process the model uses water stress fertility stress and salinity stress functions to integrate the impact of these adverse conditions to the cc development root expansion db accumulation and in particular to the final crop yield water stress function is further divided to leaf expansion stomatal closure and early senescence sub functions these sub functions are triggered successively as the total available water in the root zone keeps dropping and some critical limits are reached lastly the root zone expansion stress is activated in parallel with the stomatal closure stress meaning that the model incorporates the same water threshold for both stresses the root expansion stress becomes increasingly severe as the available water in the rootzone keeps dropping until permanent wilting point is reached and the root development is halted the dual crop coefficient concept allen et al 1998 is incorporated by aquacrop and the actual crop s transpiration is calculated as 1 t r c a d j k s c c k c t r x e t 0 where ks is the dimensionless soil water stress coefficient equal to 1 when the soil is at field capacity and 0 at permanent wilting point cc is the canopy cover adjusted for micro advective effects kctr x is the maximum crop transpiration coefficient mm and et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm the db accumulation is calculated in daily basis as 2 d b w p i 1 n t r c a d j e t 0 where db is the daily increase of aboveground dry biomass in day after sowing das tn ha d and wp is the crop s water productivity adjusted for atmospheric co2 concentration and climate g m2 lastly the crop s yield is derived as 3 y h i b where y is the crop production tn ha and hi is the harvest index a deficit irrigation strategy may substantially enhance the water productivity of cotton fereres and soriano 2007 in aquacrop this aspect is integrated with three intuitive parameters a the positive water stress impact on the hi when applied before flowering b the potentially positive effect of water stress on leaf expansion and in turn on hi during yield formation and c the potentially adverse effect of water stress induced stomatal closure on hi during yield formation thus a decrease in db production due to a deficit irrigation schedule may be compensated by an increase in hi resulting in increased water productivity 2 4 parameterization of cotton crop parameters and model validation the parameters required as inputs in the aquacrop s crop file may be separated into two distinct categories ahmadi et al 2015 raes et al 2009 paredes et al 2014 a the non conservative parameters taking values that could vary significantly from year to year around the globe or between different varieties and b the conservative parameters with values that change marginally in time and place the values of non conservative parameters should be observed measured in the field while the values of the conservative parameters are mainly determined through the trial and error approach table 3 in this study the values of non conservative parameters were obtained from the field observations of 2015 and 2016 cotton cultivation seasons the time period from cotton sowing to emergence was found to be 9 and 30 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively additionally the corresponding das needed for maximum canopy cover senescence and maturity development stages were 86 99 160 in 2015 and 103 118 170 in 2016 maximum root depth was estimated to 1 15 m in 2015 and 1 1 m in 2016 reached roughly in 99 and 112 das respectively the minimum effective rooting depth was set to 0 1 m flowering triggered 63 and 81 das in 2015 and 2016 while it s duration lasted almost 40 days in both years the gdd needed for each cotton growing stage was calculated based on 2015 season s observations and measurements the base temperature used for the calculations was 15 c kerby et al 1987 it was found that 70 675 853 and 1 273 gdd c were needed for emergence max canopy senescence and maturity growing stages respectively it is noteworthy to mention that the duration of the growing stages reported in this paper included the use of the two cotton plant growth regulators which are widely used by the farmers in the area the first one pix was used to halt the vegetative growth in the end of july while the second one ethephon was used some weeks before harvest to promote cotton maturity taking into account that cotton in central greece needs 1 450 gdd to complete its growing cycle danalatos 2007 the latter one seems to be mandatory for the crops cultivation in northern greece 2 4 1 model evaluation criteria with the aim of evaluating the applicability of sets of cotton conservative parameters proposed by farahani et al 2009 garcía vila et al 2009 and the default aquacrop cotton crop file for both cd and gdd model modes six cotton crop files were devised by merging the cotton development observations of this work non conservative parameters with the set of conservative parameters proposed on the abovementioned crop files table 4 in those cases where some of the conservative parameters were not reported by the researchers it was assumed that they used the default file values then the model was executed using each of the cotton crop files for both years the aquacrop s performance for each file was assessed through a statistical analysis utilizing the coefficient of determination r2 as a measure of the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated data the root mean square

and n the number of measurements the model s performance is considered to be satisfactory when ef and r2 values are close to 1 while values close to 0 indicate unrealistic simulation results on the contrary rmse values close to zero indicate a good agreement between measured and simulated data 3 results and discussion 3 1 root depth development the dae that the water extraction started in the depths of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm in 2015 and 2016 in measuring station 3 are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 respectively no fluctuations were observed in the swc till july 1 dae 40 in all depths in 2015 fig 2 then from july 3 dae 42 the swc in the depth of 50 cm started to drop and continued to decline exponentially until august 15 fig 2a successively the swc in the 60 cm depth started to decline a few days later on july 8 dae 47 fig 2b the dae that the swc started to decline in the depths of 70 80 90 and 100 cm were found to be 55 60 68 and 74 respectively the lower swc value in the depths of 50 60 70 and 80 cm was reached approximately on august 15 while in the depths of 90 and 100 cm on september 1 once the swc reached its lower value it remained almost constant till the end of the season in all depths almost the same swc declining patterns were observed in 2016 but the dae that the reduction was initiated in the various depths were different from those in 2015 for the depths of 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 cm the swc reduction initiated at 52 59 63 73 80 and 88 dae respectively it is noteworthy that this year the swc reduction curve at the depth of 100 cm fig 3f showed a linear form this is attributed to the fact that the swc measurements stopped on august 26 when the swc was still 26 observing more closely the swc reduction curves of both years figs 2 and 3 it is obvious that the exponential curve was formed once the swc drops below 20 whilst from 40 to 20 the swc reduction was linear the patterns were similar for measuring stations 1 and 2 the mean dae needed by the roots in the three measuring stations to reach the abovementioned soil depths in 2015 and 2016 were averaged and plotted against depth the derived curves are illustrated in fig 4 the regression analysis showed that the average root growth rate was 1 7 cm d in 2015 but slightly higher in 2016 equal to 2 cm d in terms of thermal days the average root growth rate in 2015 and 2016 were 0 17 and 0 19 cm gdd respectively an average standard deviation of 5 3 days was observed in 2015 with a maximum equal to 6 days for the depth of 70 cm indicating potential differences in cotton plants root growth within the field this deviation was moderately lower in 2016 equal to 3 7 days showing that the total root growth was more homogeneous this year the roots reached the depth of 1 m almost 77 dae or after 652 gdds in 2015 and 77 dae or 565 gdds in 2016 furthermore the extrapolation of the obtained root growth rates showed that the maximum effective root depth of 1 15 m and 1 1 m was reached in 87 dae and 82 dae or in 791 gdd and 727 gdd during 2015 and 2016 respectively a few days before the start of the canopy senescence in an experimental work bassett et al 1970 found that the cotton roots kept growing for 77 dae with an average rate of 2 5 cm day and maximum depth equal to 1 3 m while in a fine texture silty clay loam study lysimeter bland and dugas 1989 indicated a growth rate equal to 3 5 cm day farahani et al 2009 in a study conducted in a well drained clay field identified a maximum root depth equal to 1 3 m which was reached roughly 103 dae right before the starting of crop senescence with an average growth rate equal to 1 26 cm d moreover garcía vila et al 2009 suggested for a clay loam textured field a maximum rooting depth of cotton equal to 1 5 m which was reached approximately 90 97 dae representing a growth rate equal to 1 5 1 67 cm d considering that the experimental field in this study was dominated by clay the maximum root depth found here is lower than that reported by farahani et al 2009 and garcía vila et al 2009 on the contrary the root growth rates found here were moderately higher than those proposed by farahani et al 2009 but very close to the root growth rates reported by garcía vila et al 2009 these discrepancies between the effective maximum root depth as well as the root growth rates reported by the different research studies can be attributed to a the initial soil water conditions and the irrigation strategy followed during these experiments as under drought conditions the plants tend to develop a deeper root system trying to access water and nutrients stored in the deeper soil layers or away from the sowing planting row while a loose root system seems to be developed in abundance of water and nutrients abdelhamid 2010 bengough et al 2011 xiao tang et al 2009 b the soil mechanical properties resulted in high soil impedance i e compacted soil layers which may reduce the root growth rate or even halt the cotton root growth bar yosef and lambert 1981 coelho et al 2000 lowry et al 1970 taylor and ratliff 1969 and c the use of plant growth regulators i e pix although their exact impact on the root system has not yet been studied thoroughly moreover hsiao et al 2009 stated that roots development is site specific depending on soil mechanical and hydrological properties and chemical characteristics taking into account all the above mentioned the model s parameters related to rgp should always be adjusted to local specific measurements and not be considered as conservative relatively constant between different soils and varieties for no reason 3 2 model performance under the different cotton crop files 3 2 1 root growth pattern for the same year and the same mode i e gdd or cd the three different sets of conservative parameters resulted in almost similar rgps fig 5 until das 60 in 2015 and das 40 in 2016 no stomatal closure effect was observed using the crop files shown in table 4 and consequently no stress in root growth development was expected during these periods fig 6 a b in 2015 from das 70 and to das 99 the day that the maximum effective root depth was reached a rapid increase in stomata closure effect is simulated fig 6a in the case of crop file 4 table 4 the average stomata closure effect was 2 3 5 and 4 in 70 80 90 and 100 das the corresponding values for the same dates when the crop files 5 and 6 were used was found to be 3 4 6 and 7 and 2 4 6 and 7 respectively despite the differences observed in the simulated stomata closure effect values among the three crop files no noteworthy differences in the root growth development was observed fig 5b the average water stress stomata effect in 2016 at 90 100 and 110 das were 0 3 6 1 7 10 and 3 8 11 for the crop files 1 2 and 3 respectively but still no differences in root growth development were observed fig 5c for all examined cases the aquacrop simulated satisfactorily the date that roots reached the depth of 1 m fig 5 nevertheless the cd mode simulated too early root penetration right after the cotton plants emergence as a result the model simulated root growth rate was lower than the estimated the rmse was found to be 10 4 and 10 1 days for 2015 and 2016 respectively table 5 with striking discrepancies between the estimated and simulated data especially in the first 50 70 das moreover the ef index confirmed the low model s performance in cd mode by exhibiting negative values in 2015 and values below 0 3 in 2016 table 5 the root growth pattern simulated by cd mode has as a result the early access of cotton roots to the available soil water stored between the 0 1 0 9 m soil layer it is indicative that in 2016 when only 184 mm of water were irrigated table 1 70 das the root depth in cd mode was 0 63 m while on gdd mode 0 48 m at the same das the estimated by the model average adverse effect of water stress on leaf expansion was 3 and 10 for cd and gdd modes fig 6a respectively meaning that during this period the cd mode simulated a cc 7 higher than gdd mode did on the contrary in the gdd mode the derived data showed a fine correlation between the simulated and the estimated root growth patterns for both years with r2 values 0 98 for crop files 1 2 and 3 fig 5a c in 2015 the ef was slightly better for crop file 1 equal to 0 97 when compared with crop files 2 and 3 where it was found to be 0 94 for both of them no differences were observed on ef in 2016 found to be 0 98 for all the abovementioned crop files in terms of residual error in 2015 the rmse was slightly lower in the case of crop file 1 1 85 days but in 2016 the index was almost the same for crop files 1 2 and 3 1 7 days overall the simulated rgp under gdd mode was satisfactory regardless which crop file was used 3 2 2 canopy cover in the gdd mode aquacrop simulated satisfactorily the cc development when crop files 1 2 and 3 were used for both cultivation seasons fig 7 a c in 2015 the r2 was marginally higher in the case of crop file 3 0 97 compared to crop files 1 and 2 0 95 for both whilst in 2016 the r2 found to be equal to 1 00 for all crop files the highest rmse was exhibited by crop file 2 equal to 7 65 and 8 11 in 2015 and 2016 respectively these rmse values are very close to those reported by farahani et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 at 9 5 and 6 5 respectively moreover garcía vila et al 2009 found the difference in measured and simulated by aquacrop maximum cc to vary between 6 and 8 when different irrigation strategies were implemented the slightly elevated rmse found when the crop file 2 was used seems attributed to the overestimation in cc simulation observed from das 60 to das 130 in 2015 fig 7a and from das 80 to the end of the season in 2016 fig 7c this overestimation was the result of the set of values proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop file 2 crop file 5 regarding the leaf expansion water stress upper and lower thresholds and the water stress curve shape factor table 3 the combination of these values renders the cotton leaf expansion in crop file 2 more resilient to water stress this is clearly illustrated in fig 6c and d where the set of conservative parameters proposed by farahani et al 2009 showed a lower simulated leaf expansion stress effect over cotton growth cycle at both in gdd and cd modes on the other hand no striking differences in simulated leaf expansion stress effect were observed when crop files 1 and 3 were used due to this cc overestimation crop file 2 resulted in an ef equal to 0 94 while the corresponding values in the cases of crop file 1 and 3 were marginally higher at 0 95 and 0 97 respectively when the model was run in cd mode the simulated cc in both 2015 and 2016 was substantially higher than that simulated on gdd mode for all the sets of conservative parameters in 2015 this trend was more obvious in the first 80 das fig 7b this is confirmed by fig 7c where it is clearly illustrated that in the first 80 das the simulated leaf expansion stress was moderately higher in the case of gdd mode similarly in 2016 between das 40 and 80 fig 6d the simulated leaf expansion stress was constantly lower in the case of cd mode resulting in higher cc simulated values figs 7c d to some extent the reason for this overestimation in the first 70 80 das is the wrong rgp simulation as previously mentioned i e 3 2 1 root growth pattern section this wrong simulation led to the overestimation of access of cotton roots to the available soil water stored in the upper soil layers thus allowing simulation of stronger cc development than found in reality this effect in combination with the cd mode s weakness to integrate in its calculation process the non optimum temperature conditions meaning that every calendar day is equal to one growing degree day resulted in the cc overestimation consequently the rmse under cd mode in 2015 was 13 09 16 33 and 13 34 for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively considerably higher than the corresponding values under gdd mode in 2015 for the same year and the abovementioned crop files the r2 found to be 0 84 while ef 0 82 in 2016 the r2 was 1 00 and ef 0 98 for all the three crop files at this year the lower rmse exhibited by crop file 6 and was equal to 3 8 while for crop files 4 and 5 the corresponding residual errors were 4 9 and 8 1 the model s better performance in 2016 in cd mode could be attributed to the only 3 cc measurements from das 70 to the end of the cotton s growing cycle a period when the cc is constantly overestimated in cd mode garcía vila et al 2009 and farahani et al 2009 when using the same root growth parameters for fully irrigated and deficit irrigated cotton found that aquacrop overestimated slightly the cc in the case of deficit irrigation according to the conclusions of previous works abdelhamid 2010 bengough et al 2006 xiao tang et al 2009 regarding the plants root growth it was found that cotton plants may exhibit different rgps in terms of maximum active rooting depth growth rate and root density under different irrigation strategies and thus maybe a crop file modification is required when considerably different irrigation strategies are implemented the results of this study sustain this argument as it was found that when the rgp was not simulated correctly an overestimation in the cc simulation was observed 3 2 3 dry aboveground biomass the correspondence between the measured and simulated db values in both gdd and cd mode and for all crop files was found to be fair for both 2015 and 2016 r2 0 93 fig 8 in gdd mode the rmse was 0 85 tn ha 1 54 tn ha and 0 88 tn ha for crop files 1 2 and 3 while these values in 2016 were 0 61 1 16 0 73 tn ha the 18 8 g m2 proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop files 2 5 as wp reference value seems to result in a moderately higher residual error than the default 15 g m2 i e crop files 1 3 4 5 moreover when crop files 2 and 5 were used an overestimation of db on harvesting day was observed fig 8 in the case of crop files 1 and 3 the residual error is attributed especially in 2015 to the discrepancies between the db measurements and simulations from das 80 to das 140 where the measured db exceeds the simulated values a similar behavior was observed by farahani et al 2009 who reported an underestimation in db from das 80 and until the end of the cultivation period especially under a full irrigation strategy however in our study the db measurements after das 140 were again very close to the simulations while the last measured db value harvest day was marginally lower than the simulated for both seasons to some extent this finding could be attributed to the use of the plant growth regulator ethephon in combination with a defoliant spray which were applied to the cotton approximately in das 150 the regulator in combination with the defoliant results in the fast withering and drop of cotton leaves with a parallel boost in cotton bolls ripening and opening this intervention most likely decreased the db values at harvest under cd mode the r2 exhibited values 0 94 when crop files 4 5 and 6 were used for both years however crop file 5 resulted in ef values equal to 0 65 and 0 47 in 2015 and 2016 respectively while for crop files 1 and 3 these values were 0 9 the rmse in 2015 showed moderately higher values when compared to the corresponding errors calculated under gdd mode table 5 but in 2016 when the crop file 3 was used the rmse found to be 0 48 tn ha considerably lower than the 0 73 tn ha calculated under gdd mode in 2015 these increased rmse values under cd mode could be attributed to the error introduced during db calculation process through equation 1 and equation 2 and originate from the too early rgp simulation such error increases model s weakness to integrate temperature fluctuations and foremost to cc overestimation during 2015 cultivation season when cd mode was used similarly when ahmadi et al 2015 used aquacrop to simulate the growing cycle of maize they found that the model failed to simulate the final grain yield and biomass satisfactorily when a moderate of severe water stress occurred and suggested that the reason behind this poor model performance may be related to the wrong rgp simulation moreover when razzaghi et al 2017 tried to simulate potato db with aquacrop implementing deficit irrigation and no irrigation schedules they observed a wrong model overestimation in db simulation especially from mid to late season and they mentioned that some crop water stress parameters may need further calibration the residual errors found in the current study are within the range of the residual errors reported by garcía vila et al 2009 and voloudakis et al 2015 1 01 tn ha and 0 49 tn ha respectively while hussein et al 2011 reported for 2007 2008 and 2009 rmse values equal to 0 48 tn ha 0 38 tn ha and 0 48 tn ha 3 2 4 soil water content the average standard deviation among the swc measurements conducted in the tubes installed in the three measuring stations was 21 7 mm and 24 1 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the deviation in the swc measurements is attributed to the slight spatial differences in soil hydraulic characteristics within the field while their similarity among the cultivation seasons indicates that both drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies resulted in almost the same water distribution around the tubes the model running in gdd mode simulated the fluctuations of the swc satisfactorily for both cultivating seasons it resulted in r2 0 98 in 2015 and r2 0 95 in 2016 while the model performance indicator ef was 0 9 for both years exceeding the limits of 0 8 and 0 7 for r2 and ef respectively as proposed by ma et al 2011 for good crop model performance looking more thoroughly in the swc fluctuation during 2015 cultivation season fig 9 a it s noteworthy that crop file 3 underestimated the swc from das 50 to das 80 and overestimated it from das 80 until the end of the season crop files 1 and 3 followed closely the measured swc changes until das 110 but then the crop file 3 overestimated the swc until the end of the season these trends are clearly reflected in rmse values which were found to be 7 57 mm 9 74 mm and 17 04 mm for crop files 1 2 and 3 respectively for the same year but under cd mode fig 9b a consistent swc underestimation was observed between das 50 and das 80 by all thee crop files 4 5 and 6 during this period and for the same mode there was a simultaneous low leaf expansion stress fig 6c and an overestimation in cc contributing to the overestimation of the actual crop transpiration through eq 1 since das 80 the crop files 2 and 3 overestimated the swc while crop file 1 kept close track of the measured swc changes as a result of the swc underestimation during the early cotton growing stage the rmse was 14 32 mm 14 99 mm and 16 29 mm for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively no striking differences were observed between the model s performance under gdd and cd modes regarding swc simulation in 2016 in brief crop files 4 5 and 6 kept close track of the swc changes until das 70 then the swc was overestimated till day 110 but from this day on an underestimation was observed the goodness of fit indicator r2 was 0 96 and the model performance indicator ef 0 91 when crop files 4 5 and 6 were used for both model modes in gdd mode the rmse was 13 75 mm 11 54 mm and 12 35 mm for crop files 4 5 and 6 respectively whilst in cd mode the corresponding values were 12 17 mm 11 68 mm and 10 86 mm paredes et al 2014 used aquacrop model to simulate the swc fluctuations in fields cultivated with maize and they reported rmse values ranging from 5 1 mm to 10 2 mm additionally farahani et al 2009 and hussein et al 2011 reported that the model had a tendency to overpredict the swc but in this study that was not always the case 3 2 5 seed cotton yield the seed cotton yield at harvest was 3 974 tn ha 0 45 in 2015 and 3 35 tn ha 0 397 in 2016 aquacrop default set of conservative parameters crop files 1 4 achieved to simulate the seed cotton yield accurately in both gdd and cd modes for both years fig 10 in 2015 the model overpredicted slightly the seed cotton yield production by 0 018 tn ha and 0 026 tn ha in gdd and cd modes respectively on the contrary in 2016 the model underestimated marginally the seed cotton yield production by 0 06 tn ha under gdd mode and 0 046 tn ha under cd mode the worst model s performance was observed when the crop files 2 and 5 were used resulting in the case of crop file 2 in an underestimation of seed cotton yield 0 69 tn ha in 2015 and 1 207 tn ha in 2016 while for these years and crop file 4 the seed cotton yield underestimation was 0 855 tn ha and 1 271 tn ha respectively when the set of parameters proposed by garcía vila et al 2009 crop files 3 6 was used the results were not satisfactory when using this set of parameters in 2015 the model underestimated the seed cotton yield 0 250 tn ha whilst in 2016 that underestimation was significantly higher 0 7 tn ha the values proposed by farahani et al 2009 i e crop files 2 5 for the reference hi 30 and for the subgroup of conservative parameters defining the effect of water stress on hi table 3 resulted in a hi 28 6 and 25 4 in 2015 and 2016 respectively with a corresponding negative effect during yield formation of 5 and 15 on the other hand the reference hi used by aquacrop file 35 in combination with the proposed values for the parameters defining the effect of water stress on hi showed a positive before flowering effect on hi equal to 5 and continuously an additional positive 18 effect during yield formation in 2015 no positive effect before flowering occurred in 2016 but was followed by a positive effect of 31 during yield formation the combining effects of these hi building processes resulted in a hi equal to 43 5 in 2015 and 45 5 in 2016 this fundamental difference in hi building during different crop development stages has as a result the accurate seed cotton yield prediction only by the default aquacrop cotton crop file the hi values found at the harvest day in 2015 and 2016 were 51 2 and 54 9 respectively these values are approximately 10 higher than those estimated by aquacrop when the default crop file was used this overestimation is attributed again to the use of the plant growth regulator ethephon in combination with a defoliant spray a week before the harvest as already mentioned in sub section 3 3 2 dry aboveground biomass this intervention most likely decreased the db values at harvest resulting in increased hi values 4 conclusions in the present study we assessed aquacrop model s capability to simulate satisfactorily the crop growth cycle of cotton under deficit schedules when different sets of conservative parameters proposed in the literature including model s default were used the results showed that when the model run in gdd mode the accuracy of simulated rgp cc db and swc was fair for all the proposed sets r2 0 93 ef 0 91 but seed cotton yield was simulated adequately only when the aquacrop s library file was used similarly in cd mode the cc db and swc were simulated quiet accurately r2 0 75 ef 0 72 but the rgp simulation for the first 80 das was poor resulting in high rmse and very low ef values in 2016 and negative ef values in 2015 this wrong rgp simulation is attributed to the fact that under cd mode the model failed to change and adopt rgp on the non optimum temperature conditions prevailed in the area during this period and simulated too early root penetration right after cotton plants emergence overall in gdd mode and with the proper set of conservative parameters aquacrop seems to be a reliable and useful tool for irrigation scheduling management of cotton crop on the contrary cd mode renders the model as inadequate for simulating growth and water use under non optimum temperature conditions or predictions under climate change scenarios lastly the use of rgp as model s evaluation parameter could contribute considerably to the better understanding and explanation of potential discrepancies observed on simulation of cc db and final crop yield acknowledgements the research leading to these results received funding from the european

11191,to determine the main influencing factors of the two dimensional process of channel section infiltration an accurate and effective soil water infiltration model was constructed to dynamically simulate the infiltration process of farmland irrigation channels based on laboratory experiments an infiltration system consisting of a water supply unit and a cuboid plexiglass unit was set up five different initial conditions were established for soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient on this basis the cumulative infiltration and wet front processes along the section of the artificial channel were explored and the two dimensional soil water motion equation under the experimental setting conditions was established the model was solved using hydrus 2d software and an error analysis between the simulated value and the measured value was carried out the results show that the software simulation results are good additionally based on the experimental data models of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance were proposed according to the modeling results the standard regression coefficients of each influential factor were calculated for the fitting parameters and the effect of each factor on the fitting parameters was analyzed the error analysis showed that the established model of soil water movement could effectively simulate the process of soil water infiltration under experimental conditions the analysis of the standard regression coefficients suggested that the slope coefficient had the smallest influence on the fitting parameters and could be eliminated the model results showed that the calculated and measured values were all distributed around the 1 1 line and this result reflects the accuracy of the model the results can provide theoretical support for the design of irrigation systems and improve the efficiency of irrigation water use keywords laboratory experiment cumulative infiltration wetting front migration distance 1 introduction the rational design of an irrigation system can improve the efficiency of irrigation water use analyses of infiltration trends cumulative infiltration rates and the migration distance of the wetting front at different times during irrigation can improve the rational design of irrigation systems analyses of soil water infiltration trends through field experiments require extensive manpower and material resources and field work is restricted by the seasonal conditions and other factors however infiltration trends can be relatively simply and efficiently obtained through laboratory infiltration experiments and the infiltration process can be directly observed therefore such experiments have received widespread attention dialameh et al 2018 conducted a laboratory experiment in the interior of a plexiglass soil box and found that irrigation water demand was negatively correlated with the infiltration head and soil volume and quality thompson et al 2010 performed a laboratory simulation experiment of canal leakage and found that the presence of a sand layer obstructed the advancement of the wetting front specifically the layer blocked water and reduced infiltration phogat et al 2009 verified a two dimensional water balance model through laboratory experiments and studied the influence of channel height on the rise and fall of the groundwater level zhang et al 2013 designed six sets of laboratory tests using a soil box made of transparent plexiglass in the test the wet front curve was drawn directly on the plexiglass based on observations and the horizontal and vertical distances of the wet front were determined with a standard square ruler on this basis the effects of different initial water content furrow size and soil type on the change in soil wetting front were explored which provided a reference for the rational design of furrow planting systems brunson et al 2010 simulated soil water movement when the water supply head was negative i e the elevation of the irrigation water source was lower than the emitter height and concluded that the influence of the emitter radius on soil infiltration was significant the finite element model hydrus has been widely used in numerical simulations simunek et al 2005 bufon et al 2012 used hydrus 2d to simulate the cotton water content under drip irrigation conditions and the simulation results fit the measured data kandelous and šimůnek 2010 used hydrus 2d to simulate an underground drip irrigation system the root mean square error was used to evaluate the experimental results and simulation results and the corresponding relationship was found to be very good therefore this study used the domestic and foreign mature hydrus simulation technology to simulate the process of soil water infiltration and on this basis combined with various influencing factors of channel infiltration focused on the construction and verification of the infiltration model numerous scholars have conducted research to establish infiltration models based on the four classical infiltration models philip model kostiakov lewis model kostiakov model and horton model of soil water dynamics for furrow irrigation zhang et al 2012 analyzed the influences of various factors on cumulative infiltration using the path analysis method and the weight coefficient of each influencing factor on soil water infiltration was clarified which provided a reference for the optimization and streamlining of the next infiltration model nie et al 2009 developed a model of soil water movement for furrow irrigation based on a numerical simulation and deduced a calculation method of cumulative infiltration ali and ghosh 2016 proposed a method for determining the wetting front propulsion time and potential groundwater recharge for different water depths this method provided a technical reference for the design of artificial groundwater recharge facilities in irrigation systems liu et al 2015 established a semi empirical model for calculating the migration distance of the wetting front under drip irrigation conditions using the dimensional analysis method the proposed model was evaluated and the rationality of the model was validated al ogaidi et al 2016 used transparent plexiglass plates as containers to monitor the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration in the infiltration process under different conditions in real time then an empirical model for estimating wetting front migration under different water use times under drip irrigation was proposed the same procedure was used to establish a predictive model and good agreement was observed between predicted and measured values the above results suggest that hydrus 2d software can be used to simulate laboratory experiments and study the infiltration trends of channels although extensive research on infiltration models has been performed by scholars worldwide the influences of soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and slope coefficient on the fitting parameters of the model were not considered which is a limitation of existing models based on the previous research the present study was conducted to describe the characteristics of canal infiltration under different initial conditions the aim was to develop a model based on soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize the cumulative infiltration of the channel and horizontal distance and vertical distance of wetting front migration and to provide an accurate and effective simulation of the channel infiltration process in this study the laboratory experiment of channel infiltration under different initial conditions was designed and the soil water motion equation was simulated using hydrus 2d on this basis a calculation model based on soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance was established and the model was streamlined and optimized the study provides a scientific reference for rationally designing irrigation schemes and improving irrigation water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 experimental equipment the experimental equipment consisted of a cuboid plexiglass container and a water supply system a mariotte flask fig 1 in the experiment the transparent plexiglass containers were mainly used to store soil samples and observe the migration of infiltration wetting front while the water supply system provided water under different water head pressure scenarios for the infiltration process the cuboid plexiglass container was made from 10 mm thick plexiglass material the device was 60 cm long ab section 20 cm wide ac section and 110 cm high ad section the rear side of the soil device was affixed with a scale bar that could directly collect data the mariotte flask with a flexible hose was connected to a 10 mm diameter rubber hole on the device surface to supply water the diameter of mariotte flask was 20 cm and the height was 80 cm 2 1 2 experimental soil samples the experimental soil samples were taken from the experimental field of the school of conservancy and civil engineering northeast agricultural university harbin city in may 2017 the soil samples were collected at a depth of 10 30 cm according to the soil classification standards formulated by the united states department of agriculture usda the soil type used in this experiment is sandy loam the soil was passed through a 2 mm sieve before being packed into the experimental device before packing the soil was watered until the intended initial soil water content was reached combined with the average soil water content of the channel the soil liquid limit and plastic limit index the initial soil water content was set at 7 15 and 25 the soil was loaded and compacted into the experimental soil device in 10 cm increments to obtain the required bulk density and homogeneous soil profile at the same time the dry density of soil was set at 1 3 1 35 and 1 4 g cm3 2 1 3 experimental procedure the laboratory experiment was conducted in the school of conservancy and civil engineering northeast agricultural university in spring 2017 the experimental procedure is shown in table 1 eleven sets of experiments were performed under different soil bulk density initial water content channel base width infiltration head and slope coefficient horizontal distance in unit height under certain slope conditions conditions three experiments with different values were established for each independent variable experiments 1 2 and 3 were infiltration processes with different bulk densities experiments 1 4 and 5 were infiltration processes with different initial water contents etc in these experiments all other variables remained unchanged in the initial condition setting process the farmland channel section size design and water delivery standard design requirements were strictly adhered to and the section was scaled the specific scheme design is shown in table 1 below at the beginning of the experiment the soil samples were filled into the device according to the experimental procedure then base of the mariotte flask inlet was adjusted to produce the designed infiltration head water was quickly added to the soil box to reach the designed infiltration head simultaneously the water stop on the water supply pipe was opened and the height of the air inlet pipe was fine tuned after the experiment started readings were collected from the mariotte flask every 5 min and the wetting front curve was plotted every 10 min after the experiment was conducted for some time the time intervals used to collect readings and plot curves were extended according to the infiltration rate and the migration distance of the wetting front a camera was used to record the location of the wetting front after the experiment and the data was then organized 2 2 numerical simulation of the laboratory experiment 2 2 1 soil water movement model the channel infiltration process under the designed experimental conditions can be simplified to the problem of two dimensional

saturated hydraulic conductivity cm min m n and α are empirical coefficients and m 1 1 n in the study the original soil sample was taken with a ring knife and saturated in distilled water layer for 24 h after the sample reached full saturation it was taken out and dried and weighed then the samples were dehydrated in a centrifuge at different rotational speeds the rotational speeds were set at 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 r min and different rotational speeds represent different soil matrix potentials soil suction the time for each rotation was predetermined to be 100 min after each rotation was completed the ring cutter was taken out the centrifuged moisture was dried and the balance was weighed using a precision of 0 01 g at the end of the final measurement the ring knife was taken out and put into the thermostat and dried at 105 for 8 h then weighed and points corresponding to the matrix potential and soil moisture content were obtained providing the soil moisture characteristic curve in the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity the undisturbed soil obtained by the ring knife was immersed in water for 12 h after the ring knife was removed an empty ring knife was put on the ring knife that was full of saturated soil the joint was sealed with adhesive tape to prevent leakage then the joined ring knives were placed on the funnel and a 100 ml beaker was placed beneath the funnel water was added to the empty ring knife above until the water surface was 1 mm lower than the ring knife edge when the first drop of water dropped from the funnel a stopwatch to record the time every 1 2 3 5 10 t n min the beaker under the funnel was emptied and replaced and the amount of water at each time point was recorded as q 1 q 2 q 3 q n after each change of the beaker water was added to the upper ring knife until the water surface reached the original height and the water temperature was recorded with a thermometer the formula for calculating the total amount of water seeping was as follows 5 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q n 10 s in the formula q 1 q 2 q 3 q n represent the amount of water seepage at each time point and s represents the cross sectional

formula l represents the thickness of the soil layer and h represents the thickness of the water layer to facilitate the comparison of the k t values obtained at different temperatures the values were converted to a saturated hydraulic conductivity at 10 c 8 k 10 k t 0 7 0 03 t 0 in the formula t represents the water temperature at the time of measurement in addition in the process of determining the soil water characteristic curve equation the above measured soil matrix potential and water content data were used and the parameters m n α in the vg m model were obtained by using the nonlinear fitting toolbox lsqcurvefi in matlab hardie et al 2013 huang et al 2006 zlotnik et al 2007 jacinto et al 2009 2 2 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the model are shown in fig 2 initial conditions under the designed experimental conditions the soil moisture profile is a stable profile therefore the initial condition of the model is that all the points in the calculation area have the same matric potential 9 h x z t z h 0 x z ω t 0 where h0 is the initial matric potential cm ω is the calculated area the area of the wetting front was measured using standard graph paper and the length of each square unit was 1 cm and the horizontal and vertical distances of the area were recorded simultaneously and z 0 at the lowest point of the simulated area boundary conditions during the test efq represents the infiltration boundary of the pressure head as shown in fig 2 and it maintains a constant infiltration head h0 cm the atmospheric boundaries qg and gc are covered with plastic film and evaporation can be neglected to create zero flux boundaries the left boundary ea is the symmetry axis and the horizontal flux is 0 the right boundary cb is regarded as a zero flux surface the lower boundary ab contains drainage holes during the test the wetting front does not reach the base of the soil box and does not affect the process of soil water infiltration the constant initial conditions are established to create a free drainage boundary in summary the boundary conditions can be expressed as follows 10 h z d 0 t t 0 q f and f e k h h z k h 0 t 0 g c k h h z 1 sin α k h h x cos α 0 t 0 g q h x 0 t 0 e a and c b h h 0 t 0 a b where t is the duration of the experiment min 2 2 3 numeral calculations to solve the above partial differential eq 1 the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration and cumulative infiltration under the experimental design procedure were simulated using hydrus 2d software the simulation results and the measured results were compared and analyzed and the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of the simulated and measured values were calculated as shown in table 2 franses 2015 chai and draxler 2014 gough 2014 according to the data in table 2 the cumulative infiltration of soil moisture was 55671 ml under the conditions of group 1 and with the increase of soil dry density the cumulative infiltration of soil moisture was reduced by 21 596 ml and 43 033 ml in group 2 and 3 respectively at the same time the change trends of the water infiltration wetting front under different dry densities were compared and analyzed it was found that the change trend of the water infiltration wetting front was consistent with the cumulative soil infiltration showing that it decreased with the increase of soil dry density in addition with the change of soil initial moisture content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient the soil cumulative infiltration showed a certain increasing or decreasing trend and it was positively correlated with the horizontal distance and vertical distance of wetting front however for the 10 and 11 groups of tests with the change in slope coefficient the change in water infiltration was not significant the overall comparative analysis shows that the mean absolute error mae of the measured and simulated values of cumulative infiltration varies between 203 ml and 1312 ml with an average of 570 ml the rmse values vary from 211 ml to 1444 ml with an average of 641 ml the mae values of the horizontal distance of wetting front migration vary between 0 54 cm and 2 04 cm with an average of 0 96 cm the values of rmse vary from 0 54 cm to 2 04 cm with an average of 1 08 cm the mae values of the vertical distance of wetting front migration vary from 0 62 cm to 1 67 cm with an average of 1 23 cm the values of rmse vary from 0 73 cm to 1 95 cm with an average of 1 44 cm the mae values are negative indicating that eq 1 for soil moisture movement underestimates infiltration the data in the table suggest that the model can effectively simulate soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions 3 establishment of an infiltration model 3 1 model of cumulative infiltration 3 1 1 parameter fitting of the kostiakov lewis model in the study four soil infiltration models were selected as references the kostiakov lewis model horton model philip model and jiang dingsheng model the horton model is a physical model that can describe both soil infiltration characteristics and water infiltration processes but the model is complex the philip model is relatively simple but its simulation error is large the jiang dingsheng model is suitable for cases where the soil density is high and the infiltration time is long but its application range is limited in addition the experimental data were used to fit different infiltration models and the fitting accuracy was as follows kostiakov lewis model horton model philip model and jiang dingsheng model therefore this study used the kostiakov lewis model the kostiakov lewis model is an improved model based on the kostiakov model the model is simple in form and is a traditional

infiltration rate to calculate the cumulative infiltration capacity under different experimental conditions the three parameters f k and α in the kostiakov lewis model were simultaneously optimized the fitting results are shown in fig 3 the calculations show that the kostiakov lewis model can accurately describe cumulative infiltration under the experimental conditions r2 0 99 although the kostiakov lewis model can accurately describe the cumulative infiltration the empirical parameters in the model were difficult to determine due to changes in boundary conditions on the basis of kostiakov lewis model the new model involved the parameters of channel bottom width infiltration head soil bulk density soil initial moisture content and slope coefficient the cumulative infiltration

migration and the infiltration time can be related via the following equation 16 x at0 5 b where a and b are fitting parameters to calculate the horizontal distance of wetting front migration under different experimental conditions the nonlinear fitting of eq 16 is performed using matlab the fitting result is shown in fig 4 notably eq 16 can effectively describe the horizontal distance of wetting front migration under the test conditions r2 0 99 3 2 2 changes in parameters according to the results of the obtained model parameters a and b are positively or negatively correlated with γ ω d h and m as shown in table 4 according to the linear fitting results the r2 value of each fitting equation varies from 0 7802 to 0 9989 this range suggests that good linear relationships exist between the fitting parameters and set variables 3 2 3 establishment of the horizontal distance model the above analysis suggests that the parameters a and b in the model have good linear relationships with γ ω d h and m spss software was used to perform linear regression analysis involving coefficients a and b and the relationships between the two parameters and γ ω d h and m were

parameter fitting the experimental data suggest that the vertical distance of wetting front migration and the infiltration time are related via the following expression hunt et al 2017 20 z ct0 5 where c is a fitting parameter to calculate the vertical distance of wetting front migration based on different experimental conditions the nonlinear fitting of eq 20 is performed using matlab the fitting results are shown in fig 5 notably eq 20 can effectively describe the vertical distance of wetting front migration under test conditions r2 0 98 3 3 2 changes in parameters according to the results of the obtained model the parameter c is positively or negatively correlated with γ ω d h and m as shown in table 5 according to the linear fitting results the r2 value of each fitting equation varies from 0 708 to 0 9975 this range suggests that good linear relationships exist between the fitting parameter and set variables 3 3 3 model establishment the above analysis suggests that the parameter c in the model exhibits good linear relationships with γ ω d h and m spss software is used to perform linear regression analysis for c and the relationship between the parameter and γ ω

of the wetting front the parameters f k α a b and c were calculated using eqs 12 14 eqs 17 18 and eq 21 under 11 different experimental conditions furthermore the error analysis was performed between the parameters calculated by the formula and the parameters obtained by fitting the above experimental data in addition the relative error between the fitted values and calculated values was calculated and results are shown in tables 6 and 7 as can be seen the average absolute values of the relative error of the parameters f k α a b and c under 11 different experimental conditions are 3 73 8 81 7 7 4 31 1 43 and 2 94 respectively these values indicate that the established model can effectively describe soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions to further verify the accuracy of the model cumulative infiltration and the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration were calculated using eqs 14 19 and 22 under 11 different experimental conditions the calculated values were then compared with the measured values and a comparison of the results is shown in fig 6 notably fig 6 indicates that the measured and calculated value of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration are distributed around the 1 1 line under the experimental conditions these results suggest that the proposed models can effectively simulate the cumulative infiltration process and the migration distance of the wetting front under the experimental conditions 4 model simplification 4 1 importance analysis of factors that influence the model fitting parameters in the above mentioned newly built models 14 19 and 22 the structural form is relatively complicated to simplify the structure of the model and ensure its accuracy and practicability the standard regression coefficient bj of the soil bulk density γ the initial water content ω the channel bottom width d the infiltration water head h and the slope coefficient m were calculated for each fitting parameter in eqs 12 14 17 18 and 21 the absolute values of each coefficient reflect the effects of each influential factor on the fitting parameters these values can be used to eliminate the factors that have the smallest effects on the fitting parameters and simplify the established model the calculation results are shown in table 8 the data in table 8 suggest that in the cumulative infiltration model the effect of each influential factor on parameter f is in the following order d γ h ω m additionally these orders are d ω γ h m and ω h γ d m for parameters k and α respectively in the horizontal distance model the effects of each factor on parameter a and b have the following order ω h d γ m and d h ω γ m respectively in the vertical distance model the effect of each factor on parameter c is as follows d ω h γ m the above analysis indicates that the effects of the soil bulk density γ initial water content ω channel bottom width d and infiltration head h vary for each parameter however the influence of the slope factor m is least for each coefficient therefore the slope factor can be set to m 1 2 in the models for simplicity 23 i t 2 809γ 0 184ω 0 028d 0 012 h 3

laboratory experiments for different soil bulk density γ initial water content ω channel base width d and infiltration head h conditions using eqs 23 25 the cumulative infiltration and migration distance of the wetting front were calculated for different experimental conditions and the calculated values were compared with the simulated values as shown in fig 7 for each simulation condition the simulated and calculated values of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance were all distributed around the 1 1 line these results suggest that the proposed model can be used to effectively predict soil moisture movement under different boundary conditions to further verify the accuracy of the simplified model the mae and rmse of the calculated and simulated values of cumulative infiltration and the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration were calculated as shown in table 9 the average mae and rmse values for the simulated and calculated results of cumulative infiltration the horizontal distance of wetting front migration and the vertical distance of wetting front migration were 743 ml 867 ml and 0 06 cm and 1 11 cm 1 13 cm and 1 50 cm respectively these results indicate that the simplified model can effectively describe cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration under the simulated test conditions and that the model is reliable 5 discussion the purpose of this study was to investigate the process of water infiltration in a two dimensional section of a channel under irrigation conditions firstly based on the laboratory infiltration laboratory data and combined with the boundary characteristics of the test device the two dimensional soil water motion equation under the experimental setting conditions was developed the mean absolute error and the root mean square error between the simulated and measured values satisfied the error requirements and the numerical simulation effect was good in addition according to the experimental data the functional models of soil water infiltration horizontal distance and vertical distance of wet front migration were fitted the standard regression coefficients of soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to the fitting parameters were calculated and the effect of each factor on the fitting parameters was revealed at the same time the factors with less influence were determined and the functional model was optimized and streamlined the study achieved a visual simulation of the water infiltration process of the channel section in the cold regions of northern china however this study has only completed the laboratory test and its dynamic simulation evaluation and further study is needed for the field application and the parameter optimization of the model under normal circumstances the water infiltration process can be characterized as a two dimensional unsaturated soil water movement process which is described by the richards equation su et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in this study the initial conditions and constraints were set according to the size of the model and solved using hydrus 2d the mean absolute error and root mean square error of the simulated and measured values meet the requirements the results showed that hydrus software can solve the richards equation efficiently and accurately as arbat and duran ros 2013 proposed under irrigation conditions the results of solving the richards equation based on hydrus finite element software can effectively reveal the spatial distribution pattern of soil moisture and the dynamic process of soil moisture movement the kostiakov lewis model was improved on the basis of the kostiakov model the improved model is a relatively traditional and classical theoretical model and is usually used to characterize the process of soil water infiltration the present study attempted to apply the kostiakov lewis model to the simulation of the cumulative infiltration of the channel section and the fitting effect of the model was significant and the coefficient of determination was greater than 0 99 the conclusion of this study was consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2012 the parameters f k and α in the kostiakov lewis model had a good linear relationship with the initially set variables which was similar to the research findings of bautista et al 2014 who established a model that considered the simplified calculation of the cumulative infiltration of wet weeks but did not consider the effects of soil bulk density and initial water content on cumulative infiltration ali and ghosh 2016 and liu et al 2015 proposed the calculation model of wetting front migration distance in drip irrigation system taking into account the factors affecting drip irrigation system but the model cannot describe the wetting front migration distance in non drip irrigation systems however the present study addressed the shortcomings of previous studies additional influencing factors involved in the channel infiltration process are soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient and combined with the structural characteristics of the channel the magnitude of the slope coefficient depends on the angle of the slope with the change in the slope coefficient the pressure of the water head on the bottom of the channel and the slope changed however compared with the designed infiltration head soil bulk density and initial soil moisture content the slope coefficient had less influence on the migration distance of the wetting front with the change in slope coefficient the horizontal and vertical distance of wetting front migration changed slightly therefore these factors were eliminated in the process of optimizing the model as nie et al 2009 proposed initial soil moisture content bottom width and slope coefficient had little influence on the boundary effect of furrow irrigation while the infiltration depth soil texture and bulk density had significant influences on the boundary effect of furrow irrigation generally the calculation model established in this paper can be used to describe the cumulative infiltration and wetting front transport distance under different soil bulk density canal section and initial soil water content conditions and can also be used to describe the soil water infiltration process under furrow irrigation which can provide theoretical support for the rational design of furrow irrigation systems and irrigation systems 6 conclusions in the process of water delivery in farmland irrigation areas the soil water infiltration process conforms to the basic principles and characteristics of soil hydrodynamics the two dimensional soil water transport model based on the richards equation can better characterize the infiltration law of channel leakage water and the simulation results achieved using the finite element software hydrus 2d meet the accuracy requirements among these results the mean absolute error mae between the measured and simulated infiltration values of 11 groups of test samples was 570 ml and the mean root mean square error rmse was 640 ml in addition the mae and rmse of the horizontal and vertical distances of the wetting front were within the allowable range the results confirmed that hydrus 2d has a good simulation effect on the channel soil infiltration process based on the experimental data the models of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance considering the soil bulk density initial water content channel base width infiltration head and slope coefficient can effectively describe soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions based on the standard partial regression coefficients the effects of various factors on the fitting parameters in the calculation model were analyzed the results showed that the effects of the soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and infiltration head on model parameters were not consistent but they all influenced the model parameters the effect of the slope coefficient on each parameter was minimal so it was eliminated from the model thus a simplified calculation model considering the soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and infiltration head was established hydrus 2d software was used to simulate eight sets of experiments under different conditions and the simulated and calculated values were compared the calculated and simulated values were all distributed around the 1 1 line the average mae and rmse values were 743 ml 867 ml 0 06 cm 1 11 cm 1 13 cm and 1 50 cm for the eight experiments these results indicate that the established model can describe the infiltration process under different conditions this study proposes a model based on soil bulk density initial moisture content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize the channel soil moisture accumulation infiltration wetting front migration level and vertical distance the model addresses the weakness of the uncertainty of the empirical parameters of the previous infiltration model and efficiently and accurately simulates the dynamic channel soil infiltration process combined with the highest limit of channel leakage and the standard of agricultural water resources irrigation efficiency the model can effectively verify the rationality and reliability of channel section design and provide a theoretical reference for the planning and operation of regional farmland irrigation areas however this paper only uses laboratory infiltration experiments to verify the feasibility of the theory and the application of the model and farmland scale simulation and prediction will be the focus of the next step acknowledgements this research was supported by funds from the national natural science foundation of china

11191,to determine the main influencing factors of the two dimensional process of channel section infiltration an accurate and effective soil water infiltration model was constructed to dynamically simulate the infiltration process of farmland irrigation channels based on laboratory experiments an infiltration system consisting of a water supply unit and a cuboid plexiglass unit was set up five different initial conditions were established for soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient on this basis the cumulative infiltration and wet front processes along the section of the artificial channel were explored and the two dimensional soil water motion equation under the experimental setting conditions was established the model was solved using hydrus 2d software and an error analysis between the simulated value and the measured value was carried out the results show that the software simulation results are good additionally based on the experimental data models of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance were proposed according to the modeling results the standard regression coefficients of each influential factor were calculated for the fitting parameters and the effect of each factor on the fitting parameters was analyzed the error analysis showed that the established model of soil water movement could effectively simulate the process of soil water infiltration under experimental conditions the analysis of the standard regression coefficients suggested that the slope coefficient had the smallest influence on the fitting parameters and could be eliminated the model results showed that the calculated and measured values were all distributed around the 1 1 line and this result reflects the accuracy of the model the results can provide theoretical support for the design of irrigation systems and improve the efficiency of irrigation water use keywords laboratory experiment cumulative infiltration wetting front migration distance 1 introduction the rational design of an irrigation system can improve the efficiency of irrigation water use analyses of infiltration trends cumulative infiltration rates and the migration distance of the wetting front at different times during irrigation can improve the rational design of irrigation systems analyses of soil water infiltration trends through field experiments require extensive manpower and material resources and field work is restricted by the seasonal conditions and other factors however infiltration trends can be relatively simply and efficiently obtained through laboratory infiltration experiments and the infiltration process can be directly observed therefore such experiments have received widespread attention dialameh et al 2018 conducted a laboratory experiment in the interior of a plexiglass soil box and found that irrigation water demand was negatively correlated with the infiltration head and soil volume and quality thompson et al 2010 performed a laboratory simulation experiment of canal leakage and found that the presence of a sand layer obstructed the advancement of the wetting front specifically the layer blocked water and reduced infiltration phogat et al 2009 verified a two dimensional water balance model through laboratory experiments and studied the influence of channel height on the rise and fall of the groundwater level zhang et al 2013 designed six sets of laboratory tests using a soil box made of transparent plexiglass in the test the wet front curve was drawn directly on the plexiglass based on observations and the horizontal and vertical distances of the wet front were determined with a standard square ruler on this basis the effects of different initial water content furrow size and soil type on the change in soil wetting front were explored which provided a reference for the rational design of furrow planting systems brunson et al 2010 simulated soil water movement when the water supply head was negative i e the elevation of the irrigation water source was lower than the emitter height and concluded that the influence of the emitter radius on soil infiltration was significant the finite element model hydrus has been widely used in numerical simulations simunek et al 2005 bufon et al 2012 used hydrus 2d to simulate the cotton water content under drip irrigation conditions and the simulation results fit the measured data kandelous and šimůnek 2010 used hydrus 2d to simulate an underground drip irrigation system the root mean square error was used to evaluate the experimental results and simulation results and the corresponding relationship was found to be very good therefore this study used the domestic and foreign mature hydrus simulation technology to simulate the process of soil water infiltration and on this basis combined with various influencing factors of channel infiltration focused on the construction and verification of the infiltration model numerous scholars have conducted research to establish infiltration models based on the four classical infiltration models philip model kostiakov lewis model kostiakov model and horton model of soil water dynamics for furrow irrigation zhang et al 2012 analyzed the influences of various factors on cumulative infiltration using the path analysis method and the weight coefficient of each influencing factor on soil water infiltration was clarified which provided a reference for the optimization and streamlining of the next infiltration model nie et al 2009 developed a model of soil water movement for furrow irrigation based on a numerical simulation and deduced a calculation method of cumulative infiltration ali and ghosh 2016 proposed a method for determining the wetting front propulsion time and potential groundwater recharge for different water depths this method provided a technical reference for the design of artificial groundwater recharge facilities in irrigation systems liu et al 2015 established a semi empirical model for calculating the migration distance of the wetting front under drip irrigation conditions using the dimensional analysis method the proposed model was evaluated and the rationality of the model was validated al ogaidi et al 2016 used transparent plexiglass plates as containers to monitor the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration in the infiltration process under different conditions in real time then an empirical model for estimating wetting front migration under different water use times under drip irrigation was proposed the same procedure was used to establish a predictive model and good agreement was observed between predicted and measured values the above results suggest that hydrus 2d software can be used to simulate laboratory experiments and study the infiltration trends of channels although extensive research on infiltration models has been performed by scholars worldwide the influences of soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and slope coefficient on the fitting parameters of the model were not considered which is a limitation of existing models based on the previous research the present study was conducted to describe the characteristics of canal infiltration under different initial conditions the aim was to develop a model based on soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize the cumulative infiltration of the channel and horizontal distance and vertical distance of wetting front migration and to provide an accurate and effective simulation of the channel infiltration process in this study the laboratory experiment of channel infiltration under different initial conditions was designed and the soil water motion equation was simulated using hydrus 2d on this basis a calculation model based on soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance was established and the model was streamlined and optimized the study provides a scientific reference for rationally designing irrigation schemes and improving irrigation water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 experimental equipment the experimental equipment consisted of a cuboid plexiglass container and a water supply system a mariotte flask fig 1 in the experiment the transparent plexiglass containers were mainly used to store soil samples and observe the migration of infiltration wetting front while the water supply system provided water under different water head pressure scenarios for the infiltration process the cuboid plexiglass container was made from 10 mm thick plexiglass material the device was 60 cm long ab section 20 cm wide ac section and 110 cm high ad section the rear side of the soil device was affixed with a scale bar that could directly collect data the mariotte flask with a flexible hose was connected to a 10 mm diameter rubber hole on the device surface to supply water the diameter of mariotte flask was 20 cm and the height was 80 cm 2 1 2 experimental soil samples the experimental soil samples were taken from the experimental field of the school of conservancy and civil engineering northeast agricultural university harbin city in may 2017 the soil samples were collected at a depth of 10 30 cm according to the soil classification standards formulated by the united states department of agriculture usda the soil type used in this experiment is sandy loam the soil was passed through a 2 mm sieve before being packed into the experimental device before packing the soil was watered until the intended initial soil water content was reached combined with the average soil water content of the channel the soil liquid limit and plastic limit index the initial soil water content was set at 7 15 and 25 the soil was loaded and compacted into the experimental soil device in 10 cm increments to obtain the required bulk density and homogeneous soil profile at the same time the dry density of soil was set at 1 3 1 35 and 1 4 g cm3 2 1 3 experimental procedure the laboratory experiment was conducted in the school of conservancy and civil engineering northeast agricultural university in spring 2017 the experimental procedure is shown in table 1 eleven sets of experiments were performed under different soil bulk density initial water content channel base width infiltration head and slope coefficient horizontal distance in unit height under certain slope conditions conditions three experiments with different values were established for each independent variable experiments 1 2 and 3 were infiltration processes with different bulk densities experiments 1 4 and 5 were infiltration processes with different initial water contents etc in these experiments all other variables remained unchanged in the initial condition setting process the farmland channel section size design and water delivery standard design requirements were strictly adhered to and the section was scaled the specific scheme design is shown in table 1 below at the beginning of the experiment the soil samples were filled into the device according to the experimental procedure then base of the mariotte flask inlet was adjusted to produce the designed infiltration head water was quickly added to the soil box to reach the designed infiltration head simultaneously the water stop on the water supply pipe was opened and the height of the air inlet pipe was fine tuned after the experiment started readings were collected from the mariotte flask every 5 min and the wetting front curve was plotted every 10 min after the experiment was conducted for some time the time intervals used to collect readings and plot curves were extended according to the infiltration rate and the migration distance of the wetting front a camera was used to record the location of the wetting front after the experiment and the data was then organized 2 2 numerical simulation of the laboratory experiment 2 2 1 soil water movement model the channel infiltration process under the designed experimental conditions can be simplified to the problem of two dimensional

saturated hydraulic conductivity cm min m n and α are empirical coefficients and m 1 1 n in the study the original soil sample was taken with a ring knife and saturated in distilled water layer for 24 h after the sample reached full saturation it was taken out and dried and weighed then the samples were dehydrated in a centrifuge at different rotational speeds the rotational speeds were set at 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 r min and different rotational speeds represent different soil matrix potentials soil suction the time for each rotation was predetermined to be 100 min after each rotation was completed the ring cutter was taken out the centrifuged moisture was dried and the balance was weighed using a precision of 0 01 g at the end of the final measurement the ring knife was taken out and put into the thermostat and dried at 105 for 8 h then weighed and points corresponding to the matrix potential and soil moisture content were obtained providing the soil moisture characteristic curve in the measurement of saturated hydraulic conductivity the undisturbed soil obtained by the ring knife was immersed in water for 12 h after the ring knife was removed an empty ring knife was put on the ring knife that was full of saturated soil the joint was sealed with adhesive tape to prevent leakage then the joined ring knives were placed on the funnel and a 100 ml beaker was placed beneath the funnel water was added to the empty ring knife above until the water surface was 1 mm lower than the ring knife edge when the first drop of water dropped from the funnel a stopwatch to record the time every 1 2 3 5 10 t n min the beaker under the funnel was emptied and replaced and the amount of water at each time point was recorded as q 1 q 2 q 3 q n after each change of the beaker water was added to the upper ring knife until the water surface reached the original height and the water temperature was recorded with a thermometer the formula for calculating the total amount of water seeping was as follows 5 q q 1 q 2 q 3 q n 10 s in the formula q 1 q 2 q 3 q n represent the amount of water seepage at each time point and s represents the cross sectional area the calculation formula for permeability coefficient was as follows 6 v 10 q n t n s the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil was obtained as follows 7 k t 10 q n l t n s h l v l h l in the formula l represents the thickness of the soil layer and h represents the thickness of the water layer to facilitate the comparison of the k t values obtained at different temperatures the values were converted to a saturated hydraulic conductivity at 10 c 8 k 10 k t 0 7 0 03 t 0 in the formula t represents the water temperature at the time of measurement in addition in the process of determining the soil water characteristic curve equation the above measured soil matrix potential and water content data were used and the parameters m n α in the vg m model were obtained by using the nonlinear fitting toolbox lsqcurvefi in matlab hardie et al 2013 huang et al 2006 zlotnik et al 2007 jacinto et al 2009 2 2 2 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the model are shown in fig 2 initial conditions under the designed experimental conditions the soil moisture profile is a stable profile therefore the initial condition of the model is that all the points in the calculation area have the same matric potential 9 h x z t z h 0 x z ω t 0 where h0 is the initial matric potential cm ω is the calculated area the area of the wetting front was measured using standard graph paper and the length of each square unit was 1 cm and the horizontal and vertical distances of the area were recorded simultaneously and z 0 at the lowest point of the simulated area boundary conditions during the test efq represents the infiltration boundary of the pressure head as shown in fig 2 and it maintains a constant infiltration head h0 cm the atmospheric boundaries qg and gc are covered with plastic film and evaporation can be neglected to create zero flux boundaries the left boundary ea is the symmetry axis and the horizontal flux is 0 the right boundary cb is regarded as a zero flux surface the lower boundary ab contains drainage holes during the test the wetting front does not reach the base of the soil box and does not affect the process of soil water infiltration the constant initial conditions are established to create a free drainage boundary in summary the boundary conditions can be expressed as follows 10 h z d 0 t t 0 q f and f e k h h z k h 0 t 0 g c k h h z 1 sin α k h h x cos α 0 t 0 g q h x 0 t 0 e a and c b h h 0 t 0 a b where t is the duration of the experiment min 2 2 3 numeral calculations to solve the above partial differential eq 1 the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration and cumulative infiltration under the experimental design procedure were simulated using hydrus 2d software the simulation results and the measured results were compared and analyzed and the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of the simulated and measured values were calculated as shown in table 2 franses 2015 chai and draxler 2014 gough 2014 according to the data in table 2 the cumulative infiltration of soil moisture was 55671 ml under the conditions of group 1 and with the increase of soil dry density the cumulative infiltration of soil moisture was reduced by 21 596 ml and 43 033 ml in group 2 and 3 respectively at the same time the change trends of the water infiltration wetting front under different dry densities were compared and analyzed it was found that the change trend of the water infiltration wetting front was consistent with the cumulative soil infiltration showing that it decreased with the increase of soil dry density in addition with the change of soil initial moisture content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient the soil cumulative infiltration showed a certain increasing or decreasing trend and it was positively correlated with the horizontal distance and vertical distance of wetting front however for the 10 and 11 groups of tests with the change in slope coefficient the change in water infiltration was not significant the overall comparative analysis shows that the mean absolute error mae of the measured and simulated values of cumulative infiltration varies between 203 ml and 1312 ml with an average of 570 ml the rmse values vary from 211 ml to 1444 ml with an average of 641 ml the mae values of the horizontal distance of wetting front migration vary between 0 54 cm and 2 04 cm with an average of 0 96 cm the values of rmse vary from 0 54 cm to 2 04 cm with an average of 1 08 cm the mae values of the vertical distance of wetting front migration vary from 0 62 cm to 1 67 cm with an average of 1 23 cm the values of rmse vary from 0 73 cm to 1 95 cm with an average of 1 44 cm the mae values are negative indicating that eq 1 for soil moisture movement underestimates infiltration the data in the table suggest that the model can effectively simulate soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions 3 establishment of an infiltration model 3 1 model of cumulative infiltration 3 1 1 parameter fitting of the kostiakov lewis model in the study four soil infiltration models were selected as references the kostiakov lewis model horton model philip model and jiang dingsheng model the horton model is a physical model that can describe both soil infiltration characteristics and water infiltration processes but the model is complex the philip model is relatively simple but its simulation error is large the jiang dingsheng model is suitable for cases where the soil density is high and the infiltration time is long but its application range is limited in addition the experimental data were used to fit different infiltration models and the fitting accuracy was as follows kostiakov lewis model horton model philip model and jiang dingsheng model therefore this study used the kostiakov lewis model the kostiakov lewis model is an improved model based on the kostiakov model the model is simple in form and is a traditional classical model it can accurately and effectively describe the infiltration process of soil which can be expressed as follows 11 i t ft ktα where k and α are empirical parameters and f is the steady infiltration rate to calculate the cumulative infiltration capacity under different experimental conditions the three parameters f k and α in the kostiakov lewis model were simultaneously optimized the fitting results are shown in fig 3 the calculations show that the kostiakov lewis model can accurately describe cumulative infiltration under the experimental conditions r2 0 99 although the kostiakov lewis model can accurately describe the cumulative infiltration the empirical parameters in the model were difficult to determine due to changes in boundary conditions on the basis of kostiakov lewis model the new model involved the parameters of channel bottom width infiltration head soil bulk density soil initial moisture content and slope coefficient the cumulative infiltration

migration and the infiltration time can be related via the following equation 16 x at0 5 b where a and b are fitting parameters to calculate the horizontal distance of wetting front migration under different experimental conditions the nonlinear fitting of eq 16 is performed using matlab the fitting result is shown in fig 4 notably eq 16 can effectively describe the horizontal distance of wetting front migration under the test conditions r2 0 99 3 2 2 changes in parameters according to the results of the obtained model parameters a and b are positively or negatively correlated with γ ω d h and m as shown in table 4 according to the linear fitting results the r2 value of each fitting equation varies from 0 7802 to 0 9989 this range suggests that good linear relationships exist between the fitting parameters and set variables 3 2 3 establishment of the horizontal distance model the above analysis suggests that the parameters a and b in the model have good linear relationships with γ ω d h and m spss software was used to perform linear regression analysis involving coefficients a and b and the relationships between the two parameters and γ ω d h and m were obtained 17 a 4 336γ 2 388ω 0 016d 0 028 h 0 092 m 6 187 r2 0 799 p 0 05 18 b 16 490γ 9 699ω 0 959d 0 347 h 1 343 m 16 971 r2 0 969 p 0 01 finally the horizontal distance model considering γ ω d h and

parameter fitting the experimental data suggest that the vertical distance of wetting front migration and the infiltration time are related via the following expression hunt et al 2017 20 z ct0 5 where c is a fitting parameter to calculate the vertical distance of wetting front migration based on different experimental conditions the nonlinear fitting of eq 20 is performed using matlab the fitting results are shown in fig 5 notably eq 20 can effectively describe the vertical distance of wetting front migration under test conditions r2 0 98 3 3 2 changes in parameters according to the results of the obtained model the parameter c is positively or negatively correlated with γ ω d h and m as shown in table 5 according to the linear fitting results the r2 value of each fitting equation varies from 0 708 to 0 9975 this range suggests that good linear relationships exist between the fitting parameter and set variables 3 3 3 model establishment the above analysis suggests that the parameter c in the model exhibits good linear relationships with γ ω d h and m spss software is used to perform linear regression analysis for c and the relationship between the parameter and γ ω

of the wetting front the parameters f k α a b and c were calculated using eqs 12 14 eqs 17 18 and eq 21 under 11 different experimental conditions furthermore the error analysis was performed between the parameters calculated by the formula and the parameters obtained by fitting the above experimental data in addition the relative error between the fitted values and calculated values was calculated and results are shown in tables 6 and 7 as can be seen the average absolute values of the relative error of the parameters f k α a b and c under 11 different experimental conditions are 3 73 8 81 7 7 4 31 1 43 and 2 94 respectively these values indicate that the established model can effectively describe soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions to further verify the accuracy of the model cumulative infiltration and the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration were calculated using eqs 14 19 and 22 under 11 different experimental conditions the calculated values were then compared with the measured values and a comparison of the results is shown in fig 6 notably fig 6 indicates that the measured and calculated value of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration are distributed around the 1 1 line under the experimental conditions these results suggest that the proposed models can effectively simulate the cumulative infiltration process and the migration distance of the wetting front under the experimental conditions 4 model simplification 4 1 importance analysis of factors that influence the model fitting parameters in the above mentioned newly built models 14 19 and 22 the structural form is relatively complicated to simplify the structure of the model and ensure its accuracy and practicability the standard regression coefficient bj of the soil bulk density γ the initial water content ω the channel bottom width d the infiltration water head h and the slope coefficient m were calculated for each fitting parameter in eqs 12 14 17 18 and 21 the absolute values of each coefficient reflect the effects of each influential factor on the fitting parameters these values can be used to eliminate the factors that have the smallest effects on the fitting parameters and simplify the established model the calculation results are shown in table 8 the data in table 8 suggest that in the cumulative infiltration model the effect of each influential factor on parameter f is in the following order d γ h ω m additionally these orders are d ω γ h m and ω h γ d m for parameters k and α respectively in the horizontal distance model the effects of each factor on parameter a and b have the following order ω h d γ m and d h ω γ m respectively in the vertical distance model the effect of each factor on parameter c is as follows d ω h γ m the above analysis indicates that the effects of the soil bulk density γ initial water content ω channel bottom width d and infiltration head h vary for each parameter however the influence of the slope factor m is least for each coefficient therefore the slope factor can be set to m 1 2 in the models for simplicity 23 i t 2 809γ 0 184ω 0 028d 0 012 h 3

laboratory experiments for different soil bulk density γ initial water content ω channel base width d and infiltration head h conditions using eqs 23 25 the cumulative infiltration and migration distance of the wetting front were calculated for different experimental conditions and the calculated values were compared with the simulated values as shown in fig 7 for each simulation condition the simulated and calculated values of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance were all distributed around the 1 1 line these results suggest that the proposed model can be used to effectively predict soil moisture movement under different boundary conditions to further verify the accuracy of the simplified model the mae and rmse of the calculated and simulated values of cumulative infiltration and the horizontal and vertical distances of wetting front migration were calculated as shown in table 9 the average mae and rmse values for the simulated and calculated results of cumulative infiltration the horizontal distance of wetting front migration and the vertical distance of wetting front migration were 743 ml 867 ml and 0 06 cm and 1 11 cm 1 13 cm and 1 50 cm respectively these results indicate that the simplified model can effectively describe cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration under the simulated test conditions and that the model is reliable 5 discussion the purpose of this study was to investigate the process of water infiltration in a two dimensional section of a channel under irrigation conditions firstly based on the laboratory infiltration laboratory data and combined with the boundary characteristics of the test device the two dimensional soil water motion equation under the experimental setting conditions was developed the mean absolute error and the root mean square error between the simulated and measured values satisfied the error requirements and the numerical simulation effect was good in addition according to the experimental data the functional models of soil water infiltration horizontal distance and vertical distance of wet front migration were fitted the standard regression coefficients of soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to the fitting parameters were calculated and the effect of each factor on the fitting parameters was revealed at the same time the factors with less influence were determined and the functional model was optimized and streamlined the study achieved a visual simulation of the water infiltration process of the channel section in the cold regions of northern china however this study has only completed the laboratory test and its dynamic simulation evaluation and further study is needed for the field application and the parameter optimization of the model under normal circumstances the water infiltration process can be characterized as a two dimensional unsaturated soil water movement process which is described by the richards equation su et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in this study the initial conditions and constraints were set according to the size of the model and solved using hydrus 2d the mean absolute error and root mean square error of the simulated and measured values meet the requirements the results showed that hydrus software can solve the richards equation efficiently and accurately as arbat and duran ros 2013 proposed under irrigation conditions the results of solving the richards equation based on hydrus finite element software can effectively reveal the spatial distribution pattern of soil moisture and the dynamic process of soil moisture movement the kostiakov lewis model was improved on the basis of the kostiakov model the improved model is a relatively traditional and classical theoretical model and is usually used to characterize the process of soil water infiltration the present study attempted to apply the kostiakov lewis model to the simulation of the cumulative infiltration of the channel section and the fitting effect of the model was significant and the coefficient of determination was greater than 0 99 the conclusion of this study was consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2012 the parameters f k and α in the kostiakov lewis model had a good linear relationship with the initially set variables which was similar to the research findings of bautista et al 2014 who established a model that considered the simplified calculation of the cumulative infiltration of wet weeks but did not consider the effects of soil bulk density and initial water content on cumulative infiltration ali and ghosh 2016 and liu et al 2015 proposed the calculation model of wetting front migration distance in drip irrigation system taking into account the factors affecting drip irrigation system but the model cannot describe the wetting front migration distance in non drip irrigation systems however the present study addressed the shortcomings of previous studies additional influencing factors involved in the channel infiltration process are soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient and combined with the structural characteristics of the channel the magnitude of the slope coefficient depends on the angle of the slope with the change in the slope coefficient the pressure of the water head on the bottom of the channel and the slope changed however compared with the designed infiltration head soil bulk density and initial soil moisture content the slope coefficient had less influence on the migration distance of the wetting front with the change in slope coefficient the horizontal and vertical distance of wetting front migration changed slightly therefore these factors were eliminated in the process of optimizing the model as nie et al 2009 proposed initial soil moisture content bottom width and slope coefficient had little influence on the boundary effect of furrow irrigation while the infiltration depth soil texture and bulk density had significant influences on the boundary effect of furrow irrigation generally the calculation model established in this paper can be used to describe the cumulative infiltration and wetting front transport distance under different soil bulk density canal section and initial soil water content conditions and can also be used to describe the soil water infiltration process under furrow irrigation which can provide theoretical support for the rational design of furrow irrigation systems and irrigation systems 6 conclusions in the process of water delivery in farmland irrigation areas the soil water infiltration process conforms to the basic principles and characteristics of soil hydrodynamics the two dimensional soil water transport model based on the richards equation can better characterize the infiltration law of channel leakage water and the simulation results achieved using the finite element software hydrus 2d meet the accuracy requirements among these results the mean absolute error mae between the measured and simulated infiltration values of 11 groups of test samples was 570 ml and the mean root mean square error rmse was 640 ml in addition the mae and rmse of the horizontal and vertical distances of the wetting front were within the allowable range the results confirmed that hydrus 2d has a good simulation effect on the channel soil infiltration process based on the experimental data the models of cumulative infiltration and wetting front migration distance considering the soil bulk density initial water content channel base width infiltration head and slope coefficient can effectively describe soil moisture movement under the experimental conditions based on the standard partial regression coefficients the effects of various factors on the fitting parameters in the calculation model were analyzed the results showed that the effects of the soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and infiltration head on model parameters were not consistent but they all influenced the model parameters the effect of the slope coefficient on each parameter was minimal so it was eliminated from the model thus a simplified calculation model considering the soil bulk density initial water content channel bottom width and infiltration head was established hydrus 2d software was used to simulate eight sets of experiments under different conditions and the simulated and calculated values were compared the calculated and simulated values were all distributed around the 1 1 line the average mae and rmse values were 743 ml 867 ml 0 06 cm 1 11 cm 1 13 cm and 1 50 cm for the eight experiments these results indicate that the established model can describe the infiltration process under different conditions this study proposes a model based on soil bulk density initial moisture content channel bottom width infiltration head and slope coefficient to characterize the channel soil moisture accumulation infiltration wetting front migration level and vertical distance the model addresses the weakness of the uncertainty of the empirical parameters of the previous infiltration model and efficiently and accurately simulates the dynamic channel soil infiltration process combined with the highest limit of channel leakage and the standard of agricultural water resources irrigation efficiency the model can effectively verify the rationality and reliability of channel section design and provide a theoretical reference for the planning and operation of regional farmland irrigation areas however this paper only uses laboratory infiltration experiments to verify the feasibility of the theory and the application of the model and farmland scale simulation and prediction will be the focus of the next step acknowledgements this research was supported by funds from the national natural science foundation of china

capacity ranged from 10 to 221 kg ha 1 for wheat season and from 14 to 212 kg ha 1 for maize season which were mostly less than 100 kg ha 1 in the region the agronomic optimum n rates for wheat and maize were 46 221 and 44 250 kg n ha 1 with means of 110 and 127 kg n ha 1 respectively the environmentally safe n rates were 19 248 kg n ha 1 with mean of 107 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 36 209 kg n ha 1

calculated according to the given concentration soil bulk density and the corresponding soil depth in cases there were no bulk density available we assumed a value of 1 35 g cm 3 which is typical for the mineral soils in the region besides we also collected such data of some soil properties of the plough layer soils as ph soil organic matter som olsen p and exchangeable k appendix a 2 2 data

2010 of which the linear plus plateau model has been proved to be the best one in northern china chen et al 2004 cui et al 2008a 2008b 2010 zhang et al 2015 thus in this study linear plateau model was

nitrate nitrogen up to 100 cm and 200 cm were available at the same experiments the linear plateau or plateau linear models were fitted with spss 18 0 software package spss inc chicago illinois usa 3 results 3 1 response of wheat yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rate there were 33 out of 76 experiments where both the responses of wheat yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rates could be well fitted by linear plateau and plateau linear model respectively table 1 as shown by examples from 6 experiments in fig 1 the agronomic optimum n rates at which the maximum yield was obtained ranged from 46 to 221 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 110 kg n ha 1 the corresponding maximum yield for winter wheat ranged from 3909 to 7643 kg ha 1 with an average of 5960 kg ha 1 the environmentally safe n rate varied from 19 to 248 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 107 kg n ha 1 the no3 n buffer capacity ranged widely from 12 to 221 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 71 kg ha 1 there were 17 out of 76 experiments where wheat yield showed no response to n rate but their no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth could be successfully described by plateau linear model as shown by examples from 5 experiments fig 2 a and b wheat yield receiving no n fertilizer ranged from 2 8 to 8 5 t ha 1 with a mean value of 5 0 t ha 1 the environmentally safe n rates ranged from 38 to 183 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 109 kg n ha 1 the no3 n buffer capacity in 0 100 cm soil depth varied from 10 94 kg ha 1 with a mean of 49 kg ha 1 when take soil types into consideration we can divide the 50 experiments into three categories as anthrosols fluvisols and cambisols with mean no3 n buffer capacity of 60 63 and 70 kg ha 1 respectively in addition there were 9 out of 76 experiments where no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate while wheat yield could be described by linear plateau model as shown by 5 example experiments in fig 3 a and b the agronomic optimum n rates ranged from 53 to 156 kg n ha 1 with the mean value of 112 kg n ha 1 the corresponding maximum yield ranged from 4 0 7 3 t ha 1 with a mean value of 5 7 t ha 1 the no3 n content ranged from 4 117 kg ha 1 under no n fertilizer applied with a mean value of 60 kg ha 1 there were 17 out of 76 experiments where both crop yield and no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate could not be described by linear plateau and plateau linear model as shown by 5 example experiments in fig 4 a and b wheat yield receiving no n fertilizer fluctuated from 3 8 to 8 9 t ha 1 while their soil no3 n contents at harvest in 0 100 cm depth ranged from 10 to 135 kg ha 1 the no3 n contents were linearly increased with n rate in most cases fig 4b to further understand the difference of soil no3 n buffer capacity at different soil depths we compared those calculated from the data of 0 100 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths fig 5 a and b the result indicated that the no3 n buffer capacity derived from 0 to 200 cm was generally greater than that from 0 to 100 cm soil depth but the environmentally optimum n rate at no3 n buffer capacity was much the same for two soil depths 3 2 response of maize yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rate similar to wheat there were 27 out of 73 experiments where linear plateau and plateau linear model could be applied to well fit the response of maize yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rates respectively table 2 as illustrated by examples from 6 experiments in fig 6 the agronomic optimum n rates varied from 44 to 250 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 124 kg n ha 1 the corresponding grain yield of maize ranged widely from 4079 to 12 133 kg ha 1 with a mean of 8201 kg ha 1 the environmentally safe n rates varied from 43 to 209 kg n ha 1 with a mean of 99 kg n ha 1 the no3 n buffer capacity was in the range of 14 to 212 kg ha 1 with a mean of 70 kg ha 1 for 23 out of 73 experiments maize yield showed no response to n rate but the no3 n content at harvest could be well described by plateau linear model as presented in fig 2c and d by examples from 5 experiments maize grain yields of 3 2 12 0 t ha 1 were obtained with no addition of n fertilizer fig 2c the environmentally safe n rates varied in amount from 36 to 209 kg n ha 1 and 99 kg n ha 1 on average fig 2d the no3 n buffer capacity was between 19 and 159 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 60 kg ha 1 similar to wheat 50 maize experiments could be generally grouped into three soil types as anthrosols fluvisols and cambisols with mean no3 n buffer capacity of 54 56 and 83 kg ha 1 respectively besides there were 11 out of 73 experiments where no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate while the relationship between yield and n rate could be successfully fitted by linear plateau model as presented in fig 3c and d by examples from 5 experiments the agronomic optimum n rates ranged from 76 to 189 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 132 kg n ha 1 the corresponding maximum grain yield ranged from 6 5 to 10 5 t ha 1 with a mean of 8 3 t ha 1 the no3 n content with no n fertilizer ranged from 24 138 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 66 kg ha 1 there were 12 out of 73 experiments where the response of soil no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil profile to n rate could not be fitted by plateau linear model neither was the maize yield in most of the cases as shown by examples from 5 experiments fig 4c and d maize yield of 3 3 10 7 t ha 1 were obtained and no3 n content varied from 11 to 107 kg ha 1 where no fertilizer n were applied generally no3 n content showed plateau or linear increase with n rates the no3 n buffer capacity derived from the data of 0 200 cm soil profile was much greater than from 0 to 100 cm soil fig 5c and d however the environmentally optimum n rate showed no consistent trend between two soil depths 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crop yield and soil nitrate nitrogen content to nitrogen fertilizer our analysis reflected that more than 40 of the experiments collected showed no yield responses to n application this might largely due to the high residue n in the soil profile as demonstrated by high yields of wheat and maize mean values of 5 6 and 6 4 t ha 1 respectively in control plots receiving no n input since the other plant nutrients those might constraint crop performance such as p and k were sufficiently supplied except for n application and same crop varieties were used for a given experiment furthermore the abnormal environmental conditions that may influence crop performance under which the data of n rate experiments being obtained have not been presented in the literatures this speculation can also be seen to be the case that the eight experiments available in our database had an average initial no3 n content of 194 kg ha 1 in 0 100 cm depth soil profile in addition the high level of n contained in the irrigation water in some cases might also be the cause of this no response zhang et al 2015 the data analysis also showed that the plateau linear model was not applicable to describe the relationship between no3 n content in soil profile against n rate for more than 30 of the database under such condition soil no3 n content tended to be linearly increased with the increase of n application rates for most of experiments except for in fewer cases where the soil no3 n contents were remained relatively unchanged with increasing n application rates the first possible reason for this observation is the high residue n in the soil at the beginning of the experiment which was close to or much beyond the soil buffer capacity to no3 n therefore the effect of nitrogen fertilizer applied on crop yield was masked but led to the linear increase in soil no3 n content because of little uptake by crops certainly this case may also be coupled with the higher soil organic matter content in the soils which can also contribute larger amount of n to meet the need of the crops the second reason is the unexpected water supply for instance heavy rainfall following irrigation or persistent rainfall might push no3 n down to deeper layer beyond 100 cm depth during the period of experiment consequently the soil no3 n content remained at a similar level to that of control where no n fertilizer was given 4 2 soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity the mean value of soil nitrate n buffer capacity after harvesting winter wheat 64 kg ha 1 and summer maize 66 kg ha 1 was quite same and these values were in the ranges of 10 to 221 kg ha 1 and from 14 to 212 kg ha 1 respectively across all soil types with varying textures from sandy loam to clay loam in northern china in addition values of soil nitrate n buffer capacity derived from 86 of experiments for both wheat and maize were lower than 100 kg ha 1 under rain fed condition soil nitrate n buffer capacity in 100 cm soil profile was estimated to be 29 to 143 kg ha 1 with a mean of 75 kg ha 1 for winter wheat in the loess plateau xie et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 dai et al 2016 while previously published data from uk for winter wheat showed that soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity at 90 cm soil profile varied from 17 to 44 kg ha 1 with soil texture varying from sandy silt loam to clay chaney 1990 which were in the lower range of our values but the soil nitrate n buffer capacity at up to 60 cm soil depth after barley harvest in uk were between 11 to 60 kg ha 1 across various soil textures richards et al 1996 under continuous maize soil nitrate n buffer capacity of 0 90 cm soil profile ranged from 10 to 36 kg ha 1 across soil types in usa andraski et al 2000 hong et al 2007 the estimated soil nitrate n buffer capacity in 0 100 cm soil profile varied from 45 to 90 kg ha 1 after cotton harvest with different amount of water supply on a silt loam soil in xinxiang china si et al 2017 overall soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity is generally less than 100 kg ha 1 irrespective of soil types the crops grown and the quantity of water supply these evidences further support the limitation of 90 100 kg n ha 1 left in the top 90 cm soil profile after crop harvest set in europe hofman 1999 raun and johnson 1995 have discussed mechanisms of soil no3 n buffer capacity they explained the presence of soil plant buffering of inorganic n with the increased crop uptake n immobilization and gaseous losses in the soil plant system the significant positive correlation between soil no3 n buffer capacity and som in plough layer soils observed in our study suggested that the presence of buffering in nitrate nitrogen for winter wheat or across wheat and maize cropping system is most likely related to mineralization and immobilization of som in addition less impacting from soil texture on soil no3 n buffer capacity might be due to little absorption of no3 n by clay particles 4 3 environmentally safe n rate in wheat maize cropping to feed its huge population china faces great challenges to guarantee its food security particularly the quantity security therefore targeting the agronomic optimum production is the priority to farmers in agricultural practice present study found that environmentally safe n rates were greater than agronomic optimum n rates at which agronomic optimum production being achieved by 58 kg n ha 1 on average from 13 out of 33 experiments for wheat and by 40 kg n ha 1 on average from 13 out of 27 experiments for maize raun and johnson 1995 previously reported that environmentally safe n rates were higher than agronomic optimum n rates by 41 kg n ha 1 on average from four winter wheat long term experiments on silt loams and clay loam these indicated that the recommended agronomic optimum n rate not only can achieve the maximum crop yield but also can minimize the nitrate leaching risk similarly richards et al 1996 concluded that the nitrogen rate to achieve the economic optimum yield could also be used to accomplish the aim of diminishing the risk of nitrate leaching for winter barley on various soil types from sandy loams to clay loams in uk a remarkable finding from this study was that the environmentally safe n rates were lower than agronomic optimum n rates by 44 kg n ha 1 61 on average from 20 out of 33 experiments for wheat and by 86 kg n ha 1 52 on average from 14 out of 27 experiments for maize zhang et al 2018 reported that the economic optimal n application rates should be further reduced by 20 30 to minimize nitrate leaching risk for winter wheat and summer maize cropping in north china plain by considering the environmental cost these indicated that application of fertilizer nitrogen to a level up to agronomic optimum n rate at these sites could result in a large accumulation of soil no3 n which may exert a higher risk of no3 n leaching as those detected on silt loams in central pennsylvania and wisconsin of usa jemison and fox 1994 andraski et al 2000 formerly agronomic optimum n rates from 84 to 270 and 71 to 323 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively were recommended for guanzhong plain of shaanxi province in northern china zhang et al 2015 which needs to be reconsidered based on the soil no3 n buffer capacity in situ in our case wheat or maize yield at environmentally safe n rates would drop by about 13 relative to the maximum to compensate this kind of yield losses it is suggested to apply for integrated soil crop systematic management that based on the local environment drawing upon appropriate crop varieties sowing dates densities and advanced nutrient management chen et al 2014 cui et al 2018 overall in regions those are vulnerable to nitrate leaching the recommended fertilizer n rate should not exceed that for environmental safety even though we have to compromise the crop production otherwise the environmental cost may be extremely expensive 5 conclusions we found that soil nitrate n buffer capacity was generally less than 100 kg ha 1 regardless of crop and soil types under winter wheat and summer maize cropping system in northern china overall more than 50 of experiments for both wheat and maize manifested that agronomic optimum n rates were greater than the environmentally safe n rates implying the high risk of nitrate n leaching under present n recommendation it is suggested that the n rate recommended should not exceed the environmentally safe n rate in areas where the potential risk of nitrate leaching is high even though the optimum yield may not be achieved under winter wheat and

experiments where wheat yield showed no response to n rate but their no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth could be successfully described by plateau linear model as shown by examples from 5 experiments fig 2 a and b wheat yield receiving no n fertilizer ranged from 2 8 to 8 5 t ha 1 with a mean value of 5 0 t ha 1 the environmentally safe n rates ranged from 38 to 183 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 109 kg n ha 1 the no3 n buffer capacity in 0 100 cm soil depth varied from 10 94 kg ha 1 with a mean of 49 kg ha 1 when take soil types into consideration we can divide the 50 experiments into three categories as anthrosols fluvisols and cambisols with mean no3 n buffer capacity of 60 63 and 70 kg ha 1 respectively in addition there were 9 out of 76 experiments where no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate while wheat yield could be described by linear plateau model as shown by 5 example experiments in fig 3 a and b the agronomic optimum n rates ranged from 53 to 156 kg n ha 1 with the mean value of 112 kg n ha 1 the corresponding maximum yield ranged from 4 0 7 3 t ha 1 with a mean value of 5 7 t ha 1 the no3 n content ranged from 4 117 kg ha 1 under no n fertilizer applied with a mean value of 60 kg ha 1 there were 17 out of 76 experiments where both crop yield and no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate could not be described by linear plateau and plateau linear model as shown by 5 example experiments in fig 4 a and b wheat yield receiving no n fertilizer fluctuated from 3 8 to 8 9 t ha 1 while their soil no3 n contents at harvest in 0 100 cm depth ranged from 10 to 135 kg ha 1 the no3 n contents were linearly increased with n rate in most cases fig 4b to further understand the difference of soil no3 n buffer capacity at different soil depths we compared those calculated from the data of 0 100 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths fig 5 a and b the result indicated that the no3 n buffer capacity derived from 0 to 200 cm was generally greater than that from 0 to 100 cm soil depth but the environmentally optimum n rate at no3 n buffer capacity was much the same for two soil depths 3 2 response of maize yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rate similar to wheat there were 27 out of 73 experiments where linear plateau and plateau linear model could be applied to well fit the response of maize yield and no3 n content at harvest to n rates respectively table 2 as illustrated by examples from 6 experiments in fig 6 the agronomic optimum n rates varied from 44 to 250 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 124 kg n ha 1 the corresponding grain yield of maize ranged widely from 4079 to 12 133 kg ha 1 with a mean of 8201 kg ha 1 the environmentally safe n rates varied from 43 to 209 kg n ha 1 with a mean of 99 kg n ha 1 the no3 n buffer capacity was in the range of 14 to 212 kg ha 1 with a mean of 70 kg ha 1 for 23 out of 73 experiments maize yield showed no response to n rate but the no3 n content at harvest could be well described by plateau linear model as presented in fig 2c and d by examples from 5 experiments maize grain yields of 3 2 12 0 t ha 1 were obtained with no addition of n fertilizer fig 2c the environmentally safe n rates varied in amount from 36 to 209 kg n ha 1 and 99 kg n ha 1 on average fig 2d the no3 n buffer capacity was between 19 and 159 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 60 kg ha 1 similar to wheat 50 maize experiments could be generally grouped into three soil types as anthrosols fluvisols and cambisols with mean no3 n buffer capacity of 54 56 and 83 kg ha 1 respectively besides there were 11 out of 73 experiments where no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil depth showed no responses to n rate while the relationship between yield and n rate could be successfully fitted by linear plateau model as presented in fig 3c and d by examples from 5 experiments the agronomic optimum n rates ranged from 76 to 189 kg n ha 1 with a mean value of 132 kg n ha 1 the corresponding maximum grain yield ranged from 6 5 to 10 5 t ha 1 with a mean of 8 3 t ha 1 the no3 n content with no n fertilizer ranged from 24 138 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 66 kg ha 1 there were 12 out of 73 experiments where the response of soil no3 n content at harvest in 0 100 cm soil profile to n rate could not be fitted by plateau linear model neither was the maize yield in most of the cases as shown by examples from 5 experiments fig 4c and d maize yield of 3 3 10 7 t ha 1 were obtained and no3 n content varied from 11 to 107 kg ha 1 where no fertilizer n were applied generally no3 n content showed plateau or linear increase with n rates the no3 n buffer capacity derived from the data of 0 200 cm soil profile was much greater than from 0 to 100 cm soil fig 5c and d however the environmentally optimum n rate showed no consistent trend between two soil depths 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crop yield and soil nitrate nitrogen content to nitrogen fertilizer our analysis reflected that more than 40 of the experiments collected showed no yield responses to n application this might largely due to the high residue n in the soil profile as demonstrated by high yields of wheat and maize mean values of 5 6 and 6 4 t ha 1 respectively in control plots receiving no n input since the other plant nutrients those might constraint crop performance such as p and k were sufficiently supplied except for n application and same crop varieties were used for a given experiment furthermore the abnormal environmental conditions that may influence crop performance under which the data of n rate experiments being obtained have not been presented in the literatures this speculation can also be seen to be the case that the eight experiments available in our database had an average initial no3 n content of 194 kg ha 1 in 0 100 cm depth soil profile in addition the high level of n contained in the irrigation water in some cases might also be the cause of this no response zhang et al 2015 the data analysis also showed that the plateau linear model was not applicable to describe the relationship between no3 n content in soil profile against n rate for more than 30 of the database under such condition soil no3 n content tended to be linearly increased with the increase of n application rates for most of experiments except for in fewer cases where the soil no3 n contents were remained relatively unchanged with increasing n application rates the first possible reason for this observation is the high residue n in the soil at the beginning of the experiment which was close to or much beyond the soil buffer capacity to no3 n therefore the effect of nitrogen fertilizer applied on crop yield was masked but led to the linear increase in soil no3 n content because of little uptake by crops certainly this case may also be coupled with the higher soil organic matter content in the soils which can also contribute larger amount of n to meet the need of the crops the second reason is the unexpected water supply for instance heavy rainfall following irrigation or persistent rainfall might push no3 n down to deeper layer beyond 100 cm depth during the period of experiment consequently the soil no3 n content remained at a similar level to that of control where no n fertilizer was given 4 2 soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity the mean value of soil nitrate n buffer capacity after harvesting winter wheat 64 kg ha 1 and summer maize 66 kg ha 1 was quite same and these values were in the ranges of 10 to 221 kg ha 1 and from 14 to 212 kg ha 1 respectively across all soil types with varying textures from sandy loam to clay loam in northern china in addition values of soil nitrate n buffer capacity derived from 86 of experiments for both wheat and maize were lower than 100 kg ha 1 under rain fed condition soil nitrate n buffer capacity in 100 cm soil profile was estimated to be 29 to 143 kg ha 1 with a mean of 75 kg ha 1 for winter wheat in the loess plateau xie et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 dai et al 2016 while previously published data from uk for winter wheat showed that soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity at 90 cm soil profile varied from 17 to 44 kg ha 1 with soil texture varying from sandy silt loam to clay chaney 1990 which were in the lower range of our values but the soil nitrate n buffer capacity at up to 60 cm soil depth after barley harvest in uk were between 11 to 60 kg ha 1 across various soil textures richards et al 1996 under continuous maize soil nitrate n buffer capacity of 0 90 cm soil profile ranged from 10 to 36 kg ha 1 across soil types in usa andraski et al 2000 hong et al 2007 the estimated soil nitrate n buffer capacity in 0 100 cm soil profile varied from 45 to 90 kg ha 1 after cotton harvest with different amount of water supply on a silt loam soil in xinxiang china si et al 2017 overall soil nitrate nitrogen buffer capacity is generally less than 100 kg ha 1 irrespective of soil types the crops grown and the quantity of water supply these evidences further support the limitation of 90 100 kg n ha 1 left in the top 90 cm soil profile after crop harvest set in europe hofman 1999 raun and johnson 1995 have discussed mechanisms of soil no3 n buffer capacity they explained the presence of soil plant buffering of inorganic n with the increased crop uptake n immobilization and gaseous losses in the soil plant system the significant positive correlation between soil no3 n buffer capacity and som in plough layer soils observed in our study suggested that the presence of buffering in nitrate nitrogen for winter wheat or across wheat and maize cropping system is most likely related to mineralization and immobilization of som in addition less impacting from soil texture on soil no3 n buffer capacity might be due to little absorption of no3 n by clay particles 4 3 environmentally safe n rate in wheat maize cropping to feed its huge population china faces great challenges to guarantee its food security particularly the quantity security therefore targeting the agronomic optimum production is the priority to farmers in agricultural practice present study found that environmentally safe n rates were greater than agronomic optimum n rates at which agronomic optimum production being achieved by 58 kg n ha 1 on average from 13 out of 33 experiments for wheat and by 40 kg n ha 1 on average from 13 out of 27 experiments for maize raun and johnson 1995 previously reported that environmentally safe n rates were higher than agronomic optimum n rates by 41 kg n ha 1 on average from four winter wheat long term experiments on silt loams and clay loam these indicated that the recommended agronomic optimum n rate not only can achieve the maximum crop yield but also can minimize the nitrate leaching risk similarly richards et al 1996 concluded that the nitrogen rate to achieve the economic optimum yield could also be used to accomplish the aim of diminishing the risk of nitrate leaching for winter barley on various soil types from sandy loams to clay loams in uk a remarkable finding from this study was that the environmentally safe n rates were lower than agronomic optimum n rates by 44 kg n ha 1 61 on average from 20 out of 33 experiments for wheat and by 86 kg n ha 1 52 on average from 14 out of 27 experiments for maize zhang et al 2018 reported that the economic optimal n application rates should be further reduced by 20 30 to minimize nitrate leaching risk for winter wheat and summer maize cropping in north china plain by considering the environmental cost these indicated that application of fertilizer nitrogen to a level up to agronomic optimum n rate at these sites could result in a large accumulation of soil no3 n which may exert a higher risk of no3 n leaching as those detected on silt loams in central pennsylvania and wisconsin of usa jemison and fox 1994 andraski et al 2000 formerly agronomic optimum n rates from 84 to 270 and 71 to 323 kg ha 1 for wheat and maize respectively were recommended for guanzhong plain of shaanxi province in northern china zhang et al 2015 which needs to be reconsidered based on the soil no3 n buffer capacity in situ in our case wheat or maize yield at environmentally safe n rates would drop by about 13 relative to the maximum to compensate this kind of yield losses it is suggested to apply for integrated soil crop systematic management that based on the local environment drawing upon appropriate crop varieties sowing dates densities and advanced nutrient management chen et al 2014 cui et al 2018 overall in regions those are vulnerable to nitrate leaching the recommended fertilizer n rate should not exceed that for environmental safety even though we have to compromise the crop production otherwise the environmental cost may be extremely expensive 5 conclusions we found that soil nitrate n buffer capacity was generally less than 100 kg ha 1 regardless of crop and soil types under winter wheat and summer maize cropping system in northern china overall more than 50 of experiments for both wheat and maize manifested that agronomic optimum n rates were greater than the environmentally safe n rates implying the high risk of nitrate n leaching under present n recommendation it is suggested that the n rate recommended should not exceed the environmentally safe n rate in areas where the potential risk of nitrate leaching is high even though the optimum yield may not be achieved under winter wheat and summer maize cropping system in northern china acknowledgements the authors are much grateful to the national key research and development program 2016yfd0800105 for supporting this study appendix a

11193,reclaimed water irrigation in urban parks is expanding all over the world and could cause salt accumulation in soil and plants since the beginning of the 2000s the city of madrid spain has been using reclaimed water to irrigate its parks the main aim of this study was to estimate salt accumulation in soils and plants due to reclaimed water irrigation in two urban parks of madrid it was conducted over five consecutive years and the chemical properties in soil solution soil and plant leaves of four species were analyzed two plots from each park were selected one irrigated with reclaimed water rw and another one irrigated with drinking water dw there was a steady increase of cl na sar and electrical conductivity ec in soils that were rw irrigated for 5 years while in dw plots lower values for these parameters were observed likewise there was no soil sodification in rw plots on the contrary the park which has been rw irrigated for 15 years showed a slight soil salinization ec 2 ds m 1 there were significant differences for the cl and na leaf content between species irrigated with rw versus dw overall salt concentration in leaves was similar to the values found in the literature being in most of the cases below the threshold when plants start to show injuries however an adequate leaching requirement 9 is advisable in order to wash out the excessive salt accumulation in parks irrigated with reclaimed water keywords reclaimed water salinization urban park sodium chloride 1 introduction soil salinization associated with irrigation is a global problem dehaan and taylor 2002 rengasamy 2006 szabolcs 1989 yu et al 2010 almost 20 of irrigated land is threatened by salinization and this percentage is still on the rise li et al 2014 one of the processes that promotes soil salinization is reclaimed water irrigation chen et al 2013a klay et al 2010 sou dakouré et al 2013 urbano et al 2017 due to water deficit reclaimed water and wastewater irrigation is expanding all over the world bixio et al 2006 chu et al 2004 hamilton et al 2007 reclaimed water is defined as treated wastewater after an additional or complementary treatment that adjusts its quality for its intended use boe 2007 salinity levels in reclaimed water are usually high due to common tertiary treatment processes do not remove most mineral salts unless it is combined with expensive desalination processes such as reverse osmosis haruvy 2006 rebhun 2004 sodium and other forms of salinity are the most persistent in reclaimed water and are among the most difficult to remove from water which usually requires the use of expensive cation exchange resins or reverse osmosis membranes toze 2006 after municipal use water increases its salinity mainly due to sodium salts and chlorides rebhun 2004 these can originate from many sources such as detergents soaps and washing material as well as some chemicals used during the water treatment process water chlorination and other sources elgallal et al 2016 qadir and scott 2010 reclaimed water irrigation in urban parks is an increasing trend all over the world chen et al 2013b furumai 2008 qian and mecham 2005 yi et al 2011 this increase is due to two critical factors technological advances made in wastewater treatments and a rise of water deficit in many parts of the world lyu et al 2016 this kind of irrigation implies a series of benefits such as its reliability as a water source along the time and mainly during drought episodes hanjra et al 2012 wilcox et al 2016 the reduction of fertilizers use due to its high nutrient content montemurro et al 2017 and the possibility of keeping fresh water resources for high quality uses sastre merlín et al 2016a are other advantages associated with their use salinization derived of a low quality irrigation water had been widely studied for agricultural areas cassaniti et al 2009 letey et al 2011 but there are few studies for urban green areas chen et al 2015 nouri et al 2013 in one of those studies chen et al 2013b found that there was soil salinity accumulation in urban parks of beijing irrigated with reclaimed water about 20 higher in the top 0 20 m than those irrigated with drinking water however soil salinization did not appear yet in seven parks of study except for one which presented a mild soil salinization the same author chen et al 2015 concluded that there was an increase in soil salinity and a slight soil alkalization but no soil salinization was observed after 3 9 years of reclaimed water irrigation which could be attributed to the over irrigation practices in beijing parks on the other hand there is an extensive literature that has researched on the effects caused by rw irrigation on plants and a majority of it has been developed for agricultural species with an economic interest cirelli et al 2012 papadopoulos et al 2009 there are several studies for the effects on citrus trees pedrero et al 2015 2012 and on olive trees ayoub et al 2016 petousi et al 2015 among other species moreover there is also a broad literature on crop salt tolerance öztürk et al 2006 parida and das 2005 as well as studies on ornamental and landscape species fornes et al 2007 niu and cabrera 2010 rhoades et al 1992 despite these species have not an economic performance they are judged by their aesthetic value wu and dodge 2005 salinity is of rising importance in landscaping due to the increase of reclaimed water irrigation in green urban areas cassaniti et al 2012 sodium and chloride two of the main constituents of reclaimed water are suspected of the decline of redwood trees in california where rw is used for public park irrigation barnes et al 2007 adverse symptoms were noticed on some redwoods under rw irrigation such as leaf necrosis and even branch and tree death in extreme cases likewise nackley et al 2015 found that growth and appearance of this kind of conifer sequoia sempervirens is negatively affected when it is irrigated with high ec reclaimed water other species affected was photinia which had a significant decrease in plant growth under sprinkle irrigation with reclaimed water gori et al 2008 in other study bañón et al 2011 concluded that rw irrigation of lantana camara led to an excessive uptake of chloride and sodium in leaves which entailed defoliation growth decline and loss of aesthetic value soil salinity stresses plants in two ways high concentrations of salts in soils complicate water extraction for roots and high concentrations of salts within the plant can be toxic munns and tester 2008 long term saline water irrigation cause an accumulation of toxic ions particularly na and cl in the rhizosphere which initially causes osmotic stress due to a decrease in the water potential of the root system acosta motos et al 2014 ashraf et al 2017 moreover the gradual accumulation of these phytotoxic ions in plants could lead to a nutritional imbalance parida and das 2005 rengasamy 2006 stevens et al 2008 together with a decrease in growth bañón et al 2011 and damages in leaves and roots azza maher et al 2007 cassaniti et al 2012 madrid city council started thinking of reclaimed water irrigation of its urban parks during the drought that took place in the middle of the 1990s iglesias and ortega 2008 nowadays the city council has developed a vast system of more than 150 km of pipes and 65 deposits to irrigate most of its urban parks 1400 ha with reclaimed water madrid city council 2018 in 2009 madrid city council wanted to undertake an in depth study of the decline of several cedars in some parks irrigated with reclaimed water and signed a partnership agreement with our research team therefore the main objective of this research was to estimate the long term salinization risk in soils and the resulting salt accumulation in plants of two urban parks of madrid spain on account of reclaimed water irrigation a secondary goal was to obtain reliable and useful information to help municipal managers in their decision making process for maintaining urban parks in good environmental condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research was carried out in the city of madrid spain where reclaimed water is used to irrigate most of its parks since the beginning of the 2000s this water comes from several water reclamation plants after a tertiary treatment of the wastewater produced by the city of 3 2 million inhabitants average annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 421 mm the annual mean temperature is 15 c aemet 2018 and average annual evapotranspiration et penman is 930 mm according to these data madrid s climate is classified as arid by lang aridity index and as mediterranean semi arid by martonne quan et al 2013 it is characterized by dry and warm summers and cold winters nearly all the precipitation is concentrated in spring and autumn this study was conducted along 5 consecutive years 2012 2016 in two public urban parks of madrid emperatriz maría de austria park hereafter pema 40 22 53 n 3 43 16 w and garrigues walker park hereafter pgw 40 22 11 n 3 39 41 w both parks were irrigated with reclaimed water since 2002 and 2012 respectively two plots from each park were irrigated with reclaimed water pgw rw and pema rw and two more irrigated with drinking water pgw dw and pema dw study plots in both parks were adjacent and its size was about 1000 m2 for pema and around 400 m2 for pgw several adult shrubs photinia sp ten adult hackberries celtis australis and nine adult cedars cedrus atlantica and cedrus deodara were selected for the study soil texture 0 0 6 m was classified as sandy clay loam according to usda soil classification for both plots in pgw pgw dw and pgw rw and pema rw and sandy loam for pema dw table 1 soils were classified as hortic terric anthrosols in pgw and as terric anthrosols in pema iuss working group wrb 2015 2 2 irrigation water sampling and analysis the average irrigation volume was about 940 mm per year for each plot the irrigation season was usually extended through 8 months and the plots were irrigated on a daily basis except on weekends once a year in july reclaimed water and drinking water were sampled directly from the park s sprinklers each plot had low pressure sprinklers hunter pgp ultra hunter industries at a spacing of 6 8 m and operating within manufacturer s specifications samples were collected in 125 ml plastic bottles refrigerated and transferred to the laboratory for further analysis the parameters evaluated were electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds ph and concentrations of hco3 cl no3 no2 po4 3 so4 2 nh4 ca2 mg2 k and na ion concentration was determined by ion chromatography except for bicarbonates and ph that were potentiometrically determined each water sample was analyzed following the procedures described by apha 2012 2 3 soil solution sampling and analysis soil solution sampling was carried out in three different times of the year throughout the irrigation season at the beginning march in the middle july and at the end october it was sampled by suction porous ceramic cup lysimeters soilmoisture equipment corp of 4 8 cm outside diameter installed in every plot at 0 15 0 35 and 0 60 m depth with three replicates each before placing them in the field the lysimeters were washed with deionized water likewise in order to ensure a continuous contact of the porous ceramic cup with the soil matrix a slurry 1 2 soil deionized water was introduced at the bottom of the drilled hole before lysimeter installation a vacuum of 70 kpa was applied to the suction cups to obtain the soil solution and for each depth a sample composed of three soil solution sub samples was taken analyses methods and determined parameters were the same as for the irrigation water samples 2 4 soil sampling and analysis soil sampling was carried out twice a year once in march before the irrigation season and once in october right after the irrigation season soil samples were collected at four depths 0 0 05 m 0 10 0 20 m 0 30 0 40 m 0 55 0 65 m using a 6 cm edelman type auger each soil sample contained approximately 1 kg of soil and was composed of three soil sub samples randomly collected from each depth these samples were air dried then passed through a 2 mm sieve and ground before analysis by ion chromatography and potentiometry determination of the saturated paste extract electrical conductivity ec and ph were determined at 25 c using a conductivity meter metrohm 856 switzerland and a ph meter metrohm 826 switzerland respectively soil organic matter som was determined by wet oxidation walkley and black 1934 n content was determined by kjeldahl method bremner and mulvaney 1982 and soil texture by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 soluble salt content hco3 cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 k and na was determined in the saturated paste extract as described by rhoades 1982 2 5 plant leaves sampling and analysis composite samples of one kind of shrub photinia sp and two species of trees hackberry celtis australis and cedar cedrus atlantica and cedrus deodara were collected once a year in july at irrigation season highpoint samples of hackberry were collected only in pema while photinia sp and cedar samples were collected in pgw cedrus atlantica and in pema cedrus deodara each leaf sample contained approximately 500 g of fully developed green leaves composed of several sub samples collected from different specimens present in each plot in the case of hackberries and cedars samples were collected around the canopy of each tree at a height nearly 2 m above the ground then were placed in paper bags and transferred to the laboratory where they were rinsed with distilled water oven dried at 60 c and crushed after that following acid digestion with nitric acid in a microwave system kalra 1998 cl and na concentration were determined by potentiometry and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 0 armonk ny ibm corp normality was assessed by kolmogorov smirnov test and data did not follow a normal distribution even after several data transformations as data did not follow a normal distribution non parametric mann whitney u tests were applied at a 0 05 significance level to assess significant differences between means of each parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water quality concentrations of dissolved ions viz hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 k and na were significantly higher in reclaimed water rw in comparison with drinking water dw table 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar and electrical conductivity ec were also greater in reclaimed water in pgw all the parameters were significantly higher for reclaimed water except for no3 no2 nh4 and ph while in pema only ph did not differ generally both irrigation waters were adequate for irrigation according to fao water quality standards ayers and westcot 1985 however regarding these standards reclaimed water could have a slight to moderate degree of restriction on use for some parameters ec tds hco3 na and cl thus focus should be placed on the high na and cl content in rw which could imply a risk of soil salinization tarchouna et al 2010 the total mass of cl and na entering the parks through reclaimed water were of 93 kg cl ha 1 62 kg na ha 1 pema and 114 kg cl ha 1 77 kg na ha 1 pgw obtained reclaimed water agronomic parameters were compared with those reported in relevant literature e g kalavrouziotis et al 2008 lubello et al 2004 pereira et al 2011 they were within average of tertiary treated wastewaters electrical conductivity ec values of reclaimed water used for irrigation usually have a high variability depending on its origins season and treatment they range from 0 8 ds m 1 lubello et al 2004 qian and mecham 2005 to more than 3 5 ds m 1 nicolás et al 2016 in this study ec values for reclaimed water were around 0 85 ds m 1 which are in the lowest range of those obtained in the bibliography however both ec values could imply a slight to moderate degree of restriction on use due to a salinity potential problem ayers and westcot 1985 when comparing dw from the two parks there were not significant differences likewise the same outcomes were observed when comparing rw from the two parks such absence of significant differences is due to the rw pipeline network in madrid that mixes reclaimed water from several treatment plants 3 2 salt accumulation in soil solution table 3 shows chemical characteristics of soil solution obtained by lysimeters in the four plots the main differences between treatments dw vs rw were for cl so4 2 ca2 na k sar and ec which had significant higher values for rw than dw irrigation almost all these nutrients match with those nutrients with higher values in reclaimed irrigation water during the irrigation season irrigation water was infiltrated and mixed with the previous soil solution in case of high evapotranspiration rates soil solution in the first soil layers mostly consists on the infiltrated irrigation water gloaguen et al 2007 when na concentration in irrigation water is high as in this case table 2 the introduced na may replace other exchangeable cations on the exchange complex this exchange of ca2 and mg2 by na gave sar values significantly higher for the rw irrigated plots which could lead to large exchangeable sodium percentage esp and consequently results in clay swelling and dispersion netzer et al 2014 sou dakouré et al 2013 3 3 salt accumulation in soils the main chemical characteristics of soils are presented in table 4 significant differences between both treatments were found for almost the same parameters than in the case of irrigation water and soil solution cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 k na sar and ec this can be explained by the interaction between the irrigation water and the soil system lado and ben hur 2009 na and ec values in pema rw were two times higher than in pgw rw that could be explained by the fact that pema rw was rw irrigated 10 years more than pgw rw the increase in soils of four key parameters cl na sar and ec along the study period is shown in fig 1 there are three issues that must be emphasized the constant low values along the years for the parameters obtained in the dw treatment the steady increase of values from pgw rw and the higher constant values for pema rw chloride concentration in dw plots were under 50 mg l 1 during all the years however in pgw rw it showed a linear increase 157 from 70 mg l 1 in 2012 to 180 mg l 1 in 2016 this linear increase was of 29 the first year and of 14 38 and 27 the following years pgw rw reached the mean value observed in pema rw which remained quite constant throughout the study period around 150 mg l 1 the same pattern was shown for sodium concentration although values were generally below the chloride concentrations sar levels for pgw dw and pema dw were around 0 6 along the five years of study sar in pgw rw behaved in the same way as chloride and sodium increasing linearly from 1 1 to 2 5 127 despite this increase sar values are low and do not represent a risk to soil structure properties rengasamy and olsson 1991 in 2016 pgw rw reached and exceeded the mean value of pema rw 2 4 only after 5 years of reclaimed water irrigation on the other hand ec in pgw rw 1 4 in 2016 remained lower than in pema rw 2 2 according to rengasamy 2010 soils which sar is under 6 and its ec 4 ds m 1 are categorized as non salt affected soils as in the case of soils from the four study plots this contrasts with most of the soils irrigated with reclaimed water which tend to be classified as saline sodic soils muyen et al 2011 pedrero et al 2018 overall values of ec above 2 ds m 1 show that there is a slight risk of soil salinization porta et al 1994 pema rw after 10 years of reclaimed water irrigation reached and maintain this level the five years of study except in 2013 this is in accordance with chen et al 2013b who concluded in their study on parks of beijing humid continental climate and fluvo aquic and cinnamon soils that only one 2 01 ds m 1 of the seven studied parks had a mild soil salinization 2 4 ds m 1 this beijing park was irrigated for 9 years with reclaimed water irrigation however the remaining six parks did not present soil salinization even after the same years under reclaimed water irrigation annual precipitation in beijing was about 630 mm and more than 70 of the rainfall was concentrated in 3 months which implies a rise of salt leaching and a decrease of the risk of soil salinization similarly mclain and williams 2012 in their short term study 2 years in an arizona urban park arid climate did not found a soil ec increase in the first 30 cm of a sandy clay loam soil 3 4 cl and na accumulation in plant leaves chloride and sodium contents of dry weight in leaves are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively cl content was significantly higher in those hackberries irrigated with reclaimed water in comparison with those irrigated with drinking water likewise there were significant differences between photinia plants in pema obtaining higher values in those irrigated with reclaimed water however significant differences were not found between dw and rw in pgw for cl in cedars it should be noted that cl values in pgw rw cedars were higher than values obtained in pgw dw and lower than those obtained in pema rw that may be due to the higher amount of years of reclaimed water irrigation in pema park in the case of na only cedars in pgw rw 0 04 showed a significantly higher concentration than those in pgw dw 0 01 it should be underlined that is necessary to compare our results with other reclaimed water irrigation studies that used different plant species due to the lack of this kind of studies in urban parks pema rw values 0 22 na were very close to the na content obtained by ali et al 2013 after 18 months 0 25 na in khaya senegalensis however de miguel et al 2013 after one year of rw irrigation found values of 0 30 na in jatropha curcas leaves notably above ours that could be explained by the higher amount of na 122 mg l 1 present in their rw in contrast with the rw used for this study 77 and 62 mg l 1 on the other hand al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 in their six month study using treated grey water for irrigate olive trees obtained values of na 0 03 and cl 0 21 which are similar to our values for photinia pema rw and pgw rw and cedar pgw rw wu et al 2001 made a list of the salt tolerance of 38 landscape woody plant species under sprinkler irrigation with low salt 500 mg l 1 nacl and high salt 1500 mg l 1 nacl concentrations in the irrigation water the study concluded that chinese hackberry celtis sinensis had low salt tolerance for both concentrations and cedar cedrus deodara had high salt tolerance they found that leaves of hackberries under high salt irrigation were severely damaged and at least 70 of them were affected by chlorosis in our study salt concentration was clearly less 131 and 155 mg l 1 nacl for pgw and pema respectively hence we did not find chlorosis in leaves of hackberries or cedars wu and dodge 2005 expanded their study and classified several landscape tree and shrub species according to their tolerance to recycled water irrigation and soil salinity they concluded that cedrus deodara was highly tolerant to salt water spray irrigation which means that no apparent salt stress symptoms were observed when plants were irrigated with water containing 600 mg l 1 sodium and 900 mg l 1 chloride and was also highly tolerant to soil salinity cedars did not develop any salt stress symptoms even when soil ec was greater than 6 ds m 1 according to that we did not record chlorosis neither in cedrus deodara specimens pema rw nor in cedrus atlantica specimens pgw rw furthermore wu and dodge 2005 found that chinese hackberry and photinia photinia fraseri and photinia glabra were sensitive to salt spray more than 20 of leaves develop symptoms when plants were irrigated with water containing 200 mg l 1 sodium and 400 mg l 1 chloride and to soil salinity acceptable soil ec less than 2 ds m 1 however in our study photinia did not show salt nacl accumulation in leaves even when soil ec was higher than 2 ds m 1 hackberries in pema rw showed a nacl accumulation in leaves but no chlorosis was observed this is in line with the results described by dmuchowski et al 2013 who found that leaves of tilia euchlora with strong damage contained extremely high na content 0 33 likewise ayers and westcot 1985 stated that many tree crops begin to show injuries when cl content in the leaf tissue is above 0 3 or when na content is 0 25 0 50 dry weight in our case most of the species had not reached these levels except for cedars and hackberries only for cl in pema rw and no significant damage were found wu and guo 2006 also studied the effects of reclaimed water irrigation on other kind of conifer coast redwood sequoia sempervivens endl they concluded that rw irrigation should be strictly monitored to ensure that soil salinity does not exceed 2 ds m 1 the threshold for very sensitive landscape plants taking this into account a status monitoring should be done in pema rw where ec in soil has overcome this threshold likewise nackley et al 2015 presented a similar study on coast redwood under rw irrigation the results of their study suggested that its growth will be negatively impacted when ec from the irrigation water exceeds 1 ds m 1 this is in concordance with other study barnes et al 2007 of the same species who concluded that keeping an ec in soil solution around 1 ds m 1 would prevent the appearance of detrimental symptoms on redwood trees irrigated with recycled water all these studies assessing the effects of rw irrigation in conifers have been conducted in california under a mediterranean climate which is similar to madrid climate thus according to the referred studies levels of ec in soil solution 1 ds m 1 could lead to adverse effects on conifers sited in pgw rw and pema rw the risk of crop affection due to salt accumulation in the root zone may be present even when irrigation water is of low conductivity 1 ds m 1 barnes et al 2007 in these cases it is necessary to take action and to apply corrective measures to prevent the accumulation of excessive salts in soils more water than required to meet the evapotranspiration needs of the plants must pass through the root zone to leach the excess of soluble salts which usually has been expressed as the leaching requirement letey et al 2011 leaching is one of the most practical ways to reduce and control toxic ions in the root zone therefore it can be used to prevent or to correct a problem once it has been recognized from plant symptoms ayers and westcot 1985 with the aim of keeping salt levels under risk thresholds this research team carried out a leaching pilot experience in an urban park in madrid sastre merlín et al 2016b drinking water was used with encouraging results such as a notable decrease in soil solution ec leaching requirement lr was calculated according to ayers and westcot 1985 formulation eq 1 1 l r e c w 5 e c e e c w where ecw is the electrical conductivity of the applied irrigation water and ece is the plant specific threshold soil salinity tanji et al 2007 estimated the salt tolerances of landscape plants they concluded that cedrus deodara tolerance was moderate permissible soil ece between 2 and 4 ds m 1 and celtis sinensis and photinia fraseri dress were sensitive permissible soil ece less than 2 ds m 1 according to these classification ece 2 ds m 1 we obtained a leaching requirement of 0 087 for pema and 0 098 for pgw these values are similar to those values obtained and collected 0 08 in california by corwin et al 2007 through different models the relationship between water salinity water application plant tolerance and the amount of drainage water are essential to establish the optimal management strategy letey et al 2011 thus this practice should be part of the proper park management of the city in the near future in order to avoid salt accumulation in soils and plants in urban parks irrigated with reclaimed water in addition to leaching other actions could be implemented such as blending reclaimed water with water sources that have lower ec and sar wu et al 2009 likewise planting salt tolerant species cassaniti et al 2009 sevostianova and leinauer 2014 needs to be considered in order to achieve a sustainable environment in urban parks 4 conclusions the high na and cl content in reclaimed water could imply a risk of salt accumulation in soils and plants level of salts in soil solution soil and leaves of this study usually presented significant differences between both treatments dw and rw after 15 years of reclaimed water irrigation pema rw showed higher values than pgw rw and a slightly soil salinization ec 2 ds m 1 there was no soil sodification although sar and na content in soils irrigated with rw was increasing pgw rw and consistently high pema rw but they were far from being a risk sarsoil 6 overall salt concentration cl and na in leaves was similar to the values found in the literature of reclaimed water irrigation cedars hackberries and photinia were tolerant to sprinkler irrigation with reclaimed water likewise no major salt stress symptoms were observed despite the high values of cl and na in their leaf tissue however a proper park management should focus on preventing the appearance of adverse symptoms on sensitive plants thus we recommend to use a leaching requirement of 8 7 for pema and 9 8 for pgw in order to wash out the excessive salt accumulation in soils acknowledgments this work was supported by the collaboration agreements between the university of alcala and the operating companies of the irrigation and landscape service for madrid city council imesapi sa 2009 2013 and fcc utes 5 y 6 2014 2016 the authors would like to thank the madrid city

11193,reclaimed water irrigation in urban parks is expanding all over the world and could cause salt accumulation in soil and plants since the beginning of the 2000s the city of madrid spain has been using reclaimed water to irrigate its parks the main aim of this study was to estimate salt accumulation in soils and plants due to reclaimed water irrigation in two urban parks of madrid it was conducted over five consecutive years and the chemical properties in soil solution soil and plant leaves of four species were analyzed two plots from each park were selected one irrigated with reclaimed water rw and another one irrigated with drinking water dw there was a steady increase of cl na sar and electrical conductivity ec in soils that were rw irrigated for 5 years while in dw plots lower values for these parameters were observed likewise there was no soil sodification in rw plots on the contrary the park which has been rw irrigated for 15 years showed a slight soil salinization ec 2 ds m 1 there were significant differences for the cl and na leaf content between species irrigated with rw versus dw overall salt concentration in leaves was similar to the values found in the literature being in most of the cases below the threshold when plants start to show injuries however an adequate leaching requirement 9 is advisable in order to wash out the excessive salt accumulation in parks irrigated with reclaimed water keywords reclaimed water salinization urban park sodium chloride 1 introduction soil salinization associated with irrigation is a global problem dehaan and taylor 2002 rengasamy 2006 szabolcs 1989 yu et al 2010 almost 20 of irrigated land is threatened by salinization and this percentage is still on the rise li et al 2014 one of the processes that promotes soil salinization is reclaimed water irrigation chen et al 2013a klay et al 2010 sou dakouré et al 2013 urbano et al 2017 due to water deficit reclaimed water and wastewater irrigation is expanding all over the world bixio et al 2006 chu et al 2004 hamilton et al 2007 reclaimed water is defined as treated wastewater after an additional or complementary treatment that adjusts its quality for its intended use boe 2007 salinity levels in reclaimed water are usually high due to common tertiary treatment processes do not remove most mineral salts unless it is combined with expensive desalination processes such as reverse osmosis haruvy 2006 rebhun 2004 sodium and other forms of salinity are the most persistent in reclaimed water and are among the most difficult to remove from water which usually requires the use of expensive cation exchange resins or reverse osmosis membranes toze 2006 after municipal use water increases its salinity mainly due to sodium salts and chlorides rebhun 2004 these can originate from many sources such as detergents soaps and washing material as well as some chemicals used during the water treatment process water chlorination and other sources elgallal et al 2016 qadir and scott 2010 reclaimed water irrigation in urban parks is an increasing trend all over the world chen et al 2013b furumai 2008 qian and mecham 2005 yi et al 2011 this increase is due to two critical factors technological advances made in wastewater treatments and a rise of water deficit in many parts of the world lyu et al 2016 this kind of irrigation implies a series of benefits such as its reliability as a water source along the time and mainly during drought episodes hanjra et al 2012 wilcox et al 2016 the reduction of fertilizers use due to its high nutrient content montemurro et al 2017 and the possibility of keeping fresh water resources for high quality uses sastre merlín et al 2016a are other advantages associated with their use salinization derived of a low quality irrigation water had been widely studied for agricultural areas cassaniti et al 2009 letey et al 2011 but there are few studies for urban green areas chen et al 2015 nouri et al 2013 in one of those studies chen et al 2013b found that there was soil salinity accumulation in urban parks of beijing irrigated with reclaimed water about 20 higher in the top 0 20 m than those irrigated with drinking water however soil salinization did not appear yet in seven parks of study except for one which presented a mild soil salinization the same author chen et al 2015 concluded that there was an increase in soil salinity and a slight soil alkalization but no soil salinization was observed after 3 9 years of reclaimed water irrigation which could be attributed to the over irrigation practices in beijing parks on the other hand there is an extensive literature that has researched on the effects caused by rw irrigation on plants and a majority of it has been developed for agricultural species with an economic interest cirelli et al 2012 papadopoulos et al 2009 there are several studies for the effects on citrus trees pedrero et al 2015 2012 and on olive trees ayoub et al 2016 petousi et al 2015 among other species moreover there is also a broad literature on crop salt tolerance öztürk et al 2006 parida and das 2005 as well as studies on ornamental and landscape species fornes et al 2007 niu and cabrera 2010 rhoades et al 1992 despite these species have not an economic performance they are judged by their aesthetic value wu and dodge 2005 salinity is of rising importance in landscaping due to the increase of reclaimed water irrigation in green urban areas cassaniti et al 2012 sodium and chloride two of the main constituents of reclaimed water are suspected of the decline of redwood trees in california where rw is used for public park irrigation barnes et al 2007 adverse symptoms were noticed on some redwoods under rw irrigation such as leaf necrosis and even branch and tree death in extreme cases likewise nackley et al 2015 found that growth and appearance of this kind of conifer sequoia sempervirens is negatively affected when it is irrigated with high ec reclaimed water other species affected was photinia which had a significant decrease in plant growth under sprinkle irrigation with reclaimed water gori et al 2008 in other study bañón et al 2011 concluded that rw irrigation of lantana camara led to an excessive uptake of chloride and sodium in leaves which entailed defoliation growth decline and loss of aesthetic value soil salinity stresses plants in two ways high concentrations of salts in soils complicate water extraction for roots and high concentrations of salts within the plant can be toxic munns and tester 2008 long term saline water irrigation cause an accumulation of toxic ions particularly na and cl in the rhizosphere which initially causes osmotic stress due to a decrease in the water potential of the root system acosta motos et al 2014 ashraf et al 2017 moreover the gradual accumulation of these phytotoxic ions in plants could lead to a nutritional imbalance parida and das 2005 rengasamy 2006 stevens et al 2008 together with a decrease in growth bañón et al 2011 and damages in leaves and roots azza maher et al 2007 cassaniti et al 2012 madrid city council started thinking of reclaimed water irrigation of its urban parks during the drought that took place in the middle of the 1990s iglesias and ortega 2008 nowadays the city council has developed a vast system of more than 150 km of pipes and 65 deposits to irrigate most of its urban parks 1400 ha with reclaimed water madrid city council 2018 in 2009 madrid city council wanted to undertake an in depth study of the decline of several cedars in some parks irrigated with reclaimed water and signed a partnership agreement with our research team therefore the main objective of this research was to estimate the long term salinization risk in soils and the resulting salt accumulation in plants of two urban parks of madrid spain on account of reclaimed water irrigation a secondary goal was to obtain reliable and useful information to help municipal managers in their decision making process for maintaining urban parks in good environmental condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research was carried out in the city of madrid spain where reclaimed water is used to irrigate most of its parks since the beginning of the 2000s this water comes from several water reclamation plants after a tertiary treatment of the wastewater produced by the city of 3 2 million inhabitants average annual precipitation 1981 2010 is 421 mm the annual mean temperature is 15 c aemet 2018 and average annual evapotranspiration et penman is 930 mm according to these data madrid s climate is classified as arid by lang aridity index and as mediterranean semi arid by martonne quan et al 2013 it is characterized by dry and warm summers and cold winters nearly all the precipitation is concentrated in spring and autumn this study was conducted along 5 consecutive years 2012 2016 in two public urban parks of madrid emperatriz maría de austria park hereafter pema 40 22 53 n 3 43 16 w and garrigues walker park hereafter pgw 40 22 11 n 3 39 41 w both parks were irrigated with reclaimed water since 2002 and 2012 respectively two plots from each park were irrigated with reclaimed water pgw rw and pema rw and two more irrigated with drinking water pgw dw and pema dw study plots in both parks were adjacent and its size was about 1000 m2 for pema and around 400 m2 for pgw several adult shrubs photinia sp ten adult hackberries celtis australis and nine adult cedars cedrus atlantica and cedrus deodara were selected for the study soil texture 0 0 6 m was classified as sandy clay loam according to usda soil classification for both plots in pgw pgw dw and pgw rw and pema rw and sandy loam for pema dw table 1 soils were classified as hortic terric anthrosols in pgw and as terric anthrosols in pema iuss working group wrb 2015 2 2 irrigation water sampling and analysis the average irrigation volume was about 940 mm per year for each plot the irrigation season was usually extended through 8 months and the plots were irrigated on a daily basis except on weekends once a year in july reclaimed water and drinking water were sampled directly from the park s sprinklers each plot had low pressure sprinklers hunter pgp ultra hunter industries at a spacing of 6 8 m and operating within manufacturer s specifications samples were collected in 125 ml plastic bottles refrigerated and transferred to the laboratory for further analysis the parameters evaluated were electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds ph and concentrations of hco3 cl no3 no2 po4 3 so4 2 nh4 ca2 mg2 k and na ion concentration was determined by ion chromatography except for bicarbonates and ph that were potentiometrically determined each water sample was analyzed following the procedures described by apha 2012 2 3 soil solution sampling and analysis soil solution sampling was carried out in three different times of the year throughout the irrigation season at the beginning march in the middle july and at the end october it was sampled by suction porous ceramic cup lysimeters soilmoisture equipment corp of 4 8 cm outside diameter installed in every plot at 0 15 0 35 and 0 60 m depth with three replicates each before placing them in the field the lysimeters were washed with deionized water likewise in order to ensure a continuous contact of the porous ceramic cup with the soil matrix a slurry 1 2 soil deionized water was introduced at the bottom of the drilled hole before lysimeter installation a vacuum of 70 kpa was applied to the suction cups to obtain the soil solution and for each depth a sample composed of three soil solution sub samples was taken analyses methods and determined parameters were the same as for the irrigation water samples 2 4 soil sampling and analysis soil sampling was carried out twice a year once in march before the irrigation season and once in october right after the irrigation season soil samples were collected at four depths 0 0 05 m 0 10 0 20 m 0 30 0 40 m 0 55 0 65 m using a 6 cm edelman type auger each soil sample contained approximately 1 kg of soil and was composed of three soil sub samples randomly collected from each depth these samples were air dried then passed through a 2 mm sieve and ground before analysis by ion chromatography and potentiometry determination of the saturated paste extract electrical conductivity ec and ph were determined at 25 c using a conductivity meter metrohm 856 switzerland and a ph meter metrohm 826 switzerland respectively soil organic matter som was determined by wet oxidation walkley and black 1934 n content was determined by kjeldahl method bremner and mulvaney 1982 and soil texture by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 soluble salt content hco3 cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 k and na was determined in the saturated paste extract as described by rhoades 1982 2 5 plant leaves sampling and analysis composite samples of one kind of shrub photinia sp and two species of trees hackberry celtis australis and cedar cedrus atlantica and cedrus deodara were collected once a year in july at irrigation season highpoint samples of hackberry were collected only in pema while photinia sp and cedar samples were collected in pgw cedrus atlantica and in pema cedrus deodara each leaf sample contained approximately 500 g of fully developed green leaves composed of several sub samples collected from different specimens present in each plot in the case of hackberries and cedars samples were collected around the canopy of each tree at a height nearly 2 m above the ground then were placed in paper bags and transferred to the laboratory where they were rinsed with distilled water oven dried at 60 c and crushed after that following acid digestion with nitric acid in a microwave system kalra 1998 cl and na concentration were determined by potentiometry and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 0 armonk ny ibm corp normality was assessed by kolmogorov smirnov test and data did not follow a normal distribution even after several data transformations as data did not follow a normal distribution non parametric mann whitney u tests were applied at a 0 05 significance level to assess significant differences between means of each parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water quality concentrations of dissolved ions viz hco3 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 k and na were significantly higher in reclaimed water rw in comparison with drinking water dw table 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar and electrical conductivity ec were also greater in reclaimed water in pgw all the parameters were significantly higher for reclaimed water except for no3 no2 nh4 and ph while in pema only ph did not differ generally both irrigation waters were adequate for irrigation according to fao water quality standards ayers and westcot 1985 however regarding these standards reclaimed water could have a slight to moderate degree of restriction on use for some parameters ec tds hco3 na and cl thus focus should be placed on the high na and cl content in rw which could imply a risk of soil salinization tarchouna et al 2010 the total mass of cl and na entering the parks through reclaimed water were of 93 kg cl ha 1 62 kg na ha 1 pema and 114 kg cl ha 1 77 kg na ha 1 pgw obtained reclaimed water agronomic parameters were compared with those reported in relevant literature e g kalavrouziotis et al 2008 lubello et al 2004 pereira et al 2011 they were within average of tertiary treated wastewaters electrical conductivity ec values of reclaimed water used for irrigation usually have a high variability depending on its origins season and treatment they range from 0 8 ds m 1 lubello et al 2004 qian and mecham 2005 to more than 3 5 ds m 1 nicolás et al 2016 in this study ec values for reclaimed water were around 0 85 ds m 1 which are in the lowest range of those obtained in the bibliography however both ec values could imply a slight to moderate degree of restriction on use due to a salinity potential problem ayers and westcot 1985 when comparing dw from the two parks there were not significant differences likewise the same outcomes were observed when comparing rw from the two parks such absence of significant differences is due to the rw pipeline network in madrid that mixes reclaimed water from several treatment plants 3 2 salt accumulation in soil solution table 3 shows chemical characteristics of soil solution obtained by lysimeters in the four plots the main differences between treatments dw vs rw were for cl so4 2 ca2 na k sar and ec which had significant higher values for rw than dw irrigation almost all these nutrients match with those nutrients with higher values in reclaimed irrigation water during the irrigation season irrigation water was infiltrated and mixed with the previous soil solution in case of high evapotranspiration rates soil solution in the first soil layers mostly consists on the infiltrated irrigation water gloaguen et al 2007 when na concentration in irrigation water is high as in this case table 2 the introduced na may replace other exchangeable cations on the exchange complex this exchange of ca2 and mg2 by na gave sar values significantly higher for the rw irrigated plots which could lead to large exchangeable sodium percentage esp and consequently results in clay swelling and dispersion netzer et al 2014 sou dakouré et al 2013 3 3 salt accumulation in soils the main chemical characteristics of soils are presented in table 4 significant differences between both treatments were found for almost the same parameters than in the case of irrigation water and soil solution cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 k na sar and ec this can be explained by the interaction between the irrigation water and the soil system lado and ben hur 2009 na and ec values in pema rw were two times higher than in pgw rw that could be explained by the fact that pema rw was rw irrigated 10 years more than pgw rw the increase in soils of four key parameters cl na sar and ec along the study period is shown in fig 1 there are three issues that must be emphasized the constant low values along the years for the parameters obtained in the dw treatment the steady increase of values from pgw rw and the higher constant values for pema rw chloride concentration in dw plots were under 50 mg l 1 during all the years however in pgw rw it showed a linear increase 157 from 70 mg l 1 in 2012 to 180 mg l 1 in 2016 this linear increase was of 29 the first year and of 14 38 and 27 the following years pgw rw reached the mean value observed in pema rw which remained quite constant throughout the study period around 150 mg l 1 the same pattern was shown for sodium concentration although values were generally below the chloride concentrations sar levels for pgw dw and pema dw were around 0 6 along the five years of study sar in pgw rw behaved in the same way as chloride and sodium increasing linearly from 1 1 to 2 5 127 despite this increase sar values are low and do not represent a risk to soil structure properties rengasamy and olsson 1991 in 2016 pgw rw reached and exceeded the mean value of pema rw 2 4 only after 5 years of reclaimed water irrigation on the other hand ec in pgw rw 1 4 in 2016 remained lower than in pema rw 2 2 according to rengasamy 2010 soils which sar is under 6 and its ec 4 ds m 1 are categorized as non salt affected soils as in the case of soils from the four study plots this contrasts with most of the soils irrigated with reclaimed water which tend to be classified as saline sodic soils muyen et al 2011 pedrero et al 2018 overall values of ec above 2 ds m 1 show that there is a slight risk of soil salinization porta et al 1994 pema rw after 10 years of reclaimed water irrigation reached and maintain this level the five years of study except in 2013 this is in accordance with chen et al 2013b who concluded in their study on parks of beijing humid continental climate and fluvo aquic and cinnamon soils that only one 2 01 ds m 1 of the seven studied parks had a mild soil salinization 2 4 ds m 1 this beijing park was irrigated for 9 years with reclaimed water irrigation however the remaining six parks did not present soil salinization even after the same years under reclaimed water irrigation annual precipitation in beijing was about 630 mm and more than 70 of the rainfall was concentrated in 3 months which implies a rise of salt leaching and a decrease of the risk of soil salinization similarly mclain and williams 2012 in their short term study 2 years in an arizona urban park arid climate did not found a soil ec increase in the first 30 cm of a sandy clay loam soil 3 4 cl and na accumulation in plant leaves chloride and sodium contents of dry weight in leaves are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively cl content was significantly higher in those hackberries irrigated with reclaimed water in comparison with those irrigated with drinking water likewise there were significant differences between photinia plants in pema obtaining higher values in those irrigated with reclaimed water however significant differences were not found between dw and rw in pgw for cl in cedars it should be noted that cl values in pgw rw cedars were higher than values obtained in pgw dw and lower than those obtained in pema rw that may be due to the higher amount of years of reclaimed water irrigation in pema park in the case of na only cedars in pgw rw 0 04 showed a significantly higher concentration than those in pgw dw 0 01 it should be underlined that is necessary to compare our results with other reclaimed water irrigation studies that used different plant species due to the lack of this kind of studies in urban parks pema rw values 0 22 na were very close to the na content obtained by ali et al 2013 after 18 months 0 25 na in khaya senegalensis however de miguel et al 2013 after one year of rw irrigation found values of 0 30 na in jatropha curcas leaves notably above ours that could be explained by the higher amount of na 122 mg l 1 present in their rw in contrast with the rw used for this study 77 and 62 mg l 1 on the other hand al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 in their six month study using treated grey water for irrigate olive trees obtained values of na 0 03 and cl 0 21 which are similar to our values for photinia pema rw and pgw rw and cedar pgw rw wu et al 2001 made a list of the salt tolerance of 38 landscape woody plant species under sprinkler irrigation with low salt 500 mg l 1 nacl and high salt 1500 mg l 1 nacl concentrations in the irrigation water the study concluded that chinese hackberry celtis sinensis had low salt tolerance for both concentrations and cedar cedrus deodara had high salt tolerance they found that leaves of hackberries under high salt irrigation were severely damaged and at least 70 of them were affected by chlorosis in our study salt concentration was clearly less 131 and 155 mg l 1 nacl for pgw and pema respectively hence we did not find chlorosis in leaves of hackberries or cedars wu and dodge 2005 expanded their study and classified several landscape tree and shrub species according to their tolerance to recycled water irrigation and soil salinity they concluded that cedrus deodara was highly tolerant to salt water spray irrigation which means that no apparent salt stress symptoms were observed when plants were irrigated with water containing 600 mg l 1 sodium and 900 mg l 1 chloride and was also highly tolerant to soil salinity cedars did not develop any salt stress symptoms even when soil ec was greater than 6 ds m 1 according to that we did not record chlorosis neither in cedrus deodara specimens pema rw nor in cedrus atlantica specimens pgw rw furthermore wu and dodge 2005 found that chinese hackberry and photinia photinia fraseri and photinia glabra were sensitive to salt spray more than 20 of leaves develop symptoms when plants were irrigated with water containing 200 mg l 1 sodium and 400 mg l 1 chloride and to soil salinity acceptable soil ec less than 2 ds m 1 however in our study photinia did not show salt nacl accumulation in leaves even when soil ec was higher than 2 ds m 1 hackberries in pema rw showed a nacl accumulation in leaves but no chlorosis was observed this is in line with the results described by dmuchowski et al 2013 who found that leaves of tilia euchlora with strong damage contained extremely high na content 0 33 likewise ayers and westcot 1985 stated that many tree crops begin to show injuries when cl content in the leaf tissue is above 0 3 or when na content is 0 25 0 50 dry weight in our case most of the species had not reached these levels except for cedars and hackberries only for cl in pema rw and no significant damage were found wu and guo 2006 also studied the effects of reclaimed water irrigation on other kind of conifer coast redwood sequoia sempervivens endl they concluded that rw irrigation should be strictly monitored to ensure that soil salinity does not exceed 2 ds m 1 the threshold for very sensitive landscape plants taking this into account a status monitoring should be done in pema rw where ec in soil has overcome this threshold likewise nackley et al 2015 presented a similar study on coast redwood under rw irrigation the results of their study suggested that its growth will be negatively impacted when ec from the irrigation water exceeds 1 ds m 1 this is in concordance with other study barnes et al 2007 of the same species who concluded that keeping an ec in soil solution around 1 ds m 1 would prevent the appearance of detrimental symptoms on redwood trees irrigated with recycled water all these studies assessing the effects of rw irrigation in conifers have been conducted in california under a mediterranean climate which is similar to madrid climate thus according to the referred studies levels of ec in soil solution 1 ds m 1 could lead to adverse effects on conifers sited in pgw rw and pema rw the risk of crop affection due to salt accumulation in the root zone may be present even when irrigation water is of low conductivity 1 ds m 1 barnes et al 2007 in these cases it is necessary to take action and to apply corrective measures to prevent the accumulation of excessive salts in soils more water than required to meet the evapotranspiration needs of the plants must pass through the root zone to leach the excess of soluble salts which usually has been expressed as the leaching requirement letey et al 2011 leaching is one of the most practical ways to reduce and control toxic ions in the root zone therefore it can be used to prevent or to correct a problem once it has been recognized from plant symptoms ayers and westcot 1985 with the aim of keeping salt levels under risk thresholds this research team carried out a leaching pilot experience in an urban park in madrid sastre merlín et al 2016b drinking water was used with encouraging results such as a notable decrease in soil solution ec leaching requirement lr was calculated according to ayers and westcot 1985 formulation eq 1 1 l r e c w 5 e c e e c w where ecw is the electrical conductivity of the applied irrigation water and ece is the plant specific threshold soil salinity tanji et al 2007 estimated the salt tolerances of landscape plants they concluded that cedrus deodara tolerance was moderate permissible soil ece between 2 and 4 ds m 1 and celtis sinensis and photinia fraseri dress were sensitive permissible soil ece less than 2 ds m 1 according to these classification ece 2 ds m 1 we obtained a leaching requirement of 0 087 for pema and 0 098 for pgw these values are similar to those values obtained and collected 0 08 in california by corwin et al 2007 through different models the relationship between water salinity water application plant tolerance and the amount of drainage water are essential to establish the optimal management strategy letey et al 2011 thus this practice should be part of the proper park management of the city in the near future in order to avoid salt accumulation in soils and plants in urban parks irrigated with reclaimed water in addition to leaching other actions could be implemented such as blending reclaimed water with water sources that have lower ec and sar wu et al 2009 likewise planting salt tolerant species cassaniti et al 2009 sevostianova and leinauer 2014 needs to be considered in order to achieve a sustainable environment in urban parks 4 conclusions the high na and cl content in reclaimed water could imply a risk of salt accumulation in soils and plants level of salts in soil solution soil and leaves of this study usually presented significant differences between both treatments dw and rw after 15 years of reclaimed water irrigation pema rw showed higher values than pgw rw and a slightly soil salinization ec 2 ds m 1 there was no soil sodification although sar and na content in soils irrigated with rw was increasing pgw rw and consistently high pema rw but they were far from being a risk sarsoil 6 overall salt concentration cl and na in leaves was similar to the values found in the literature of reclaimed water irrigation cedars hackberries and photinia were tolerant to sprinkler irrigation with reclaimed water likewise no major salt stress symptoms were observed despite the high values of cl and na in their leaf tissue however a proper park management should focus on preventing the appearance of adverse symptoms on sensitive plants thus we recommend to use a leaching requirement of 8 7 for pema and 9 8 for pgw in order to wash out the excessive salt accumulation in soils acknowledgments this work was supported by the collaboration agreements between the university

carried out an experiment in xinjiang an arid region in china to demonstrate the effects of mulching biodegradable films under drip irrigation on soil conditions and cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield in 2015 with less precipitation and 2016 with more precipitation plastic mulch made from polyethylene pe and four types of biodegradable mulch were compared namely bd1 to bd4 with different levels of thickness and induction periods our results indicated that pe mulch was the most efficient in soil water and heat conservation biodegradable mulches performed similarly in warming the soil in both years which increased topsoil 5 20 cm depth temperature than no mulching in the cropping season by 0 66 c and 0 61 c in 2015 and 2016 respectively the effect of mulching on increasing soil water storage was stronger in the wet year the increased soil water storage 0 100 cm depth by biodegradable mulches than no mulching was 113 mm and 194 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively earlier onset of the phenological events of cotton growth was similar between pe mulch and biodegradable mulches mulching shortened the number of days from sowing to cotton maturity by 4 days and 10 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with no mulching biodegradable mulches achieved better performance in enhancing cotton yield and water use efficiency wue in the dry year 916 kg ha 1 1 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 than in the wet year 568 kg ha 1 1 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 although pe mulch resulted in the highest yield there was no significant difference in wue between pe mulch and bd1 or bd2 therefore some of the commercially available biodegradable mulches can be used as a competitive alternative to plastic mulch to enhance crop yield and control soil pollution keywords arid environment oasis agroecosystem pbat soil temperature soil moisture water use efficiency xinjiang 1 introduction mulches have been proven effective in soil water conservation soil temperature regulation weed control and improving water use efficiency wue and crop production li et al 2000 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 qin et al 2015 given these benefits for agriculture plastic mulches made from polyethylene pe are widely applied to many crop species around the world such as corn sugar beet melon and tomato among others li et al 2000 it is predicted that the global usage of agricultural plastic films including plastic mulches will keep increasing from 4 4 million tons in 2012 to 7 4 million tons in 2019 with china and the middle east being the major markets sintim and flury 2017 despite the positive effects in crop yield plastic mulches do not readily biodegrade or are even non degradable after usage plastic mulches break into small segments and cause detrimental soil pollution problems he et al 2018 xie et al 2007 the residual plastic segments reduce soil permeability and impede crop roots absorbing water and nutrient and impair agricultural production liu et al 2008 2014 due to the lack of efficient recovery the rate of residual plastic mulches ranges from 60 to 349 kg ha 1in northwest china dong et al 2013 which risks food security and soil health liu et al 2014 besides the release of plastic fragments from croplands has been recognized as a primary source of plastic accumulation in the sea sintim and flury 2017 hence the white revolution which should have brought the gospel to modern agriculture has turned into the white pollution kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 fortunately the increasing availability of biodegradable mulches offers a potential means to mitigate the adverse impacts of the white pollution kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 different from plastic mulches that need to be retrieved and disposed after harvest biodegradable mulches can be tilled into the soil and degraded by soil organisms sintim and flury 2017 due to the new formulations of biodegradable polymers recent studies have shown that biodegradable mulches can be a competitive alternative to plastic mulches in terms of enhancing crop yield and quality as well as weed prevention for example ghimire et al 2018 indicated that biodegradable mulches could result in the pumpkin yield and quality comparable to that under plastic mulches in the u s a anzalone et al 2010 reported that most of the major weed species were well controlled by both plastic and biodegradable mulches in a tomato field in europe the vast arid and semi arid regions in northwest china are a growing market for biodegradable mulches prior work compared the performance of biodegradable mulches made from different raw materials in mulching practice such as the mechanical behavior and the degradation process in china e g zhan et al 2010 zhao et al 2005 although some studies have examined the effects of biodegradable mulches on soil heat and water conditions and crop yield in other places of the world e g kapanen et al 2008 moreno and moreno 2008 similar efforts in china remain insufficient a previous study indicated that biodegradable mulches were able to raise soil temperature and preserve soil moisture in north china wang et al 2004 but data used in that study was only from field measurements on three different days after sowing thus a more comprehensive in field testing of biodegradable mulches is needed in china xinjiang located in northwest china fig 1 a b is the largest cotton planting region in china due to the extremely arid desert climate and large irrigation demand irrigation is the key to sustaining agricultural production han et al 2015 mamitimin et al 2015 a water saving irrigation technique that equips drip irrigation under mulches has been practiced across xinjiang since the early 1990s wu 2010 the total area under mulched drip irrigation in xinjiang expanded from 50 000 ha in the early 2000s to 2 million ha in 2014 statistical bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2015 therefore it is essential to test the potential of biodegradable mulch as an environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional plastic mulch in the mulched drip irrigation to address this issue we compared four different biodegradable mulches as well as conventional plastic mulch in drip irrigated cotton fields in an oasis agroecosystem in northwest china we investigated the effects of different mulches on 1 soil temperature soil water storage and soil respiration rate 2 cotton growth and yield and 3 wue based on results from two consecutive years one dry year with limited precipitation and one wet year with more abundant precipitation we identified two biodegradable mulches that achieved a similar wue with plastic mulch which were recommended as a proper choice for the wide application in drip irrigation to increase agricultural production and control soil pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experiments were conducted in the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps 44 19 n 85 59 e 412 m a s l in 2015 and 2016 in shihezi city fig 1c d the study site has a typical arid continental climate the average annual sunshine duration amounts up to 2865 h and the frost free period lasts 170 days the total precipitation and average air temperature of the cropping season april to november were 31 7 mm and 20 3 in 2015 and 157 4 mm and 21 6 in 2016 respectively fig 2 air temperature precipitation wind speed and other meteorological data were recorded by an automatic weather station located 100 m from the study site the soil at this site is medium loam with a ph of 7 83 the average field water holding capacity is 0 30 m m of soil and the average permanent wilting point is 0 16 m m of soil within the 0 20 cm topsoil the total n p and available k is 0 80 g kg 1 0 94 g kg 1 and 0 42 g kg 1 respectively prior to the experiment the study site was planted with cotton in 2014 soil bulk density field water holding capacity and permanent wilting point of different soil layers were measured in the lab table s1 2 2 experimental design a typical setup of the mulched drip irrigation in xinjiang was adopted that four rows were sown under one strip of mulch 145 cm wide with two drip tapes fig 3 each drip tape was laid in the middle of a narrow row and the distance between the wide and the narrow rows was 20 and 45 cm respectively the interval between mulches was 50 cm left as the bare land surface dibble sowing was carried out that allowed drip tape laying mulching and seed sowing being completed in one run cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown at a rate of 250 000 plants ha 1 on 27 april 2015 and 21 april 2016 during sowing four types of biodegradable mulches guangzhou kingfa co ltd guangdong china namely bd1 to bd4 as well as conventional pe mulch xinjiang tianye co ltd xinjiang china commonly used in the study area were selected additionally a drip irrigated cotton field without mulching was included as the control each treatment had three replicates and each plot was 18 m 3 m in total eighteen plots i e six treatments four covered by different biodegradable mulches one by pe film and one control three replicates were established all of the other agriculture managements were kept the same with local cotton fields each plot received the same amount and type of fertilizers from the drip irrigation laterals including urea with the n content of 46 and monopotassium phosphate with the p2o5 content of 52 the external diameter and wall thickness of the laterals were 16 mm and 0 3 mm respectively interval spacing between two emitters was 30 cm a water pump was used to exert pressure on the water supply system that was regulated by the pressure gauges installed at the front end of the water supply pipe sluice valves were used to adjust the water pressure in the laterals at 0 06 mpa to maintain a constant flow rate of approximately 1 2 l hour 1 the selected biodegradable mulches were all made from polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat with different levels of thickness 0 01 to 0 012 mm and induction periods 45 to 60 days table 1 the selected pe mulch was transparent with a thinner thickness 0 008 mm than the biodegradable mulches selecting the biodegradable mulches was according to local agriculture management and our preliminary comparison of several more types of biodegradable mulch 2 3 sampling and field measurements 2 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature was measured at 5 10 15 and 20 cm depth in each plot using geothermometers yuhuan zhituo technology co ltd zhejiang china in both years soil temperature measurements were taken at 08 00 12 00 16 00 20 00 local standard time on the day of planting 0 day after sowing das seedling 10 das squaring 45 das flowering 65 das bolling 90 das boll opening 120 das and harvesting 180 das respectively additional daily measurements were undertaken at every two hours from 08 00 to 20 00 in the first month after sowing in all plots in 2015 2 3 2 soil water storage in both years gravimetric soil moisture was measured to the depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals on 45 65 90 120 and 180 das respectively soil samples were collected by a stainless steel ring knife 100 cm3 each depth had three replicated soil samples soil samples were oven dried to a constant weight to calculate gravimetric soil moisture a detailed description of soil sampling and soil moisture measurement was provided in li et al 2013 volumetric soil moisture was calculated based on the measured gravimetric soil moisture and soil bulk density table s1 soil water storage was calculated for 0 100 cm depth of the soil profile 2 3 3 soil respiration photosynthesis and transpiration soil respiration was measured by the li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system li cor inc nebraska u s a every two hours at full blooming 65 das and full bolling 100 das in each plot in 2016 the li 8100 system was mounted on the polyvinyl chloride pvc collars that were inserted into the soils to a depth of 9 5 cm one day prior to the measurement to minimize the disturbance to the soil surface du et al 2014 the pvc collars were installed between the two drip tapes i e the wide rows on the same day of measuring soil respiration gas exchange rate on fully expanded leaves was also recorded with the ci 340 handheld photosynthesis system cid bio science inc washington u s a a fully expanded leaf was secured within the ci 340 chamber to measure leaf gas exchange under ambient conditions photosynthesis rate and transpiration were recorded at 14 00 local standard time with the maximum gas exchange activity li et al 2015 five fully expanded leaves were randomly selected in each plot to conduct the measurement 2 3 4 aboveground biomass cotton growth and cotton yield aboveground biomass measurements started from 30 das and continued at every 30 days throughout the cropping season in 2015 and 2016 on each measurement day aboveground part of five cotton plants was collected plant samples were then oven dried to a constant weight to measure the biomass moreover the date of cotton entering a phenology stage e g emergence squaring flowering boll opening and maturity was also recorded in all plots the definition of each phenology stage was adopted from munger et al 1998 emergence indicates that the hypocotyl with cotyledons breaks through the soil surface squaring indicates that a full canopy surface area develops flowering indicates the beginning of flowering boll opening indicates the beginning of boll bursting and maturity indicates that over 90 of bolls open in addition following the procedure in li et al 2004 four rows of cotton 145 cm wide and 100 cm long in each plot were gathered during harvest to obtain cotton yield 2 3 5 evapotranspiration and wue evapotranspiration et was determined from the soil water mass balance at each of the growing stage 1 e t p i c d r δ s where p is rainfall i is irrigation c is exfiltration of groundwater into the root zone d is deep drainage r is surface runoff and δs is the change in soil water storage 0 100 cm depth in a period such as 0 45 45 65 65 90 90 120 120 180 and 0 180 das the groundwater table at the study site remained at a depth of 8 m and thus c was negligible runoff r was never observed in the field because no heavy storm occurred during the study period d was assumed to be zero in consequence eq 1 is simplified as 2 e t p i δ s wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the ratio between the annual cotton yield and total et eq 2 over the cropping season in each year hussain and al jaloud 1995 2 4 statistical analysis the sas package sas institute inc north carolina u s a was used to perform the one way analysis of variance anova and paired t test the tukey s hsd test was adopted to conduct multiple comparisons after anova to examine the significant difference between the means of different treatments differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature the difference in average temperature of the topsoil 5 20 cm depth between the plots with mulching and those without is compared in fig 4 biodegradable mulches performed similarly in warming the topsoil in two studied years the average change in topsoil temperature under different biodegradable mulches relative to no mulching was 0 66 c and 0 61 c in the cropping season in 2015 and 2016 respectively there is no significant difference between various biodegradable mulches in warming the soil pe mulch showed the strongest ability of heat preservation where topsoil temperature was 1 35 c and 1 48 c higher than no mulching in 2015 and 2016 respectively moreover the paired t test indicates that there is no significant difference in the warming effect of any type of mulch between 2015 less precipitation and 2016 more precipitation therefore precipitation over the cropping season had limited impact on the warming effect of mulching at the study site the stronger warming effect of the selected pe mulch can be explained by its thinner thickness that allows more solar radiation to penetrate and warm the topsoil zhao et al 2011 other studies indicated that thinner biodegradable mulches 0 008 mm could achieve similar or even stronger effect in soil heat preservation with pe mulch e g shen et al 2012 zhang et al 2000 therefore thickness of the film is the primary factor that controls the warming effect by mulching moreover the warming effect was more evident at early stages of cotton growth particularly from seedling to flowering i e 10 to 65 das then the warming effect gradually weakened with the growth of cotton fig 4 which is consistent with previous findings reported in qiao et al 2008 during the period of 0 45 das all of the mulches were intact and the heat loss by cotton transpiration was limited therefore mulching was more effective in warming the soil whereas at late stages of cotton growth i e 65 180 das the warming effect of mulching was offset by cotton transpiration and more frequent irrigation the degradation of biodegradable mulches also reduced the ability of soil heat conservation in addition to the declining trend with cotton growth the warming effect by mulching varies at different depths and different times of a day an example is shown in fig s1 which compares the warming effect in 2 hour intervals at four depths on 15 das in 2015 the warming effect was stronger in the shallow subsurface 5 15 cm depth that could be up to 5 c whereas at 20 cm depth the warming effect decreased to about 1 c the most substantial warming effect was observed at 18 00 indicating an accumulated effect of soil heat conservation during the daytime the warming effect decreased to the minimum at 10 00 on the measuring day before solar radiation began to heat the soil 3 2 soil water storage the difference in soil water storage of 0 100 cm depth between the plots with mulching and those without is compared at various cotton growth stages in fig 5 at early growth stages 45 65 and 90 das when mulches kept relatively intact biodegradable films performed similarly with pe films in soil water preservation in both years fig 5a when approaching late growth stages 120 and 180 das the plots covered by pe mulch stored more water in the soil than those with biodegradable mulches in both years it is suggested that mulching improves soil water condition by reducing unproductive evaporation li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 2015 thus the degradation of biodegradable mulches at late growth stages enhanced soil evaporation and soil water loss li et al 1999 on 120 and 180 das bd2 and bd3 showed a better performance in holding soil water than bd1 and bd4 the faster degradation rates of bd1 and bd4 table 1 limited the efficiency in soil water conservation at later cotton growth stages when averaged to the entire cropping season pe mulch achieved the best effect in maintaining soil water in both years fig 5b the wetting effect by mulching was significantly different between 2015 and 2016 for any type of mulches which was stronger with more precipitation 2016 the average increase in soil water storage 0 100 cm depth by mulching with biodegradable films than no mulching was 113 mm and 194 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively among biodegradable mulches bd2 was the best in maintaining soil water in the wetter year and bd3 is the best in the drier year therefore for the purpose of soil water preservation the biodegradable film with a longer induction period e g bd2 and bd3 is more suitable 3 3 et evapotranspiration et calculated for the plots without mulching as well as the difference in et between the plots with mulching and those without are compared at different periods in table 2 due to the higher precipitation the total et from 0 to 180 das was larger in 2016 than in 2015 all types of mulches showed a stronger influence in limiting the total et in the wetter year 2016 the change in et due to mulching varied at different cotton growth stages at early growth stages 0 65 das cotton plants were immature and the consumption of water was mainly via soil evaporation mulch reduced soil evaporation and thus suppressed et at middle growth stages 65 90 das greater consumption of water was through cotton transpiration because of the earlier growth of cotton under mulches see section 3 4 mulching led to a higher et than no mulching after 90 das the difference in et between mulching and no mulching became relatively small indicating that the increase in et due to greater cotton transpiration in the mulched plots with better developed canopies was offset by the increase in et due to stronger soil evaporation in the plots without mulching where a larger area of bare soil surface existed for all cotton growth stages investigated biodegradable mulches performed similarly with pe mulch in influencing et 3 4 cotton phenology and aboveground biomass table 3 compares the number of days after sowing required by cotton plants to enter various phenology stages under different mulching treatments pe mulch and biodegradable mulches exerted similar impact in advancing cotton growth at all growth stages the earlier onsets of cotton growth were more evident with more precipitation 2016 for example mulching shortened the number of days from sowing to cotton maturity by 4 days and 10 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively the earlier growth of cotton was likely due to the warmer and wetter soil under mulches figs 4 and 5 previous studies also showed that pe films and biodegradable films can increase soil temperature and soil water content thereby promoting crop growth li et al 2001 duan et al 2006 wang et al 2007 in addition different timings of agriculture management between the two studied years e g fertilizer application and irrigation could also influence cotton growth mulching clearly enhanced the accumulation of aboveground biomass of cotton plants than no mulching whereas the difference between various types of mulches was less profound table 4 in the wetter year 2016 aboveground biomass of cotton plants was higher than that in the drier year 2015 at all growth stages after 30 das for example aboveground biomass of cotton plants measured on 150 das in the plots without mulching was 112 3 and 96 3 g plant 1 in 2016 and 2015 respectively however the increase in aboveground biomass by mulching was more remarkable in the drier year for example compared with no mulching the average increase in aboveground biomass in the mulched plots on 150 das was 63 6 and 60 2 g plant 1 in 2015 drier and 2016 wetter boatwright et al 1976 and cumbus and nye 1985 suggested that mulching promotes root development thereby enhancing the absorption of water and nutrient as well as biomass buildup 3 5 cotton yield and water use efficiency wue because of the greater amount of precipitation cotton yield was higher in all plots in 2016 regardless of mulching or no mulching fig 6 a among different types of mulches pe mulch performed the best in enhancing cotton yield in both years i e 5344 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 5432 kg ha 1 in 2016 biodegradable mulches significantly boosted cotton yield in both years the average increase in cotton yield under biodegradable mulches relative to no mulching in 2015 and 2016 was 916 kg ha 1 and 582 kg ha 1 respectively compared with cotton yield without mulching this is a 21 3 increase in cotton yield in the drier year 2015 and a 12 1 increase in the wetter year 2016 respectively therefore mulched drip irrigation is likely more effective in improving yield under the dry condition which is consistent with prior findings in other arid regions e g li et al 2001 however the influence on cotton yield from different types of biodegradable mulches varied in the two years for example bd2 was the most effective in increasing yield in 2015 but bd4 was the best in 2016 it is possible that the accumulated residual mulch segments in the second year of practicing mulching impaired the efficiency of mulching to improve agricultural production he et al 2018 whether or not the long term use of biodegradable mulches can reduce the efficiency of mulching to gain crop yield is still under debate for example moreno and moreno 2008 reported that the decomposition process of the biodegradable film showed a limited effect on the yield in spain however sintim and flury 2017 suggested that although invisible to the naked eye the degraded biodegradable mulch products could also influence soil quality therefore continuous in field test is still needed to clarify this issue mulched drip irrigation significantly improved wue than no mulching fig 6b possibly due to the larger amount of precipitation wue was lower in 2016 across the plots indicating more water was lost as unproductive evaporation in both years there was no significant difference in wue between bd1 bd2 and pe mulch although the absolute values of wue were larger in the plots under pe mulch bd1 and bd2 increased wue from 8 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the control i e no mulching to 10 86 and 10 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 and from 8 06 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 9 42 and 9 35 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 relatively speaking this is an increase of 24 and 17 in wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively which also suggests mulched drip irrigation can be more effective in improving wue under the dry condition given the similar performance in improving wue with pe mulch in both the dry and wet years we recommend bd1 and bd2 as good alternatives of plastic films in practicing mulched drip irrigation previous studies suggested that mulching could change water consumption in cropland from soil evaporation to crop transpiration and from unproductive consumption to valid consumption thereby increasing crop yield and wue li et al 2010 li et al 2001 showed that the use of plastic mulches increased wue by 13 in corn fields here we found that the increase in wue by biodegradable films could be up to 24 in the drier year fig 6b moreover transparent thinner biodegradable mulches e g bd1 and bd2 exhibited better performance on improving cotton yield and wue fig 6 however to satisfy the requirements of mechanical farming thicker biodegradable mulches with higher tenacity are more suitable therefore more commercially available biodegradable mulches should be tested to ensure the sustainability of the oasis agriculture under mulched drip irrigation 3 6 soil respiration cotton photosynthesis and cotton transpiration two hour dynamics of soil respiration rate in consecutive 24 h were compared on 65 das and 100 das in 2016 fig s2 on both days mulching enhanced soil respiration than no mulching the improved soil water and heat conditions under mulches figs 4 and 5 likely favored microbial activity and increased soil respiration gao et al 2009 the greater soil respiration rate under mulches indicated the better gas exchange at the soil atmosphere interface which benefited oxygen entry into soil and root growth this also contributed to the greater cotton yield and wue in the plots under mulches fig 6 among different mulches soil respiration rate of the plots with pe mulch was higher than those under biodegradable mulches on 65 das whereas on 100 das when biodegradable mulches were largely degraded soil respiration rate was higher in the plots covered by biodegradable mulches degradation of mulches enlarged the soil atmosphere interface and then enhanced gas exchange the larger cotton canopy at the later growth stages likely created more shade on the ground and impeded solar radiation to heat the soil which influenced microbial activity and resulted in lower soil respiration rates on 100 das than on 65 das photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate on 65 das and 100 das in 2016 were compared across the plots with different mulching treatments table s2 photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate were higher on 65 das than on 100 das which were influenced by the growth status of cotton leaves and the meteorological conditions during measurement mulching enhanced photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate than no mulching on both days pe mulch resulted in higher photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate than biodegradable mulches which was in line with the better cotton growth under pe mulch tables 3 and 4 different biodegradable mulches perform similarly in strengthening the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration at the cotton growth stages studied 4 conclusions this study evaluated the influence of mulching different films under drip irrigation on soil water and heat conditions cotton growth and wue in a drier year and a wetter year in an oasis agroecosystem in xinjiang northwest china our results indicated that among different types of mulches conventional plastic mulch was the best in soil water and heat conservation biodegradable mulches significantly increased soil water storage and soil temperature than no mulching in both years the warming effect due to mulching with biodegradable films was similar in the two years whereas the wetting effect of biodegradable mulches was more significant in the wetter year 2016 pe mulch and biodegradable mulches performed similarly in advancing cotton growth mulching shortened the time to cotton maturity especially in the wetter year moreover mulching significantly improved cotton yield and wue in drip irrigated fields which was more considerable in the drier year 2015 compared with no mulching biodegradable mulches increased cotton yield by 21 3 and 12 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although pe mulch achieved the highest yield there was no significant difference in wue between the plots covered by pe mulch and those with bd1 or bd2 which enhanced wue by 24 and 17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively relative to no mulching therefore we recommend bd1 and bd2 two commercially available biodegradable mulches as competitive alternatives to conventional plastic film under drip irrigation in arid regions to enhance crop yield and control soil pollution we also advocate continued efforts to test the performance and impacts

carried out an experiment in xinjiang an arid region in china to demonstrate the effects of mulching biodegradable films under drip irrigation on soil conditions and cotton gossypium hirsutum l yield in 2015 with less precipitation and 2016 with more precipitation plastic mulch made from polyethylene pe and four types of biodegradable mulch were compared namely bd1 to bd4 with different levels of thickness and induction periods our results indicated that pe mulch was the most efficient in soil water and heat conservation biodegradable mulches performed similarly in warming the soil in both years which increased topsoil 5 20 cm depth temperature than no mulching in the cropping season by 0 66 c and 0 61 c in 2015 and 2016 respectively the effect of mulching on increasing soil water storage was stronger in the wet year the increased soil water storage 0 100 cm depth by biodegradable mulches than no mulching was 113 mm and 194 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively earlier onset of the phenological events of cotton growth was similar between pe mulch and biodegradable mulches mulching shortened the number of days from sowing to cotton maturity by 4 days and 10 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with no mulching biodegradable mulches achieved better performance in enhancing cotton yield and water use efficiency wue in the dry year 916 kg ha 1 1 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 than in the wet year 568 kg ha 1 1 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 although pe mulch resulted in the highest yield there was no significant difference in wue between pe mulch and bd1 or bd2 therefore some of the commercially available biodegradable mulches can be used as a competitive alternative to plastic mulch to enhance crop yield and control soil pollution keywords arid environment oasis agroecosystem pbat soil temperature soil moisture water use efficiency xinjiang 1 introduction mulches have been proven effective in soil water conservation soil temperature regulation weed control and improving water use efficiency wue and crop production li et al 2000 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 qin et al 2015 given these benefits for agriculture plastic mulches made from polyethylene pe are widely applied to many crop species around the world such as corn sugar beet melon and tomato among others li et al 2000 it is predicted that the global usage of agricultural plastic films including plastic mulches will keep increasing from 4 4 million tons in 2012 to 7 4 million tons in 2019 with china and the middle east being the major markets sintim and flury 2017 despite the positive effects in crop yield plastic mulches do not readily biodegrade or are even non degradable after usage plastic mulches break into small segments and cause detrimental soil pollution problems he et al 2018 xie et al 2007 the residual plastic segments reduce soil permeability and impede crop roots absorbing water and nutrient and impair agricultural production liu et al 2008 2014 due to the lack of efficient recovery the rate of residual plastic mulches ranges from 60 to 349 kg ha 1in northwest china dong et al 2013 which risks food security and soil health liu et al 2014 besides the release of plastic fragments from croplands has been recognized as a primary source of plastic accumulation in the sea sintim and flury 2017 hence the white revolution which should have brought the gospel to modern agriculture has turned into the white pollution kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 fortunately the increasing availability of biodegradable mulches offers a potential means to mitigate the adverse impacts of the white pollution kyrikou and briassoulis 2007 different from plastic mulches that need to be retrieved and disposed after harvest biodegradable mulches can be tilled into the soil and degraded by soil organisms sintim and flury 2017 due to the new formulations of biodegradable polymers recent studies have shown that biodegradable mulches can be a competitive alternative to plastic mulches in terms of enhancing crop yield and quality as well as weed prevention for example ghimire et al 2018 indicated that biodegradable mulches could result in the pumpkin yield and quality comparable to that under plastic mulches in the u s a anzalone et al 2010 reported that most of the major weed species were well controlled by both plastic and biodegradable mulches in a tomato field in europe the vast arid and semi arid regions in northwest china are a growing market for biodegradable mulches prior work compared the performance of biodegradable mulches made from different raw materials in mulching practice such as the mechanical behavior and the degradation process in china e g zhan et al 2010 zhao et al 2005 although some studies have examined the effects of biodegradable mulches on soil heat and water conditions and crop yield in other places of the world e g kapanen et al 2008 moreno and moreno 2008 similar efforts in china remain insufficient a previous study indicated that biodegradable mulches were able to raise soil temperature and preserve soil moisture in north china wang et al 2004 but data used in that study was only from field measurements on three different days after sowing thus a more comprehensive in field testing of biodegradable mulches is needed in china xinjiang located in northwest china fig 1 a b is the largest cotton planting region in china due to the extremely arid desert climate and large irrigation demand irrigation is the key to sustaining agricultural production han et al 2015 mamitimin et al 2015 a water saving irrigation technique that equips drip irrigation under mulches has been practiced across xinjiang since the early 1990s wu 2010 the total area under mulched drip irrigation in xinjiang expanded from 50 000 ha in the early 2000s to 2 million ha in 2014 statistical bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2015 therefore it is essential to test the potential of biodegradable mulch as an environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional plastic mulch in the mulched drip irrigation to address this issue we compared four different biodegradable mulches as well as conventional plastic mulch in drip irrigated cotton fields in an oasis agroecosystem in northwest china we investigated the effects of different mulches on 1 soil temperature soil water storage and soil respiration rate 2 cotton growth and yield and 3 wue based on results from two consecutive years one dry year with limited precipitation and one wet year with more abundant precipitation we identified two biodegradable mulches that achieved a similar wue with plastic mulch which were recommended as a proper choice for the wide application in drip irrigation to increase agricultural production and control soil pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experiments were conducted in the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of the xinjiang production and construction corps 44 19 n 85 59 e 412 m a s l in 2015 and 2016 in shihezi city fig 1c d the study site has a typical arid continental climate the average annual sunshine duration amounts up to 2865 h and the frost free period lasts 170 days the total precipitation and average air temperature of the cropping season april to november were 31 7 mm and 20 3 in 2015 and 157 4 mm and 21 6 in 2016 respectively fig 2 air temperature precipitation wind speed and other meteorological data were recorded by an automatic weather station located 100 m from the study site the soil at this site is medium loam with a ph of 7 83 the average field water holding capacity is 0 30 m m of soil and the average permanent wilting point is 0 16 m m of soil within the 0 20 cm topsoil the total n p and available k is 0 80 g kg 1 0 94 g kg 1 and 0 42 g kg 1 respectively prior to the experiment the study site was planted with cotton in 2014 soil bulk density field water holding capacity and permanent wilting point of different soil layers were measured in the lab table s1 2 2 experimental design a typical setup of the mulched drip irrigation in xinjiang was adopted that four rows were sown under one strip of mulch 145 cm wide with two drip tapes fig 3 each drip tape was laid in the middle of a narrow row and the distance between the wide and the narrow rows was 20 and 45 cm respectively the interval between mulches was 50 cm left as the bare land surface dibble sowing was carried out that allowed drip tape laying mulching and seed sowing being completed in one run cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown at a rate of 250 000 plants ha 1 on 27 april 2015 and 21 april 2016 during sowing four types of biodegradable mulches guangzhou kingfa co ltd guangdong china namely bd1 to bd4 as well as conventional pe mulch xinjiang tianye co ltd xinjiang china commonly used in the study area were selected additionally a drip irrigated cotton field without mulching was included as the control each treatment had three replicates and each plot was 18 m 3 m in total eighteen plots i e six treatments four covered by different biodegradable mulches one by pe film and one control three replicates were established all of the other agriculture managements were kept the same with local cotton fields each plot received the same amount and type of fertilizers from the drip irrigation laterals including urea with the n content of 46 and monopotassium phosphate with the p2o5 content of 52 the external diameter and wall thickness of the laterals were 16 mm and 0 3 mm respectively interval spacing between two emitters was 30 cm a water pump was used to exert pressure on the water supply system that was regulated by the pressure gauges installed at the front end of the water supply pipe sluice valves were used to adjust the water pressure in the laterals at 0 06 mpa to maintain a constant flow rate of approximately 1 2 l hour 1 the selected biodegradable mulches were all made from polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat with different levels of thickness 0 01 to 0 012 mm and induction periods 45 to 60 days table 1 the selected pe mulch was transparent with a thinner thickness 0 008 mm than the biodegradable mulches selecting the biodegradable mulches was according to local agriculture management and our preliminary comparison of several more types of biodegradable mulch 2 3 sampling and field measurements 2 3 1 soil temperature soil temperature was measured at 5 10 15 and 20 cm depth in each plot using geothermometers yuhuan zhituo technology co ltd zhejiang china in both years soil temperature measurements were taken at 08 00 12 00 16 00 20 00 local standard time on the day of planting 0 day after sowing das seedling 10 das squaring 45 das flowering 65 das bolling 90 das boll opening 120 das and harvesting 180 das respectively additional daily measurements were undertaken at every two hours from 08 00 to 20 00 in the first month after sowing in all plots in 2015 2 3 2 soil water storage in both years gravimetric soil moisture was measured to the depth of 100 cm at 10 cm intervals on 45 65 90 120 and 180 das respectively soil samples were collected by a stainless steel ring knife 100 cm3 each depth had three replicated soil samples soil samples were oven dried to a constant weight to calculate gravimetric soil moisture a detailed description of soil sampling and soil moisture measurement was provided in li et al 2013 volumetric soil moisture was calculated based on the measured gravimetric soil moisture and soil bulk density table s1 soil water storage was calculated for 0 100 cm depth of the soil profile 2 3 3 soil respiration photosynthesis and transpiration soil respiration was measured by the li 8100 automated soil co2 flux system li cor inc nebraska u s a every two hours at full blooming 65 das and full bolling 100 das in each plot in 2016 the li 8100 system was mounted on the polyvinyl chloride pvc collars that were inserted into the soils to a depth of 9 5 cm one day prior to the measurement to minimize the disturbance to the soil surface du et al 2014 the pvc collars were installed between the two drip tapes i e the wide rows on the same day of measuring soil respiration gas exchange rate on fully expanded leaves was also recorded with the ci 340 handheld photosynthesis system cid bio science inc washington u s a a fully expanded leaf was secured within the ci 340 chamber to measure leaf gas exchange under ambient conditions photosynthesis rate and transpiration were recorded at 14 00 local standard time with the maximum gas exchange activity li et al 2015 five fully expanded leaves were randomly selected in each plot to conduct the measurement 2 3 4 aboveground biomass cotton growth and cotton yield aboveground biomass measurements started from 30 das and continued at every 30 days throughout the cropping season in 2015 and 2016 on each measurement day aboveground part of five cotton plants was collected plant samples were then oven dried to a constant weight to measure the biomass moreover the date of cotton entering a phenology stage e g emergence squaring flowering boll opening and maturity was also recorded in all plots the definition of each phenology stage was adopted from munger et al 1998 emergence indicates that the hypocotyl with cotyledons breaks through the soil surface squaring indicates that a full canopy surface area develops flowering indicates the beginning of flowering boll opening indicates the beginning of boll bursting and maturity indicates that over 90 of bolls open in addition following the procedure in li et al 2004 four rows of cotton 145 cm wide and 100 cm long in each plot were gathered during harvest to obtain cotton yield 2 3 5 evapotranspiration and wue evapotranspiration et was determined from the soil water mass balance at each of the growing stage 1 e t p i c d r δ s where p is rainfall i is irrigation c is exfiltration of groundwater into the root zone d is deep drainage r is surface runoff and δs is the change in soil water storage 0 100 cm depth in a period such as 0 45 45 65 65 90 90 120 120 180 and 0 180 das the groundwater table at the study site remained at a depth of 8 m and thus c was negligible runoff r was never observed in the field because no heavy storm occurred during the study period d was assumed to be zero in consequence eq 1 is simplified as 2 e t p i δ s wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the ratio between the annual cotton yield and total et eq 2 over the cropping season in each year hussain and al jaloud 1995 2 4 statistical analysis the sas package sas institute inc north carolina u s a was used to perform the one way analysis of variance anova and paired t test the tukey s hsd test was adopted to conduct multiple comparisons after anova to examine the significant difference between the means of different treatments differences were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil temperature the difference in average temperature of the topsoil 5 20 cm depth between the plots with mulching and those without is compared in fig 4 biodegradable mulches performed similarly in warming the topsoil in two studied years the average change in topsoil temperature under different biodegradable mulches relative to no mulching was 0 66 c and 0 61 c in the cropping season in 2015 and 2016 respectively there is no significant difference between various biodegradable mulches in warming the soil pe mulch showed the strongest ability of heat preservation where topsoil temperature was 1 35 c and 1 48 c higher than no mulching in 2015 and 2016 respectively moreover the paired t test indicates that there is no significant difference in the warming effect of any type of mulch between 2015 less precipitation and 2016 more precipitation therefore precipitation over the cropping season had limited impact on the warming effect of mulching at the study site the stronger warming effect of the selected pe mulch can be explained by its thinner thickness that allows more solar radiation to penetrate and warm the topsoil zhao et al 2011 other studies indicated that thinner biodegradable mulches 0 008 mm could achieve similar or even stronger effect in soil heat preservation with pe mulch e g shen et al 2012 zhang et al 2000 therefore thickness of the film is the primary factor that controls the warming effect by mulching moreover the warming effect was more evident at early stages of cotton growth particularly from seedling to flowering i e 10 to 65 das then the warming effect gradually weakened with the growth of cotton fig 4 which is consistent with previous findings reported in qiao et al 2008 during the period of 0 45 das all of the mulches were intact and the heat loss by cotton transpiration was limited therefore mulching was more effective in warming the soil whereas at late stages of cotton growth i e 65 180 das the warming effect of mulching was offset by cotton transpiration and more frequent irrigation the degradation of biodegradable mulches also reduced the ability of soil heat conservation in addition to the declining trend with cotton growth the warming effect by mulching varies at different depths and different times of a day an example is shown in fig s1 which compares the warming effect in 2 hour intervals at four depths on 15 das in 2015 the warming effect was stronger in the shallow subsurface 5 15 cm depth that could be up to 5 c whereas at 20 cm depth the warming effect decreased to about 1 c the most substantial warming effect was observed at 18 00 indicating an accumulated effect of soil heat conservation during the daytime the warming effect decreased to the minimum at 10 00 on the measuring day before solar radiation began to heat the soil 3 2 soil water storage the difference in soil water storage of 0 100 cm depth between the plots with mulching and those without is compared at various cotton growth stages in fig 5 at early growth stages 45 65 and 90 das when mulches kept relatively intact biodegradable films performed similarly with pe films in soil water preservation in both years fig 5a when approaching late growth stages 120 and 180 das the plots covered by pe mulch stored more water in the soil than those with biodegradable mulches in both years it is suggested that mulching improves soil water condition by reducing unproductive evaporation li et al 2013 qin et al 2014 2015 thus the degradation of biodegradable mulches at late growth stages enhanced soil evaporation and soil water loss li et al 1999 on 120 and 180 das bd2 and bd3 showed a better performance in holding soil water than bd1 and bd4 the faster degradation rates of bd1 and bd4 table 1 limited the efficiency in soil water conservation at later cotton growth stages when averaged to the entire cropping season pe mulch achieved the best effect in maintaining soil water in both years fig 5b the wetting effect by mulching was significantly different between 2015 and 2016 for any type of mulches which was stronger with more precipitation 2016 the average increase in soil water storage 0 100 cm depth by mulching with biodegradable films than no mulching was 113 mm and 194 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively among biodegradable mulches bd2 was the best in maintaining soil water in the wetter year and bd3 is the best in the drier year therefore for the purpose of soil water preservation the biodegradable film with a longer induction period e g bd2 and bd3 is more suitable 3 3 et evapotranspiration et calculated for the plots without mulching as well as the difference in et between the plots with mulching and those without are compared at different periods in table 2 due to the higher precipitation the total et from 0 to 180 das was larger in 2016 than in 2015 all types of mulches showed a stronger influence in limiting the total et in the wetter year 2016 the change in et due to mulching varied at different cotton growth stages at early growth stages 0 65 das cotton plants were immature and the consumption of water was mainly via soil evaporation mulch reduced soil evaporation and thus suppressed et at middle growth stages 65 90 das greater consumption of water was through cotton transpiration because of the earlier growth of cotton under mulches see section 3 4 mulching led to a higher et than no mulching after 90 das the difference in et between mulching and no mulching became relatively small indicating that the increase in et due to greater cotton transpiration in the mulched plots with better developed canopies was offset by the increase in et due to stronger soil evaporation in the plots without mulching where a larger area of bare soil surface existed for all cotton growth stages investigated biodegradable mulches performed similarly with pe mulch in influencing et 3 4 cotton phenology and aboveground biomass table 3 compares the number of days after sowing required by cotton plants to enter various phenology stages under different mulching treatments pe mulch and biodegradable mulches exerted similar impact in advancing cotton growth at all growth stages the earlier onsets of cotton growth were more evident with more precipitation 2016 for example mulching shortened the number of days from sowing to cotton maturity by 4 days and 10 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively the earlier growth of cotton was likely due to the warmer and wetter soil under mulches figs 4 and 5 previous studies also showed that pe films and biodegradable films can increase soil temperature and soil water content thereby promoting crop growth li et al 2001 duan et al 2006 wang et al 2007 in addition different timings of agriculture management between the two studied years e g fertilizer application and irrigation could also influence cotton growth mulching clearly enhanced the accumulation of aboveground biomass of cotton plants than no mulching whereas the difference between various types of mulches was less profound table 4 in the wetter year 2016 aboveground biomass of cotton plants was higher than that in the drier year 2015 at all growth stages after 30 das for example aboveground biomass of cotton plants measured on 150 das in the plots without mulching was 112 3 and 96 3 g plant 1 in 2016 and 2015 respectively however the increase in aboveground biomass by mulching was more remarkable in the drier year for example compared with no mulching the average increase in aboveground biomass in the mulched plots on 150 das was 63 6 and 60 2 g plant 1 in 2015 drier and 2016 wetter boatwright et al 1976 and cumbus and nye 1985 suggested that mulching promotes root development thereby enhancing the absorption of water and nutrient as well as biomass buildup 3 5 cotton yield and water use efficiency wue because of the greater amount of precipitation cotton yield was higher in all plots in 2016 regardless of mulching or no mulching fig 6 a among different types of mulches pe mulch performed the best in enhancing cotton yield in both years i e 5344 kg ha 1 in 2015 and 5432 kg ha 1 in 2016 biodegradable mulches significantly boosted cotton yield in both years the average increase in cotton yield under biodegradable mulches relative to no mulching in 2015 and 2016 was 916 kg ha 1 and 582 kg ha 1 respectively compared with cotton yield without mulching this is a 21 3 increase in cotton yield in the drier year 2015 and a 12 1 increase in the wetter year 2016 respectively therefore mulched drip irrigation is likely more effective in improving yield under the dry condition which is consistent with prior findings in other arid regions e g li et al 2001 however the influence on cotton yield from different types of biodegradable mulches varied in the two years for example bd2 was the most effective in increasing yield in 2015 but bd4 was the best in 2016 it is possible that the accumulated residual mulch segments in the second year of practicing mulching impaired the efficiency of mulching to improve agricultural production he et al 2018 whether or not the long term use of biodegradable mulches can reduce the efficiency of mulching to gain crop yield is still under debate for example moreno and moreno 2008 reported that the decomposition process of the biodegradable film showed a limited effect on the yield in spain however sintim and flury 2017 suggested that although invisible to the naked eye the degraded biodegradable mulch products could also influence soil quality therefore continuous in field test is still needed to clarify this issue mulched drip irrigation significantly improved wue than no mulching fig 6b possibly due to the larger amount of precipitation wue was lower in 2016 across the plots indicating more water was lost as unproductive evaporation in both years there was no significant difference in wue between bd1 bd2 and pe mulch although the absolute values of wue were larger in the plots under pe mulch bd1 and bd2 increased wue from 8 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the control i e no mulching to 10 86 and 10 85 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2015 and from 8 06 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 9 42 and 9 35 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2016 relatively speaking this is an increase of 24 and 17 in wue in 2015 and 2016 respectively which also suggests mulched drip irrigation can be more effective in improving wue under the dry condition given the similar performance in improving wue with pe mulch in both the dry and wet years we recommend bd1 and bd2 as good alternatives of plastic films in practicing mulched drip irrigation previous studies suggested that mulching could change water consumption in cropland from soil evaporation to crop transpiration and from unproductive consumption to valid consumption thereby increasing crop yield and wue li et al 2010 li et al 2001 showed that the use of plastic mulches increased wue by 13 in corn fields here we found that the increase in wue by biodegradable films could be up to 24 in the drier year fig 6b moreover transparent thinner biodegradable mulches e g bd1 and bd2 exhibited better performance on improving cotton yield and wue fig 6 however to satisfy the requirements of mechanical farming thicker biodegradable mulches with higher tenacity are more suitable therefore more commercially available biodegradable mulches should be tested to ensure the sustainability of the oasis agriculture under mulched drip irrigation 3 6 soil respiration cotton photosynthesis and cotton transpiration two hour dynamics of soil respiration rate in consecutive 24 h were compared on 65 das and 100 das in 2016 fig s2 on both days mulching enhanced soil respiration than no mulching the improved soil water and heat conditions under mulches figs 4 and 5 likely favored microbial activity and increased soil respiration gao et al 2009 the greater soil respiration rate under mulches indicated the better gas exchange at the soil atmosphere interface which benefited oxygen entry into soil and root growth this also contributed to the greater cotton yield and wue in the plots under mulches fig 6 among different mulches soil respiration rate of the plots with pe mulch was higher than those under biodegradable mulches on 65 das whereas on 100 das when biodegradable mulches were largely degraded soil respiration rate was higher in the plots covered by biodegradable mulches degradation of mulches enlarged the soil atmosphere interface and then enhanced gas exchange the larger cotton canopy at the later growth stages likely created more shade on the ground and impeded solar radiation to heat the soil which influenced microbial activity and resulted in lower soil respiration rates on 100 das than on 65 das photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate on 65 das and 100 das in 2016 were compared across the plots with different mulching treatments table s2 photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate were higher on 65 das than on 100 das which were influenced by the growth status of cotton leaves and the meteorological conditions during measurement mulching enhanced photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate than no mulching on both days pe mulch resulted in higher photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate than biodegradable mulches which was in line with the better cotton growth under pe mulch tables 3 and 4 different biodegradable mulches perform similarly in strengthening the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration at the cotton growth stages studied 4 conclusions this study evaluated the influence of mulching different films under drip irrigation on soil water and heat conditions cotton growth and wue in a drier year and a wetter year in an oasis agroecosystem in xinjiang northwest china our results indicated that among different types of mulches conventional plastic mulch was the best in soil water and heat conservation biodegradable mulches significantly increased soil water storage and soil temperature than no mulching in both years the warming effect due to mulching with biodegradable films was similar in the two years whereas the wetting effect of biodegradable mulches was more significant in the wetter year 2016 pe mulch and biodegradable mulches performed similarly in advancing cotton growth mulching shortened the time to cotton maturity especially in the wetter year moreover mulching significantly improved cotton yield and wue in drip irrigated fields which was more considerable in the drier year 2015 compared with no mulching biodegradable mulches increased cotton yield by 21 3 and 12 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although pe mulch achieved the highest yield there was no significant difference in wue between the plots covered by pe mulch and those with bd1 or bd2 which enhanced wue by 24 and 17 in 2015 and 2016 respectively relative to no mulching therefore we recommend bd1 and bd2 two commercially available biodegradable mulches as competitive alternatives to conventional plastic film under drip irrigation in arid regions to enhance crop yield and control soil pollution we also advocate continued efforts to test the performance and impacts
