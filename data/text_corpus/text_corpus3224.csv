16120,chromate cr vi and pentachlorophenol pcp coexist widely in the environment and are highly toxic to public health however whether cr vi bio reduction is accompanied by pcp bio degradation and how microbial communities can keep long term stability to mediate these bioprocesses in aquifer remain elusive herein we conducted a 365 day continuous column experiment during which the concurrent removals of cr vi and pcp were realized under anaerobic condition this process allowed for complete cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation at an efficiency of 92 8 4 2 using ethanol as a co metabolic substrate more specifically cr vi was reduced to insoluble chromium iii and pcp was efficiently dechlorinated with chloride ion release collectively acinetobacter and spirochaeta regulated cr vi bio reduction heterotrophically while pseudomonas mediated not only cr vi bio reduction but also pcp bio dechlorination the bio dechlorinated products were further mineralized by azospira and longilinea genes encoding proteins for cr vi bio reduction chra and yief and pcp bio degradation pcea were upregulated cytochrome c and intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide were involved in cr vi and pcp detoxification by promoting electron transfer taken together our findings provide a promising bioremediation strategy for concurrent removal of cr vi and pcp in aquifers through bio stimulation with supplementation of appropriate substrates keywords chromium pentachlorophenol microbial evolution co metabolism synthetic aquifer 1 introduction increasing attention has been paid to the concurrent co contamination of heavy metals and organic compounds in aquifers cabeza et al 2012 krcmar et al 2018 critically these co contaminants are able to spontaneously migrate in natural ecosystems liu and han 2021 chromate cr vi and pentachlorophenol pcp are representative co contaminants in these natural ecosystems threatening human health and well being visvanathan et al 2005 zhang et al 2012 amrik et al 2014 modern industrial processes such as metalworking petroleum refining leather tanning and steel production commonly lead to excessive chromium discharge mukherjee et al 1998 chirwa et al 2000 shi et al 2019 to better protect the environment and human health the world health organization who establishes 50 μg l as the maximum chromium contaminant level in drinking water who 2017 in natural waters the valence of chromium ranges from 6 to 2 comparatively cr vi has higher toxicity solubility mobility and bioavailability relative to other species nath et al 2009 kim et al 2015 lu et al 2018 bishop et al 2019 aquifers contaminated by cr vi are found around the globe for instance the groundwater near a marble processing plant in limpopo province south africa has been measured with a cr vi concentration ranging from 2 30 6 49 mg l williams et al 2014 in china cr vi has become a characteristic aquifer contaminant in areas along the yellow river e g baotou this contamination is due to massive discharge of chromium containing industrial wastewater bai et al 2016 lu et al 2020 given the seriousness of this global problem the removal and detoxification of cr vi is of great interest for programs involving groundwater resource quality protection pcp is widely used as a herbicide defoliant germicide preservative and molluscacide due to its inherent bactericidal and fungicidal properties although pcp has been banned in many countries e g germany austria and china it remains detectable globally and in every medium type air water and soil geyer et al 1987 muir et al 1999 zheng et al 2011 pcp contaminated aquifers are frequently reported for example pcp has been used in finland during the process of wood protection this use has occurred for several decades leading to severe aquifer contamination around sawmills kitunen et al 1987 distressingly pcp is a persistent toxic substance that has raised critical human health and environmental concerns as a result the who includes it as a class i carcinogen and its concentration in drinking water has been limited to under 9 μg l who 2017 notably chromium and pcp are used as a tanning agent and biocide respectively during the leather tanning process concentrations of chromium 500 700 mg l and pcp 10 90 mg l are commonly found in tannery effluent resulting in severe combined contamination in nearby aquifers due to the insufficient wastewater treatment srivastava et al 2007 thakur et al 2011 for example both cr vi 4 17 mg l and pcp 4 47 mg l have been detected in aquifers located in southern taiwan kao et al 2004 ou et al 2020 therefore developing strategies for the concurrent removal of cr vi and pcp in aquifers is highly relevant for efficient groundwater remediation cr vi and pcp found in aquifers can be removed by an anaerobic microbial process a benefit of this approach is that it is likely both more sustainable and effective than conventional methods tong et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 the detoxification of cr vi to cr iii has been achieved through anaerobic bio reduction singh et al 2007 sharma et al 2008 heterotrophic cr vi reducers catalyze this biotransformation using organic carbon as an electron donor sharma et al 2009 tripathi et al 2011 wang et al 2018a however the direct anaerobic bio degradation of pcp remains difficult given its stable aromatic ring structure and polychlorinated substituents lin et al 2016 with this limitation in mind co metabolic degradation using bio dechlorination to accelerate pcp removal has become an effective strategy with the addition of the appropriate co metabolic substrates such as sodium acetate wang et al 2016 citrate and lactate li et al 2019 these substrates provide sufficient carbon and energy sources for microorganism growth and elevate their corresponding enzyme production ultimately this helps facilitate pcp degradation thus far both microbial processes cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation have been independently investigated and developed there remain open questions regarding whether 1 cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation occurs simultaneously within an aquifer and 2 how microbial communities mediate the long term stability of this process therefore we proposed here a promising bioremediation strategy for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation in parallel this was achieved using bio stimulation which is a simple efficient and environmental friendly remediation method this approach features in situ addition of a bioavailable substrate to modify the medium s physicochemical conditions this results in an enhanced ability of the microbial community to remove the desired contaminants álvarez et al 2015 continuous operation of a biological column for 365 days was conducted which allowed us to investigate the feasibility and stability of this process at varied hydraulic and biogeochemical conditions this was followed by a characterization of the reaction products identification of microbial community composition quantification of key related genes and assessment of electron transfer compounds collectively these findings highlighted the concurrent biogeochemical processes of both cr vi and pcp and the development of a potential bioremediation strategy for their co contaminated aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental column was a plexiglass column with a height of 250 mm and an inner diameter of 50 mm the column was made of plexiglass and equipped with three sampling ports distributed evenly along the length of the column fig s1 the initial inoculum was aquifer sediment collected from a tailing reservoir of a metal mine in the panzhihua region of sichuan province china 26 05 27 21 n 101 08 102 15 e at an elevation of 1 200 m above sea level chromium contamination was found in the aquifer at this site briefly 50 ml of the initial inoculum was evenly mixed with quartz and then added into column to regulate porosity the effective volume was 300 ml the column was then covered with aluminum foil to omit light synthetic groundwater in the inlet bottle was degassed with n2 for 30 min then injected into the column through upstream flow using a peristaltic pump bt100 1l shanghai china the column as well as inlet and outlet bottles were sealed and connected by pipes to prevent oxygen diffusion the synthetic groundwater contained 0 8082 g l nahco3 and 0 0299 g l kh2po4 with ethanol 99 v v as the co metabolic substrate cr vi was supplied in the form of k2cr2o7 all chemicals used in this study were analytical grade reagents a series of batch experiments were also conducted in 250 ml plexiglass bottles sealed by air tight rubber stoppers to verify the involved bioprocesses for cr vi and pcp removal briefly 10 ml anaerobic consortium from the column experiment was added as inoculum then 200 ml of synthetic groundwater with the same components as stage 1 of the column experiment was also supplemented all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 c 2 2 long term experimental procedure detailed operating conditions for the long term experiment were shown in table 1 briefly the entire 365 days of the experiment was divided into five stages these stages were determined according to different hydraulic retention time hrt chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and pollutant loading the hrt ranged from 2 to 0 25 days corresponding to a flow rate of 0 104 ml min to 0 833 ml min respectively the equivalent cod concentration contributed by ethanol was in the range of 200 400 mg l which was considering the inadequate organic carbon in the aquifer sediments the effluent from the column was collected daily to determine groundwater quality indices including cr vi pcp cod ph orp and conductivity han and liu 2004 bio degradation products of pcp microbial community characteristics harbored functional genes and electron transfer compounds were monitored at the end of each stage the solid products of the bio reduction related to cr vi were characterized at the end of the experiment 2 3 analytical methods all liquid samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm filter prior to analysis the concentration of cr vi was measured using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv2300 shanghai china at a wavelength at 540 nm zhang et al 2012 pcp concentration was detected using high performance liquid chromatography lc 10a shimadzu japan the bio degradation products of pcp were identified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry trace gc dsq thermo fisher usa following standard

rapid dna spin kit according to the manufacturer s instructions arup california usa the extracted dna was amplified using polymerase chain reaction pcr with primers of 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and

the ncbi database with accession number of prjna756235 according to the silva ssu115 16s rrna database the classifier was used to analyze the classification with a confidence threshold of 70 fei et al 2022 real time quantitative pcr detection system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa was used to perform quantitative pcr qpcr for functional genes including chra and yief for cr vi bio reduction and pcea for reductive bio dichlorination of pcp specific primers were shown in table s1 he et al 2011 ashwana et al 2014 the released electrons could be transferred to cr vi and pcp through microbial cell surfaces by cytochrome c and within cell by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh therefore cytochrome c and nadh were extracted and determined as previously described zhao et al 2017 kang et al 2018 li et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term cr vi and pcp removal over the 365 days of the experiment the dynamics of individual cr vi and pcp concentrations along with their removal efficiencies and capacities were measured and shown in figure 1 in stage 1 0 149 d 99 9 0 07 and 57 9 32 3 of cr vi and pcp were removed with an initial concentration of 10 mg l for both cr vi and pcp removal capacities were 4 99 0 03 g m3 d and 2 89 1 62 g m3 d for cr vi and pcp respectively it was noteworthy that the pcp removal efficiency significantly fluctuated owing to its high toxicity in the later period of stage 1 pcp reached a relatively steady and high removal efficiency of approximately 94 indicating pcp decomposers were progressively enriched for subsequent pcp removal in stage 2 150 219 d when the influent cr vi concentration had increased to 50 mg l the removal efficiencies of cr vi and pcp were 99 9 0 06 and 100 respectively their corresponding removal capacities were 24 90 0 01 g m3 d and 5 g m3 d respectively suggesting that cr vi reducers had successfully adapted to the increased toxicity in stage 3 220 259 d when the influent pcp concentration had increased to 50 mg l complete cr vi removal was realized with a removal capacity of 5 g m3 although the pcp concentration had significantly increased by five fold the biological column still yielded a high pcp removal efficiency of 97 4 1 8 along with a removal capacity of 24 36 0 47 g m3 d these results indicated that the pcp decomposers were gradually tolerant to increased toxicity in stages 2 and 3 moscoso et al 2012 when the cod concentration decreased to 200 mg l in stage 4 both the cr vi and pcp removal performances were well maintained with removal efficiencies and capacities of 100 and 5 g m3 d for cr vi and 92 8 4 2 and 4 64 0 21 g m3 d for pcp these results indicated that a lower bioavailable substrate was sufficient for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation this highlighted its practical applicability owing to the reduced organic matter found in groundwater meanwhile bioavailable substrate played an important role in co metabolic pcp bio degradation shi et al 2015 which ultimately accelerated the bio degradation process the bioavailable substrate doses in our study were relatively lower than those shown in existing bio stimulation studies and or applications for instance ethanol was injected into the cr vi contaminated aquifer at an abandoned industrial site for remediation purposes and reached the cod concentration in groundwater at approximately 1900 mg l song et al 2021 relatedly 900 mg l cod in the form of lactate was supplemented for pcp bio degradation in paddy soils of southern china chen et al 2012 in stage 5 311 365 d and along with the decreased hrt from days 1 to 0 25 in the three substages complete cr vi removal was still maintained maximum removal capacity of 40 g m3 d was achieved in contrast pcp decreased considerably to 57 7 12 6 with corresponding removal capacities of 23 10 5 10 g m3 d this finding showed that cr vi removal was able to resist hrt fluctuations in the tested biosystem comparatively the sharp decrease of pcp removal when hrt was shortened suggested that co metabolic pcp bio degradation was more easily suppressed than cr vi bio reduction 3 2 identification of reaction products and bioprocesses the total cr concentration in the column s effluent was nearly equal to the effluent cr vi concentration fig s2 this result suggested that the products from cr vi reduction had almost precipitated to further explore the potential reaction products during cr vi bio reduction microbial morphology on the quartz collected from the column was analyzed after the 365 day experiment had ended based on the representative sem image fig 2 a a large number of precipitates had deposited on the cell surface and a high cr signal in the eds spectra was noted fig 2b the tight attachment of these precipitates to the cells ensured that they were not easily washed away but remained in place it had been previously shown that biosystems had good immobilization for cr vi reduction products thereby preventing their secondary release lai et al 2016 xrd spectra further revealed that the structure of these precipitates was related to both cr oh 3 and cro oh fig 2c especially with a high signal for cr oh 3 xps results clearly showed two obvious peaks namely cr 2p1 2 and cr 2p3 2 at 586 3 ev and 576 6 ev respectively fig 2d this suggested cr iii in the precipitates wang et al 2018b in our batch experiments and when compared with the biotic group hardly any cr vi was removed either with sterilization or in the abiotic group fig s3a this suggested adsorption and chemical reduction had a negligible contribution to cr vi removal cr vi was rarely absorbed by microbes lai et al 2016 these results provided strong evidence that cr vi was removed primarily through bio reduction cl was detected in the effluent at each stage and its concentration roughly equaled to the one that the removed pcp contained except for stage 3 which had the highest influent pcp concentration fig s4 these findings implied the efficient dechlorination of pcp tong et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 clear pcp removal was also observed in the biotic group of the batch experiments fig s3b while pcp removal under conditions of either sterilization or in the abiotic group was insignificant these findings implied adsorption and chemical dechlorination had a negligible contribution to pcp removal little pcp could be absorbed by microbes owing to its biorefractory characteristics li et al 2013 these results collectively illustrated that pcp was bio degraded through bio dechlorination in our proposed biosystem possible bio dechlorinated products were further examined in stage 5a only 2 90 0 17 mg l phenol was detected without the appearance of other chlorophenol compounds furthermore the detected phenol concentration was lower than the theoretical one from pcp degradation while the measured co2 yield was slightly higher than that from ethanol oxidation this confirmed that mineralization occurred during pcp removal the cod concentrations declined rapidly across each stage with an average utilization percentage at 93 50 47 65 fig s5 decrease in the concentration of ethanol was also accordingly observed these results indicated the consumption of ethanol as an electron donor for cr vi bio reduction and co metabolic substrate for pcp bio degradation under anaerobic conditions sulfate and nitrate have been convincingly reported to inhibit pcp bio dechlorination owing to electron competition xu et al 2018 meanwhile the redox potential of cr vi was higher than that of sulfate eө 172 mv and nitrate eө 934 mv thus it could be inferred that pcp bio degradation might be impacted by cr vi bio reduction however this hypothesis would require additional research to confirm 3 3 microbial community evolution and functional gene examination microbial richness and diversity in the inoculum were higher than those in each stage table s2 and fig s6 indicating that the high toxicity of co existing cr vi and pcp significantly reshaped microbial communities the pca findings showed that microbial samples from all stages of the column were clearly distinct from the inoculum fig 3 a suggesting that microorganisms capable of cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation gradually adapted to changing operational conditions hao et al 2018 in fig 3b 176 350 347 163 and 254 independent otus from stage 1 to stage 5 were displayed in the venn diagram 471 shared otus across all stages had adapted to experimental column with cr vi pcp and co metabolic substrate during the long term operation of the column the microbial community at the class level was significantly changed fig 3c more specifically anaerolineae gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidia predominated across all stages anaerolineae had the highest relative abundance in stage 3 with the highest pcp concentration this indicated that anaerolineae had a higher pcp tolerance the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria was higher in stages 1 and 2 and gradually reduced from stages 3 to 5 this implied that it might be effective at cr vi bio reduction and that the highest pcp concentration in stage 3 caused irreversible damage to the enriched gammaproteobacteria in addition past work had shown that predominant deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidia had also grown and accumulated in either vanadium or chromium oxide solutions guan et al 2019 kosek et al 2019 zakharyuk et al 2019 potential bacteria for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation were identified at the genus level the accumulated heterotrophic cr vi reducers e g acinetobacter and spirochaeta contributed to cr vi bio reduction arias et al 2003 jin et al 2017 an et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and were concentratedly distributed within the first three stages pseudomonas was rarely detected in the inoculum but was significantly enriched from stages 1 to 2 with corresponding relative abundances from 20 64 to 22 84 however this value greatly decreased to 9 44 2 69 and 1 65 from stage 3 to 5 the ability of pseudomonas to bio reduce cr vi to cr iii and bio biodegrade pcp for mineralization had been previously confirmed by several lines of past research kao et al 2005 song et al 2009 dogan et al 2011 garg et al 2013 however high pcp concentration inhibited its growth trevors et al 1982 pcp bio dechlorination by pseudomonas had also been reported with the release of phenol and cl leung et al 1997 cassidy et al 1997 garg et al 2013 meanwhile two enriched genera azospira and longilinea were found from stages 1 to 2 and from stages 3 to 5 respectively these had not been detected in the inoculum and were capable of anaerobic mineralization of pcp bio dechlorination products tabassum et al 2015 li et al 2016 long et al 2018 wu et al 2021 thus this tight synergistic relationship between these microbes resulted in the degradation and mineralization of pcp 3 4 examination of metabolic pathway functional genes specific to cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation were detected in each stage of the column fig 4 a the chra and yief genes were related to encoding cr vi efflux transporter protein mitigating intracellular toxicity and cr vi reductase of class i facilitating cr vi bio reduction respectively he et al 2011 chai et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the total abundance of chra and yief were sharply decreased when cr vi concentration increased from 10 mg l in stage 1 to 50 mg l in stage 2 and gradually increased when cr vi concentration was constant at 10 mg l in all subsequent stages these results suggested that they might be inhibited by high cr vi concentration and gradually recovered under relatively lower cr vi concentration meanwhile the pcea gene encoded for dehalogenase and was involved in the bio dechlorination of chlorinated organics hauke et al 2004 fricker et al 2014 it was gradually enriched from stages 2 to 5 without harboring in stage 1 this could have contributed to the pcp bio dechlorination in our biosystem cytochrome c and nadh as catalytic compounds involved in electron transfer for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation and were also examined here both cytochrome c and nadh contents remained relatively stable across all stages and were averaged at approximately 5 73 and 0 49 mg g vss respectively fig 4b these were nearly equivalent to those previously reported in simultaneously treating v v and phenanthrene as well as v v and pentachlorophenol zhang et al 2019 shi et al 2020a cytochrome c is bound to the membrane and functions as a type of electron transfer protein as such it could rapidly adjust the electron flow for heavy metal bio reduction across the cell membrane he et al 2021 meanwhile nadh used for intracellular cr vi detoxification actively took part in the cyclic reduction oxidation reaction of nadh nad pair for electron transfer while obtaining adenosine triphosphate from the tricarboxylic acid cycle wang et al 2017 shi et al 2020b in addition pcp bio degradation coupled to nadh bio oxidation had also been previously reported li et al 2011 3 5 potential mechanisms and environmental implications the potential mechanisms of concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation in our anaerobic column were proposed fig 5 pseudomonas acinetobacter and spirochaeta as heterotrophic cr vi reducers could use ethanol as a carbon source and electron donor to reduce cr vi meanwhile pcp was bio dechlorinated by pseudomonas using ethanol as a co metabolic substrate with the release of cl bio dechlorinated products were further mineralized by azospira and longilinea the key genes chra and yief encoding cr vi reductase and pcea encoding pcp dehalogenase were significantly expressed and catalyzed their removals the electron transfer was likely facilitated by both cytochrome c and intracellular nadh delivering electrons for cr vi detoxification and pcp bio degradation eventually cr vi precipitated naturally in the main forms of cr oh 3 and cro oh while the bio dechlorinated products of pcp were further mineralized the steady long term removal performance was presented here for concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation and offered efficient bioremediation strategy i e bio stimulation actual groundwater sampled at an industrial site in southern china with cr vi concentration at 53 78 mg l was also supplied to the column the cr vi removal efficiency reached 67 71 through bio stimulation with cod concentration at 400 mg l and hrt at 1 day when 10 mg l pcp was supplemented cr vi and pcp removal efficiencies shifted to 36 36 and 79 72 respectively these results indicated that the proposed bio stimulation was practically efficient for remediation of aquifer that had been co contaminated with cr vi and pcp the relatively lower removal efficiencies might had been due to the complexity of the compositions for actual groundwater reductive bio dichlorination of pcp would compete electrons with cr vi reduction resulting in a decrease in cr vi removal efficiency with supplemented pcp however further subsequent investigations are still necessary for this proposed bio stimulation although the groundwater temperature at contaminated sites may be close to room temperature song et al 2021 the ambient temperature of most aquifers is relatively low bortone et al 2020 given this the behavior of the proposed bioprocess will require further evaluation under lower temperatures this is particularly important as microbially catalyzed processes are temperature sensitive the external addition of an organic sustrate dose must be carefully controlled to prevent secondary pollution regarding the development and application of the proposed remediation strategy soluble cr vi released from cr iii reoxidation under redox fluctuation should be carefully considered and prevented xu et al 2021 intermediates from pcp bio degradation will require further mineralization other co occurring contaminants e g nitrate should also be taken into account liu et al 2021 moreover a carefully designed injection scheme with reasonable distribution of injection wells and proper injection pressure is essential to realize the even distribution of bioactive substrates luna et al 2015 recently innovative approaches have used slow release organic carbon source materials e g woodchip and straw for v v detoxification li et al 2020 these may be promising alternatives for organic co metabolic substrate which would decrease the cost of using ethanol as proposed here furthermore the produced cr iii precipitates that had attached onto these materials allows for their potential reuse to compensate bioremediation costs in summary the results obtained from this study provide unequivocal evidence for the close links among biogeochemical cycling of chromium and biorefractory organics in aquifers 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated steady concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation using ethanol as a co metabolic substrate over a 365 day experiment using a biological column the major conclusions were as follows complete cr vi reduction and removal efficiency of 92 8 4 2 for pcp occurred with both an initial concentration of 10 mg l and hydraulic retention time of 2 days the major bio reduction products of cr vi were insoluble cr oh 3 and cro oh pcp was efficiently bio degraded with nontoxic cl production acinetobacter and spirochaeta played important roles in cr vi bio reduction pseudomonas likely not only participated in cr vi bio reduction but also joined in the bio dechlorination of pcp the bio dechlorinated products were further mineralized by azospira and longilinea genes responsible for cr vi bio reduction chra and yief and pcp bio degradation pcea were upregulated cr vi reduction and pcp degradation were also accelerated through electron transfer with cytochrome c and nadh further investigation will be needed regarding the influence of environmental factors the optimization of co metabolic substrate dose and the further mineralization of intermediates from pcp

microbial communities mediate the long term stability of this process therefore we proposed here a promising bioremediation strategy for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation in parallel this was achieved using bio stimulation which is a simple efficient and environmental friendly remediation method this approach features in situ addition of a bioavailable substrate to modify the medium s physicochemical conditions this results in an enhanced ability of the microbial community to remove the desired contaminants álvarez et al 2015 continuous operation of a biological column for 365 days was conducted which allowed us to investigate the feasibility and stability of this process at varied hydraulic and biogeochemical conditions this was followed by a characterization of the reaction products identification of microbial community composition quantification of key related genes and assessment of electron transfer compounds collectively these findings highlighted the concurrent biogeochemical processes of both cr vi and pcp and the development of a potential bioremediation strategy for their co contaminated aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experimental column was a plexiglass column with a height of 250 mm and an inner diameter of 50 mm the column was made of plexiglass and equipped with three sampling ports distributed evenly along the length of the column fig s1 the initial inoculum was aquifer sediment collected from a tailing reservoir of a metal mine in the panzhihua region of sichuan province china 26 05 27 21 n 101 08 102 15 e at an elevation of 1 200 m above sea level chromium contamination was found in the aquifer at this site briefly 50 ml of the initial inoculum was evenly mixed with quartz and then added into column to regulate porosity the effective volume was 300 ml the column was then covered with aluminum foil to omit light synthetic groundwater in the inlet bottle was degassed with n2 for 30 min then injected into the column through upstream flow using a peristaltic pump bt100 1l shanghai china the column as well as inlet and outlet bottles were sealed and connected by pipes to prevent oxygen diffusion the synthetic groundwater contained 0 8082 g l nahco3 and 0 0299 g l kh2po4 with ethanol 99 v v as the co metabolic substrate cr vi was supplied in the form of k2cr2o7 all chemicals used in this study were analytical grade reagents a series of batch experiments were also conducted in 250 ml plexiglass bottles sealed by air tight rubber stoppers to verify the involved bioprocesses for cr vi and pcp removal briefly 10 ml anaerobic consortium from the column experiment was added as inoculum then 200 ml of synthetic groundwater with the same components as stage 1 of the column experiment was also supplemented all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 c 2 2 long term experimental procedure detailed operating conditions for the long term experiment were shown in table 1 briefly the entire 365 days of the experiment was divided into five stages these stages were determined according to different hydraulic retention time hrt chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and pollutant loading the hrt ranged from 2 to 0 25 days corresponding to a flow rate of 0 104 ml min to 0 833 ml min respectively the equivalent cod concentration contributed by ethanol was in the range of 200 400 mg l which was considering the inadequate organic carbon in the aquifer sediments the effluent from the column was collected daily to determine groundwater quality indices including cr vi pcp cod ph orp and conductivity han and liu 2004 bio degradation products of pcp microbial community characteristics harbored functional genes and electron transfer compounds were monitored at the end of each stage the solid products of the bio reduction related to cr vi were characterized at the end of the experiment 2 3 analytical methods all liquid samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm filter prior to analysis the concentration of cr vi was measured using an uv visible spectrophotometer uv2300 shanghai china at a wavelength at 540 nm zhang et al 2012 pcp concentration was detected using high performance liquid chromatography lc 10a shimadzu japan the bio degradation products of pcp were identified using gas chromatograph mass spectrometry trace gc dsq thermo fisher usa following standard procedures that had been previously published chen et al 2012 xue et al 2017 ion chromatography ics 5000 thermo fisher usa was used to quantify the produced chloride ion cl ethanol and carbon dioxide co2 were analyzed using gas chromatography agilent gc7890 usa with both flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the solution ph orp and conductivity were

produced precipitates was examined using x ray diffraction xrd rigaku d max pc 2500 rigaku japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra kratos uk was used to study the chromium valences in the precipitates 2 4 microbial analysis the inoculum and microbial samples in each stage were collected and pretreated as previously reported liu et al 2016 microbial dna was extracted using the soil rapid dna spin kit according to the manufacturer s instructions arup california usa the extracted dna was amplified using polymerase chain reaction pcr with primers of 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat yin et al 2022 subsequent high throughput sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform using majorbio technology shanghai china raw sequence data were submitted to the ncbi database with accession number of prjna756235 according to the silva ssu115 16s rrna database the classifier was used to analyze the classification with a confidence threshold of 70 fei et al 2022 real time quantitative pcr detection system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa was used to perform quantitative pcr qpcr for functional genes including chra and yief for cr vi bio reduction and pcea for reductive bio dichlorination of pcp specific primers were shown in table s1 he et al 2011 ashwana et al 2014 the released electrons could be transferred to cr vi and pcp through microbial cell surfaces by cytochrome c and within cell by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh therefore cytochrome c and nadh were extracted and determined as previously described zhao et al 2017 kang et al 2018 li et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term cr vi and pcp removal over the 365 days of the experiment the dynamics of individual cr vi and pcp concentrations along with their removal efficiencies and capacities were measured and shown in figure 1 in stage 1 0 149 d 99 9 0 07 and 57 9 32 3 of cr vi and pcp were removed with an initial concentration of 10 mg l for both cr vi and pcp removal capacities were 4 99 0 03 g m3 d and 2 89 1 62 g m3 d for cr vi and pcp respectively it was noteworthy that the pcp removal efficiency significantly fluctuated owing to its high toxicity in the later period of stage 1 pcp reached a relatively steady and high removal efficiency of approximately 94 indicating pcp decomposers were progressively enriched for subsequent pcp removal in stage 2 150 219 d when the influent cr vi concentration had increased to 50 mg l the removal efficiencies of cr vi and pcp were 99 9 0 06 and 100 respectively their corresponding removal capacities were 24 90 0 01 g m3 d and 5 g m3 d respectively suggesting that cr vi reducers had successfully adapted to the increased toxicity in stage 3 220 259 d when the influent pcp concentration had increased to 50 mg l complete cr vi removal was realized with a removal capacity of 5 g m3 although the pcp concentration had significantly increased by five fold the biological column still yielded a high pcp removal efficiency of 97 4 1 8 along with a removal capacity of 24 36 0 47 g m3 d these results indicated that the pcp decomposers were gradually tolerant to increased toxicity in stages 2 and 3 moscoso et al 2012 when the cod concentration decreased to 200 mg l in stage 4 both the cr vi and pcp removal performances were well maintained with removal efficiencies and capacities of 100 and 5 g m3 d for cr vi and 92 8 4 2 and 4 64 0 21 g m3 d for pcp these results indicated that a lower bioavailable substrate was sufficient for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation this highlighted its practical applicability owing to the reduced organic matter found in groundwater meanwhile bioavailable substrate played an important role in co metabolic pcp bio degradation shi et al 2015 which ultimately accelerated the bio degradation process the bioavailable substrate doses in our study were relatively lower than those shown in existing bio stimulation studies and or applications for instance ethanol was injected into the cr vi contaminated aquifer at an abandoned industrial site for remediation purposes and reached the cod concentration in groundwater at approximately 1900 mg l song et al 2021 relatedly 900 mg l cod in the form of lactate was supplemented for pcp bio degradation in paddy soils of southern china chen et al 2012 in stage 5 311 365 d and along with the decreased hrt from days 1 to 0 25 in the three substages complete cr vi removal was still maintained maximum removal capacity of 40 g m3 d was achieved in contrast pcp decreased considerably to 57 7 12 6 with corresponding removal capacities of 23 10 5 10 g m3 d this finding showed that cr vi removal was able to resist hrt fluctuations in the tested biosystem comparatively the sharp decrease of pcp removal when hrt was shortened suggested that co metabolic pcp bio degradation was more easily suppressed than cr vi bio reduction 3 2 identification of reaction products and bioprocesses the total cr concentration in the column s effluent was nearly equal to the effluent cr vi concentration fig s2 this result suggested that the products from cr vi reduction had almost precipitated to further explore the potential reaction products during cr vi bio reduction microbial morphology on the quartz collected from the column was analyzed after the 365 day experiment had ended based on the representative sem image fig 2 a a large number of precipitates had deposited on the cell surface and a high cr signal in the eds spectra was noted fig 2b the tight attachment of these precipitates to the cells ensured that they were not easily washed away but remained in place it had been previously shown that biosystems had good immobilization for cr vi reduction products thereby preventing their secondary release lai et al 2016 xrd spectra further revealed that the structure of these precipitates was related to both cr oh 3 and cro oh fig 2c especially with a high signal for cr oh 3 xps results clearly showed two obvious peaks namely cr 2p1 2 and cr 2p3 2 at 586 3 ev and 576 6 ev respectively fig 2d this suggested cr iii in the precipitates wang et al 2018b in our batch experiments and when compared with the biotic group hardly any cr vi was removed either with sterilization or in the abiotic group fig s3a this suggested adsorption and chemical reduction had a negligible contribution to cr vi removal cr vi was rarely absorbed by microbes lai et al 2016 these results provided strong evidence that cr vi was removed primarily through bio reduction cl was detected in the effluent at each stage and its concentration roughly equaled to the one that the removed pcp contained except for stage 3 which had the highest influent pcp concentration fig s4 these findings implied the efficient dechlorination of pcp tong et al 2015 mikkonen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 clear pcp removal was also observed in the biotic group of the batch experiments fig s3b while pcp removal under conditions of either sterilization or in the abiotic group was insignificant these findings implied adsorption and chemical dechlorination had a negligible contribution to pcp removal little pcp could be absorbed by microbes owing to its biorefractory characteristics li et al 2013 these results collectively illustrated that pcp was bio degraded through bio dechlorination in our proposed biosystem possible bio dechlorinated products were further examined in stage 5a only 2 90 0 17 mg l phenol was detected without the appearance of other chlorophenol compounds furthermore the detected phenol concentration was lower than the theoretical one from pcp degradation while the measured co2 yield was slightly higher than that from ethanol oxidation this confirmed that mineralization occurred during pcp removal the cod concentrations declined rapidly across each stage with an average utilization percentage at 93 50 47 65 fig s5 decrease in the concentration of ethanol was also accordingly observed these results indicated the consumption of ethanol as an electron donor for cr vi bio reduction and co metabolic substrate for pcp bio degradation under anaerobic conditions sulfate and nitrate have been convincingly reported to inhibit pcp bio dechlorination owing to electron competition xu et al 2018 meanwhile the redox potential of cr vi was higher than that of sulfate eө 172 mv and nitrate eө 934 mv thus it could be inferred that pcp bio degradation might be impacted by cr vi bio reduction however this hypothesis would require additional research to confirm 3 3 microbial community evolution and functional gene examination microbial richness and diversity in the inoculum were higher than those in each stage table s2 and fig s6 indicating that the high toxicity of co existing cr vi and pcp significantly reshaped microbial communities the pca findings showed that microbial samples from all stages of the column were clearly distinct from the inoculum fig 3 a suggesting that microorganisms capable of cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation gradually adapted to changing operational conditions hao et al 2018 in fig 3b 176 350 347 163 and 254 independent otus from stage 1 to stage 5 were displayed in the venn diagram 471 shared otus across all stages had adapted to experimental column with cr vi pcp and co metabolic substrate during the long term operation of the column the microbial community at the class level was significantly changed fig 3c more specifically anaerolineae gammaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidia predominated across all stages anaerolineae had the highest relative abundance in stage 3 with the highest pcp concentration this indicated that anaerolineae had a higher pcp tolerance the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria was higher in stages 1 and 2 and gradually reduced from stages 3 to 5 this implied that it might be effective at cr vi bio reduction and that the highest pcp concentration in stage 3 caused irreversible damage to the enriched gammaproteobacteria in addition past work had shown that predominant deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidia had also grown and accumulated in either vanadium or chromium oxide solutions guan et al 2019 kosek et al 2019 zakharyuk et al 2019 potential bacteria for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation were identified at the genus level the accumulated heterotrophic cr vi reducers e g acinetobacter and spirochaeta contributed to cr vi bio reduction arias et al 2003 jin et al 2017 an et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and were concentratedly distributed within the first three stages pseudomonas was rarely detected in the inoculum but was significantly enriched from stages 1 to 2 with corresponding relative abundances from 20 64 to 22 84 however this value greatly decreased to 9 44 2 69 and 1 65 from stage 3 to 5 the ability of pseudomonas to bio reduce cr vi to cr iii and bio biodegrade pcp for mineralization had been previously confirmed by several lines of past research kao et al 2005 song et al 2009 dogan et al 2011 garg et al 2013 however high pcp concentration inhibited its growth trevors et al 1982 pcp bio dechlorination by pseudomonas had also been reported with the release of phenol and cl leung et al 1997 cassidy et al 1997 garg et al 2013 meanwhile two enriched genera azospira and longilinea were found from stages 1 to 2 and from stages 3 to 5 respectively these had not been detected in the inoculum and were capable of anaerobic mineralization of pcp bio dechlorination products tabassum et al 2015 li et al 2016 long et al 2018 wu et al 2021 thus this tight synergistic relationship between these microbes resulted in the degradation and mineralization of pcp 3 4 examination of metabolic pathway functional genes specific to cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation were detected in each stage of the column fig 4 a the chra and yief genes were related to encoding cr vi efflux transporter protein mitigating intracellular toxicity and cr vi reductase of class i facilitating cr vi bio reduction respectively he et al 2011 chai et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the total abundance of chra and yief were sharply decreased when cr vi concentration increased from 10 mg l in stage 1 to 50 mg l in stage 2 and gradually increased when cr vi concentration was constant at 10 mg l in all subsequent stages these results suggested that they might be inhibited by high cr vi concentration and gradually recovered under relatively lower cr vi concentration meanwhile the pcea gene encoded for dehalogenase and was involved in the bio dechlorination of chlorinated organics hauke et al 2004 fricker et al 2014 it was gradually enriched from stages 2 to 5 without harboring in stage 1 this could have contributed to the pcp bio dechlorination in our biosystem cytochrome c and nadh as catalytic compounds involved in electron transfer for cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation and were also examined here both cytochrome c and nadh contents remained relatively stable across all stages and were averaged at approximately 5 73 and 0 49 mg g vss respectively fig 4b these were nearly equivalent to those previously reported in simultaneously treating v v and phenanthrene as well as v v and pentachlorophenol zhang et al 2019 shi et al 2020a cytochrome c is bound to the membrane and functions as a type of electron transfer protein as such it could rapidly adjust the electron flow for heavy metal bio reduction across the cell membrane he et al 2021 meanwhile nadh used for intracellular cr vi detoxification actively took part in the cyclic reduction oxidation reaction of nadh nad pair for electron transfer while obtaining adenosine triphosphate from the tricarboxylic acid cycle wang et al 2017 shi et al 2020b in addition pcp bio degradation coupled to nadh bio oxidation had also been previously reported li et al 2011 3 5 potential mechanisms and environmental implications the potential mechanisms of concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation in our anaerobic column were proposed fig 5 pseudomonas acinetobacter and spirochaeta as heterotrophic cr vi reducers could use ethanol as a carbon source and electron donor to reduce cr vi meanwhile pcp was bio dechlorinated by pseudomonas using ethanol as a co metabolic substrate with the release of cl bio dechlorinated products were further mineralized by azospira and longilinea the key genes chra and yief encoding cr vi reductase and pcea encoding pcp dehalogenase were significantly expressed and catalyzed their removals the electron transfer was likely facilitated by both cytochrome c and intracellular nadh delivering electrons for cr vi detoxification and pcp bio degradation eventually cr vi precipitated naturally in the main forms of cr oh 3 and cro oh while the bio dechlorinated products of pcp were further mineralized the steady long term removal performance was presented here for concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation and offered efficient bioremediation strategy i e bio stimulation actual groundwater sampled at an industrial site in southern china with cr vi concentration at 53 78 mg l was also supplied to the column the cr vi removal efficiency reached 67 71 through bio stimulation with cod concentration at 400 mg l and hrt at 1 day when 10 mg l pcp was supplemented cr vi and pcp removal efficiencies shifted to 36 36 and 79 72 respectively these results indicated that the proposed bio stimulation was practically efficient for remediation of aquifer that had been co contaminated with cr vi and pcp the relatively lower removal efficiencies might had been due to the complexity of the compositions for actual groundwater reductive bio dichlorination of pcp would compete electrons with cr vi reduction resulting in a decrease in cr vi removal efficiency with supplemented pcp however further subsequent investigations are still necessary for this proposed bio stimulation although the groundwater temperature at contaminated sites may be close to room temperature song et al 2021 the ambient temperature of most aquifers is relatively low bortone et al 2020 given this the behavior of the proposed bioprocess will require further evaluation under lower temperatures this is particularly important as microbially catalyzed processes are temperature sensitive the external addition of an organic sustrate dose must be carefully controlled to prevent secondary pollution regarding the development and application of the proposed remediation strategy soluble cr vi released from cr iii reoxidation under redox fluctuation should be carefully considered and prevented xu et al 2021 intermediates from pcp bio degradation will require further mineralization other co occurring contaminants e g nitrate should also be taken into account liu et al 2021 moreover a carefully designed injection scheme with reasonable distribution of injection wells and proper injection pressure is essential to realize the even distribution of bioactive substrates luna et al 2015 recently innovative approaches have used slow release organic carbon source materials e g woodchip and straw for v v detoxification li et al 2020 these may be promising alternatives for organic co metabolic substrate which would decrease the cost of using ethanol as proposed here furthermore the produced cr iii precipitates that had attached onto these materials allows for their potential reuse to compensate bioremediation costs in summary the results obtained from this study provide unequivocal evidence for the close links among biogeochemical cycling of chromium and biorefractory organics in aquifers 4 conclusion in this study we demonstrated steady concurrent cr vi bio reduction and pcp bio degradation using ethanol as a co metabolic substrate over a 365 day experiment using a biological column the major conclusions were as follows complete cr vi reduction and removal efficiency of 92 8 4 2 for pcp occurred with both an initial concentration of 10 mg l and hydraulic retention time of 2 days the major bio reduction products of cr vi were insoluble cr oh 3 and cro oh pcp was efficiently bio degraded with nontoxic cl production acinetobacter and spirochaeta played important roles in cr vi bio reduction pseudomonas likely not only participated in cr vi bio reduction but also joined in the bio dechlorination of pcp the bio dechlorinated products were further mineralized by azospira and longilinea genes responsible for cr vi bio reduction chra and yief and pcp bio degradation pcea were upregulated cr vi reduction and pcp degradation were also accelerated through electron transfer with cytochrome c and nadh further investigation will be needed regarding the influence of environmental factors the optimization of co metabolic substrate dose and the further mineralization of intermediates from pcp

16121,legionella pneumophila is a natural inhabitant of water systems from there it can be transmitted to humans by aerosolization resulting in severe pneumonia most large outbreaks are caused by cooling towers colonized with l pneumophila the resident microbiota of the cooling tower is a key determinant for the colonization and growth of l pneumophila in our preceding study the genus pseudomonas correlated negatively with the presence of l pneumophila in cooling towers but it was not clear which species was responsible therefore we identified the pseudomonas species inhabiting 14 cooling towers using a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing strategy we found that cooling towers that are free of l pneumophila contained a high relative abundance of members from the pseudomonas alcaliphila oleovorans phylogenetic cluster p alcaliphila jcm 10630 inhibited the growth of l pneumophila on agar plates analysis of the p alcaliphila genome revealed the presence of a gene cluster predicted to produce toxoflavin l pneumophila growth was inhibited by pure toxoflavin and by extracts from p alcaliphila culture found to contain toxoflavin by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in addition toxoflavin inhibits the growth of vermameoba vermiformis a host cell of l pneumophila our study indicates that p alcaliphila may be important to restrict growth of l pneumophila in water systems through the production of toxoflavin a sufficiently high concentration of toxoflavin is likely not achieved in the bulk water but might have a local inhibitory effect such as near or in biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cooling towers water microbiota biofilm antimicrobials 1 introduction legionellosis is a human respiratory disease caused by the bacterium legionella cunha et al 2016 legionella pneumophila causes 90 of the cases and the remaining 10 mostly involve l micdadei l bozemanii and l longbeachae cunha et al 2016 legionellosis includes legionnaires disease ld a systemic infection involving severe pneumonia and pontiac fever a mild flu like disease cunha et al 2016 there is a clear upward trend in the prevalence of legionnaires disease worldwide cunha et al 2016 making ld the fifth most burdensome disease in people older than 15 years old after aids tuberculosis influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease in europe in 2018 cassini et al 2018 legionella is transmitted to humans by the inhalation of aerosols containing the bacteria that are generated by engineered water systems ews meyer 1983 several types of ews can shed l pneumophila including water distribution systems showers and faucets spas fountains and cooling towers heijnsbergen et al 2015 however most of the large outbreaks of ld are caused by cooling towers garrison et al 2016 deficiencies in management and operation of water systems is the main cause of outbreak of ld garrison et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2010 cooling towers contain a complex microbial ecosystem constituted by a diverse community of planktonic and biofilm associated bacteria protozoa and algae gregorio et al 2017 hauer et al 2016 llewellyn et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 paranjape et al 2020b 2020a pereira et al 2017 pinel et al 2021 tsao et al 2019 the microbial community in cooling towers is mostly found in surface attached and floating biofilms which seeds the bulk water with planktonic microorganisms di pippo et al 2018 gregorio et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the bacterial and protozoan community identified by different studies varies greatly but include typical biofilm forming aquatic bacteria sphingomonadaceae caulobacteraceae and hyphomicrobiaceae gregorio et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 wang et al 2013 protozoans such as amoeba and ciliates prey on some of these microorganisms and digest them via their endocytic pathway legionella species have evolved to hijack this pathway in a variety of these phagocytic protozoans to facilitate their own growth boamah et al 2017 fields et al 1984 paranjape et al 2020a rowbotham 1980 in fact most if not all of the multiplication of legionella spp in water systems occurs inside these host cells boamah et al 2017 protozoan hosts also shield legionella from deleterious conditions boamah et al 2017 therefore legionella s presence in ews is strongly associated with the presence of host cells boamah et al 2017 in multi species biofilms l pneumophila is associated with amoebas and other phagocytic protozoans and in dense microcolonies taylor et al 2013 the composition of the microbial community in cooling towers is influenced by different factors including local temperature and the disinfection regime llewellyn et al 2017 paranjape et al 2020b pereira et al 2017 our previous study found that continuous chlorine application reduced microbial diversity decreasing the abundance of l pneumophila while increasing the abundance of pseudomonas paranjape et al 2020b this meant that there was a strong inverse relationship between l pneumophila and pseudomonas in cooling towers a correlation which has also been observed in a large study of 196 cooling towers in the united states of america llewellyn et al 2017 there was also a positive correlation between chlorine and pseudomonas which has similarly been reported in drinking water systems bertelli et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2012 holinger et al 2014 however this negative interaction is not consistent across all types of water systems for instance pseudomonas is positively correlated with legionella in a municipal drinking water distribution system zhang et al 2021 similarly legionella coexists with pseudomonas in wastewater aeration ponds fykse et al 2013 pseudomonas is a large genus and several species of pseudomonas can inhabit a single system pereira et al 2018 some strains like pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 17569 promote the presence of legionella in dynamic biofilms while others like pseudomonas aeruginosa do not stewart et al 2012 therefore the inconsistent relationship between legionella and pseudomonas observed in past studies is likely mediated by the specific strain s involved which cannot be determined using standard 16s rrna amplicon sequencing which specific pseudomonas species correlates negatively with l pneumophila in real cooling towers remains essentially unknown one can hypothesize that some strains of pseudomonas produce compounds inhibiting growth of l pneumophila in cooling towers several bacteria can inhibit the growth of l pneumophila on solid medium including species of aeromonas bacillus flavobacterium pseudomonas acinetobacter kluyvera rahnella burkholderia staphylococcus stenotrophomonas or sphingobacterium corre et al 2021 2019 guerrieri et al 2008 loiseau et al 2015 temmerman et al 2007 verdon et al 2008 for a fraction of these species the active substances responsible for the inhibition were identified staphylococcus warneri produces an antimicrobial peptide named warnericin verdon et al 2008 in the case of bacillus secreted proteases and surfactin were identified to have an anti legionella effect loiseau et al 2015 pseudomonas fluorescens strain mfe01 produces the volatile compound 1 undecene that inhibits the growth of l pneumophila in a separate but nearby dish a phenomenon that was called aerial killing corre et al 2021 2019 these studies indicate that the cooling tower microbiota likely produces a wide range of biomolecules including proteins antimicrobial peptides and surfactants that can have deleterious effects on l pneumophila in water systems berjeaud et al 2016 therefore we hypothesized that there is a species of pseudomonas associated with the absence of l pneumophila in cooling towers and that this inhibition would be linked to the production of an inhibitory molecule to this end we used a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing strategy to resolve the pseudomonas species within the cooling towers sampled in our previous study paranjape et al 2020b p alcaliphila oleovorans was found to dominate cooling towers free of l pneumophila the genome of p alcaliphila was analyzed for biosynthetic gene clusters and the production of corresponding biomolecules inhibiting l pneumophila growth was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and cultures l pneumophila strains philadelphia 1 atcc 33152 and lp120292 which was involved in the ld outbreak in quebec city in 2012 lévesque et al 2014 and is hereafter referred to as the quebec strain were used as test strains strains stored at 80 c in 10 glycerol were cultured aerobically at 37 c for 3 days on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar supplemented with 0 25 mg ml l cysteine and 0 4 mg

rrna amplicon sequencing strategy previously published by pereira et al 2018 was used to identify the species of pseudomonas present in cooling towers sampled in a previous study paranjape et al 2020b their microbiome was previously determined using 16s and 18s rrna amplicon sequencing paranjape et al 2020b 2020a out of 18 cooling towers originally sampled 14 were included in the present study the other 4 were not included as they harbored extremely low abundance of pseudomonas paranjape et al 2020b details on the methodology used and the cooling towers characteristics can be found in our previous study paranjape et al 2020b briefly water was collected in sterile bottles and 0 01 thiosulfate was added prior to dna extraction with powerwater kit from qiagen l pneumophila was detected by qpcr from these extracts paranjape et al 2020b other water samples were also collected to determine heterotrophic plate counts and analyze physio chemical parameters to determine the pseudomonas species present in these cooling towers a two step pcr strategy was used to amplify the v3 v4 region of pseudomonas 16s rrna and add indices using paq5000 polymerase the dna was first amplified with

nextera xt index kit according to the manufacturer s instruction the amplicons were purified as above and quantified using quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen the amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq using the v2 250 bp paired end reagent kit the data are available from the sequence read archive under the bioproject accession number prjna787128 the resulting sequences were processed using dada2 callahan et al 2016 implemented in qiime 2 version 2018 8 bolyen et al 2019 the sequences were trimmed by 21 nt and truncated to 200 nt the dataset was rarefied to 50 000 sequences per samples the taxonomic assignment to the genus level of the resulting amplicon sequence variants asv was assigned using a classifier trained on the silva ssu database 132 quast et al 2013 according to qiime 2 instructions species level taxonomic assignment of the asvs was performed using blast against the curated 16s rrna sequences of pseudomonas as previously described pereira et al 2018 this dataset was then further analyzed using microbiomeanalyst chong et al 2020 to calculate shannon diversity and perform linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 2 3 legionella pneumophila inhibition assay an anti legionella assay was performed using a soft agar overlay technique briefly a suspension of l pneumophila strains quebec and philadelphia 1 and p alcaliphila were prepared in aye broth and adjusted to an od600nm of 0 2 then 200 µl of legionella suspension were added to 5 ml of autoclaved soft agar 0 5 of agar in ddh2o and gently poured on the surface of solidified cye agar plate the plates were left to solidify in a biological safety cabinet for 15 min then a 10 µl drop of p alcaliphila suspension was inoculated in the middle of the plate plates were incubated at 25 c 30 c and 37 c for 3 days and the diameter of the p alcaliphila colony and the zone of inhibition were measured 2 4 organic extraction of toxoflavin from p alcaliphila supernatant chloroform extraction was performed as previously described chen et al 2012 with slight modifications p alcaliphila was grown on a cye plate for 4 days at 30 c the bacterial cells were removed from the surface of the agar using a cell scraper and the agar was cut in smaller pieces using a sterile razorblade the chopped agar was then mixed with chloroform in 1 1 w v ratio in 50 ml falcon tube for extraction of toxoflavin the chloroform fraction 25 ml was filtered through filtropur s 0 2 µm filter sarstedt and left to fully evaporate in a fume hood the extract was then dissolved in 200 µl methanol the agar from a sterile cye plate was processed the same way to serve as a negative control extracts were tested with the disk diffusion assay described below 2 5 disk diffusion assay the susceptibility of the test strains to commercial toxoflavin sigma aldrich and p alcaliphila extracts was assessed by adapting the soft overlay agar technique previously described instead of adding the p alcaliphila suspension to the center a sterile paper disk was placed and 10 ul of extract or a range of commercial toxoflavin concentrations 0 ng μl 50 ng μl 100 ng μl 250 ng μl and 1000 ng μl was added to the disk plates were incubated at 30 c for 3 days and the zone of inhibition was measured 2 6 lc esi ms analysis of toxoflavin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis was performed by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2795 mississauga on canada equipped with a 100 4 6 mm i d kinetex c8 phenomenex reversed phase column particle size 2 6 μm using a mecn h2o gradient containing 1 acetic acid at a flow rate of 400 µl min the detector was a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer quattro premier xe waters equipped with a z spray interface using electrospray ionization in positive mode analyzes were carried out in both ms full scan and ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm scan modes with a mass to charge ratio m z window ranging from 130 to 930 the capillary voltage was set at 3 5 kv and the cone voltage at 30 v the source temperature was kept at 120 c and the desolvating gas at 200 c nitrogen was used as the cone and desolvation gas and argon was used as collision gas at collision energies up to 30 ev 2 7 biofilm and pellicle assay the biofilm formation ability of p alcaliphila was investigated by inoculating media with bacteria briefly 1 ml of trypticase soy broth king s b or r2a broth was added to the center four wells of a 24 well plate surrounding wells were filled with sterile water to prevent desiccation then 20 µl of p alcaliphila in fraquil od600nm 0 1 was added to each well and incubated at room temperature the optimal temperature for l pneumophila inhibition observed in inhibition assays and possible in towers with or without shaking at 150 rpm to simulate the different mixing conditions possible in cooling towers after a week images of the wells were taken when incubated without shaking plates were shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h to determine if pellicles could form 2 8 vermamoeba vermiformis inhibition assay the sensitivity of l pneumophila host vermamoeba vermiformis to toxoflavin was determined by monitoring its growth in the presence of toxoflavin v vermiformis were grown at room temperature in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks sarstedt in modified pynfh medium atcc medium 1034 and passaged when confluence was reached the amoebas were passaged 3 days prior to exposure by adding 5 ml of culture to 20 ml of fresh modified pynfh cell concentration was measured with a guava easycyte flow cytometer to prepare samples for flow cytometry 400 µl of culture was centrifuged at 5000 g for 2 min the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in 400 µl of phosphate buffered saline pbs the stock culture was diluted to 5 104 cells ml in fresh modified pynfh and 900 µl was added to the wells of a 24 well plate then 100 µl of different toxoflavin solutions were added to wells to give final toxoflavin concentrations of 0 10 25 50 or 100 µg ml the plate was incubated at room temperature without shaking after 2 and 4 days 400 µl samples were taken from each well to measure cell concentration each condition was performed in triplicate results were analyzed using two way anova with time and toxoflavin concentration as factors and tukey s test correction for mutltiple comparison was used to assess significance between conditions 3 results 3 1 profiling of pseudomonas species in cooling towers pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was performed on triplicate samples from 14 cooling towers the microbiota of these cooling towers was previosuly studied using 16s and 18s rrna sequencing paranjape et al 2020b 2020a for pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing a total of 4 680 703 reads were obtained and processed with qiime using the dada2 pipeline bolyen et al 2019 callahan et al 2016 as can be seen in supplementary fig 1 the 2 control samples contained very few sequences passing quality control indicating that the amplicons from the cooling tower samples were not contaminated by spurious sequences the cooling tower samples contained a minimum of 51 089 sequences passing quality control the data set was rarefied to 50 000 sequences per cooling tower all sequences were assigned to pseudomonas showing the high specificity of the primers used as previously reported pereira et al 2018 considering all the cooling towers 34 pseudomonas species were found among which 14 can be described as major or abundant species and the other 20 as minor species collectively representing less than 5 of the population of note this method is unable to differentiate closely related species such as p alcaliphila and p oleovorans such species are therefore grouped in clusters the highest diversity of pseudomonas species was observed in cooling towers cdq1 and est1 containing 26 and 13 different species respectively followed by ct cn3 cn4 and mtl5 fig 1 a in our study the top three most abundant pseudomonas species were p alcaliphila oleovorans p monteilii and p alcaligenes the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster was observed in all cooling towers in various proportions but was the dominant pseudomonas species in several cooling towers including cn2 out1 out2 mont1 mtl1 mtl4 mtl7 and mtl8 fig 1a the opportunistic human pathogen p aeruginosa associated with a variety of disease in susceptible individuals gellatly and hancock 2013 was detected only in towers cdq1 and est2 at a low abundance of 0 01 next we calculated the abundance of each pseudomonas species as a fraction of relative bacterial abundance paranjape et al 2020b as can be seen in fig 1b p alcaliphila oleovorans is the most abundant pseudomonas species in cooling tower microbiomes dominated by pseudomonas including cooling towers out1 mont1 and mtl1 next we sought to identify factors influencing the diversity of pseudomonas within the cooling towers shannon diversity was calculated for each tower fig 2 a as expected cooling towers cdq1 and est1 had the highest shannon diversity while the cooling towers dominated by p alcaliphila had the lowest diversity in our previous study we determined that chlorine application schedule had a greater impact than chlorine concentration in shaping the bacterial communities paranjape et al 2020b similarly treatment schedule seems to affect pseudomonas diversity as tower treated by periodic applications showed significantly higher diversity p 0 03 than cooling towers treated continuously fig 2b concentration of total chlorine and residual chlorine did not seem to affect pseudomonas diversity the slopes of the shannon diversity against the concentration of total chlorine 0 599 0 502 and against the concentration of residual chlorine 0 107 0 073 were not significantly different than zero fig 2c d we next used linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse implemented in microbiomeanalyst chong et al 2020 to examine the differences in the abundance of pseudomonas species relative to the bacterial reads in cooling towers lefse is an algorithm that uses a mix of statistical testing linear discriminant analysis lda and effect size to identify taxa that are predictive of a particular condition segata et al 2011 the treatment schedule and the presence or absence of legionella spp and l pneumophila were considered as comparison factors paranjape et al 2020b p alcaliphila oleovorans was the only species enriched in cooling towers free of l pneumophila and free of legionella spp fig 3 a b in contrast p monteilii cluster was enriched in towers containing legionella spp or l pneumophila p alcaligenes was enriched in cooling towers containing l pneumophila and p soli was enriched in towers containing legionella spp fig 3a b by considering the treatment schedule p alcaliphila oleovorans and p anguiliseptica were associated with continuous treatment whereas p monteilii and p soli were associated with periodic treatment fig 3c 3 2 anti l pneumophila activity of p alcaliphila our results reavealed that a member of the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster seems to be the main inhibitor of l pneumophila colonization in the cooling towers we studied therefore we investigated if an isolate of that cluster p alcaliphila strain jcm 10630 can inhibit l pneumophila growth in vitro yumoto et al 2001 we carried out l pneumophila inihibition assay at three different temperatures 25 c 30 c and 37 c this range was chosen because the water of the cooling towers included in this study was typicallly between 20 and 25 c paranjape et al 2020b and because the optimal growth temperature of l pneumophila is 37 c after three days of incubation p alcaliphila inhibited the growth of l pneumophila at 25 c and 30 c but not at 37 c fig 4 a one way anova with a tukey correction for mutltiple comparison was used to assess significance between conditions the diameter of inhibition was significantly larger at 25 c than at 30 c for both strains p 0 001 the two strains showed similar inhibition zones at each temperature tested p 0 6 the size of the colony of p alcaliphila was significantly larger at 25 c than at 30 c p 0 001 the strain of l pneumophila seems to influence slighlty the growth of p alcaliphila at 25 c as the colony was slightly larger 14 3 mm when grown with the quebec strain than with the philadelphia 1 strain 13 mm p 0 02 there were no difference in colony size at 30 c 3 3 in silico analysis of p alcaliphila genome the p alcaliphila strain jcm 10 630 genome was retrieved from refseq gcf 900101755 1 and was analyzed to identify clues as to the cause of the inhibition of l pneumophila growth we first used antismash blin et al 2019 to identify putative biosynthetic gene clusters bcgs five clusters were found but none showed similarity higher than 50 with known clusters table 1 next we used the blast koala function of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes to assign kegg orthology annotation to the genes and predict metabolic pathways present in this genome kanehisa et al 2016 a cluster of genes homologous to toxoflavin synthesis cluster was detected toxoflavin is an important virulence factor of the plant pathogen burkholderia glumae suzuki et al 2004 and is also produced by pseudomonas protegens pf 5 philmus et al 2015 it is a broad spectrum inhibitor that is toxic to various plants park et al 2019 fungi li et al 2019 and gram positive and gram negative bacteria nagamatsu et al 1993 including mycobacterium smegmatis the p alcaliphila toxoflavin cluster is most homologous to the b glumae cluster and organized in a similar manner chen et al 2012 philmus et al 2015 suzuki et al 2004 the homology of p alcaliphila genes compared to b glumae varies between 36 and 69 identity table 2 overall our in silico analysis suggests that the inhibition of l pneumophila growth by p alcaliphila could be due to the production of toxoflavin another compound or a mixture of several molecules 3 4 toxoflavin inhibits growth of l pneumophila on cye plate the susceptibility of the two strains of l pneumophila to toxoflavin was tested using a dilution series of commercial toxoflavin sigma aldrich the results showed that the size of the inhibition zone proportionally increases with concentration of toxoflavin for both strains fig 5 the diameters of the inhibition zone were 10 mm 12 mm 20 mm and 30 mm when a total of 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 µg of toxoflavin was added respectively 3 5 toxoflavin is secreted by p alcaliphila on cye agar plate in order to confirm that p alcaliphila produces toxoflavin we performed chloroform extraction from cye plate inoculated with a pure culture of p alcaliphila controls included an extract from a sterile cye plate and the methanol carrier alone l pneumophila growth was inhibited by the extract from plates inoculated with p alcaliphila fig 6 c slightly more than sterile cye and methanol fig 6a b with zone of inhibitions of 12 10 and 10 mm respectively in order to confirm that toxoflavin was present the extracts were then subjected to lc esi ms pure toxoflavin solution produced a strong peak at m z 194 0 fig 6d the same strong peak appeared in p alcaliphila plate extracts fig 6f while being absent in the control fig 6e these results were then confirmed with lc esi ms ms in mrm mode supplementary fig s2 3 6 p alcaliphila produces floating biofilm mat many pseudomonas species can produce attached biofilms or floating biofilm mats mann and wozniak 2012 we investigated the ability of p alcaliphila jcm 10630 to form these structures at the optimal temperature for l pneumophila inhibition by toxoflavin that was also observed in cooling towers 25 c fig 5a and with and without shaking to simulate the different levels of disturbance within a cooling tower system e g stagnant water in dead ends and flowing water in pipes first we tested the production of attached biofilm in r2a king s b and in trypticase soy broth at room temperature under shaking after one week no attached biofilm was seen however a filamentous floating mass of cells could be seen in both r2a and trypticase soy broth fig 7 a we then tested the production of a pellicle by incubating p alcaliphila in the same three media but without shaking no pellicle was formed in any of these media fig 7b nevertheless we could see a mat at the bottom of the well in all cases shaking for 1 h dislodged the mat produced in trypticase soy broth and r2a resulting in a floating mat similar to what was seen after incubation with shaking fig 7a we therefore concluded that p alcaliphila may produces floating biofilm mats in cooling towers 3 7 toxoflavin is toxic for vermamoeba vermiformis since p alcaliphila was also negatively correlated with the presence of host cells in cooling towers paranjape et al 2020a we next hypothesized that toxoflavin might be toxic for amoebas typically found in water systems therefore we monitored the growth of v vermiformis when exposed to toxoflavin fig 8 ranging from a concentration at which there was a very small to a very large effect against l pneumophila fig 5 within four days cells unexposed to toxoflavin grew by 7 6 fold in contrast cells exposed to 10 µg ml and 25 µg ml grew much less by a factor of 3 7 and 3 3 respectively cells exposed to higher concentrations showed a sharp decrease in cell number at day 2 and then recovered slightly by day 4 reaching the number of cells present at the start of the experiment suggesting that toxoflavin toxicity diminished over time 4 discussion several previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between the presence of l pneumophila and pseudomonas in cooling towers llewellyn et al 2017 paranjape et al 2020b by using a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing approach pereira et al 2018 we identified that members of p alcaliphila oleovoran cluster are the main species associated with the exclusion of l pneumophila from cooling towers fortunately the opportunistic human pathogen p aeruginosa does not seem to thrive under these conditions as it was present only in very low abundance the dominance of p alcaliphila oleovorans is surprising as a previous study of a single cooling tower located in braunschweig germany found a high diversity of pseudomonas species even when p alcaliphila oleovorans was a member of the core community pereira et al 2018 differences in microbiology or physico chemical properties of source water or cooling tower management could explain the dominance of p alcaliphila oleovorans in our cooling tower samples compared to those in germany the diversity and abundance of pseudomonas may also be affected by seasons but this could not be investigated with our current data set importantly the presence of p alcaliphila oleovorans was strongly associated with continuous disinfectant application this strategy presumably creates conditions favorable for this group or specific members of this group nevertheless we cannot rule out that other factors also influence the community of pseudomonas in cooling towers our analysis also revealed that some species of pseudomonas may be beneficial for l pneumophila lefse analysis suggest that members of the p monteilii cluster and p alcaligenes are positively associated with l pneumophila fig 4a for example it has been reported that in an environment lacking critical nutrients for its growth l pneumophila can form microcolonies around certain aquatic bacteria including flavobacterium breve wadowsky and yee 1983 and p alcaligenes çotuk et al 2005 unfortunately the method used is not able to differentiate between members of the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster as the region targeted is identical in addition to p alcaliphila and p oleovorans this cluster also contains p chengduensis pereira et al 2018 these three species are associated with various water environments peix et al 2018 tao et al 2014 it is possible that the cooling towers studied here contain a diversity of species belonging to this cluster the water of the cooling towers included in this study was typically between 20 and 25 c and ph 8 paranjape et al 2020b this falls within the conditions that p alcaliphila jcm 10630 can thrive in having been isolated from sea water and shown to be alkali tolerant and psychrophilic growing best at temperature between 4 and 30 c yumoto et al 2001 in this study we found that p alcaliphila was able to inhibit l pneumophila growth at least in part through toxoflavin production in assays 1 µg of toxoflavin directly inhibited l pneumophila growth on plates and 25 µg ml inhibited the growth of l pneumophila host v vermiformis given the broad antimicrobial spectrum of toxoflavin it is also possible that it contributes to the observed reduction in alpha diversity seen in cooling towers where p alcaliphila is dominant paranjape et al 2020b genomic analysis revealed that p alcaliphila contains a homologue of the toxoflavin biosynthetic cluster and the presence of toxoflavin was confirmed in corresponding organic extracts inhibition appeared to be temperature dependent since p alcaliphila inhibited l pneumohila growth at 25 and 30 c but not 37 c multiple mechanisms could explain this phenomenon it could be that the rate of growth of l pneumophila is far greater than p alcaliphila at 37 c and so outpaced the accumulation of toxoflavin the other possibility is that temperature affects toxoflavin production to our knowledge regulation of toxoflavin production by temperature has not been reported in pseudomonas spp however pseudomonas is recognized for having complex quorum sensing systems which have been studied extensively in p aeruginosa chadha et al 2021 the toxoflavin biosynthetic gene cluster has been thoroughly studied in detail in b glumae and in p protegens chen et al 2012 in b glumae toxoflavin is regulated by quorum sensing system involving tofi encoding the n octanoyl homoserine lactone synthase and the associate receptor tofr chen et al 2012 kim et al 2004 in turn tofr induced expression of toxj which induced expression of toxr the main regulator of the toxoflavin biosynthesis and transporter loci chen et al 2012 kim et al 2004 the p alcaliphila jcm 10 630 genome contains a homologue of tofr 40 identity but no homologue of tofi could be identified therefore the regulation of toxoflavin production by quorum sensing could explain our results but confirmation will require additional experiments it is extremely unlikely that p alcaliphila can produce enough toxoflavin for it to accumulate in cooling towers and reach inhibitory concentrations in bulk water as this would require incredibly high levels of bacteria which cannot be supported in cooling towers conditions even b glumae a bacterium well known for toxoflavin synthesis only produces 9 µg ml at an od600nm of 5 6 iqbal et al 2021 the amount of commercial toxoflavin needed to reach these levels is also too expensive to be considered as a viable biocide to control pathogens in cooling towers however local concentrations in biofilms or floating mats could potentially reach inhibitory or lethal concentrations since pseudomonas are known to form a diversity of biofilm structures koza et al 2020 indeed we showed that p alcaliphila cells can aggregate in pure culture to form floating mats but not an attached biofilm at room temperature 25 c which is within the temperature observed in the cooling towers systems and also the optimal temperature for toxoflavin production fig 5 this does not eliminate the possibility that p alcaliphila can colonize surfaces in water system or multispecies biofilm we also cannot rule out that other compounds contributed to the inhibition of l pneumophila by p alcaliphila of note ripp like type biosynthetic gene clusters includes bacteriocin and other antimicrobial peptide derived molecules arnison et al 2012 similarly it is possible that the member of the p alacaliphila oleovorans cluster found in cooling towers is different from the isolate used in this study and so other or additional bcg and corresponding molecules could be acting as l pneumophila inhibitors multiple molecules could be contributing to inhibitory effects of pseudomonas in cooling towers and will need to be investigated 5 conclusion pseudonomas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing increased the species level resolution of our data which allowed us to narrow down candidate species responsible for the exclusion of l pneumophila in cooling towers the absence of l pneumophila was most strongly associated with the presence of p alcaliphila oleovorans which seems to be mediated at least partially by the production of toxoflavin our study demonstrates that the microbiome can be a determinant risk factor for the growth of pathogen in ews such as cooling towers some resident microbial communities are permissive for pathogen growth whereas others are resistant for example one that is dominated by p alcaliphila is detrimental for l pneumophila from the perspective of ews management it could be useful to aim at creating appropriate conditions that enhance the growth of microbial species that are deleterious to the pathogen that needs to be controlled such system would be inherently more resistant to colonization by the pathogen which may act as a failsafe in the case that chemical disinfection temporarily fails it is highly likely that p alcaliphila is not the only microbe that could play such roles as many other bacteria inhibit l pneumophila growth in vitro additional studies are needed to confirm that microbiome manipulation in ews is feasible and beneficial

16121,legionella pneumophila is a natural inhabitant of water systems from there it can be transmitted to humans by aerosolization resulting in severe pneumonia most large outbreaks are caused by cooling towers colonized with l pneumophila the resident microbiota of the cooling tower is a key determinant for the colonization and growth of l pneumophila in our preceding study the genus pseudomonas correlated negatively with the presence of l pneumophila in cooling towers but it was not clear which species was responsible therefore we identified the pseudomonas species inhabiting 14 cooling towers using a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing strategy we found that cooling towers that are free of l pneumophila contained a high relative abundance of members from the pseudomonas alcaliphila oleovorans phylogenetic cluster p alcaliphila jcm 10630 inhibited the growth of l pneumophila on agar plates analysis of the p alcaliphila genome revealed the presence of a gene cluster predicted to produce toxoflavin l pneumophila growth was inhibited by pure toxoflavin and by extracts from p alcaliphila culture found to contain toxoflavin by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in addition toxoflavin inhibits the growth of vermameoba vermiformis a host cell of l pneumophila our study indicates that p alcaliphila may be important to restrict growth of l pneumophila in water systems through the production of toxoflavin a sufficiently high concentration of toxoflavin is likely not achieved in the bulk water but might have a local inhibitory effect such as near or in biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cooling towers water microbiota biofilm antimicrobials 1 introduction legionellosis is a human respiratory disease caused by the bacterium legionella cunha et al 2016 legionella pneumophila causes 90 of the cases and the remaining 10 mostly involve l micdadei l bozemanii and l longbeachae cunha et al 2016 legionellosis includes legionnaires disease ld a systemic infection involving severe pneumonia and pontiac fever a mild flu like disease cunha et al 2016 there is a clear upward trend in the prevalence of legionnaires disease worldwide cunha et al 2016 making ld the fifth most burdensome disease in people older than 15 years old after aids tuberculosis influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease in europe in 2018 cassini et al 2018 legionella is transmitted to humans by the inhalation of aerosols containing the bacteria that are generated by engineered water systems ews meyer 1983 several types of ews can shed l pneumophila including water distribution systems showers and faucets spas fountains and cooling towers heijnsbergen et al 2015 however most of the large outbreaks of ld are caused by cooling towers garrison et al 2016 deficiencies in management and operation of water systems is the main cause of outbreak of ld garrison et al 2016 mouchtouri et al 2010 cooling towers contain a complex microbial ecosystem constituted by a diverse community of planktonic and biofilm associated bacteria protozoa and algae gregorio et al 2017 hauer et al 2016 llewellyn et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 paranjape et al 2020b 2020a pereira et al 2017 pinel et al 2021 tsao et al 2019 the microbial community in cooling towers is mostly found in surface attached and floating biofilms which seeds the bulk water with planktonic microorganisms di pippo et al 2018 gregorio et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the bacterial and protozoan community identified by different studies varies greatly but include typical biofilm forming aquatic bacteria sphingomonadaceae caulobacteraceae and hyphomicrobiaceae gregorio et al 2017 paniagua et al 2020 wang et al 2013 protozoans such as amoeba and ciliates prey on some of these microorganisms and digest them via their endocytic pathway legionella species have evolved to hijack this pathway in a variety of these phagocytic protozoans to facilitate their own growth boamah et al 2017 fields et al 1984 paranjape et al 2020a rowbotham 1980 in fact most if not all of the multiplication of legionella spp in water systems occurs inside these host cells boamah et al 2017 protozoan hosts also shield legionella from deleterious conditions boamah et al 2017 therefore legionella s presence in ews is strongly associated with the presence of host cells boamah et al 2017 in multi species biofilms l pneumophila is associated with amoebas and other phagocytic protozoans and in dense microcolonies taylor et al 2013 the composition of the microbial community in cooling towers is influenced by different factors including local temperature and the disinfection regime llewellyn et al 2017 paranjape et al 2020b pereira et al 2017 our previous study found that continuous chlorine application reduced microbial diversity decreasing the abundance of l pneumophila while increasing the abundance of pseudomonas paranjape et al 2020b this meant that there was a strong inverse relationship between l pneumophila and pseudomonas in cooling towers a correlation which has also been observed in a large study of 196 cooling towers in the united states of america llewellyn et al 2017 there was also a positive correlation between chlorine and pseudomonas which has similarly been reported in drinking water systems bertelli et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2012 holinger et al 2014 however this negative interaction is not consistent across all types of water systems for instance pseudomonas is positively correlated with legionella in a municipal drinking water distribution system zhang et al 2021 similarly legionella coexists with pseudomonas in wastewater aeration ponds fykse et al 2013 pseudomonas is a large genus and several species of pseudomonas can inhabit a single system pereira et al 2018 some strains like pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 17569 promote the presence of legionella in dynamic biofilms while others like pseudomonas aeruginosa do not stewart et al 2012 therefore the inconsistent relationship between legionella and pseudomonas observed in past studies is likely mediated by the specific strain s involved which cannot be determined using standard 16s rrna amplicon sequencing which specific pseudomonas species correlates negatively with l pneumophila in real cooling towers remains essentially unknown one can hypothesize that some strains of pseudomonas produce compounds inhibiting growth of l pneumophila in cooling towers several bacteria can inhibit the growth of l pneumophila on solid medium including species of aeromonas bacillus flavobacterium pseudomonas acinetobacter kluyvera rahnella burkholderia staphylococcus stenotrophomonas or sphingobacterium corre et al 2021 2019 guerrieri et al 2008 loiseau et al 2015 temmerman et al 2007 verdon et al 2008 for a fraction of these species the active substances responsible for the inhibition were identified staphylococcus warneri produces an antimicrobial peptide named warnericin verdon et al 2008 in the case of bacillus secreted proteases and surfactin were identified to have an anti legionella effect loiseau et al 2015 pseudomonas fluorescens strain mfe01 produces the volatile compound 1 undecene that inhibits the growth of l pneumophila in a separate but nearby dish a phenomenon that was called aerial killing corre et al 2021 2019 these studies indicate that the cooling tower microbiota likely produces a wide range of biomolecules including proteins antimicrobial peptides and surfactants that can have deleterious effects on l pneumophila in water systems berjeaud et al 2016 therefore we hypothesized that there is a species of pseudomonas associated with the absence of l pneumophila in cooling towers and that this inhibition would be linked to the production of an inhibitory molecule to this end we used a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing strategy to resolve the pseudomonas species within the cooling towers sampled in our previous study paranjape et al 2020b p alcaliphila oleovorans was found to dominate cooling towers free of l pneumophila the genome of p alcaliphila was analyzed for biosynthetic gene clusters and the production of corresponding biomolecules inhibiting l pneumophila growth was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and cultures l pneumophila strains philadelphia 1 atcc 33152 and lp120292 which was involved in the ld outbreak in quebec city in 2012 lévesque et al 2014 and is hereafter referred to as the quebec strain were used as test strains strains stored at 80 c in 10 glycerol were cultured aerobically at 37 c for 3 days on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar supplemented with 0 25 mg ml l cysteine and 0 4 mg ml ferric pyrophosphate pseudomonas alcaliphila strain jcm 10630 cip 108031t was acquired from the centre de ressources biologiques de l institut pasteur and grown on nutrient agar at 30 c aye broth bcye without agar and charcoal or fraquil an artificial freshwater medium morel et al 1975 were used as liquid media 2 2 pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing strategy previously published by pereira et al 2018 was used to identify the species of pseudomonas present in cooling towers sampled in a previous study paranjape et al 2020b their microbiome was previously determined using 16s and 18s rrna amplicon sequencing paranjape et al 2020b 2020a out of 18 cooling towers originally sampled 14 were included in the present study the other 4 were not included as they harbored extremely low abundance of pseudomonas paranjape et al 2020b details on the methodology used and the cooling towers characteristics can be found in our previous study paranjape et al 2020b briefly water was collected in sterile bottles and 0 01 thiosulfate was added prior to dna extraction with powerwater kit from qiagen l pneumophila was detected by qpcr from these extracts paranjape et al 2020b other water samples were also collected to determine heterotrophic plate counts and analyze physio chemical parameters to determine the pseudomonas species present in these cooling towers a two step pcr strategy was used to amplify the v3 v4 region of pseudomonas 16s rrna and add indices using paq5000 polymerase the dna was first amplified with the pse434f 5 tcgtcggcagcgtcagatgtgtataagagacagactttaagttgggaggaaggg 3 and pse665r 5 gtctcgtgggctcggagatgtgtataagagacag acacaggaaattccaccaccc 3 containing 5 overhang for illumina nextera indexing kit underlined a no template control and dna extracted from a blank carthridge were also included an initial denaturation step of 2 min at 95 c was used followed by 30 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 58 c and 30 s at 72 c and a final elongation step of 7 min at 72 c the amplicons were purified with ampure xp beads as per the manufacturer s instruction indexing pcr was then performed with the nextera xt index kit according to the manufacturer s instruction the amplicons were purified as above and quantified using quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen the amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq using the v2 250 bp paired end reagent kit the data are available from the sequence read archive under the bioproject accession number prjna787128 the resulting sequences were processed using dada2 callahan et al 2016 implemented in qiime 2 version 2018 8 bolyen et al 2019 the sequences were trimmed by 21 nt and truncated to 200 nt the dataset was rarefied to 50 000 sequences per samples the taxonomic assignment to the genus level of the resulting amplicon sequence variants asv was assigned using a classifier trained on the silva ssu database 132 quast et al 2013 according to qiime 2 instructions species level taxonomic assignment of the asvs was performed using blast against the curated 16s rrna sequences of pseudomonas as previously described pereira et al 2018 this dataset was then further analyzed using microbiomeanalyst chong et al 2020 to calculate shannon diversity and perform linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 2 3 legionella pneumophila inhibition assay an anti legionella assay was performed using a soft agar overlay technique briefly a suspension of l pneumophila strains quebec and philadelphia 1 and p alcaliphila were prepared in aye broth and adjusted to an od600nm of 0 2 then 200 µl of legionella suspension were added to 5 ml of autoclaved soft agar 0 5 of agar in ddh2o and gently poured on the surface of solidified cye agar plate the plates were left to solidify in a biological safety cabinet for 15 min then a 10 µl drop of p alcaliphila suspension was inoculated in the middle of the plate plates were incubated at 25 c 30 c and 37 c for 3 days and the diameter of the p alcaliphila colony and the zone of inhibition were measured 2 4 organic extraction of toxoflavin from p alcaliphila supernatant chloroform extraction was performed as previously described chen et al 2012 with slight modifications p alcaliphila was grown on a cye plate for 4 days at 30 c the bacterial cells were removed from the surface of the agar using a cell scraper and the agar was cut in smaller pieces using a sterile razorblade the chopped agar was then mixed with chloroform in 1 1 w v ratio in 50 ml falcon tube for extraction of toxoflavin the chloroform fraction 25 ml was filtered through filtropur s 0 2 µm filter sarstedt and left to fully evaporate in a fume hood the extract was then dissolved in 200 µl methanol the agar from a sterile cye plate was processed the same way to serve as a negative control extracts were tested with the disk diffusion assay described below 2 5 disk diffusion assay the susceptibility of the test strains to commercial toxoflavin sigma aldrich and p alcaliphila extracts was assessed by adapting the soft overlay agar technique previously described instead of adding the p alcaliphila suspension to the center a sterile paper disk was placed and 10 ul of extract or a range of commercial toxoflavin concentrations 0 ng μl 50 ng μl 100 ng μl 250 ng μl and 1000 ng μl was added to the disk plates were incubated at 30 c for 3 days and the zone of inhibition was measured 2 6 lc esi ms analysis of toxoflavin liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis was performed by using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2795 mississauga on canada equipped with a 100 4 6 mm i d kinetex c8 phenomenex reversed phase column particle size 2 6 μm using a mecn h2o gradient containing 1 acetic acid at a flow rate of 400 µl min the detector was a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer quattro premier xe waters equipped with a z spray interface using electrospray ionization in positive mode analyzes were carried out in both ms full scan and ms ms multiple reaction monitoring mrm scan modes with a mass to charge ratio m z window ranging from 130 to 930 the capillary voltage was set at 3 5 kv and the cone voltage at 30 v the source temperature was kept at 120 c and the desolvating gas at 200 c nitrogen was used as the cone and desolvation gas and argon was used as collision gas at collision energies up to 30 ev 2 7 biofilm and pellicle assay the biofilm formation ability of p alcaliphila was investigated by inoculating media with bacteria briefly 1 ml of trypticase soy broth king s b or r2a broth was added to the center four wells of a 24 well plate surrounding wells were filled with sterile water to prevent desiccation then 20 µl of p alcaliphila in fraquil od600nm 0 1 was added to each well and incubated at room temperature the optimal temperature for l pneumophila inhibition observed in inhibition assays and possible in towers with or without shaking at 150 rpm to simulate the different mixing conditions possible in cooling towers after a week images of the wells were taken when incubated without shaking plates were shaken at 150 rpm for 1 h to determine if pellicles could form 2 8 vermamoeba vermiformis inhibition assay the sensitivity of l pneumophila host vermamoeba vermiformis to toxoflavin was determined by monitoring its growth in the presence of toxoflavin v vermiformis were grown at room temperature in 75 cm2 cell culture flasks sarstedt in modified pynfh medium atcc medium 1034 and passaged when confluence was reached the amoebas were passaged 3 days prior to exposure by adding 5 ml of culture to 20 ml of fresh modified pynfh cell concentration was measured with a guava easycyte flow cytometer to prepare samples for flow cytometry 400 µl of culture was centrifuged at 5000 g for 2 min the supernatant discarded and the pellet resuspended in 400 µl of phosphate buffered saline pbs the stock culture was diluted to 5 104 cells ml in fresh modified pynfh and 900 µl was added to the wells of a 24 well plate then 100 µl of different toxoflavin solutions were added to wells to give final toxoflavin concentrations of 0 10 25 50 or 100 µg ml the plate was incubated at room temperature without shaking after 2 and 4 days 400 µl samples were taken from each well to measure cell concentration each condition was performed in triplicate results were analyzed using two way anova with time and toxoflavin concentration as factors and tukey s test correction for mutltiple comparison was used to assess significance between conditions 3 results 3 1 profiling of pseudomonas species in cooling towers pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing was performed on triplicate samples from 14 cooling towers the microbiota of these cooling towers was previosuly studied using 16s and 18s rrna sequencing paranjape et al 2020b 2020a for pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing a total of 4 680 703 reads were obtained and processed with qiime using the dada2 pipeline bolyen et al 2019 callahan et al 2016 as can be seen in supplementary fig 1 the 2 control samples contained very few sequences passing quality control indicating that the amplicons from the cooling tower samples were not contaminated by spurious sequences the cooling tower samples contained a minimum of 51 089 sequences passing quality control the data set was rarefied to 50 000 sequences per cooling tower all sequences were assigned to pseudomonas showing the high specificity of the primers used as previously reported pereira et al 2018 considering all the cooling towers 34 pseudomonas species were found among which 14 can be described as major or abundant species and the other 20 as minor species collectively representing less than 5 of the population of note this method is unable to differentiate closely related species such as p alcaliphila and p oleovorans such species are therefore grouped in clusters the highest diversity of pseudomonas species was observed in cooling towers cdq1 and est1 containing 26 and 13 different species respectively followed by ct cn3 cn4 and mtl5 fig 1 a in our study the top three most abundant pseudomonas species were p alcaliphila oleovorans p monteilii and p alcaligenes the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster was observed in all cooling towers in various proportions but was the dominant pseudomonas species in several cooling towers including cn2 out1 out2 mont1 mtl1 mtl4 mtl7 and mtl8 fig 1a the opportunistic human pathogen p aeruginosa associated with a variety of disease in susceptible individuals gellatly and hancock 2013 was detected only in towers cdq1 and est2 at a low abundance of 0 01 next we calculated the abundance of each pseudomonas species as a fraction of relative bacterial abundance paranjape et al 2020b as can be seen in fig 1b p alcaliphila oleovorans is the most abundant pseudomonas species in cooling tower microbiomes dominated by pseudomonas including cooling towers out1 mont1 and mtl1 next we sought to identify factors influencing the diversity of pseudomonas within the cooling towers shannon diversity was calculated for each tower fig 2 a as expected cooling towers cdq1 and est1 had the highest shannon diversity while the cooling towers dominated by p alcaliphila had the lowest diversity in our previous study we determined that chlorine application schedule had a greater impact than chlorine concentration in shaping the bacterial communities paranjape et al 2020b similarly treatment schedule seems to affect pseudomonas diversity as tower treated by periodic applications showed significantly higher diversity p 0 03 than cooling towers treated continuously fig 2b concentration of total chlorine and residual chlorine did not seem to affect pseudomonas diversity the slopes of the shannon diversity against the concentration of total chlorine 0 599 0 502 and against the concentration of residual chlorine 0 107 0 073 were not significantly different than zero fig 2c d we next used linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse implemented in microbiomeanalyst chong et al 2020 to examine the differences in the abundance of pseudomonas species relative to the bacterial reads in cooling towers lefse is an algorithm that uses a mix of statistical testing linear discriminant analysis lda and effect size to identify taxa that are predictive of a particular condition segata et al 2011 the treatment schedule and the presence or absence of legionella spp and l pneumophila were considered as comparison factors paranjape et al 2020b p alcaliphila oleovorans was the only species enriched in cooling towers free of l pneumophila and free of legionella spp fig 3 a b in contrast p monteilii cluster was enriched in towers containing legionella spp or l pneumophila p alcaligenes was enriched in cooling towers containing l pneumophila and p soli was enriched in towers containing legionella spp fig 3a b by considering the treatment schedule p alcaliphila oleovorans and p anguiliseptica were associated with continuous treatment whereas p monteilii and p soli were associated with periodic treatment fig 3c 3 2 anti l pneumophila activity of p alcaliphila our results reavealed that a member of the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster seems to be the main inhibitor of l pneumophila colonization in the cooling towers we studied therefore we investigated if an isolate of that cluster p alcaliphila strain jcm 10630 can inhibit l pneumophila growth in vitro yumoto et al 2001 we carried out l pneumophila inihibition assay at three different temperatures 25 c 30 c and 37 c this range was chosen because the water of the cooling towers included in this study was typicallly between 20 and 25 c paranjape et al 2020b and because the optimal growth temperature of l pneumophila is 37 c after three days of incubation p alcaliphila inhibited the growth of l pneumophila at 25 c and 30 c but not at 37 c fig 4 a one way anova with a tukey correction for mutltiple comparison was used to assess significance between conditions the diameter of inhibition was significantly larger at 25 c than at 30 c for both strains p 0 001 the two strains showed similar inhibition zones at each temperature tested p 0 6 the size of the colony of p alcaliphila was significantly larger at 25 c than at 30 c p 0 001 the strain of l pneumophila seems to influence slighlty the growth of p alcaliphila at 25 c as the colony was slightly larger 14 3 mm when grown with the quebec strain than with the philadelphia 1 strain 13 mm p 0 02 there were no difference in colony size at 30 c 3 3 in silico analysis of p alcaliphila genome the p alcaliphila strain jcm 10 630 genome was retrieved from refseq gcf 900101755 1 and was analyzed to identify clues as to the cause of the inhibition of l pneumophila growth we first used antismash blin et al 2019 to identify putative biosynthetic gene clusters bcgs five clusters were found but none showed similarity higher than 50 with known clusters table 1 next we used the blast koala function of the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes to assign kegg orthology annotation to the genes and predict metabolic pathways present in this genome kanehisa et al 2016 a cluster of genes homologous to toxoflavin synthesis cluster was detected toxoflavin is an important virulence factor of the plant pathogen burkholderia glumae suzuki et al 2004 and is also produced by pseudomonas protegens pf 5 philmus et al 2015 it is a broad spectrum inhibitor that is toxic to various plants park et al 2019 fungi li et al 2019 and gram positive and gram negative bacteria nagamatsu et al 1993 including mycobacterium smegmatis the p alcaliphila toxoflavin cluster is most homologous to the b glumae cluster and organized in a similar manner chen et al 2012 philmus et al 2015 suzuki et al 2004 the homology of p alcaliphila genes compared to b glumae varies between 36 and 69 identity table 2 overall our in silico analysis suggests that the inhibition of l pneumophila growth by p alcaliphila could be due to the production of toxoflavin another compound or a mixture of several molecules 3 4 toxoflavin inhibits growth of l pneumophila on cye plate the susceptibility of the two strains of l pneumophila to toxoflavin was tested using a dilution series of commercial toxoflavin sigma aldrich the results showed that the size of the inhibition zone proportionally increases with concentration of toxoflavin for both strains fig 5 the diameters of the inhibition zone were 10 mm 12 mm 20 mm and 30 mm when a total of 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 µg of toxoflavin was added respectively 3 5 toxoflavin is secreted by p alcaliphila on cye agar plate in order to confirm that p alcaliphila produces toxoflavin we performed chloroform extraction from cye plate inoculated with a pure culture of p alcaliphila controls included an extract from a sterile cye plate and the methanol carrier alone l pneumophila growth was inhibited by the extract from plates inoculated with p alcaliphila fig 6 c slightly more than sterile cye and methanol fig 6a b with zone of inhibitions of 12 10 and 10 mm respectively in order to confirm that toxoflavin was present the extracts were then subjected to lc esi ms pure toxoflavin solution produced a strong peak at m z 194 0 fig 6d the same strong peak appeared in p alcaliphila plate extracts fig 6f while being absent in the control fig 6e these results were then confirmed with lc esi ms ms in mrm mode supplementary fig s2 3 6 p alcaliphila produces floating biofilm mat many pseudomonas species can produce attached biofilms or floating biofilm mats mann and wozniak 2012 we investigated the ability of p alcaliphila jcm 10630 to form these structures at the optimal temperature for l pneumophila inhibition by toxoflavin that was also observed in cooling towers 25 c fig 5a and with and without shaking to simulate the different levels of disturbance within a cooling tower system e g stagnant water in dead ends and flowing water in pipes first we tested the production of attached biofilm in r2a king s b and in trypticase soy broth at room temperature under shaking after one week no attached biofilm was seen however a filamentous floating mass of cells could be seen in both r2a and trypticase soy broth fig 7 a we then tested the production of a pellicle by incubating p alcaliphila in the same three media but without shaking no pellicle was formed in any of these media fig 7b nevertheless we could see a mat at the bottom of the well in all cases shaking for 1 h dislodged the mat produced in trypticase soy broth and r2a resulting in a floating mat similar to what was seen after incubation with shaking fig 7a we therefore concluded that p alcaliphila may produces floating biofilm mats in cooling towers 3 7 toxoflavin is toxic for vermamoeba vermiformis since p alcaliphila was also negatively correlated with the presence of host cells in cooling towers paranjape et al 2020a we next hypothesized that toxoflavin might be toxic for amoebas typically found in water systems therefore we monitored the growth of v vermiformis when exposed to toxoflavin fig 8 ranging from a concentration at which there was a very small to a very large effect against l pneumophila fig 5 within four days cells unexposed to toxoflavin grew by 7 6 fold in contrast cells exposed to 10 µg ml and 25 µg ml grew much less by a factor of 3 7 and 3 3 respectively cells exposed to higher concentrations showed a sharp decrease in cell number at day 2 and then recovered slightly by day 4 reaching the number of cells present at the start of the experiment suggesting that toxoflavin toxicity diminished over time 4 discussion several previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between the presence of l pneumophila and pseudomonas in cooling towers llewellyn et al 2017 paranjape et al 2020b by using a pseudomonas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing approach pereira et al 2018 we identified that members of p alcaliphila oleovoran cluster are the main species associated with the exclusion of l pneumophila from cooling towers fortunately the opportunistic human pathogen p aeruginosa does not seem to thrive under these conditions as it was present only in very low abundance the dominance of p alcaliphila oleovorans is surprising as a previous study of a single cooling tower located in braunschweig germany found a high diversity of pseudomonas species even when p alcaliphila oleovorans was a member of the core community pereira et al 2018 differences in microbiology or physico chemical properties of source water or cooling tower management could explain the dominance of p alcaliphila oleovorans in our cooling tower samples compared to those in germany the diversity and abundance of pseudomonas may also be affected by seasons but this could not be investigated with our current data set importantly the presence of p alcaliphila oleovorans was strongly associated with continuous disinfectant application this strategy presumably creates conditions favorable for this group or specific members of this group nevertheless we cannot rule out that other factors also influence the community of pseudomonas in cooling towers our analysis also revealed that some species of pseudomonas may be beneficial for l pneumophila lefse analysis suggest that members of the p monteilii cluster and p alcaligenes are positively associated with l pneumophila fig 4a for example it has been reported that in an environment lacking critical nutrients for its growth l pneumophila can form microcolonies around certain aquatic bacteria including flavobacterium breve wadowsky and yee 1983 and p alcaligenes çotuk et al 2005 unfortunately the method used is not able to differentiate between members of the p alcaliphila oleovorans cluster as the region targeted is identical in addition to p alcaliphila and p oleovorans this cluster also contains p chengduensis pereira et al 2018 these three species are associated with various water environments peix et al 2018 tao et al 2014 it is possible that the cooling towers studied here contain a diversity of species belonging to this cluster the water of the cooling towers included in this study was typically between 20 and 25 c and ph 8 paranjape et al 2020b this falls within the conditions that p alcaliphila jcm 10630 can thrive in having been isolated from sea water and shown to be alkali tolerant and psychrophilic growing best at temperature between 4 and 30 c yumoto et al 2001 in this study we found that p alcaliphila was able to inhibit l pneumophila growth at least in part through toxoflavin production in assays 1 µg of toxoflavin directly inhibited l pneumophila growth on plates and 25 µg ml inhibited the growth of l pneumophila host v vermiformis given the broad antimicrobial spectrum of toxoflavin it is also possible that it contributes to the observed reduction in alpha diversity seen in cooling towers where p alcaliphila is dominant paranjape et al 2020b genomic analysis revealed that p alcaliphila contains a homologue of the toxoflavin biosynthetic cluster and the presence of toxoflavin was confirmed in corresponding organic extracts inhibition appeared to be temperature dependent since p alcaliphila inhibited l pneumohila growth at 25 and 30 c but not 37 c multiple mechanisms could explain this phenomenon it could be that the rate of growth of l pneumophila is far greater than p alcaliphila at 37 c and so outpaced the accumulation of toxoflavin the other possibility is that temperature affects toxoflavin production to our knowledge regulation of toxoflavin production by temperature has not been reported in pseudomonas spp however pseudomonas is recognized for having complex quorum sensing systems which have been studied extensively in p aeruginosa chadha et al 2021 the toxoflavin biosynthetic gene cluster has been thoroughly studied in detail in b glumae and in p protegens chen et al 2012 in b glumae toxoflavin is regulated by quorum sensing system involving tofi encoding the n octanoyl homoserine lactone synthase and the associate receptor tofr chen et al 2012 kim et al 2004 in turn tofr induced expression of toxj which induced expression of toxr the main regulator of the toxoflavin biosynthesis and transporter loci chen et al 2012 kim et al 2004 the p alcaliphila jcm 10 630 genome contains a homologue of tofr 40 identity but no homologue of tofi could be identified therefore the regulation of toxoflavin production by quorum sensing could explain our results but confirmation will require additional experiments it is extremely unlikely that p alcaliphila can produce enough toxoflavin for it to accumulate in cooling towers and reach inhibitory concentrations in bulk water as this would require incredibly high levels of bacteria which cannot be supported in cooling towers conditions even b glumae a bacterium well known for toxoflavin synthesis only produces 9 µg ml at an od600nm of 5 6 iqbal et al 2021 the amount of commercial toxoflavin needed to reach these levels is also too expensive to be considered as a viable biocide to control pathogens in cooling towers however local concentrations in biofilms or floating mats could potentially reach inhibitory or lethal concentrations since pseudomonas are known to form a diversity of biofilm structures koza et al 2020 indeed we showed that p alcaliphila cells can aggregate in pure culture to form floating mats but not an attached biofilm at room temperature 25 c which is within the temperature observed in the cooling towers systems and also the optimal temperature for toxoflavin production fig 5 this does not eliminate the possibility that p alcaliphila can colonize surfaces in water system or multispecies biofilm we also cannot rule out that other compounds contributed to the inhibition of l pneumophila by p alcaliphila of note ripp like type biosynthetic gene clusters includes bacteriocin and other antimicrobial peptide derived molecules arnison et al 2012 similarly it is possible that the member of the p alacaliphila oleovorans cluster found in cooling towers is different from the isolate used in this study and so other or additional bcg and corresponding molecules could be acting as l pneumophila inhibitors multiple molecules could be contributing to inhibitory effects of pseudomonas in cooling towers and will need to be investigated 5 conclusion pseudonomas specific 16s rrna amplicon sequencing increased the species level resolution of our data which allowed us to narrow down candidate species responsible for the exclusion of l pneumophila in cooling towers the absence of l pneumophila was most strongly associated with the presence of p alcaliphila oleovorans which seems to be mediated at least partially by the production of toxoflavin our study demonstrates that the microbiome can be a determinant risk factor for the growth of pathogen in ews such as cooling towers some resident microbial communities are permissive for pathogen growth whereas others are resistant for example one that is dominated by p alcaliphila is detrimental for l pneumophila from the perspective of ews management it could be useful to aim at creating appropriate conditions that enhance the growth of microbial species that are deleterious to the pathogen that needs to be controlled such system would be inherently more resistant to colonization by the pathogen which may act as a failsafe in the case that chemical disinfection temporarily fails it is highly likely that p alcaliphila is not the only microbe that could play such roles as many other bacteria inhibit l pneumophila growth in vitro additional studies are needed to confirm that microbiome manipulation in ews is feasible and beneficial

16122,recent research has shown enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr from municipal wastewater at warmer temperatures around 30 c to be achievable in both laboratory scale reactors and full scale treatment plants in the context of a changing climate the feasibility of ebpr at even higher temperatures is of interest we operated two lab scale ebpr sequencing batch reactors for 300 days at 30 c and 35 c respectively and followed the dynamics of the communities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and competing glycogen accumulating organisms gaos using a combination of 16s rrna gene metabarcoding quantitative pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses stable and nearly complete phosphorus p removal was achieved at 30 c similarly long term p removal was stable at 35 c with effluent po4 3 p concentrations 0 5 mg l on half of all monitored days diverse and abundant candidatus accumulibacter amplicon sequence variants were closely related to those found in temperate environments suggesting that ebpr at this temperature does not require a highly specialized pao community a slow feeding strategy effectively limited the carbon uptake rates of gaos allowing paos to outcompete gaos at both temperatures candidatus competibacter was the main gao along with cluster iii defluviicoccus members these organisms withstood the slow feeding regime suggesting that their bioenergetic characteristics of carbon uptake differ from those of their tetrad forming relatives comparative cycle studies revealed higher carbon and p cycling activity of ca accumulibacter when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 35 c implying that the lowered p removal performance at 35 c was not a direct effect of temperature but a result of higher metabolic rates of carbon and or p utilization of paos and gaos the resultant carbon deficiency and escalated community competition an increase in the toc to po4 3 p ratio from 25 1 to 40 1 effectively eased the carbon deficiency and benefited paos in general a slow feeding strategy and sufficiently high carbon input benefited a high and stable ebpr at 35 c representing basic conditions suitable for full scale treatment plants experiencing higher water temperatures graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal global warming polyphosphate accumulating organisms glycogen accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter carbon source 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a process widely employed for p removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps because it is relatively cheap and sustainable and is desirable for downstream nutrient recovery garcía martín et al 2006 simoes et al 2020 roy et al 2021 despite the advantages its application in warm climates has long been considered unfavorable owing to observations that the functional bacteria i e polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in the process were outcompeted by their rivals glycogen accumulating organisms gaos at high temperatures 25 c whang and park 2002 panswad et al 2003 lópez vázquez et al 2009 deteriorated ebpr performance and the dominance of gaos were reported at full scale wwtps with average yearly temperatures above 25 c wong et al 2005 cao 2011 seasonal deterioration in ebpr performance as wastewater temperature increased during the summer has also been reported gu et al 2005 in a pilot scale membrane bioreactor employing the university of cape town uct configuration for raw municipal wastewater treatment total phosphorus removal dropped from 95 to below 50 when the temperature increased from 24 c to above 35 c at temperatures above 30 c volatile fatty acids vfas were completely utilized however phosphorus was not released suggesting competition with gaos sayi ucar et al 2015 in batch tests the maximum acetate uptake rates of candidatus accumulibacter paos and candidatus competibacter gaos were similar at temperatures 20 c brdjanovic et al 1997 with increasing temperature the rates of ca competibacter continued to increase following the extended arrhenius equation lópez vázquez et al 2007 while those of ca accumulibacter remained relatively constant in the range of 20 30 c additionally significantly increased anaerobic maintenance coefficients were observed for ca accumulibacter these results helped to explain the ebpr instability reported in wwtps treating warm effluents lópez vázquez et al 2007 however these experiments were performed by exposing the enrichment culture obtained at 20 c to other temperatures and hence it is not clear if the observed short term effects were partially a stress response by ca accumulibacter to acute temperature changes on the other hand there have been efforts to explore the long term feasibility of ebpr at temperatures 25 c robust ebpr was obtained at 30 c for an extended period 100 days by applying a short ebpr cycle freitas et al 2009 selectively removing biomass from the top of the sludge bed allowed to maintain complete p removal for nearly three months in an aerobic granular sludge system operated at 30 c winkler et al 2011 long term ebpr 160 days stability has been demonstrated in a lab scale reactor at 28 c in the absence of a short ebpr cycle or selective sludge removal ong et al 2014 however as the temperature increased to 32 c ebpr activities were significantly compromised with a reduction in the average abundance based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analyses of ca accumulibacter shen et al 2017 further showed that having multiple anaerobic aerobic stages in one ebpr cycle aided ebpr at 30 c in addition to these laboratory scale studies which included either specific operational control or the presence of a specifically enriched pao community there are reports of stable ebpr in full scale systems in warm climates law et al 2016 cao et al 2017 cokro et al 2017 the presence of gaos had no apparent effect on the long term stability of ebpr at 30 c law et al 2016 a recent field study in singapore further showed a wide range of paos exhibiting high micro diversity in carbon usage which might be important for the observed ebpr stability in these full scale wwtps operating at water temperatures of 28 32 c qiu et al 2019 even higher water temperatures are expected due to global warming the global surface temperatures are likely to rise by up to 4 8 c by the end of this century in a high emission scenario intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 more pronounced temperature increases have been observed in highly urbanized areas for example temperatures in singapore have risen at a rate 0 25 c per decade since 1948 and currently around 0 5 c per decade more than double that of the global average during the same period meteorological service singapore 2021 the aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of ebpr at 35 c two lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in parallel at 30 c and 35 c respectively for over 300 days we employed a slow feeding strategy to mimic the operating conditions typically found in the field qiu et al 2019 with a mixture of acetate and propionate as carbon source consecutive cycle studies involved switching temperatures between 30 c and 35 c to investigate the effect of temperature on carbon and p transformation kinetics and stoichiometry the fine scale dynamics of the bacterial community was monitored using 16s rrna gene metabarcoding fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr operation two sbrs with a working volume of 1 59 l each were inoculated with activated sludge from a local wwtp in singapore with an ambient water temperature of 28 31 c qiu et al 2019 a slow feeding strategy mimicking the actual feeding conditions in full scale plants was applied for reactor operation tu and schuler 2013 qiu et al 2020 tian et al 2022 additionally a mixture of acetate and propionate molar ratio of 8 4 1 was used as a carbon source acetate and propionate acetate predominantly have been reported as the major vfas in municipal wastewater in different geographical regions lópez vázquez et al 2008a qiu et al 2019 the sbrs were operated with 6 h cycles including a 60 min feeding a 20 min anaerobic a 180 min aerobic and a 100 min settling decant stage in each cycle 0 74 l of synthetic wastewater containing 193 8 mg l acetate 17 2 mg l propionate and 8 8 mg l po4 3 p detailed in the supplementary materials was introduced into the reactor with a resultant toc p molar ratio of 25 1 two reactors were operated in parallel at 30 c r30 and 35 c r35 respectively temperature control was achieved using a proportional integral derivative temperature controller connected to heating jackets wrapping the reactors the hrt and srt in both reactors were 12 9 h and 25 d respectively the ph was automatically controlled at 6 80 7 50 by using a m200 transmitter mettler toledo switzerland connected to an acid base 0 5 m hcl naoh dosing system the do was maintained at 0 8 1 2 mg l during the aerobic phase by using the same transmitter connected to a solenoid valve in the aeration system during days 175 220 sodium acetate and propionic acid concentrations in the feed supplementary materials for r35 were increased 1 6 times resultant toc p molar ratio of 40 1 which was reduced to 1 2 times toc p molar ratio of 30 1 from day 220 onwards until the end of the experiment the resultant mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor suspended volatile solids mlvss concentrations were 1 57 2 00 and 1 07 1 57 g l respectively in r30 and 1 51 2 15 and 1 25 1 93 g l respectively in r35 during the experiment fig s1 2 2 consecutive cycle study a consecutive cycle study was performed on days 55 77 105 203 and 294 to investigate the effect of temperature on the carbon and p cycling kinetics and stoichiometry cycle studies were done in adjacent sbr cycles in both reactors with the first cycle at their respective original temperature i e r30 at 30 c and r35 at 35 c in the subsequent cycle the temperature in the two reactors was switched i e in r30 to 35 c and in r35 to 30 c this strategy allowed the interrogation of temperature effects in both reactors by effectively discounting any potential bias arising from the acute response of the microbial communities to temperature changes in the cycle study filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters and activated sludge samples were collected at regular time intervals for po4 3 p vfas polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and glycogen analyses 2 3 chemical analysis po4 3 p levels were measured using test kits hach usa following standard methods as were mixed

fluorescence in situ hybridization activated sludge samples collected from both reactors during the operation were immediately fixed using 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 c for 2 h the fixed samples were washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution and stored in a mixture of 1 pbs and ethanol 1 1 at 20 c before fish analysis microorganisms of interest were detected using eubmix eub338 eub338ii

ecogenomics the generated data was analyzed using the dada2 pipeline version 1 12 callahan et al 2016 and midas 3 6 nierychlo et al 2020 as reference for taxonomy assignment the obtained data were deposited in the ncbi database under the bioproject no prjna807832 a 16s rrna gene clone library was prepared on certain genomic dna samples r30 day5 r35 day5 r30 day105 and r35 day105 for the recovery of the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of dominant ca accumulibacter taxa after pcr amplification with primer set 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 qiu et al 2013 phylogenic analysis mega x kumar et al 2018 was performed to compare the ca accumulibacter sequences in the clone library and those from metabarcoding to further confirm their phylogenic relationships with existing ca accumulibacter sequences additionally qpcr was used to analyze the clade level distribution of ca accumulibacter according to he et al 2007 see supplementary materials for additional information about 16s rrna gene metabarcoding and qpcr 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 the alpha diversity calculation was performed using r packages hillr version 0 5 0 chao et al 2014 canonical correlation analysis cca was performed to relate the ebpr kinetics and stoichiometry obtained in cycle studies and the community dynamics using r packages vegan version 2 5 6 a permutation test was performed with function anova cca to assess the significance of cca microbial ecological network analysis was done using cytoscape version 3 7 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ebpr works at 35 c with influent toc and po4 3 p concentrations of 86 and 8 8 mg l respectively toc p molar ratio of 25 1 r30 the reactor operated at 30 c showed high and stable ebpr performance for 300 days fig 1 a p release was maintained at 35 mg l and complete p removal was achieved on most days a technical failure occurred on day 35 resulting in no carbon source being supplied for two days good ebpr activity was restored immediately after the system had returned to normal operation showing the high resilience of the system to unexpected disturbances previous studies reported significantly reduced ebpr activity at 32 c ong et al 2014 similarly shen et al 2017 observed fluctuating ebpr performance at 30 c using a multi cycle operational strategy it is possible that the slow feeding strategy used in this work benefited a high and stable ebpr at 30 c discussed later as for carbon sources a modeling study suggested paos could outcompete gaos at 30 c when fed with acetate and propionate at a molar ratio of 3 1 compared to a ratio of 1 1 or pure acetate or propionate lópez vázquez et al 2009 similarly acetate fed and propionate fed bioreactors operating at 30 c displayed higher and more stable ebpr with acetate as feed shen et al 2017 wang et al 2020 further showed that propionate was always the preferred carbon source of ca accumulibacter enriched with acetate or propionate at high temperature but the addition of this carbon source alone led to aerobic glycogen replenishment instead of high p uptake in conclusion a mixture of vfas dominated by acetate appears more desirable than one dominated by propionate to achieve ebpr at high temperatures complete p removal was also achieved in r35 the reactor operated at 35 c during the first two weeks fig 1b the same technical fault as for r30 occurred on day 35 and the following two day starvation period had no lasting impact on r35 ebpr activity was restored within two days complete p removal was maintained during days 91 109 until there was a sudden drop in p release and uptake activities from 40 to 0 mg l within a day the reason for this decrease in ebpr activity is unknown and may not be a result of gao competition since the relative abundances of gaos also decreased significantly during this period fig 2 the reactor r35 did not recover on its own from this complete loss of ebpr activity days 109 119 fig 1b re seeding with waste sludge collected from r30 instead of fresh field sludge for the sake of experimental consistency and comparability of the two reactors led to a restoration of ebpr activities although at a lower level p release and uptake values around 10 mg l days 135 175 an increase in the influent toc concentration to 137 mg l toc p ratio of 40 1 led to a rapid increase in ebpr activities complete p removal was achieved on day 187 and maintained until day 219 when the influent toc was reduced to 103 mg l toc p ratio of 30 1 after a period of low level fluctuation near complete p removal was achieved again day 285 and was maintained until the end of the experiment day 316 in general although the overall performance was lower compared to r30 appreciable ebpr activities were achieved in r35 for an extended period near complete p removal was achieved effluent po4 3 p 0 5 mg l more than half the time the present study is the first report of sustained ebpr at this temperature although the process stability and reliability need to be further assessed at different scales although vfas are major components of dissolved organics in municipal wastewater lópez vázquez et al 2008a a diverse range of carbon sources can contribute to ebpr in the field qiu et al 2019 diversified carbon sources may result in increased diversity of the ebpr microbial community which is expected to benefit system stability 3 2 community composition and dynamics in the activated sludge inoculum ca accumulibacter was the predominant pao at a relative abundance of 0 76 followed by tetrasphaera at 0 3 ca competibacter 2 12 and defluviicoccus 1 23 were the predominated gaos followed by micropruina 0 05 during reactor operation paos and gaos were top ranked community members in both reactors fig s2 ca accumulibacter remained as the predominant pao with relative abundance values significantly increased in both reactors up to 16 0 and 6 88 in r30 and r35 respectively tetrasphaera disappeared within the first month no microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 ca methylophosphatis singleton et al 2021 ca obscuribacter soo et al 2014 or ca accumulimonas nguyen et al 2012 putative paos were detected in the seed sludge or during reactor operation ca competibacter remained the predominant gao 2 12 11 5 in r30 and 1 35 24 4 in r35 followed by defluviicoccus 0 25 4 73 in r30 and 0 70 6 16 in r35 ca contendobacter a member of the ca competibacter lineage mcilroy et al 2014 appeared in both reactors only during a limited period days 98 133 in r30 and days 119 203 in r35 micropruina was only present in the seed sludge 0 05 no propionivibrio albertsen et al 2016 related gaos were detected in either reactor despite the different ranking in relative abundances most 23 out of 30 dominant genera were shared between the two reactors detailed dynamics of each major pao gao lineage are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 ca accumulibacter in the reactors are closely related to those commonly found in temperate systems thirty nine ca accumulibacter amplicon sequence variants asvs each asv was uniquely numbered were detected 27 and 28 of which occurred in r30 and r35 respectively fig 2a and b the two reactors shared 16 asvs with 9 of them asvs 11 23 28 32 36 38 73 87 353 being detected in 4 samples in both reactors representing the core ca accumulibacter community among these 9 core asvs 6 asvs 23 28 32 36 38 353 were originally present in the seed sludge the remaining 3 asvs 11 73 and 87 started to emerge in both reactors from day 5 implying that they were probably also present in the seed sludge but at undetectable relative abundances all these asvs flourished at the beginning of the experiment concomitant with the presence of desirable ebpr activities in both reactors during the first few weeks fig 1 suggesting that the operation strategy employed in this study effectively retained the majority of ca accumulibacter species originally present in the field which is key to sustained ebpr activities in the long term additionally these results demonstrated that most ca accumulibacter in the full scale sludge could effectively survive an elevated temperature of 35 c despite the extended presence of these core asvs their relative abundances and status of predominance differed in the two reactors fig 2a and b in r30 asvs 11 23 28 32 36 38 stayed at comparable relative abundances ranging from 0 07 to 1 57 later asv11 started to dominate until the end of operation asv11 is closely related 100 identity to ca accumulibacter clade iif strain scelse 1 qiu et al 2020 similarly ong et al 2014 reported the predominance of clade iif ca accumulibacter in a bioreactor at 32 c it seems that certain metabolic characteristics enable members of this clade to dominate at high temperatures qiu et al 2020 in contrast asv11 was less abundant in r35 throughout the operation the sudden disruption of ebpr activities in r35 and subsequent inoculation with r30 sludge on day 119 presented an opportunity to test the growth potential of asv11 at 35 c its decreasing relative abundance to 0 1 suggested that asv 11 may not have a significant growth advantage at 35 c compared to r30 r35 exhibited dominance of single asvs during each period of operation which might be a reason for the lower ebpr stability in r35 than in r30 fig 1 asv36 prevailed during the first 50 days followed by asv23 and asv11 and then asv32 and asv73 a whole genus phylogenetic analysis suggested that these asvs are widely distributed in the ca accumulibacter lineage table s1 and fig s3 for example asv36 is closely related 100 identity to clade iid sequences ef565158 ef565159 recovered from a full scale wwtp in us asv 32 is closely related 100 identity to clade iib sequence ab736230 from a lab scale ebpr system operated at 20 4 c satoh et al 2013 asv87 is closely affiliated 100 identity with a clade iif member jq726366 from an sbr operated at 20 c kim et al 2013 and asv28 is closely related 100 identity to clade iic sequence kj807999 from a full scale wwtp in china the closed genome of asv28 was recovered using nanopore long read sequencing as reported in our previous work arumugam et al 2021 a clone library was established to recover the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of the dominant asvs fig s3 subsequent phylogenetic analysis supported their identification qpcr analysis was also employed to analyze the clade level distribution and dynamics fig s4 no clade i member was detected in either reactor the dynamics of clades iib iic and iid generally agree with the 16s rrna gene based identification of these dominant asvs collectively these results suggested that a diverse range of ca accumulibacter members could survive at 35 c these asvs are not unique but have also been found in laboratory and full scale ebpr systems in temperate climates implying that successful ebpr at elevated temperatures does not require a highly specialized ca accumulibacter community 3 2 2 rare ca compatibacter asvs in the seed sludge thrived in reactors together with defluviicoccus cluster iii members fifty four ca competibacter sequences were detected 40 of which were found in each reactor fig 2c and d similar to what was observed for ca accumulibacter multiple asvs 1 12 16 24 42 dominated r30 for the first 150 days and asv 22 proliferated during the remainder of reactor operation while single asvs dominated r35 during each period of operation asvs 1 29 and 124 different from the core ca accumulibacter asvs which were all derived from the seed sludge a great number of ca competibacter asvs were present in the seed sludge but decreased in relative abundance in both reactors after initially thriving during the first 100 days the remaining predominant asvs e g asv 29 and asv 124 in r35 and asv 22 in r30 had not been detected in the seed sludge they appeared only after day 77 no closely related relatives of these asvs were found in the ncbi database the best matches were lr650365 94 12 identity to asv 29 hq467835 96 73 identity to asv 124 and dq201883 96 73 identity to asv 22 in contrast close relatives of asvs which dominated the seed sludge were commonly detected in temperate wwtps e g the top three most dominant ca competibacter asvs in the seed sludge asv16 asv1 and asv132 showed 100 98 91 and 99 64 similarity to sequences kf428043 wang et al 2014a hq476545 kim et al 2013 and kj807854 wang et al 2014b respectively since ca competibacter in full scale systems have not been as well studied it is reasonable that no close relatives were found in databases for these asvs that were rare in the seed sludge but thrived in both reactors since the same was observed in r30 and r35 we cannot exclude the possibility that lab scale reactors tend to selectively benefit certain rare ca competibacter asvs in the long term nielsen et al 2019 overall a higher predominance of ca competibacter was observed at 35 c fig 2 which corresponded to the lower ebpr performance of r35 fig 1 defluviicoccus related gaos showed lower relative abundance compared to ca competibacter fig 2e and f asv 8 dominated r30 with other asvs staying at low levels throughout the operation the dominant asv in r35 was also asv 8 before day 112 afterwards asv80 and asv202 increased but then declined as the ebpr activity recovered to a high level fig 1 asv 8 is closely related 100 identity to ab445107 nittami et al 2009 a cluster iii member having a nostocoida limicola like filamentous morphology commonly found in full scale systems mcilroy et al 2010 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 chen et al 2022 fish analysis confirmed their presence and morphology fig s5 asv 80 showed 99 63 similarity to dq250533 a cluster ii member having the typical tetrad forming morphology wong and liu 2007 fish analysis allowed their detection in r35 together with asv 202 cocci in clumps fig s5j neither asv 80 nor asv 202 were detected in the seed sludge their proliferation in r35 coincided with reduced ebpr activity fig 1 and a reduction in the relative abundance of ca competibacter fig 2d which could have opened up an ecological niche tetrad forming defluviicoccus were believed to be unable to compete with ca accumulibacter under low substrate conditions tu and schuler 2013 due to their inability to effectively take up low concentration substrates burow et al 2008 recent research further suggested lower uptake rates of vfas of defluviicoccus vanus cluster ii member than ca accumulibacter at 30 c wang et al 2020 their decrease after the restoration of the ebpr activities verified these hypotheses however the ability of cluster iii member asv 8 to co exist with ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter in the long term under the slow feeding condition suggested that they are metabolically different from their cluster ii relatives in terms of carbon uptake bioenergetics chen et al 2022 apart from these well characterized paos and gaos dechloromonas related sequences were also detected in both reactors fig 3 g and h asvs in r30 showed high inter lineage dynamics in the first 125 days alternating predominance was observed for asvs 10 67 112 and 166 in r35 a significant predominance of single asvs 10 and 21 was observed during different stages of operation similar to the patterns observed for ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter communities recent research allowed the identification of two novel dechloromonas related paos in full scale wwtps petriglieri et al 2021 in r35 asvs 10 and 21 were present during days 108 119 when there was no detectable ebpr activity suggesting that both asvs acted as gaos we did not find well characterized relatives of other asvs in the database the highest similarity score was 97 45 which is between asv67 and candidatus dechloromonas phosphoritropha midas s 96 petriglieri et al 2021 their ecological roles in the systems need further confirmation 3 2 3 regulation of pao gao interactions via controlled organic carbon supply benefits a higher ebpr stability at elevated temperature almost all core asvs in each lineage both paos and gaos were thriving fig s6 and the appearance of rare species originally undetectable in the seed sludge suggests that the operational conditions including the composition of the feed in this work effectively benefited the growth of each community hence an elevated temperature of 35 c does not present an obstacle for any of these single asvs to survive and multiply within each lineage of gaos and paos certain asvs fared better in r35 than in r30 with lower community richness reflected by the hill number 1d and evenness reflected by 2d fig s7 implying that both pao and gao communities were stressed at 35 c previous research suggested that both paos and gaos have faster carbon metabolic rates and maintenance coefficients as the temperature increases brdjanovic et al 1997 lópez vázquez et al 2007 2008b table 1 this would result in increased carbon requirements of the ebpr community at 35 c causing stress due to a carbon deficiency to test this hypothesis the toc p ratio in r35 was increased from 25 1 to 40 1 on day 175 fig 1 a subsequent increase in ebpr activity was observed together with increases in the diversity and evenness of all respective lineage members to values comparable to those in r30 fig s7 supporting the notion that the supply of carbon was a limiting factor in r35 the lower relative abundance of paos and higher abundance of gaos at 35 c suggests that paos are more sensitive to carbon deficient conditions increasing the concentration of carbon sources effectively allowed ca accumulibacter to outcompete ca competibacter in terms of relative abundance by the end of the experiment fig 2b and d there was no clear anticorrelation between relative abundance values of paos and gaos in either reactor fig s8 microbial ecological network analysis failed to identify any direct interaction between paos and gaos fig s9 implying that the variation in ebpr activities was not directly triggered by preferential growth of gaos previous research suggested superior anaerobic carbon uptake rates of gaos at temperatures above 25 c however these apparent anaerobic carbon uptake rates were obtained under conditions where carbon sources were fed to the reactor as a pulse lópez vázquez et al 2007 to date almost all laboratory scale reactor experiments reported in the literature employed a fast feeding regime modeling studies also used the maximal anaerobic carbon uptake rates to evaluate pao gao competition lópez vázquez et al 2009 in full scale wwtps law et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 chen et al 2022 and in this work the anaerobic carbon uptake was not determined by the maximal uptake rates of both organisms but by the feeding rate table 1 the average carbon feeding rate was 1 04 1 85 mmol c g vss h in r30 and up to 2 27 mmol c g vss h in r35 higher volumetric loading rates at increased influent toc p molar ratios in r35 which also resulted in slightly higher mlss and mlvss concentrations in r35 than in r30 at an average of 1 96 versus 1 76 g l for mlss and 1 55 versus 1 26 g l for mlvss respectively during day 175 220 fig s1 which is far below the maximum carbon uptake rates of around 4 0 mmol c g vss h for ca accumulibacter and above 6 0 mmol c g vss h for ca competibacter at 35 c lópez vázquez et al 2007 table 1 the capability of ca accumulibacter to generate luxury pmf via the efflux of protons in symport with po4 3 p saunders et al 2007 burow et al 2008 qiu et al 2020 chen et al 2022 likely confers an advantage in competing with gaos at low substrate concentrations 3 3 pao kinetics and stoichiometry are not compromised at 35 c previous research suggested lower anaerobic carbon uptake rates and a higher maintenance coefficient of ca accumulibacter paos compared to ca competibacter gaos at temperatures above 20 c lópez vázquez et al 2007 regarding their aerobic metabolism ca competibacter showed no advantage over ca accumulibacter lópez vázquez et al 2008b on the contrary the aerobic carbon conversion rates of ca competibacter decreased significantly above 30 c with significantly reduced aerobic maximum yields and increased pha and oxygen requirements for glycogen production lópez vázquez et al 2008b it is still not clear whether the kinetics of aerobic metabolism in ca accumulibacter continue to increase or decline at temperatures above 30 c as it does for ca competibacter additionally the previous understanding was mainly obtained by exposing enrichment cultures obtained at 20 c to high temperatures it is essential to know whether ebpr communities growing at high temperatures have a similar response to temperature changes to test previous observations and further understand the temperature effects on ebpr at temperature above 30 c the p and carbon cycling activities in both reactors were therefore monitored via consecutive cycle studies consecutive cycle studies were performed five times throughout the long term operation on days 55 77 105 203 and 294 fig 3 generally higher p release occurred at 35 c in both reactors but pronouncedly higher p uptake rates were observed at 35 c than at 30 c in both reactors in all cases regardless of community composition showing higher aerobic p uptake activities of ca accumulibacter at 35 c fig 3 this was not restricted to the presence of specific species clades additionally higher phv formation p 0 01 was observed at 35 c than at 30 c in both reactors fig 4 gaos produce more phv than paos with either acetate or propionate as a carbon source table 2 since there was no change in the influent between the consecutive sbr cycles increased phv formation suggested an increase in carbon uptake by gaos at 35 c this hypothesis was also supported by the higher amount of glycogenolysis p 0 01 in r30 fig 4 a previous study suggested a higher anaerobic carbon uptake rate of ca competibacter with increasing temperature lópez vázquez et al 2007 in view of the slightly higher relative abundance of defluviicoccus in r35 than in r30 defluviicoccus probably also has a similar temperature dependency the aerobic carbon conversion related kinetics and stoichiometry parameters showed a less significant increase as compared to the aerobic p uptake related parameters fig 4 indicating a lower aerobic carbon metabolism of gaos compared to ca accumulibacter this result is in line with the previous finding that the aerobic metabolic efficiency of ca competibacter decreased at temperatures above 30 c lópez vázquez et al 2008b in general these results suggest that a temperature increase from 30 c to 35 c did not have a detrimental effect on the activity of ca accumulibacter in contrast the aerobic activity especially p metabolism increased significantly figs 3 and 4 this advantage in aerobic metabolism may partially offset its weakness in anaerobic metabolism as compared to gaos yet the increased anaerobic maintenance coefficient and the higher aerobic carbon consumption might have resulted in a carbon imbalance in the long term again underlining the importance of sufficient carbon supply to sustain long term activity these results explain the observation that ca accumulibacter effectively co existed with gaos at 35 c and that a higher toc p ratio benefited its competitiveness vis à vis gaos in fast feeding systems an increased toc p ratio may impair ebpr activities at high temperature as shown by ong et al 2013 owing to the higher carbon uptake rates of gaos compared to those of paos at high temperature the more carbon is added the more carbon can be taken up by gaos the slow feeding strategy effectively pegged the carbon uptake rates of gaos and paos at the same level i e the carbon feeding rate table 1 thus allowing paos to obtain sufficient carbon for ebpr in addition to the consecutive cycle study normal cycle studies were performed to monitor the changes in p and carbon cycling kinetics and stoichiometry during the long term operation table 2 cca was used to relate these parameters to the community dynamics in both reactors fig 5 generally the ca accumulibacter population was positively related to the anaerobic p release vfa uptake p vfa ratios the aerobic p uptake rates and the aerobic p uptake pha consumption p pha ratios these parameters are effective indicators of a higher ebpr activity the population of gaos was positively related to the anaerobic vfa uptake pha formation and glycogen consumption vfa uptake ratios higher values of which are indications of the thriving of gaos dechloromonas was also positively related to these factors implying that they probably performed as gaos in contrast to the high correlation between the ca accumulibacter population and the p uptake rate a low correlation was observed between the ca accumulibacter population and the p release rate owing to the slow feeding strategy which limited the carbon uptake rates and p release rates of ca accumulibacter the strategy also effectively restricted the advantage of ca competibacter in anaerobic carbon uptake we estimated the percentage of carbon taken up by paos in both systems based on the anaerobic p vfa ratios and aerobic p pha ratios our previous research suggested a p vfa ratio of a highly enriched ca accumulibacter culture at 30 c in the range of 0 51 0 59 qiu et al 2020 and based on the metabolic model the p pha ratio of ca accumulibacter is around 0 42 by comparing the anaerobic p vfa and aerobic p pha ratios observed in this work and the model values table 2 around 70 59 6 91 9 with an average of 76 3 based on the p vfa ratios or 44 3 79 7 with an average of 64 7 based on the p pha ratios of the carbon sources were taken up by ca accumulibacter in r30 in r35 it was around 50 33 8 73 1 with an average of 56 8 based on the p vfa ratios or 27 9 66 5 with an average of 44 0 based on the p pha ratio with the highest values observed at high toc p ratios fig 6 showing that the slow feeding strategy could effectively prevent excessive uptake of carbon sources by gaos even at high toc p ratios 4 conclusions the following findings will have important implications for a successful operation of ebpr systems at elevated temperatures ebpr works at 35 c a wide range of ca accumulibacter asvs closely related to those commonly found in full scale and lab scale ebpr systems operated at temperate conditions survived and proliferated for a prolonged period over 300 days suggesting that ebpr at elevated temperature might not require a highly specialized ca accumulibacter community short term temperature tests showed increased activity of ca accumulibacter especially p uptake rates when the temperature increased from 30 to 35 c suggesting that elevated temperature does not have a direct adverse effect on ca accumulibacter low richness and evenness were observed at 35 c for each specific pao gao linage showing that the ebpr community was stressed because of higher carbon and or p metabolic rates and the resultant carbon deficiency increasing the toc p ratio eased the community competition and benefited ebpr at 35 c increased carbon input might be necessary for stable ebpr at this temperature slow feeding effectively pegged the carbon uptake rates of gaos and paos at the same level which may have allowed ca accumulibacter to co exist with gaos and outcompete them at 35 c to achieve complete p removal ca competibacter was the predominant gaoat 35 c together with cluster iii defluviicoccus cluster iii defluviicoccus members effectively survived the slow feeding condition implying that their bioenergetic characteristics for carbon uptake are different from those of their tetrad forming relatives

16122,recent research has shown enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr from municipal wastewater at warmer temperatures around 30 c to be achievable in both laboratory scale reactors and full scale treatment plants in the context of a changing climate the feasibility of ebpr at even higher temperatures is of interest we operated two lab scale ebpr sequencing batch reactors for 300 days at 30 c and 35 c respectively and followed the dynamics of the communities of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and competing glycogen accumulating organisms gaos using a combination of 16s rrna gene metabarcoding quantitative pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses stable and nearly complete phosphorus p removal was achieved at 30 c similarly long term p removal was stable at 35 c with effluent po4 3 p concentrations 0 5 mg l on half of all monitored days diverse and abundant candidatus accumulibacter amplicon sequence variants were closely related to those found in temperate environments suggesting that ebpr at this temperature does not require a highly specialized pao community a slow feeding strategy effectively limited the carbon uptake rates of gaos allowing paos to outcompete gaos at both temperatures candidatus competibacter was the main gao along with cluster iii defluviicoccus members these organisms withstood the slow feeding regime suggesting that their bioenergetic characteristics of carbon uptake differ from those of their tetrad forming relatives comparative cycle studies revealed higher carbon and p cycling activity of ca accumulibacter when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 35 c implying that the lowered p removal performance at 35 c was not a direct effect of temperature but a result of higher metabolic rates of carbon and or p utilization of paos and gaos the resultant carbon deficiency and escalated community competition an increase in the toc to po4 3 p ratio from 25 1 to 40 1 effectively eased the carbon deficiency and benefited paos in general a slow feeding strategy and sufficiently high carbon input benefited a high and stable ebpr at 35 c representing basic conditions suitable for full scale treatment plants experiencing higher water temperatures graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal global warming polyphosphate accumulating organisms glycogen accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter carbon source 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a process widely employed for p removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps because it is relatively cheap and sustainable and is desirable for downstream nutrient recovery garcía martín et al 2006 simoes et al 2020 roy et al 2021 despite the advantages its application in warm climates has long been considered unfavorable owing to observations that the functional bacteria i e polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in the process were outcompeted by their rivals glycogen accumulating organisms gaos at high temperatures 25 c whang and park 2002 panswad et al 2003 lópez vázquez et al 2009 deteriorated ebpr performance and the dominance of gaos were reported at full scale wwtps with average yearly temperatures above 25 c wong et al 2005 cao 2011 seasonal deterioration in ebpr performance as wastewater temperature increased during the summer has also been reported gu et al 2005 in a pilot scale membrane bioreactor employing the university of cape town uct configuration for raw municipal wastewater treatment total phosphorus removal dropped from 95 to below 50 when the temperature increased from 24 c to above 35 c at temperatures above 30 c volatile fatty acids vfas were completely utilized however phosphorus was not released suggesting competition with gaos sayi ucar et al 2015 in batch tests the maximum acetate uptake rates of candidatus accumulibacter paos and candidatus competibacter gaos were similar at temperatures 20 c brdjanovic et al 1997 with increasing temperature the rates of ca competibacter continued to increase following the extended arrhenius equation lópez vázquez et al 2007 while those of ca accumulibacter remained relatively constant in the range of 20 30 c additionally significantly increased anaerobic maintenance coefficients were observed for ca accumulibacter these results helped to explain the ebpr instability reported in wwtps treating warm effluents lópez vázquez et al 2007 however these experiments were performed by exposing the enrichment culture obtained at 20 c to other temperatures and hence it is not clear if the observed short term effects were partially a stress response by ca accumulibacter to acute temperature changes on the other hand there have been efforts to explore the long term feasibility of ebpr at temperatures 25 c robust ebpr was obtained at 30 c for an extended period 100 days by applying a short ebpr cycle freitas et al 2009 selectively removing biomass from the top of the sludge bed allowed to maintain complete p removal for nearly three months in an aerobic granular sludge system operated at 30 c winkler et al 2011 long term ebpr 160 days stability has been demonstrated in a lab scale reactor at 28 c in the absence of a short ebpr cycle or selective sludge removal ong et al 2014 however as the temperature increased to 32 c ebpr activities were significantly compromised with a reduction in the average abundance based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analyses of ca accumulibacter shen et al 2017 further showed that having multiple anaerobic aerobic stages in one ebpr cycle aided ebpr at 30 c in addition to these laboratory scale studies which included either specific operational control or the presence of a specifically enriched pao community there are reports of stable ebpr in full scale systems in warm climates law et al 2016 cao et al 2017 cokro et al 2017 the presence of gaos had no apparent effect on the long term stability of ebpr at 30 c law et al 2016 a recent field study in singapore further showed a wide range of paos exhibiting high micro diversity in carbon usage which might be important for the observed ebpr stability in these full scale wwtps operating at water temperatures of 28 32 c qiu et al 2019 even higher water temperatures are expected due to global warming the global surface temperatures are likely to rise by up to 4 8 c by the end of this century in a high emission scenario intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2018 more pronounced temperature increases have been observed in highly urbanized areas for example temperatures in singapore have risen at a rate 0 25 c per decade since 1948 and currently around 0 5 c per decade more than double that of the global average during the same period meteorological service singapore 2021 the aim of this work was to explore the feasibility of ebpr at 35 c two lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in parallel at 30 c and 35 c respectively for over 300 days we employed a slow feeding strategy to mimic the operating conditions typically found in the field qiu et al 2019 with a mixture of acetate and propionate as carbon source consecutive cycle studies involved switching temperatures between 30 c and 35 c to investigate the effect of temperature on carbon and p transformation kinetics and stoichiometry the fine scale dynamics of the bacterial community was monitored using 16s rrna gene metabarcoding fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and qpcr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbr operation two sbrs with a working volume of 1 59 l each were inoculated with activated sludge from a local wwtp in singapore with an ambient water temperature of 28 31 c qiu et al 2019 a slow feeding strategy mimicking the actual feeding conditions in full scale plants was applied for reactor operation tu and schuler 2013 qiu et al 2020 tian et al 2022 additionally a mixture of acetate and propionate molar ratio of 8 4 1 was used as a carbon source acetate and propionate acetate predominantly have been reported as the major vfas in municipal wastewater in different geographical regions lópez vázquez et al 2008a qiu et al 2019 the sbrs were operated with 6 h cycles including a 60 min feeding a 20 min anaerobic a 180 min aerobic and a 100 min settling decant stage in each cycle 0 74 l of synthetic wastewater containing 193 8 mg l acetate 17 2 mg l propionate and 8 8 mg l po4 3 p detailed in the supplementary materials was introduced into the reactor with a resultant toc p molar ratio of 25 1 two reactors were operated in parallel at 30 c r30 and 35 c r35 respectively temperature control was achieved using a proportional integral derivative temperature controller connected to heating jackets wrapping the reactors the hrt and srt in both reactors were 12 9 h and 25 d respectively the ph was automatically controlled at 6 80 7 50 by using a m200 transmitter mettler toledo switzerland connected to an acid base 0 5 m hcl naoh dosing system the do was maintained at 0 8 1 2 mg l during the aerobic phase by using the same transmitter connected to a solenoid valve in the aeration system during days 175 220 sodium acetate and propionic acid concentrations in the feed supplementary materials for r35 were increased 1 6 times resultant toc p molar ratio of 40 1 which was reduced to 1 2 times toc p molar ratio of 30 1 from day 220 onwards until the end of the experiment the resultant mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor suspended volatile solids mlvss concentrations were 1 57 2 00 and 1 07 1 57 g l respectively in r30 and 1 51 2 15 and 1 25 1 93 g l respectively in r35 during the experiment fig s1 2 2 consecutive cycle study a consecutive cycle study was performed on days 55 77 105 203 and 294 to investigate the effect of temperature on the carbon and p cycling kinetics and stoichiometry cycle studies were done in adjacent sbr cycles in both reactors with the first cycle at their respective original temperature i e r30 at 30 c and r35 at 35 c in the subsequent cycle the temperature in the two reactors was switched i e in r30 to 35 c and in r35 to 30 c this strategy allowed the interrogation of temperature effects in both reactors by effectively discounting any potential bias arising from the acute response of the microbial communities to temperature changes in the cycle study filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters and activated sludge samples were collected at regular time intervals for po4 3 p vfas polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and glycogen analyses 2 3 chemical analysis po4 3 p levels were measured using test kits hach usa following standard methods as were mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor suspended volatile solids mlvss concentrations fig s1 apha 1999 acetate and propionate concentrations were measured using a gas chromatograph shimadzu

fluorescence in situ hybridization activated sludge samples collected from both reactors during the operation were immediately fixed using 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 c for 2 h the fixed samples were washed with 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution and stored in a mixture of 1 pbs and ethanol 1 1 at 20 c before fish analysis microorganisms of interest were detected using eubmix eub338 eub338ii

deposited in the ncbi database under the bioproject no prjna807832 a 16s rrna gene clone library was prepared on certain genomic dna samples r30 day5 r35 day5 r30 day105 and r35 day105 for the recovery of the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of dominant ca accumulibacter taxa after pcr amplification with primer set 27f 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and 1492r 5 ggttaccttgttacgactt 3 qiu et al 2013 phylogenic analysis mega x kumar et al 2018 was performed to compare the ca accumulibacter sequences in the clone library and those from metabarcoding to further confirm their phylogenic relationships with existing ca accumulibacter sequences additionally qpcr was used to analyze the clade level distribution of ca accumulibacter according to he et al 2007 see supplementary materials for additional information about 16s rrna gene metabarcoding and qpcr 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 the alpha diversity calculation was performed using r packages hillr version 0 5 0 chao et al 2014 canonical correlation analysis cca was performed to relate the ebpr kinetics and stoichiometry obtained in cycle studies and the community dynamics using r packages vegan version 2 5 6 a permutation test was performed with function anova cca to assess the significance of cca microbial ecological network analysis was done using cytoscape version 3 7 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 ebpr works at 35 c with influent toc and po4 3 p concentrations of 86 and 8 8 mg l respectively toc p molar ratio of 25 1 r30 the reactor operated at 30 c showed high and stable ebpr performance for 300 days fig 1 a p release was maintained at 35 mg l and complete p removal was achieved on most days a technical failure occurred on day 35 resulting in no carbon source being supplied for two days good ebpr activity was restored immediately after the system had returned to normal operation showing the high resilience of the system to unexpected disturbances previous studies reported significantly reduced ebpr activity at 32 c ong et al 2014 similarly shen et al 2017 observed fluctuating ebpr performance at 30 c using a multi cycle operational strategy it is possible that the slow feeding strategy used in this work benefited a high and stable ebpr at 30 c discussed later as for carbon sources a modeling study suggested paos could outcompete gaos at 30 c when fed with acetate and propionate at a molar ratio of 3 1 compared to a ratio of 1 1 or pure acetate or propionate lópez vázquez et al 2009 similarly acetate fed and propionate fed bioreactors operating at 30 c displayed higher and more stable ebpr with acetate as feed shen et al 2017 wang et al 2020 further showed that propionate was always the preferred carbon source of ca accumulibacter enriched with acetate or propionate at high temperature but the addition of this carbon source alone led to aerobic glycogen replenishment instead of high p uptake in conclusion a mixture of vfas dominated by acetate appears more desirable than one dominated by propionate to achieve ebpr at high temperatures complete p removal was also achieved in r35 the reactor operated at 35 c during the first two weeks fig 1b the same technical fault as for r30 occurred on day 35 and the following two day starvation period had no lasting impact on r35 ebpr activity was restored within two days complete p removal was maintained during days 91 109 until there was a sudden drop in p release and uptake activities from 40 to 0 mg l within a day the reason for this decrease in ebpr activity is unknown and may not be a result of gao competition since the relative abundances of gaos also decreased significantly during this period fig 2 the reactor r35 did not recover on its own from this complete loss of ebpr activity days 109 119 fig 1b re seeding with waste sludge collected from r30 instead of fresh field sludge for the sake of experimental consistency and comparability of the two reactors led to a restoration of ebpr activities although at a lower level p release and uptake values around 10 mg l days 135 175 an increase in the influent toc concentration to 137 mg l toc p ratio of 40 1 led to a rapid increase in ebpr activities complete p removal was achieved on day 187 and maintained until day 219 when the influent toc was reduced to 103 mg l toc p ratio of 30 1 after a period of low level fluctuation near complete p removal was achieved again day 285 and was maintained until the end of the experiment day 316 in general although the overall performance was lower compared to r30 appreciable ebpr activities were achieved in r35 for an extended period near complete p removal was achieved effluent po4 3 p 0 5 mg l more than half the time the present study is the first report of sustained ebpr at this temperature although the process stability and reliability need to be further assessed at different scales although vfas are major components of dissolved organics in municipal wastewater lópez vázquez et al 2008a a diverse range of carbon sources can contribute to ebpr in the field qiu et al 2019 diversified carbon sources may result in increased diversity of the ebpr microbial community which is expected to benefit system stability 3 2 community composition and dynamics in the activated sludge inoculum ca accumulibacter was the predominant pao at a relative abundance of 0 76 followed by tetrasphaera at 0 3 ca competibacter 2 12 and defluviicoccus 1 23 were the predominated gaos followed by micropruina 0 05 during reactor operation paos and gaos were top ranked community members in both reactors fig s2 ca accumulibacter remained as the predominant pao with relative abundance values significantly increased in both reactors up to 16 0 and 6 88 in r30 and r35 respectively tetrasphaera disappeared within the first month no microlunatus phosphovorus nakamura et al 1995 ca methylophosphatis singleton et al 2021 ca obscuribacter soo et al 2014 or ca accumulimonas nguyen et al 2012 putative paos were detected in the seed sludge or during reactor operation ca competibacter remained the predominant gao 2 12 11 5 in r30 and 1 35 24 4 in r35 followed by defluviicoccus 0 25 4 73 in r30 and 0 70 6 16 in r35 ca contendobacter a member of the ca competibacter lineage mcilroy et al 2014 appeared in both reactors only during a limited period days 98 133 in r30 and days 119 203 in r35 micropruina was only present in the seed sludge 0 05 no propionivibrio albertsen et al 2016 related gaos were detected in either reactor despite the different ranking in relative abundances most 23 out of 30 dominant genera were shared between the two reactors detailed dynamics of each major pao gao lineage are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 ca accumulibacter in the reactors are closely related to those commonly found in temperate systems thirty nine ca accumulibacter amplicon sequence variants asvs each asv was uniquely numbered were detected 27 and 28 of which occurred in r30 and r35 respectively fig 2a and b the two reactors shared 16 asvs with 9 of them asvs 11 23 28 32 36 38 73 87 353 being detected in 4 samples in both reactors representing the core ca accumulibacter community among these 9 core asvs 6 asvs 23 28 32 36 38 353 were originally present in the seed sludge the remaining 3 asvs 11 73 and 87 started to emerge in both reactors from day 5 implying that they were probably also present in the seed sludge but at undetectable relative abundances all these asvs flourished at the beginning of the experiment concomitant with the presence of desirable ebpr activities in both reactors during the first few weeks fig 1 suggesting that the operation strategy employed in this study effectively retained the majority of ca accumulibacter species originally present in the field which is key to sustained ebpr activities in the long term additionally these results demonstrated that most ca accumulibacter in the full scale sludge could effectively survive an elevated temperature of 35 c despite the extended presence of these core asvs their relative abundances and status of predominance differed in the two reactors fig 2a and b in r30 asvs 11 23 28 32 36 38 stayed at comparable relative abundances ranging from 0 07 to 1 57 later asv11 started to dominate until the end of operation asv11 is closely related 100 identity to ca accumulibacter clade iif strain scelse 1 qiu et al 2020 similarly ong et al 2014 reported the predominance of clade iif ca accumulibacter in a bioreactor at 32 c it seems that certain metabolic characteristics enable members of this clade to dominate at high temperatures qiu et al 2020 in contrast asv11 was less abundant in r35 throughout the operation the sudden disruption of ebpr activities in r35 and subsequent inoculation with r30 sludge on day 119 presented an opportunity to test the growth potential of asv11 at 35 c its decreasing relative abundance to 0 1 suggested that asv 11 may not have a significant growth advantage at 35 c compared to r30 r35 exhibited dominance of single asvs during each period of operation which might be a reason for the lower ebpr stability in r35 than in r30 fig 1 asv36 prevailed during the first 50 days followed by asv23 and asv11 and then asv32 and asv73 a whole genus phylogenetic analysis suggested that these asvs are widely distributed in the ca accumulibacter lineage table s1 and fig s3 for example asv36 is closely related 100 identity to clade iid sequences ef565158 ef565159 recovered from a full scale wwtp in us asv 32 is closely related 100 identity to clade iib sequence ab736230 from a lab scale ebpr system operated at 20 4 c satoh et al 2013 asv87 is closely affiliated 100 identity with a clade iif member jq726366 from an sbr operated at 20 c kim et al 2013 and asv28 is closely related 100 identity to clade iic sequence kj807999 from a full scale wwtp in china the closed genome of asv28 was recovered using nanopore long read sequencing as reported in our previous work arumugam et al 2021 a clone library was established to recover the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of the dominant asvs fig s3 subsequent phylogenetic analysis supported their identification qpcr analysis was also employed to analyze the clade level distribution and dynamics fig s4 no clade i member was detected in either reactor the dynamics of clades iib iic and iid generally agree with the 16s rrna gene based identification of these dominant asvs collectively these results suggested that a diverse range of ca accumulibacter members could survive at 35 c these asvs are not unique but have also been found in laboratory and full scale ebpr systems in temperate climates implying that successful ebpr at elevated temperatures does not require a highly specialized ca accumulibacter community 3 2 2 rare ca compatibacter asvs in the seed sludge thrived in reactors together with defluviicoccus cluster iii members fifty four ca competibacter sequences were detected 40 of which were found in each reactor fig 2c and d similar to what was observed for ca accumulibacter multiple asvs 1 12 16 24 42 dominated r30 for the first 150 days and asv 22 proliferated during the remainder of reactor operation while single asvs dominated r35 during each period of operation asvs 1 29 and 124 different from the core ca accumulibacter asvs which were all derived from the seed sludge a great number of ca competibacter asvs were present in the seed sludge but decreased in relative abundance in both reactors after initially thriving during the first 100 days the remaining predominant asvs e g asv 29 and asv 124 in r35 and asv 22 in r30 had not been detected in the seed sludge they appeared only after day 77 no closely related relatives of these asvs were found in the ncbi database the best matches were lr650365 94 12 identity to asv 29 hq467835 96 73 identity to asv 124 and dq201883 96 73 identity to asv 22 in contrast close relatives of asvs which dominated the seed sludge were commonly detected in temperate wwtps e g the top three most dominant ca competibacter asvs in the seed sludge asv16 asv1 and asv132 showed 100 98 91 and 99 64 similarity to sequences kf428043 wang et al 2014a hq476545 kim et al 2013 and kj807854 wang et al 2014b respectively since ca competibacter in full scale systems have not been as well studied it is reasonable that no close relatives were found in databases for these asvs that were rare in the seed sludge but thrived in both reactors since the same was observed in r30 and r35 we cannot exclude the possibility that lab scale reactors tend to selectively benefit certain rare ca competibacter asvs in the long term nielsen et al 2019 overall a higher predominance of ca competibacter was observed at 35 c fig 2 which corresponded to the lower ebpr performance of r35 fig 1 defluviicoccus related gaos showed lower relative abundance compared to ca competibacter fig 2e and f asv 8 dominated r30 with other asvs staying at low levels throughout the operation the dominant asv in r35 was also asv 8 before day 112 afterwards asv80 and asv202 increased but then declined as the ebpr activity recovered to a high level fig 1 asv 8 is closely related 100 identity to ab445107 nittami et al 2009 a cluster iii member having a nostocoida limicola like filamentous morphology commonly found in full scale systems mcilroy et al 2010 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 chen et al 2022 fish analysis confirmed their presence and morphology fig s5 asv 80 showed 99 63 similarity to dq250533 a cluster ii member having the typical tetrad forming morphology wong and liu 2007 fish analysis allowed their detection in r35 together with asv 202 cocci in clumps fig s5j neither asv 80 nor asv 202 were detected in the seed sludge their proliferation in r35 coincided with reduced ebpr activity fig 1 and a reduction in the relative abundance of ca competibacter fig 2d which could have opened up an ecological niche tetrad forming defluviicoccus were believed to be unable to compete with ca accumulibacter under low substrate conditions tu and schuler 2013 due to their inability to effectively take up low concentration substrates burow et al 2008 recent research further suggested lower uptake rates of vfas of defluviicoccus vanus cluster ii member than ca accumulibacter at 30 c wang et al 2020 their decrease after the restoration of the ebpr activities verified these hypotheses however the ability of cluster iii member asv 8 to co exist with ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter in the long term under the slow feeding condition suggested that they are metabolically different from their cluster ii relatives in terms of carbon uptake bioenergetics chen et al 2022 apart from these well characterized paos and gaos dechloromonas related sequences were also detected in both reactors fig 3 g and h asvs in r30 showed high inter lineage dynamics in the first 125 days alternating predominance was observed for asvs 10 67 112 and 166 in r35 a significant predominance of single asvs 10 and 21 was observed during different stages of operation similar to the patterns observed for ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter communities recent research allowed the identification of two novel dechloromonas related paos in full scale wwtps petriglieri et al 2021 in r35 asvs 10 and 21 were present during days 108 119 when there was no detectable ebpr activity suggesting that both asvs acted as gaos we did not find well characterized relatives of other asvs in the database the highest similarity score was 97 45 which is between asv67 and candidatus dechloromonas phosphoritropha midas s 96 petriglieri et al 2021 their ecological roles in the systems need further confirmation 3 2 3 regulation of pao gao interactions via controlled organic carbon supply benefits a higher ebpr stability at elevated temperature almost all core asvs in each lineage both paos and gaos were thriving fig s6 and the appearance of rare species originally undetectable in the seed sludge suggests that the operational conditions including the composition of the feed in this work effectively benefited the growth of each community hence an elevated temperature of 35 c does not present an obstacle for any of these single asvs to survive and multiply within each lineage of gaos and paos certain asvs fared better in r35 than in r30 with lower community richness reflected by the hill number 1d and evenness reflected by 2d fig s7 implying that both pao and gao communities were stressed at 35 c previous research suggested that both paos and gaos have faster carbon metabolic rates and maintenance coefficients as the temperature increases brdjanovic et al 1997 lópez vázquez et al 2007 2008b table 1 this would result in increased carbon requirements of the ebpr community at 35 c causing stress due to a carbon deficiency to test this hypothesis the toc p ratio in r35 was increased from 25 1 to 40 1 on day 175 fig 1 a subsequent increase in ebpr activity was observed together with increases in the diversity and evenness of all respective lineage members to values comparable to those in r30 fig s7 supporting the notion that the supply of carbon was a limiting factor in r35 the lower relative abundance of paos and higher abundance of gaos at 35 c suggests that paos are more sensitive to carbon deficient conditions increasing the concentration of carbon sources effectively allowed ca accumulibacter to outcompete ca competibacter in terms of relative abundance by the end of the experiment fig 2b and d there was no clear anticorrelation between relative abundance values of paos and gaos in either reactor fig s8 microbial ecological network analysis failed to identify any direct interaction between paos and gaos fig s9 implying that the variation in ebpr activities was not directly triggered by preferential growth of gaos previous research suggested superior anaerobic carbon uptake rates of gaos at temperatures above 25 c however these apparent anaerobic carbon uptake rates were obtained under conditions where carbon sources were fed to the reactor as a pulse lópez vázquez et al 2007 to date almost all laboratory scale reactor experiments reported in the literature employed a fast feeding regime modeling studies also used the maximal anaerobic carbon uptake rates to evaluate pao gao competition lópez vázquez et al 2009 in full scale wwtps law et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 chen et al 2022 and in this work the anaerobic carbon uptake was not determined by the maximal uptake rates of both organisms but by the feeding rate table 1 the average carbon feeding rate was 1 04 1 85 mmol c g vss h in r30 and up to 2 27 mmol c g vss h in r35 higher volumetric loading rates at increased influent toc p molar ratios in r35 which also resulted in slightly higher mlss and mlvss concentrations in r35 than in r30 at an average of 1 96 versus 1 76 g l for mlss and 1 55 versus 1 26 g l for mlvss respectively during day 175 220 fig s1 which is far below the maximum carbon uptake rates of around 4 0 mmol c g vss h for ca accumulibacter and above 6 0 mmol c g vss h for ca competibacter at 35 c lópez vázquez et al 2007 table 1 the capability of ca accumulibacter to generate luxury pmf via the efflux of protons in symport with po4 3 p saunders et al 2007 burow et al 2008 qiu et al 2020 chen et al 2022 likely confers an advantage in competing with gaos at low substrate concentrations 3 3 pao kinetics and stoichiometry are not compromised at 35 c previous research suggested lower anaerobic carbon uptake rates and a higher maintenance coefficient of ca accumulibacter paos compared to ca competibacter gaos at temperatures above 20 c lópez vázquez et al 2007 regarding their aerobic metabolism ca competibacter showed no advantage over ca accumulibacter lópez vázquez et al 2008b on the contrary the aerobic carbon conversion rates of ca competibacter decreased significantly above 30 c with significantly reduced aerobic maximum yields and increased pha and oxygen requirements for glycogen production lópez vázquez et al 2008b it is still not clear whether the kinetics of aerobic metabolism in ca accumulibacter continue to increase or decline at temperatures above 30 c as it does for ca competibacter additionally the previous understanding was mainly obtained by exposing enrichment cultures obtained at 20 c to high temperatures it is essential to know whether ebpr communities growing at high temperatures have a similar response to temperature changes to test previous observations and further understand the temperature effects on ebpr at temperature above 30 c the p and carbon cycling activities in both reactors were therefore monitored via consecutive cycle studies consecutive cycle studies were performed five times throughout the long term operation on days 55 77 105 203 and 294 fig 3 generally higher p release occurred at 35 c in both reactors but pronouncedly higher p uptake rates were observed at 35 c than at 30 c in both reactors in all cases regardless of community composition showing higher aerobic p uptake activities of ca accumulibacter at 35 c fig 3 this was not restricted to the presence of specific species clades additionally higher phv formation p 0 01 was observed at 35 c than at 30 c in both reactors fig 4 gaos produce more phv than paos with either acetate or propionate as a carbon source table 2 since there was no change in the influent between the consecutive sbr cycles increased phv formation suggested an increase in carbon uptake by gaos at 35 c this hypothesis was also supported by the higher amount of glycogenolysis p 0 01 in r30 fig 4 a previous study suggested a higher anaerobic carbon uptake rate of ca competibacter with increasing temperature lópez vázquez et al 2007 in view of the slightly higher relative abundance of defluviicoccus in r35 than in r30 defluviicoccus probably also has a similar temperature dependency the aerobic carbon conversion related kinetics and stoichiometry parameters showed a less significant increase as compared to the aerobic p uptake related parameters fig 4 indicating a lower aerobic carbon metabolism of gaos compared to ca accumulibacter this result is in line with the previous finding that the aerobic metabolic efficiency of ca competibacter decreased at temperatures above 30 c lópez vázquez et al 2008b in general these results suggest that a temperature increase from 30 c to 35 c did not have a detrimental effect on the activity of ca accumulibacter in contrast the aerobic activity especially p metabolism increased significantly figs 3 and 4 this advantage in aerobic metabolism may partially offset its weakness in anaerobic metabolism as compared to gaos yet the increased anaerobic maintenance coefficient and the higher aerobic carbon consumption might have resulted in a carbon imbalance in the long term again underlining the importance of sufficient carbon supply to sustain long term activity these results explain the observation that ca accumulibacter effectively co existed with gaos at 35 c and that a higher toc p ratio benefited its competitiveness vis à vis gaos in fast feeding systems an increased toc p ratio may impair ebpr activities at high temperature as shown by ong et al 2013 owing to the higher carbon uptake rates of gaos compared to those of paos at high temperature the more carbon is added the more carbon can be taken up by gaos the slow feeding strategy effectively pegged the carbon uptake rates of gaos and paos at the same level i e the carbon feeding rate table 1 thus allowing paos to obtain sufficient carbon for ebpr in addition to the consecutive cycle study normal cycle studies were performed to monitor the changes in p and carbon cycling kinetics and stoichiometry during the long term operation table 2 cca was used to relate these parameters to the community dynamics in both reactors fig 5 generally the ca accumulibacter population was positively related to the anaerobic p release vfa uptake p vfa ratios the aerobic p uptake rates and the aerobic p uptake pha consumption p pha ratios these parameters are effective indicators of a higher ebpr activity the population of gaos was positively related to the anaerobic vfa uptake pha formation and glycogen consumption vfa uptake ratios higher values of which are indications of the thriving of gaos dechloromonas was also positively related to these factors implying that they probably performed as gaos in contrast to the high correlation between the ca accumulibacter population and the p uptake rate a low correlation was observed between the ca accumulibacter population and the p release rate owing to the slow feeding strategy which limited the carbon uptake rates and p release rates of ca accumulibacter the strategy also effectively restricted the advantage of ca competibacter in anaerobic carbon uptake we estimated the percentage of carbon taken up by paos in both systems based on the anaerobic p vfa ratios and aerobic p pha ratios our previous research suggested a p vfa ratio of a highly enriched ca accumulibacter culture at 30 c in the range of 0 51 0 59 qiu et al 2020 and based on the metabolic model the p pha ratio of ca accumulibacter is around 0 42 by comparing the anaerobic p vfa and aerobic p pha ratios observed in this work and the model values table 2 around 70 59 6 91 9 with an average of 76 3 based on the p vfa ratios or 44 3 79 7 with an average of 64 7 based on the p pha ratios of the carbon sources were taken up by ca accumulibacter in r30 in r35 it was around 50 33 8 73 1 with an average of 56 8 based on the p vfa ratios or 27 9 66 5 with an average of 44 0 based on the p pha ratio with the highest values observed at high toc p ratios fig 6 showing that the slow feeding strategy could effectively prevent excessive uptake of carbon sources by gaos even at high toc p ratios 4 conclusions the following findings will have important implications for a successful operation of ebpr systems at elevated temperatures ebpr works at 35 c a wide range of ca accumulibacter asvs closely related to those commonly found in full scale and lab scale ebpr systems operated at temperate conditions survived and proliferated for a prolonged period over 300 days suggesting that ebpr at elevated temperature might not require a highly specialized ca accumulibacter community short term temperature tests showed increased activity of ca accumulibacter especially p uptake rates when the temperature increased from 30 to 35 c suggesting that elevated temperature does not have a direct adverse effect on ca accumulibacter low richness and evenness were observed at 35 c for each specific pao gao linage showing that the ebpr community was stressed because of higher carbon and or p metabolic rates and the resultant carbon deficiency increasing the toc p ratio eased the community competition and benefited ebpr at 35 c increased carbon input might be necessary for stable ebpr at this temperature slow feeding effectively pegged the carbon uptake rates of gaos and paos at the same level which may have allowed ca accumulibacter to co exist with gaos and outcompete them at 35 c to achieve complete p removal ca competibacter was the predominant gaoat 35 c together with cluster iii defluviicoccus cluster iii defluviicoccus members effectively survived the slow feeding condition implying that their bioenergetic characteristics for carbon uptake are different from those of their tetrad forming relatives

16123,anammox process has been widely regarded as an energy efficient method for sludge digestion filtrate treatment however the complex high strength organics in the filtrate especially of anaerobic digestion after thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp ad brings serious threat to anammox bacteria and the high nitrate residue in effluent remains another significant barrier in operation in this study a novel double line anammox mediated system integrating the partial nitrification anammox pna with partial denitrification anammox pda processes in separately sequencing batch reactors sbrs was developed to polish the thp ad filtrate when the real thp ad filtrate 1946 5 mg nh4 n l 2076 0 mg cod l was fed to the front pna reactor sbrpna with 5 fold dilution effluent total nitrogen tn remained at 93 0 mg l notably the final effluent tn was effectively polished to as low as 8 8 mg l by the following pda reactor sbrpda which was fed with the sbrpna effluent and real domestic wastewater 71 0 mg nh4 n l 209 1 mg cod l more severe inhibition on anammox activity was observed in sbrpna rather than sbrpda by refractory organics in filtrate fortunately it could be alleviated with the enhanced degradability of particulate organics and aromatic protein like compounds attributed to the enrichment of class anaerolineae in both sbrpna and sbrpda this further stimulated the electron donor supply for pda process with much lower external carbon source demand 16s rrna sequencing analysis revealed that candidatus brocadia as dominant anammox bacteria were efficiently enriched in both sbrpna and sbrpda indicating its unexpected toughness and adaptability to the complex organic compounds in thp ad filtrate overall this study suggested that the novel double line anammox would be a promising alternative for cost efficient nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater containing complex organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thp ad filtrate domestic wastewater complex organic matter anammox partial nitrification pn partial denitrification pd 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a promising approach for stabilization and volume reduction of waste activated sludge was along with additional biogas energy generation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as the general by product of ad digestion filtrate has high nutrient loads and is usually considered to recycle to the mainstream line which accounts for 1 of the mainstream flow but 15 20 of the nitrogen loading lackner et al 2014 with the optimization of sludge management thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp of was has been developed and successfully applied prior to ad unit currently aims to improve methane production and sludge dewaterability however the filtrate of thp ad with higher concentration of nh4 n 1688 3000 mg l and recalcitrant cod 1505 4242 mg l compared to that of ad brings significant pressure on the mainline and causes a corresponding increase in the toxicological risks and operation cost cao et al 2021 han et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the partial nitrification combined with anammox pna process is an attractive and energy efficient option to treat digestion filtrate separately within sidestream line it saves 100 organic carbon consumption and 60 aeration demand when compared to conventional nitrification denitrification joss et al 2009 lackner et al 2014 nevertheless one of the challenges hindering the sidestream pna is the excessive no3 generated from anammox bacteria itself in practice the effluent of pna process treating thp ad filtrate usually contains no3 n in a range of 75 0 172 7 mg l cao et al 2021 driessen et al 2020 ochs et al 2021 thereby considerable organic carbon e g 1 9 3 3 kg methanol kg no3 n is required for the latter denitrification peng et al 2007 theis and hicks 2012 recently the integration of partial denitrification pd no3 no2 and anammox referred to as pda process opened a new door for cost efficient no3 and nh4 removal kalyuzhnyi and gladchenko 2009 zhang et al 2022 in this process no3 reduction ends in no2 with 60 saving in organics demand the no2 and nh4 are removed via anammox subsequently the no3 generated by anammox in pda process can be eliminated in situ within the nitrite loop based on these principles the single stage pda process has been developed to simultaneously treat no3 contained wastewater e g secondary effluent of wwtps and domestic wastewater mainly contained nh4 and biodegradable organics with the effluent tn 5 mg l cao et al 2019a du et al 2020 therefore the double line anammox mediated system by integrating the pna with pda would have a promising application prospect in realizing advanced nitrogen removal from sideline thp ad filtrate by introducing mainline domestic wastewater importantly the organic matters in thp ad filtrate desired much attention considerable particulate organics and refractory organics such as humic substances generated during thp ad process would affect the activity of functional bacteria liang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 found that particulate and collide organics contained in digestion filtrate had negative impacts on aob cao et al 2021 revealed that humic acid like fulvic acid like substances and building blocks were the major organic compounds in thp ad filtrate and aob lost its activity by 34 1 when exposed to 10 thp ad filtrate while anammox bacteria was completely suppressed at 60 thp ad filtrate wang et al 2021 reported anammox bacteria could be severely inhibited by the organics with molecular weight of 10 30 kda in digestion filtrate on the other hand there would be small fraction of these complex organic compounds can be degraded in pna process resulting in growth of denitrifiers with the degradation products as the electron donor wang et al 2019 as for the pda system the organics composition is particularly important since it can affect the no2 n accumulation characteristics and then the anammox activity shi et al 2020 thus organics evolution along with the double line anammox system and the crucial roles of complex organics on nitrogen removal efficiency and robustness needs further investigation therefore in this study real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater were used to investigate a novel double line anammox by integrating pna and pda processes for ultra deep nitrogen removal the important and multiple roles of complex organics involved in thp ad filtrate on the metabolism and communities of functional bacteria were analyzed the role of key groups for enhancing biodegradation of particulate organics and refractory organics was explored finally the microbial interactions between heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers anammox and denitrifiers were addressed providing the potential alternative for cost efficient treatment of wastewater containing high strength ammonia and complex organic matter 2 methods and materials 2 1 seeding sludge and feeding wastewater sbrpna and sbrpda without biofilm were inoculated with sludge from two parent bioreactors of pna and pda respectively li et al 2021b before treating real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater sbrpna and sbrpda were operated with synthetic wastewater 400 mg l nh4 n for sbrpna 50 mg l nh4 n and 50 mg l no3 n for sbrpda for adaption with nitrogen removal efficiency nre both 80 3 the thp ad filtrate was collected from the thp ad process effluent in gaobeidian wwtp beijing china and the domestic wastewater was taken from a septic tank of 30 m3 in the residential area of beijing university of technology table 1 2 2 reactors and operation each cycle of sbrpna 10 l consisted of four steps feeding with 5 0 l diluted thp ad filtrate diluted 5 folds with tap water aerobic reaction

treatment and it has been reported to be efficient for pda process according to previous study du et al 2017 the temperature was maintained at 28 2 c in both reactors the operation was divided into three phases based on the pna performance the operational parameters was shown in table s1 2 3 analytical methods measurement of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were analyzed using a lachat

with glucose as the standard the do and ph were monitored by a ph oxi 340i analyzer wtw company germany the assessments of the maximum specific activity of aob nob and anammox bacteria were conducted according to previous studies du et al 2020 liu et al 2017 2 4 cod fractionation cod can be divided into four fractions particulate cod p cod large colloidal cod lc cod small colloidal cod sc cod and soluble cod s cod the sum of these four fractions is the total cod t cod the liquid samples were firstly passed through 10 20 μm paper filters to remove the suspended solids and measured as t cod t

al 2020 3 results 3 1 efficiency of the double line system for thp ad filtrate treatment in phase ⅰ days 1 10 the performance of nitrogen removal in pna process was restricted when the real thp ad filtrate was introduced nh4 n of 36 2 mg l and no3 n of 137 4 mg l were observed in the effluent with the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption rapidly increased to 0 51 which indicated the deterioration of both pn and anammox processes fig 1 although full nitrification from nh4 to no3 occurred in sbrpna the following sbrpda could further polish the sbrpna effluent with the final effluent tn of 20 6 mg l notably flocs in sbrpna with a diameter of 200 μm exhibited high nob activity while particles larger than 200 μm showed more active aob and anammox bacteria metabolism fig s1 therefore in phase ⅱ days 11 36 two optimization strategies were applied in sbrpna for performance promotion one was elevating the dilution ratio of thp ad filtrate in influent from 5 time to 10 time to reduce the inhibitory organic components in thp ad filtrate and the other was discharging flocs by shortening the settling time of sbrpna to 5 min these strategies contributed to an nre gradually up to 71 4 and an effluent no3 n down to 92 1 mg l of sbrpna the final effluent tn of the pna pda system decreased to 6 7 mg l then which clearly demonstrated the stable performance and high contribution to total nitrogen removal of sbrpda in phase ⅲ days 37 105 the optimization strategies were suspended sbrpna operated in the same way as phase ⅰ it is noteworthy that the nrepna was stabilized at 73 8 and the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption decreased to 0 24 this suggested that not only the unexpected nob was effectively suppressed but also the anammox bacteria had a high tolerance to the inhibition of thp ad filtrate in sbrpna however sbrpda effluent nh4 n increased obviously from 5 8 to 30 3 mg l in the first week of phase ⅲ this was presumably caused by the excess organic matter that served as electron donor for no2 n reduction thus the external cod n was gradually reduced to 0 3 low tn concentration in pda effluent of average 8 8 mg l was then obtained in phase ⅲ taken together although the disturbance was observed at initial which was most likely attributed to the shock of complex organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater satisfactory performance with final effluent tn of 8 8 mg l was obtained at stable stage a mean nrr of 0 52 kg n m3 d was obtained in sbrpna which was up to more than 10 times higher than that in low strength wastewater anammox based treatment and close to the nrr in high strength thp ad filtrate treatment table s3 the nrr in sbrpda even reached 1 07 kg n m3 d further confirming the few inhibition performed on anammox after long term acclimation as such the novel double line anammox system provides a feasible engineering solution for efficient and energy saving operations in wwtps 3 2 transformation of size fractionated organic matter as shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency of sbrpna and sbrpda increased slightly from 5 4 and 14 1 in phase i to 10 4 and 17 9 in phase iii respectively however the cod removal performance can only reflect the macroscopic changes of the total organics concentration across the pna pda process which is limited to characterize the compositional changes of complex organics within each of pna and pda processes so a deeper exploration of the bio transformation of different size fractionate organics was carried out the organics in thp ad filtrate usually contained subvisible particles large colloidal organics small colloidal organics and soluble organics p cod lc cod sc cod and s cod as shown in table 2 discrepancies in degradation affinity of size fractionated organics were observed between two reactors at initial period phase ⅰ sbrpna preferred to remove large size organics with p cod and lc cod decreased by 26 2 mg l 62 4 and 2 6 mg l 76 7 respectively which presumably attributed to the oxidation of biodegradable macromolecular organics under aeration condition and the efficient adsorption by eps details in section 3 4 while the removal of sc cod 24 1 mg l 41 4 and s cod 29 7 mg l 23 4 was much higher than that of p cod 1 1 mg l 4 1 and lc cod 0 3 mg l 5 6 in sbrpda indicating the utilization preference of small size organics in pd process different results were obtained in the stable period phase ⅲ in sbrpna in which the p cod removal climbed to 26 3 mg l 75 8 while the concentration of lc cod and sc cod increased by 8 4 mg l 129 0 and 15 1 mg l 50 3 after pna treatment and the removal of s cod also decreased to 35 8 mg l 13 7 sbrpda also exhibited a similar trend with the p cod and lc cod removal efficiency significantly increased by 81 5 and 15 3 respectively while the s cod removal efficiency only increased by 3 7 and the sc cod in effluent was even slightly higher than in influent it demonstrated that a part of particular organics was transformed into colloidal and soluble organics resulting from the strengthened biodegradability of large size organics after long term operation considering the continuous reduction of the external cod n from 2 3 to 0 3 it can be assumed that even the small part of biotransformation products was utilized by the pd process it played an important role in the overall saving of organic matter addition 3 3 organic matter transformation 3 3 1 transformation of fluorescent organic compounds revealed by eem eem spectra of sbrpna influent sbrpna effluent sbrpda influent as well as sbrpda effluent at stable stage are summarized in fig s2 in order to further conduct quantitative comparison of organic compounds parafac was used to deconvolute complex eems into independent fluorescent components fig 3 component 1 was assigned to the humic like component component 2 was assigned to the fulvic like component and component 3 was assigned to aromatic protein like components chen et al 2003 in sbrpna humic like component and fulvic like component was consumed by 3 2 and 24 9 respectively it suggests that although both humic like and fulvic like substances are recognized as refractory organics sbrpna after long term acclimation still had a certain degradability on them especially for fulvic like substances with smaller molecular weight besides the aromatic protein like component was consumed by 48 2 indicating the stronger degradability on proteins of sbrpna as for sbrpda little removal of the humic like component was observed while fulvic like component and aromatic protein like component were released during the reaction the recurrence of the fulvic like component might be attributed to microbial humification resulting from cell lysis in an adverse environment while the generated aromatic protein like was most likely caused by the degradation of larger molecular weight proteins under anoxic condition zhou et al 2015 besides heterotrophs with sufficient organics prefer to secrete eps microbial products that are rich in protein maqbool et al 2017 which would be released and also lead to the increase in protein like components in sbrpda effluent briefly thp ad filtrate is rich in refractory organics such as humic substances and protein like compounds which are mainly generated by maillard reaction and most of these exert adverse effects on microorganisms based on the nitrogen removal performance of the whole system the removal of macromolecular humic substances and proteins in sbrpna might alleviate the anammox bacteria inactivation and the slight recurrence of them in sbrpda was assumed to have little effect on the stability further investigation is needed to reveal the role of refractory organics on the pda process 3 3 2 transformation of functional organic groups revealed by ftir the peaks of ftir spectra shown in fig 3c d were attributed to characteristic bands of proteins c o and c c stretching amide ⅰ around 1655 cm 1 c h stretching tryptophan around 3100 cm 1 polysaccharides c oh stretching around 1100 cm 1 carbohydrates and lipids c o stretching around 1299

with the eem results obvious removal of uronic acids was also observed in sbrpna uronic acids are considered to widely exist in the cell walls and eps of bacteria xu et al 2019 indicating that a part of lysed cell debris that is abundant in thp ad filtrate could be removed in sbrpna additionally it was observed that a certain amount of proteins located at approximately 1655 cm 1 polysaccharides and hydroxyl function groups were generated in both sbrpna and sbrpda which was most likely caused by the decomposition of macromolecule protein like substances e g tryptophan and uronic acids by heterotrophic bacteria and the active microbial metabolism or eps peeling off the degradability of organics was likely improved after sbrpna and sbrpda treatment and the newly generated organics could participate in the pd process as electron donor as evidenced by the extremely low cod n of 0 3 obtained in sbrpda 3 4 response of sludge characterization and eps production to real thp ad filtrate 3 4 1 sludge size and eps composition after introducing real thp ad filtrate the particle size of sbrpna sludge showed a decreasing trend from 323 2 to 278 9 μm immediately then the value temporarily increased to 321 7 μm due to the flocs discharge fig 4 although the variation extent was relatively limited it would still affect the pna performance li et al 2020b however the trend of particle disintegration was still unstoppable and the proportion of the sludge larger than 500 μm in sbrpna decreased from 24 8 to 9 3 with time the deterioration of particles structure might be attributed to the increasing refractory compounds which had an inhibitory effect on the bacteria metabolic activity and could shift the microbial community as for sbrpda sludge the particle size remained relatively stable at around 368 1 μm during the whole operation this could be explained by the heterotrophs producing much more eps than autotrophs during nitrogen conversion process xie et al 2012 which could help to form compact particles and thereby resist adverse stimulation in environment thus eps characterization of sbrpna and sbrpda sludge was evaluated the components of eps mainly includes protein polysaccharide and humic substances as shown in fig 4c the total eps content of sbrpna sludge increased instantly by 70 9 after introducing real thp ad filtrate then decreased slightly and maintained at a stable level in subsequent operation the concentration of humic substances in eps of sludge taken from phase ⅰ increased by 129 5 compared with that of seeding sludge the distribution of humic substances in s eps lb eps and tb eps was 64 8 19 5 and 15 7 at stable stage respectively this clearly demonstrated that part of humic substances in thp ad filtrate could be removed by the adsorption of eps and the s eps of pna sludge has the strongest adsorbability on it besides the protein content in eps increased from 69 6 to 125 4 mg l in phase ⅱ due to the strategy of flocs discouragement but it was then decreased by 37 4 and stabilized at around 78 5 mg l during stable stage the total eps content in sbrpda sludge was more abundant and stable which fluctuated in the range of 183 8 to 260 9 mg l fig 4d this contributed to the stability of particle size diameter of sbrpda sludge 3 4 2 morphological structure as regards the surface morphology the sbrpna sludge under synthetic wastewater conditions had a porous structure with most spherical microorganisms which were speculated to be nitrifiers and anammox bacteria after treating thp ad filtrate filamentous bacteria proliferated and covered throughout the sludge while spherical bacteria were encapsulated in them it is because the complex organics in thp ad filtrate stimulated the growth of filamentous heterotrophs belonging to the class anaerolineae details in section 3 5 compared with sbrpna sludge sbrpda sludge has a denser structure with most rod and ellipsoid shaped microorganisms which were inferred to be denitrifiers and anammox bacteria after introduction of thp ad filtrate the internal compact microbial aggregates could still be observed whereas abundant eps like substances were enriched on the surface of pda sludge which protected functional bacteria 3 5 microbial community succession to compare community structures a scatter plot based on principal component analysis pca scores was obtained from the sequences at otu levels the results show that the microbial community in both sbrpna and sbrpda were changing after introducing thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater fig 5 a according to the matrix distances the biggest differences were between 3 phase i and 70 days phase iii in both reactors the taxonomic classification of phylum showed that in sbrpna samples the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased slightly from 38 2 phase i to 34 2 phase ii and then increased to 54 4 phase iii conversely proteobacteria bacteroidota and acidobacteriota decreased continuously throughout the operation nitrospirota which the typical nob belonging to increased from 2 1 phase ⅰ to 5 8 phase ii firstly but then decreased to 1 9 at the end of phase ⅲ planctomycetes which the anammox bacteria belonging to increased from 6 7 phase ⅰ to 9 4 phase ii and then decreased to 5 6 at the end of phase ⅲ fig 5b in sbrpda proteobacteria consisted of a large group of heterotrophic denitrifiers that dominated the microbial community with the percentage over 60 during the whole operation importantly planctomycetes considerably increased from 1 9 phase ⅰ to 3 4 phase ⅲ in genus level nitrosomonas was the major aob with relative abundance increasing from 1 93 to 3 52 over the long term operation in sbrpna while nob nitrospira rapidly increased from 2 06 in phase ⅰ to 5 78 in phase ii and then fell and stabilized at 1 85 in phase ⅲ candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were dominant anammox associated consortia in sbrpna at the beginning fig 5c however candidatus kuenenia decreased from 2 58 phase ⅰ to 0 36 phase ⅲ while candidatus brocadia was maintained at about 3 07 in sbrpda thauera was the top dominant genus among all samples with relative abundance ranging from 46 21 to 61 10 which was previously assumed as the main denitrifiers responsible for the no2 accumulation during no3 n reduction du et al 2020 besides the narg gene copies increased by 306 4 with the nirk nirs gene copies decreasing by 4 5 after long term operation fig 6 giving further evidence to the stable no2 generation the robust denitrifying populations held great potential for the effective retention and growth of anammox bacteria as a result candidatus brocadia which was the sole anammox bacteria relative abundance 0 1 over the entire operation in sbrpda increased significantly from 0 89 in phase ⅰ to 2 48 in phase ⅲ p 0 001 fig 5c d the evolution of anammox consortium in both reactors indicated the toughness and adaptability of candidatus brocadia to the complex organic compounds in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater the enrichment of candidatus brocadia was also observed in previous studies treating landfill leachate zhang et al 2020 it presumably manifests that candidatus brocadia has greater organic resistance or is able to participate in organic metabolism under organics rich condition and subsequently outcompete other anammox consortia in particular class anaerolineae was significantly enriched in both sbrpna from 32 8 to 47 3 and sbrpda from 4 5 to 9 7 after feeding with thp ad filtrate fig 5d all p 0 001 genus rbg 13 54 9 and sja 15 were the main contributors to this difference for sbrpna all p 0 001 and genus a4b and sbr1031 were the main contributors to this difference for sbrpda all p 0 001 most species of the anaerolineae were able to degrade carbohydrates and protein involved in sludge fermentation and hydrolysis process rosenkranz et al 2013 xiao et al 2021 accordingly the enrichment of anaerolineae was responsible for the decomposition of refractory organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater alleviating the inhibition of complex organics on both reactors and facilitating the utilization of complex organics to drive pd process and consequently reducing the demand for external carbon sources besides bacteria belonging to class anaerolineae always showed multicellular forms in filaments which further explained the filamentous bacteria proliferation shown in fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 impact of complex organic compounds on the whole system inhibition or enhancement organics are chemically complicated and present in a large range of concentration in both thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater they have drawn much attention in nitrogen removal studies due to their negative impacts on the anammox based system efficiency and stability inhibitions can be described as 1 enzyme deactivation 2 competition for substrate and live space with heterotrophs and 3 diffusional limitation xiao et al 2021 in sbrpna of this study significant decrease in specific activity of anammox saana from 6 0 mg n g vss h to 2 0 mg n g vss h was observed in phase ⅰ after feeding with thp ad filtrate fig s3b mainly attributing to the enzyme deactivation caused by the sudden impact of complex organics the repression of anammox bacteria then contributed to the recovery of nob with specific activity sanob increased from 1 9 mg n g vss h to 7 4 mg n g vss h which could in turn compete with anammox bacteria for the substrate therefore the optimization strategies of flocs discharge and influent dilution was implemented in phase ⅱ to directly out selected nob and alleviated the organic load resulting in the decrease of sanob to 6 1 mg n g vss h and the increase of saana to 4 5 mg n g vss h interestingly sanob was observed to further decrease to 5 5 mg n g vss h with the saana further increasing to 5 6 mg n g vss h during phase ⅲ without optimization strategies it benefited from the adaption of anammox bacteria and the selective enrichment of class anaerolineae under organics rich condition after long term operation the anaerolineae responsible for carbohydrate hydrolysis and proteolysis improved the degradation of complex organics on the one hand it could reduce the inhibition on anammox bacteria to some degree despite the limited cod degradation on the other hand it might indirectly inhibit the nob by competing for both nutrient substrate and the do for organic degradation and benefit anammox with sufficient no2 supply and limited do condition hubaux et al 2015 it is evidenced by the slight decrease of do concentration from 0 2 to 0 1 without a significant increase in aob activity fig s1 in sbrpna during phase ⅲ this is in line with previous studies where aerobic metabolism of organics by heterotrophs could outcompete nob for no2 or do under organics contained condition li et al 2020a van tendeloo et al 2021 although the nitrogen removal performance of sbrpda was not seriously negatively affected fig s3c the selective enrichment of class anaerolineae and the transformation of complex organics had an important effect on nitrogen conversion in sbrpda the ratio of narg nirk nirs increased by 325 5 which would be the key reason for the stably high no2 n accumulation of pd process this is inconsistent with previous literature that nirk nirs instead of narg would be sufficiently enriched when slowly biodegradable organics in sludge fermentation liquid offering electron donor cao et al 2019b it might be due to the extra active anammox process following pd process in this study which was competitive for no2 utilization and then led to the constant suppression on denitrifiers carrying nir gene the transformation of particle organics into soluble organics and the decomposition of complex protein like organics into micromolecule compounds in this system could reduce the operational costs by diminishing the external organics demand for pd process fig 6 besides the suspended solids in thp ad filtrate was 91 5 336 9 mg l which might act as carbon source to further decrease the external addition cao et al 2020 also the decay of cells was assumed to provide a certain amount of carbon source under the condition of high mlss 4 5 4 8 g l in sbrpda as a result the nrepda remained at 92 8 during the entire operation with the external cod n being gradually reduced from 2 3 in phase ⅰ to 0 3 in phase ⅲ fig 1 which accelerated the engineering application of cost efficient co treatment of sidestreams and mainstreams 4 2 a novel method for ultra deep nitrogen removal by double line anammox perspectives and application to date anammox mediated processes that rely on autotrophic nitrogen removal have been identified as the promising step toward energy autarky wastewater treatment in practice single stage pna has been developed worldwide with the majority 75 applied to sidestream treatment in wwtps lackner et al 2014 however high no3 n ranging from 75 0 to 260 mg l in the pna effluent has been frequently reported cao et al 2021 driessen et al 2020 jardin and hennerkes 2012 ochs et al 2021 this issue could be solved by the post denitrification biofilter but it would invisibly increase the operational costs li et al 2016 in this study the sbrpna was also beset by the excessive no3 with effluent no3 n fluctuating from 57 0 to 138 3 mg l fortunately the existence of the post sbrpda reversed this situation ultra deep nitrogen removal was achieved with the final effluent tn of 8 8 mg l on average treating the real 5 time diluted thp ad filtrate with 355 4 mg l nh4 n and 323 4 mg l cod importantly a certain part of domestic wastewater was synchronously treated via anammox in sbrpda without aeration which further relieves the mainline stress and reduces energy consumption additionally this double line anammox system could make positive use of the complex organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater relieving inhibition on anammox bacteria and reducing external carbon source demand recently the pda process in anoxic tank of traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic system has revolutionized the mainstream treatment li et al 2021a thus the sidestream pna effluent could be also returned to the mainstream anoxic unit for the ultra polishment except to flow into the separate pda unit in the future application however a large quantity of organics still remained in the treated effluent due to the refractory characteristics of thp ad filtrate therefore further studies are required to efficiently remove the residual organics through advanced approaches such as coagulation ozonation and fenton oxidation 5 conclusions in this study integration of double no2 supply pathways and anammox approach were developed to remove nitrogen from real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater for the first time the main conclusions include ultra deep nitrogen removal from thp ad filtrate was achieved by the double line pna pda process extremely low effluent tn was maintained at 8 8 mg l on average despite the unstable performance of pna the inhibition of complex organics on anammox activity was alleviated and the nob suppression in pna process could be indirectly strengthened due to the competition for do and nutrients with heterotrophic and anammox bacteria the enrichment of anaerolineae facilitated the decomposition of particulate organics and aromatic proteins into soluble biodegradable organics which improved the removal performance and provided available carbon source for pd process lowering the external cod n to 0 3 anammox was demonstrated as the dominant pathway with 72 0 of the nitrogen removal during the long term operation candidatus brocadia 2 48 was selectively cultivated in both sbrs with exposure to thp ad filtrate cooperating well with nitrosomonas 3 52 in sbrpna and thauera 46 13 and sbrpda declaration of competing interest the authors

16123,anammox process has been widely regarded as an energy efficient method for sludge digestion filtrate treatment however the complex high strength organics in the filtrate especially of anaerobic digestion after thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp ad brings serious threat to anammox bacteria and the high nitrate residue in effluent remains another significant barrier in operation in this study a novel double line anammox mediated system integrating the partial nitrification anammox pna with partial denitrification anammox pda processes in separately sequencing batch reactors sbrs was developed to polish the thp ad filtrate when the real thp ad filtrate 1946 5 mg nh4 n l 2076 0 mg cod l was fed to the front pna reactor sbrpna with 5 fold dilution effluent total nitrogen tn remained at 93 0 mg l notably the final effluent tn was effectively polished to as low as 8 8 mg l by the following pda reactor sbrpda which was fed with the sbrpna effluent and real domestic wastewater 71 0 mg nh4 n l 209 1 mg cod l more severe inhibition on anammox activity was observed in sbrpna rather than sbrpda by refractory organics in filtrate fortunately it could be alleviated with the enhanced degradability of particulate organics and aromatic protein like compounds attributed to the enrichment of class anaerolineae in both sbrpna and sbrpda this further stimulated the electron donor supply for pda process with much lower external carbon source demand 16s rrna sequencing analysis revealed that candidatus brocadia as dominant anammox bacteria were efficiently enriched in both sbrpna and sbrpda indicating its unexpected toughness and adaptability to the complex organic compounds in thp ad filtrate overall this study suggested that the novel double line anammox would be a promising alternative for cost efficient nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater containing complex organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thp ad filtrate domestic wastewater complex organic matter anammox partial nitrification pn partial denitrification pd 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is a promising approach for stabilization and volume reduction of waste activated sludge was along with additional biogas energy generation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as the general by product of ad digestion filtrate has high nutrient loads and is usually considered to recycle to the mainstream line which accounts for 1 of the mainstream flow but 15 20 of the nitrogen loading lackner et al 2014 with the optimization of sludge management thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp of was has been developed and successfully applied prior to ad unit currently aims to improve methane production and sludge dewaterability however the filtrate of thp ad with higher concentration of nh4 n 1688 3000 mg l and recalcitrant cod 1505 4242 mg l compared to that of ad brings significant pressure on the mainline and causes a corresponding increase in the toxicological risks and operation cost cao et al 2021 han et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the partial nitrification combined with anammox pna process is an attractive and energy efficient option to treat digestion filtrate separately within sidestream line it saves 100 organic carbon consumption and 60 aeration demand when compared to conventional nitrification denitrification joss et al 2009 lackner et al 2014 nevertheless one of the challenges hindering the sidestream pna is the excessive no3 generated from anammox bacteria itself in practice the effluent of pna process treating thp ad filtrate usually contains no3 n in a range of 75 0 172 7 mg l cao et al 2021 driessen et al 2020 ochs et al 2021 thereby considerable organic carbon e g 1 9 3 3 kg methanol kg no3 n is required for the latter denitrification peng et al 2007 theis and hicks 2012 recently the integration of partial denitrification pd no3 no2 and anammox referred to as pda process opened a new door for cost efficient no3 and nh4 removal kalyuzhnyi and gladchenko 2009 zhang et al 2022 in this process no3 reduction ends in no2 with 60 saving in organics demand the no2 and nh4 are removed via anammox subsequently the no3 generated by anammox in pda process can be eliminated in situ within the nitrite loop based on these principles the single stage pda process has been developed to simultaneously treat no3 contained wastewater e g secondary effluent of wwtps and domestic wastewater mainly contained nh4 and biodegradable organics with the effluent tn 5 mg l cao et al 2019a du et al 2020 therefore the double line anammox mediated system by integrating the pna with pda would have a promising application prospect in realizing advanced nitrogen removal from sideline thp ad filtrate by introducing mainline domestic wastewater importantly the organic matters in thp ad filtrate desired much attention considerable particulate organics and refractory organics such as humic substances generated during thp ad process would affect the activity of functional bacteria liang et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 found that particulate and collide organics contained in digestion filtrate had negative impacts on aob cao et al 2021 revealed that humic acid like fulvic acid like substances and building blocks were the major organic compounds in thp ad filtrate and aob lost its activity by 34 1 when exposed to 10 thp ad filtrate while anammox bacteria was completely suppressed at 60 thp ad filtrate wang et al 2021 reported anammox bacteria could be severely inhibited by the organics with molecular weight of 10 30 kda in digestion filtrate on the other hand there would be small fraction of these complex organic compounds can be degraded in pna process resulting in growth of denitrifiers with the degradation products as the electron donor wang et al 2019 as for the pda system the organics composition is particularly important since it can affect the no2 n accumulation characteristics and then the anammox activity shi et al 2020 thus organics evolution along with the double line anammox system and the crucial roles of complex organics on nitrogen removal efficiency and robustness needs further investigation therefore in this study real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater were used to investigate a novel double line anammox by integrating pna and pda processes for ultra deep nitrogen removal the important and multiple roles of complex organics involved in thp ad filtrate on the metabolism and communities of functional bacteria were analyzed the role of key groups for enhancing biodegradation of particulate organics and refractory organics was explored finally the microbial interactions between heterotrophic bacteria nitrifiers anammox and denitrifiers were addressed providing the potential alternative for cost efficient treatment of wastewater containing high strength ammonia and complex organic matter 2 methods and materials 2 1 seeding sludge and feeding wastewater sbrpna and sbrpda without biofilm were inoculated with sludge from two parent bioreactors of pna and pda respectively li et al 2021b before treating real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater sbrpna and sbrpda were operated with synthetic wastewater 400 mg l nh4 n for sbrpna 50 mg l nh4 n and 50 mg l no3 n for sbrpda for adaption with nitrogen removal efficiency nre both 80 3 the thp ad filtrate was collected from the thp ad process effluent in gaobeidian wwtp beijing china and the domestic wastewater was taken from a septic tank of 30 m3 in the residential area of beijing university of technology table 1 2 2 reactors and operation each cycle of sbrpna 10 l consisted of four steps feeding with 5 0 l diluted thp ad filtrate diluted 5 folds with tap water aerobic reaction

treatment and it has been reported to be efficient for pda process according to previous study du et al 2017 the temperature was maintained at 28 2 c in both reactors the operation was divided into three phases based on the pna performance the operational parameters was shown in table s1 2 3 analytical methods measurement of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations were analyzed using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee the cod concentration was determined using a cod quick analysis apparatus lian hua tech co china protein and humic substances

with glucose as the standard the do and ph were monitored by a ph oxi 340i analyzer wtw company germany the assessments of the maximum specific activity of aob nob and anammox bacteria were conducted according to previous studies du et al 2020 liu et al 2017 2 4 cod fractionation cod can be divided into four fractions particulate cod p cod large colloidal cod lc cod small colloidal cod sc cod and soluble cod s cod the sum of these four fractions is the total cod t cod the liquid samples were firstly passed through 10 20 μm paper filters to remove the suspended solids and measured as t cod t

illumina miseq platform majorbio china trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by 97 identity threshold taxonomic analysis was conducted according to previous work du et al 2020 3 results 3 1 efficiency of the double line system for thp ad filtrate treatment in phase ⅰ days 1 10 the performance of nitrogen removal in pna process was restricted when the real thp ad filtrate was introduced nh4 n of 36 2 mg l and no3 n of 137 4 mg l were observed in the effluent with the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption rapidly increased to 0 51 which indicated the deterioration of both pn and anammox processes fig 1 although full nitrification from nh4 to no3 occurred in sbrpna the following sbrpda could further polish the sbrpna effluent with the final effluent tn of 20 6 mg l notably flocs in sbrpna with a diameter of 200 μm exhibited high nob activity while particles larger than 200 μm showed more active aob and anammox bacteria metabolism fig s1 therefore in phase ⅱ days 11 36 two optimization strategies were applied in sbrpna for performance promotion one was elevating the dilution ratio of thp ad filtrate in influent from 5 time to 10 time to reduce the inhibitory organic components in thp ad filtrate and the other was discharging flocs by shortening the settling time of sbrpna to 5 min these strategies contributed to an nre gradually up to 71 4 and an effluent no3 n down to 92 1 mg l of sbrpna the final effluent tn of the pna pda system decreased to 6 7 mg l then which clearly demonstrated the stable performance and high contribution to total nitrogen removal of sbrpda in phase ⅲ days 37 105 the optimization strategies were suspended sbrpna operated in the same way as phase ⅰ it is noteworthy that the nrepna was stabilized at 73 8 and the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption decreased to 0 24 this suggested that not only the unexpected nob was effectively suppressed but also the anammox bacteria had a high tolerance to the inhibition of thp ad filtrate in sbrpna however sbrpda effluent nh4 n increased obviously from 5 8 to 30 3 mg l in the first week of phase ⅲ this was presumably caused by the excess organic matter that served as electron donor for no2 n reduction thus the external cod n was gradually reduced to 0 3 low tn concentration in pda effluent of average 8 8 mg l was then obtained in phase ⅲ taken together although the disturbance was observed at initial which was most likely attributed to the shock of complex organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater satisfactory performance with final effluent tn of 8 8 mg l was obtained at stable stage a mean nrr of 0 52 kg n m3 d was obtained in sbrpna which was up to more than 10 times higher than that in low strength wastewater anammox based treatment and close to the nrr in high strength thp ad filtrate treatment table s3 the nrr in sbrpda even reached 1 07 kg n m3 d further confirming the few inhibition performed on anammox after long term acclimation as such the novel double line anammox system provides a feasible engineering solution for efficient and energy saving operations in wwtps 3 2 transformation of size fractionated organic matter as shown in fig 2 the cod removal efficiency of sbrpna and sbrpda increased slightly from 5 4 and 14 1 in phase i to 10 4 and 17 9 in phase iii respectively however the cod removal performance can only reflect the macroscopic changes of the total organics concentration across the pna pda process which is limited to characterize the compositional changes of complex organics within each of pna and pda processes so a deeper exploration of the bio transformation of different size fractionate organics was carried out the organics in thp ad filtrate usually contained subvisible particles large colloidal organics small colloidal organics and soluble organics p cod lc cod sc cod and s cod as shown in table 2 discrepancies in degradation affinity of size fractionated organics were observed between two reactors at initial period phase ⅰ sbrpna preferred to remove large size organics with p cod and lc cod decreased by 26 2 mg l 62 4 and 2 6 mg l 76 7 respectively which presumably attributed to the oxidation of biodegradable macromolecular organics under aeration condition and the efficient adsorption by eps details in section 3 4 while the removal of sc cod 24 1 mg l 41 4 and s cod 29 7 mg l 23 4 was much higher than that of p cod 1 1 mg l 4 1 and lc cod 0 3 mg l 5 6 in sbrpda indicating the utilization preference of small size organics in pd process different results were obtained in the stable period phase ⅲ in sbrpna in which the p cod removal climbed to 26 3 mg l 75 8 while the concentration of lc cod and sc cod increased by 8 4 mg l 129 0 and 15 1 mg l 50 3 after pna treatment and the removal of s cod also decreased to 35 8 mg l 13 7 sbrpda also exhibited a similar trend with the p cod and lc cod removal efficiency significantly increased by 81 5 and 15 3 respectively while the s cod removal efficiency only increased by 3 7 and the sc cod in effluent was even slightly higher than in influent it demonstrated that a part of particular organics was transformed into colloidal and soluble organics resulting from the strengthened biodegradability of large size organics after long term operation considering the continuous reduction of the external cod n from 2 3 to 0 3 it can be assumed that even the small part of biotransformation products was utilized by the pd process it played an important role in the overall saving of organic matter addition 3 3 organic matter transformation 3 3 1 transformation of fluorescent organic compounds revealed by eem eem spectra of sbrpna influent sbrpna effluent sbrpda influent as well as sbrpda effluent at stable stage are summarized in fig s2 in order to further conduct quantitative comparison of organic compounds parafac was used to deconvolute complex eems into independent fluorescent components fig 3 component 1 was assigned to the humic like component component 2 was assigned to the fulvic like component and component 3 was assigned to aromatic protein like components chen et al 2003 in sbrpna humic like component and fulvic like component was consumed by 3 2 and 24 9 respectively it suggests that although both humic like and fulvic like substances are recognized as refractory organics sbrpna after long term acclimation still had a certain degradability on them especially for fulvic like substances with smaller molecular weight besides the aromatic protein like component was consumed by 48 2 indicating the stronger degradability on proteins of sbrpna as for sbrpda little removal of the humic like component was observed while fulvic like component and aromatic protein like component were released during the reaction the recurrence of the fulvic like component might be attributed to microbial humification resulting from cell lysis in an adverse environment while the generated aromatic protein like was most likely caused by the degradation of larger molecular weight proteins under anoxic condition zhou et al 2015 besides heterotrophs with sufficient organics prefer to secrete eps microbial products that are rich in protein maqbool et al 2017 which would be released and also lead to the increase in protein like components in sbrpda effluent briefly thp ad filtrate is rich in refractory organics such as humic substances and protein like compounds which are mainly generated by maillard reaction and most of these exert adverse effects on microorganisms based on the nitrogen removal performance of the whole system the removal of macromolecular humic substances and proteins in sbrpna might alleviate the anammox bacteria inactivation and the slight recurrence of them in sbrpda was assumed to have little effect on the stability further investigation is needed to reveal the role of refractory organics on the pda process 3 3 2 transformation of functional organic groups revealed by ftir the peaks of ftir spectra shown in fig 3c d were attributed to characteristic bands of proteins c o and c c stretching amide ⅰ around 1655 cm 1 c h stretching tryptophan around 3100 cm 1 polysaccharides c oh stretching around 1100 cm 1 carbohydrates and lipids c o stretching around 1299 cm 1 c h stretching around 2930 cm 1 uronic acids coo stretching around 1405 cm 1 hydroxyl function groups o h stretching around 3400 cm 1 and phosphate groups or nucleic acid groups fingerprint region 1000 cm 1 badireddy et al 2010 hou et al 2015 lotti et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 tryptophan a category of aromatic proteins was significantly removed in sbrpna which was in line with the eem results obvious removal of uronic acids was also observed in sbrpna uronic acids are considered to widely exist in the cell walls and eps of bacteria xu et al 2019 indicating that a part of lysed cell debris that is abundant in thp ad filtrate could be removed in sbrpna additionally it was observed that a certain amount of proteins located at approximately 1655 cm 1 polysaccharides and hydroxyl function groups were generated in both sbrpna and sbrpda which was most likely caused by the decomposition of macromolecule protein like substances e g tryptophan and uronic acids by heterotrophic bacteria and the active microbial metabolism or eps peeling off the degradability of organics was likely improved after sbrpna and sbrpda treatment and the newly generated organics could participate in the pd process as electron donor as evidenced by the extremely low cod n of 0 3 obtained in sbrpda 3 4 response of sludge characterization and eps production to real thp ad filtrate 3 4 1 sludge size and eps composition after introducing real thp ad filtrate the particle size of sbrpna sludge showed a decreasing trend from 323 2 to 278 9 μm immediately then the value temporarily increased to 321 7 μm due to the flocs discharge fig 4 although the variation extent was relatively limited it would still affect the pna performance li et al 2020b however the trend of particle disintegration was still unstoppable and the proportion of the sludge larger than 500 μm in sbrpna decreased from 24 8 to 9 3 with time the deterioration of particles structure might be attributed to the increasing refractory compounds which had an inhibitory effect on the bacteria metabolic activity and could shift the microbial community as for sbrpda sludge the particle size remained relatively stable at around 368 1 μm during the whole operation this could be explained by the heterotrophs producing much more eps than autotrophs during nitrogen conversion process xie et al 2012 which could help to form compact particles and thereby resist adverse stimulation in environment thus eps characterization of sbrpna and sbrpda sludge was evaluated the components of eps mainly includes protein polysaccharide and humic substances as shown in fig 4c the total eps content of sbrpna sludge increased instantly by 70 9 after introducing real thp ad filtrate then decreased slightly and maintained at a stable level in subsequent operation the concentration of humic substances in eps of sludge taken from phase ⅰ increased by 129 5 compared with that of seeding sludge the distribution of humic substances in s eps lb eps and tb eps was 64 8 19 5 and 15 7 at stable stage respectively this clearly demonstrated that part of humic substances in thp ad filtrate could be removed by the adsorption of eps and the s eps of pna sludge has the strongest adsorbability on it besides the protein content in eps increased from 69 6 to 125 4 mg l in phase ⅱ due to the strategy of flocs discouragement but it was then decreased by 37 4 and stabilized at around 78 5 mg l during stable stage the total eps content in sbrpda sludge was more abundant and stable which fluctuated in the range of 183 8 to 260 9 mg l fig 4d this contributed to the stability of particle size diameter of sbrpda sludge 3 4 2 morphological structure as regards the surface morphology the sbrpna sludge under synthetic wastewater conditions had a porous structure with most spherical microorganisms which were speculated to be nitrifiers and anammox bacteria after treating thp ad filtrate filamentous bacteria proliferated and covered throughout the sludge while spherical bacteria were encapsulated in them it is because the complex organics in thp ad filtrate stimulated the growth of filamentous heterotrophs belonging to the class anaerolineae details in section 3 5 compared with sbrpna sludge sbrpda sludge has a denser structure with most rod and ellipsoid shaped microorganisms which were inferred to be denitrifiers and anammox bacteria after introduction of thp ad filtrate the internal compact microbial aggregates could still be observed whereas abundant eps like substances were enriched on the surface of pda sludge which protected functional bacteria 3 5 microbial community succession to compare community structures a scatter plot based on principal component analysis pca scores was obtained from the sequences at otu levels the results show that the microbial community in both sbrpna and sbrpda were changing after introducing thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater fig 5 a according to the matrix distances the biggest differences were between 3 phase i and 70 days phase iii in both reactors the taxonomic classification of phylum showed that in sbrpna samples the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased slightly from 38 2 phase i to 34 2 phase ii and then increased to 54 4 phase iii conversely proteobacteria bacteroidota and acidobacteriota decreased continuously throughout the operation nitrospirota which the typical nob belonging to increased from 2 1 phase ⅰ to 5 8 phase ii firstly but then decreased to 1 9 at the end of phase ⅲ planctomycetes which the anammox bacteria belonging to increased from 6 7 phase ⅰ to 9 4 phase ii and then decreased to 5 6 at the end of phase ⅲ fig 5b in sbrpda proteobacteria consisted of a large group of heterotrophic denitrifiers that dominated the microbial community with the percentage over 60 during the whole operation importantly planctomycetes considerably increased from 1 9 phase ⅰ to 3 4 phase ⅲ in genus level nitrosomonas was the major aob with relative abundance increasing from 1 93 to 3 52 over the long term operation in sbrpna while nob nitrospira rapidly increased from 2 06 in phase ⅰ to 5 78 in phase ii and then fell and stabilized at 1 85 in phase ⅲ candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia were dominant anammox associated consortia in sbrpna at the beginning fig 5c however candidatus kuenenia decreased from 2 58 phase ⅰ to 0 36 phase ⅲ while candidatus brocadia was maintained at about 3 07 in sbrpda thauera was the top dominant genus among all samples with relative abundance ranging from 46 21 to 61 10 which was previously assumed as the main denitrifiers responsible for the no2 accumulation during no3 n reduction du et al 2020 besides the narg gene copies increased by 306 4 with the nirk nirs gene copies decreasing by 4 5 after long term operation fig 6 giving further evidence to the stable no2 generation the robust denitrifying populations held great potential for the effective retention and growth of anammox bacteria as a result candidatus brocadia which was the sole anammox bacteria relative abundance 0 1 over the entire operation in sbrpda increased significantly from 0 89 in phase ⅰ to 2 48 in phase ⅲ p 0 001 fig 5c d the evolution of anammox consortium in both reactors indicated the toughness and adaptability of candidatus brocadia to the complex organic compounds in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater the enrichment of candidatus brocadia was also observed in previous studies treating landfill leachate zhang et al 2020 it presumably manifests that candidatus brocadia has greater organic resistance or is able to participate in organic metabolism under organics rich condition and subsequently outcompete other anammox consortia in particular class anaerolineae was significantly enriched in both sbrpna from 32 8 to 47 3 and sbrpda from 4 5 to 9 7 after feeding with thp ad filtrate fig 5d all p 0 001 genus rbg 13 54 9 and sja 15 were the main contributors to this difference for sbrpna all p 0 001 and genus a4b and sbr1031 were the main contributors to this difference for sbrpda all p 0 001 most species of the anaerolineae were able to degrade carbohydrates and protein involved in sludge fermentation and hydrolysis process rosenkranz et al 2013 xiao et al 2021 accordingly the enrichment of anaerolineae was responsible for the decomposition of refractory organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater alleviating the inhibition of complex organics on both reactors and facilitating the utilization of complex organics to drive pd process and consequently reducing the demand for external carbon sources besides bacteria belonging to class anaerolineae always showed multicellular forms in filaments which further explained the filamentous bacteria proliferation shown in fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 impact of complex organic compounds on the whole system inhibition or enhancement organics are chemically complicated and present in a large range of concentration in both thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater they have drawn much attention in nitrogen removal studies due to their negative impacts on the anammox based system efficiency and stability inhibitions can be described as 1 enzyme deactivation 2 competition for substrate and live space with heterotrophs and 3 diffusional limitation xiao et al 2021 in sbrpna of this study significant decrease in specific activity of anammox saana from 6 0 mg n g vss h to 2 0 mg n g vss h was observed in phase ⅰ after feeding with thp ad filtrate fig s3b mainly attributing to the enzyme deactivation caused by the sudden impact of complex organics the repression of anammox bacteria then contributed to the recovery of nob with specific activity sanob increased from 1 9 mg n g vss h to 7 4 mg n g vss h which could in turn compete with anammox bacteria for the substrate therefore the optimization strategies of flocs discharge and influent dilution was implemented in phase ⅱ to directly out selected nob and alleviated the organic load resulting in the decrease of sanob to 6 1 mg n g vss h and the increase of saana to 4 5 mg n g vss h interestingly sanob was observed to further decrease to 5 5 mg n g vss h with the saana further increasing to 5 6 mg n g vss h during phase ⅲ without optimization strategies it benefited from the adaption of anammox bacteria and the selective enrichment of class anaerolineae under organics rich condition after long term operation the anaerolineae responsible for carbohydrate hydrolysis and proteolysis improved the degradation of complex organics on the one hand it could reduce the inhibition on anammox bacteria to some degree despite the limited cod degradation on the other hand it might indirectly inhibit the nob by competing for both nutrient substrate and the do for organic degradation and benefit anammox with sufficient no2 supply and limited do condition hubaux et al 2015 it is evidenced by the slight decrease of do concentration from 0 2 to 0 1 without a significant increase in aob activity fig s1 in sbrpna during phase ⅲ this is in line with previous studies where aerobic metabolism of organics by heterotrophs could outcompete nob for no2 or do under organics contained condition li et al 2020a van tendeloo et al 2021 although the nitrogen removal performance of sbrpda was not seriously negatively affected fig s3c the selective enrichment of class anaerolineae and the transformation of complex organics had an important effect on nitrogen conversion in sbrpda the ratio of narg nirk nirs increased by 325 5 which would be the key reason for the stably high no2 n accumulation of pd process this is inconsistent with previous literature that nirk nirs instead of narg would be sufficiently enriched when slowly biodegradable organics in sludge fermentation liquid offering electron donor cao et al 2019b it might be due to the extra active anammox process following pd process in this study which was competitive for no2 utilization and then led to the constant suppression on denitrifiers carrying nir gene the transformation of particle organics into soluble organics and the decomposition of complex protein like organics into micromolecule compounds in this system could reduce the operational costs by diminishing the external organics demand for pd process fig 6 besides the suspended solids in thp ad filtrate was 91 5 336 9 mg l which might act as carbon source to further decrease the external addition cao et al 2020 also the decay of cells was assumed to provide a certain amount of carbon source under the condition of high mlss 4 5 4 8 g l in sbrpda as a result the nrepda remained at 92 8 during the entire operation with the external cod n being gradually reduced from 2 3 in phase ⅰ to 0 3 in phase ⅲ fig 1 which accelerated the engineering application of cost efficient co treatment of sidestreams and mainstreams 4 2 a novel method for ultra deep nitrogen removal by double line anammox perspectives and application to date anammox mediated processes that rely on autotrophic nitrogen removal have been identified as the promising step toward energy autarky wastewater treatment in practice single stage pna has been developed worldwide with the majority 75 applied to sidestream treatment in wwtps lackner et al 2014 however high no3 n ranging from 75 0 to 260 mg l in the pna effluent has been frequently reported cao et al 2021 driessen et al 2020 jardin and hennerkes 2012 ochs et al 2021 this issue could be solved by the post denitrification biofilter but it would invisibly increase the operational costs li et al 2016 in this study the sbrpna was also beset by the excessive no3 with effluent no3 n fluctuating from 57 0 to 138 3 mg l fortunately the existence of the post sbrpda reversed this situation ultra deep nitrogen removal was achieved with the final effluent tn of 8 8 mg l on average treating the real 5 time diluted thp ad filtrate with 355 4 mg l nh4 n and 323 4 mg l cod importantly a certain part of domestic wastewater was synchronously treated via anammox in sbrpda without aeration which further relieves the mainline stress and reduces energy consumption additionally this double line anammox system could make positive use of the complex organics in thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater relieving inhibition on anammox bacteria and reducing external carbon source demand recently the pda process in anoxic tank of traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic system has revolutionized the mainstream treatment li et al 2021a thus the sidestream pna effluent could be also returned to the mainstream anoxic unit for the ultra polishment except to flow into the separate pda unit in the future application however a large quantity of organics still remained in the treated effluent due to the refractory characteristics of thp ad filtrate therefore further studies are required to efficiently remove the residual organics through advanced approaches such as coagulation ozonation and fenton oxidation 5 conclusions in this study integration of double no2 supply pathways and anammox approach were developed to remove nitrogen from real thp ad filtrate and domestic wastewater for the first time the main conclusions include ultra deep nitrogen removal from thp ad filtrate was achieved by the double line pna pda process extremely low effluent tn was maintained at 8 8 mg l on average despite the unstable performance of pna the inhibition of complex organics on anammox activity was alleviated and the nob suppression in pna process could be indirectly strengthened due to the competition for do and nutrients with heterotrophic and anammox bacteria the enrichment of anaerolineae facilitated the decomposition of particulate organics and aromatic proteins into soluble biodegradable organics which improved the removal performance and provided available carbon source for pd process lowering the external cod n to 0 3 anammox was demonstrated as the dominant pathway with 72 0 of the nitrogen removal during the long term operation candidatus brocadia 2 48 was selectively cultivated in both sbrs with exposure to thp ad filtrate cooperating well with nitrosomonas 3 52 in sbrpna and thauera 46 13 and sbrpda declaration of competing interest the authors

16124,graphene oxide go are subjected to photoaging in aquatic environment and inevitably enter biota and then interact with proteins here the interactions of pristine and photoaged go with two typical proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and lysozyme were systematically investigated due to long term photoirradiation 1 3 day the lateral size of go decreased greatly and the oxygen containing groups decreased as well while the graphitic carbon contents increased compared to pristine go the photoaged go displayed stronger binding affinities with both proteins which was mainly attributed to the increased binding sites as a result of smaller lateral size and increased hydrophobicity the photoaging effect was more obvious for the negatively charged bsa because hydrogen bonding and van der waals force were mainly involved in the enthalpy driven interactions between them while the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged lysozyme and go diminished the photoaging effect analyses of synchronous three dimensional fluorescence spectra and fibrillation experiments intensified that the photoaged go induced more serious changes in conformational structure of bsa and exhibited stronger inhibition on fibrillation of bsa compared to pristine go this study provided novel insights into the increased ecological risks of go as a result of photoaging graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide go proteins photoaged conformational structure fibrillation 1 introduction as one typical two dimensional carbon nanomaterial graphene oxide go has found wide applications in many fields ranging from environmental protection to nanomedicine loh et al 2010 mao et al 2013 perreault et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 consequently they are inevitably released into natural aquatic environment ren et al 2018 suarez iglesias et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 thus triggering growing concerns on their biological exposure and ecological risks park et al 2017 yao et al 2019 go could accumulate in organisms chen et al 2021 and had the potential to be transferred into human through food chain lu et al 2017 proteins are important components to maintain the life activity of organisms once go enter biological systems they may interact with proteins and a protein corona would be formed on their surface huang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 protein corona is a protein layer adsorbed onto nanoparticles upon contact with biofluids chong et al 2015 yan et al 2019 such interactions may alter the conformational structures of proteins and then affect their biological functions malik et al 2020 pandit and de 2020 therefore understanding the interactions between go and proteins and the induced changes in the protein conformational structures is crucial for predicting the biological risks of go to human health liu et al 2019 martínez negro et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 the interactions between go and protein are largely determined by the physicochemical properties of go huang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 once released into the environment go would experience aging processes under multiple actions such as photoirradiation and the physicochemical properties may change distinctly du et al 2019 sun et al 2021 reduced graphene oxides rgo could be formed as a result of chemical reduction and photoirradiation but in different extents chowdhury et al 2015b zhao et al 2014 generally chemical reduction significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity and lateral size of the rgo relative to the pristine one bai et al 2017 qi et al 2019 wei et al 2015 consequently the aggregation status of go and rgo in physiological environment were different and then greatly affected their interactions with fetal bovine serum qi et al 2019 it was demonstrated that the chemically reduced rgo exhibited lower colloidal dispersion thus lower inhibition effect on the lysozyme activity bai et al 2017 different from the chemical reduction process photoaging as a relatively mild process did not largely reduce the content of go surface oxygen containing groups but might break large nanosheets into smaller ones gao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 chowdhury et al 2015a reported that the c o ratio of go slightly increased from 1 72 to 2 0 while its effective diameter decreased from 200 nm to 130 nm after exposure to 1 kw xenon lamp for 11 h usually smaller sized nanomaterials exhibit stronger affinity with proteins due to the increased surface areas šimšíková 2016 sun et al 2020 our previous study indicated that the photoaged go displayed comparable dispersion as the pristine one while the chemically reduced rgo inclined to form large aggregates in electrolyte solution sun et al 2021 the changes induced by photoaging might result in interesting differences in the binding interactions of go with proteins concentration of protein in biological fluids is usually as high as g l gan et al 2015 and their surface charge molecular structure and weight vary distinctly chong et al 2015 these features of proteins may also affect their interactions with pristine and photoaged go and eventually change their conformational structure and biological functions in this study the interactions of pristine and photoaged go with model proteins were systematically investigated at molecular level there are various types of proteins in different body fluids table s4 and bovine serum albumin bsa and lysozyme were selected as model proteins due to their wide presence in biological environment as well as their significant different conformational structure surface charge and contents of amide acid residues bai et al 2017 gan et al 2015 both bsa and lysozyme are globular proteins and their molecular weights are 68 and 14 3 kda respectively du et al 2014 and their physicochemical properties are shown in table s5 bsa has 583 amino acid residues with 29 α helices and three structurally similar domains 35 cysteine residues of bsa are involved in 17 disulfide bridges among which there are eight double disulfide bridges nan et al 2019 lysozyme comprises of 129 amino acid residues having 6 tryptophan three tyrosine residues and 4 disulfide bonds and it was positively charged in physiological ph 7 4 du et al 2014 this study aims to disclose 1 the impacts of sunlight irradiation on the physicochemical properties of go 2 the intrinsic mechanisms accounting for the interactions between the go and both proteins 3 the impacts of the photoaged go on the protein conformational structure and biological functions this work would provide novel insights into the interactions between proteins and environmentally photoaged go and is of importance in predicting ecological risk of go in physiological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents single layer go powder was purchased from tianjin plannano energy technologies co ltd tianjin china lyophilized powder of bsa a2153 and lysozyme 62 970 1g f were both supplied by sigma aldrich company st louis mo usa the protein powders were freshly dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 and stored at 4 phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 was prepared by dissolving 8 0 g nacl 0 2 g kcl 2 9 g na2hpo4 and 0 2 g kh2po4 in 1 l ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of pristine and photoaged go forty mg of pristine go was put into a dried and clean glass bottle and then 400 ml of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm hhitech china was added the suspension was stirred at 600 rpm for one night and ultrasonicated in ice bath for 6 h to get the go stock solution 40 ml of go solution was added into the 50 ml transparent quartz tube with 30 mm magneton 300 rpm min photochemical reaction apparatus xpa 7 xu jiang machine plant nanjing china with a cyclic water installation was used to stimulate environmental photoaged process of go wavelength range diagram of 800 w xenon lamp is shown in figure s1 the go suspension was irradiated for 8 h per day for 3 days making a total of 3 days the samples photoaged for different periods 0 1 and 3 days were labelled as go 0 go 1 and go 3 respectively pristine and photoaged go stock solution were ultrasonicated for 10 min before each set of experiment concentrations of pristine and photoaged go were normalized to the corresponding experimental concentrations sufficient go suspensions were photoaged for different periods and freeze dried to get lyophilized powder for the following physicochemical characterization morphologies and lateral sizes of the pristine and photoaged go were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini 500 zeiss germany chemical compositions and functional groups of go were characterized by uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ulvac phi japan respectively high temperature oxidation multi n c3100 analytik jena germany was used to measure the total organic carbon toc of go suspensions the detailed information for go characterizations were described in our previous studies sun et al 2018 2021 2020 2 3 hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential the intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter d h and zeta potential of pristine and photoaged go with and without proteins were conducted by time resolved dynamic light scattering on zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk sun et al 2018 2020 the concentrations of go and proteins were fixed at 10 and 100 mg l respectively each measurement was conducted for at least three times 2 4 fluorescence spectroscopy steady state fluorescence spectra were conducted by hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer equipped with xe lamp hitachi japan fluorescence spectra of the proteins as a function of go concentration were recorded over an emission wavelength range of 290 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm with 2 5 nm emission and excitation slit 10 ml of the go solutions at different concentrations were added into equal volume of protein suspensions at fixed concentration 100 mg l and then incubated at 289 298 and 310 k for 60 min the effect of interaction time 0 30 and 60 min on fluorescence spectra of proteins as functions of go concentrations was investigated at 298 k synchronous fluorescent spectra of protein were recorded with the excitation wavelength over a range of 200 500 nm while the emission spectra were set as 215 nm δλ 15 nm and 260 nm δλ 60 nm respectively protein concentration was kept at 100 mg l and the concentrations of pristine and photoaged go varied in the range of 0 25 mg l three dimensional fluorescence spectra of go bsa and go bsa complex were recorded on hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer the excitation wavelength ranged from 200 to 500 nm while the emission wavelength was over a range of 240 to 550 nm with 5 0 nm sampling intervals of both excitation and emission the scan speed was 12 000 nm min and the emission and excitation slits were 2 5 nm the concentration of protein was 100 mg l while the pristine and photoaged go concentrations were 12 5 mg l 2 6 fibrillation of bsa in the absence and presence of pristine and photoaged go initial concentration of bsa for fibrillation was 5000 mg l to provide strong fluorescence intensity over an emission wavelength range of 450 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm with 5 nm emission and excitation slit bsa was firstly incubated with the pristine and photoaged go for about 30 min then 120 μm thioflavin t was added and the mixed solution was incubated for another 30 min at ph 7 4 and 298 k effects of pristine and photoaged go on bsa fluorescence spectra were recorded using the corresponding go as the references 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the pristine and photoaged go simulated solar light irradiation significantly affected the physicochemical properties of go gao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the surface morphology and lateral size of the go were examined by fesem figure s2 and the images indicated that all go samples were in the form of nanosheets and their lateral size decreased within the irradiation time as shown in figure s3 the mean lateral size of go 0 go 1 and go 3 were 1403 1 362 5 570 9 212 2 and 242 4 83 4 nm respectively consistent with the fesem results the d h of the go decreased from the original 237 1 nm to 210 6 nm after 3 days irradiation fig 1 a table s1 these revealed that the large go nanosheets were broken due to sufficient photoirradiation this change in morphology was accompanied by the decrease of toc content and that of go 3 was about 86 of go 0 table s1 previous studies reported that long term photoaging resulted in go degradation with formation of co2 and soluble low molecular weight substances hou et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 fig 1b illustrates that the uv vis absorbance of the go in the range of 250 700 nm increased with the irradiation time due to the restoration of sp2 π conjugated network li et al 2008 suggesting the formation of light absorbing transformation products which was in agreement with the darker color of photoaged go figure s4 additionally the maximum absorption wavelength shifted toward the blue region as the irradiation time increased which might be due to the decreased π conjugated domains luo et al 2010 sun et al 2020 the c 1 s xps spectra shown in figure s5 further reveal the changes of go surface functional groups the o content decreased from 32 24 for go 0 to 27 36 for go 3 and the carbon to oxygen c o ratio increased from 2 10 for go 0 to 2 66 for go 3 which evidenced that photoirradiation induced mild reduction of the go c 1 s xps profiles of the pristine and photoaged go with characteristic peaks at 284 4 286 5 287 8 and 288 8 ev which represents aromatic rings cc c c epoxy hydroxyl co c coh carbonyl c o and carboxyl oc o functional groups respectively the contents of the functional groups are listed in table s2 specially the oxygen containing functional groups including co c o and oc o groups decreased from 56 74 for the go 0 to 42 05 for go 3 while the graphitic carbon contents cc and c c groups increased from 43 26 to 57 95 in pure water without any salts the zeta potentials of the go 1 and go 3 were similar to that of go 0 which was around 45 mv table s1 indicating that light irradiation did not significantly change the surface charge of go sun et al 2021 the large negative zeta potentials of the go suggested that the all go were stable during the light exposure process gao et al 2020 3 2 stability of pristine and photoaged go in physiological environment protein stability is important to maintain its conformational structure and bioactivity huang et al 2020 yan et al 2021 for both bsa and lysozyme at different concentrations their respective uv vis and fluorescent spectra as well as the d h values in the presence of pbs did not change distinctly relative to those in the absence of pbs figure s6 s7 these results indicated that both proteins were stable and were not decomposed at the experimental conditions the colloidal states of the go in physiological environment is an important factor determining their biological effects sun et al 2021 the stability and zeta potentials of the go in the presence of proteins at 100 mg l are shown in fig 2 the isoelectric point of go was reported to be lower than 2 wu et al 2013 the isoelectric points of bsa and lysozyme are 4 7 and 11 3 respectively du et al 2014 in pbs solution the zeta potential of the go bsa conjugate was all about 23 mv the mass ratio of bsa 100 mg l to go was 10 the strong steric repulsion induced by the high concentration of bsa favored the dispersion of the go as stable colloidal states sun et al 2020 the tem images figure s8 also revealed that the photoaged go nanoparticles were well dispersed in solution of 100 mg l bsa in the presence of lysozyme all the go nanomaterials quickly formed large aggregates and their zeta potential were all 5 mv which might be attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between go and lysozyme at ph 7 4 previous study indicated that aggregation morphology remarkably affected the protein affinities of go and the go with higher reduction degree were more easily to aggregate in fetal serum albumin thus depressed their binding with proteins qi et al 2019 the different stability and dispersion states of go might induce their greatly different binding affinities with both proteins which are going to be discussed as follows 3 3 thermodynamics for the binding between go 0 and proteins go 0 was chosen as the typical quencher of protein fluorescent spectra to investigate the effect of incubation time and temperature on the interactions between go and proteins wei and ge 2013 and the results are shown in figs s9 and s10 go 0 did not show any fluorescent absorption fig s11 suggesting that the observed fluorescent spectra of the go protein complexes were originated from the proteins wei and ge 2013 bsa and lysozyme both exhibited a characteristic intrinsic fluorescence with an emission peak of 340 nm at the 280 nm excitation wavelength which was ascribed to tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acid residues in them gan et al 2015 kuchlyan et al 2015 wei et al 2015 as the go 0 concentration increased the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm decreased remarkably without significant shift of the peak position indicating that there was strong binding affinity between go and the aromatic amino acid residues of both proteins šimšíková 2016 the emission intensity of bsa decreased as the incubation time extended from 0 to 60 min fig s9d implying that it took time for them to interact with each other to form complex gradually while for lysozyme the intensity did not change much with the incubation time which might be attributed to the strong and fast electrostatic interaction between them bai et al 2017 li et al 2014 the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged go and the positively charged lysozyme was so strong that the complexion between them reached equilibrium quickly once they were incubated together li et al 2022 considering that go was unstable in the presence of lysozyme and quickly formed large aggregates bsa was chosen to further understand the thermodynamic of the go 0 and bsa interaction as shown in figure s12 the fluorescence intensity of bsa in the presence of go 0 decreased with the increase of incubation temperature the fluorescence quenching process of bsa was then analyzed by the modified stern volmer formula huang et al 2020 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f a 1 q 1 f a k a where f 0 and f are the emission maximum values of bsa in the absence and presence of go 0 k a is the binding constant of bsa and f a is the molar fraction of solvent accessible fluorophore and q is the concentration of go mol l the molecular weight of go is 1036 g mol huang et al 2020 the calculated k a of bsa quenched by go 0 at 289 k 298 k and 310 k were 1 2 0 87 and 0 04 respectively table s3 the decrease of k a with increasing temperature indicated that it was a static quenching process with no distinct electron transfer between go 0 and bsa nan et al 2019 šimšíková 2016 wei and ge 2013 proteins could interact with go through electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds van der waals interaction and hydrophobic interactions kuchlyan et al 2015 thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between go and proteins such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated as the following equations huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 2 l n k a δ h r t δ s r 3 δ g δ h t δ s the calculated δg δh and δs values are shown in table s3 and all the values were negative under the experimental temperatures the negative δg values revealed that the reaction between go 0 and bsa was spontaneous and favorable huang et al 2020 the negative δh and δs revealed that the interaction was an exothermic and entropy decreasing process and mainly driven by enthalpy nan et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the result also revealed that hydrogen bonds and van der waals force were mainly responsible for the interaction between go 0 and bsa nan et al 2019 xu et al 2018 3 4 binding affinities and mechanisms between proteins and the go 3 4 1 binding affinity between proteins and the go steady state fluorescence emission spectra of bsa and lysozymes and the f f0 ratios as a function of the go concentrations are shown in figs 3 s13 and s14 the f f0 of bsa 100 mg l quenched by go 0 go 1 and go 3 at 20 mg l were 0 41 0 27 and 0 15 respectively while the f f0 of lysozyme quenched by go 0 go 1 and go 3 at 12 5 mg l were 0 33 0 28 and 0 25 respectively these indicated that after photoaging the interactions between the go and proteins became stronger and this effect was more significant for go bsa interaction in line with this the adsorption results fig s15 certified that the photoaged go had greater affinity with bsa than pristine go in physiological environment in the process of photoaging pristine go was broken into smaller nanosheets accompanied by the formation of soluble hydroxylated and or carboxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds cao et al 2021 hou et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 which might bind with proteins strongly chen et al 2020 thus the filtrate of the go 50 mg l were collected by filtered them through a 100 nm nylon membrane fig s16 which was then incubated with the proteins the fluorescence of bsa 100 mg l did not change much as incubated with the filtrates fig s17 revealing that the low molecular weight species derived from go photoaging did not interact with bsa distinctly the surface oxygen containing groups of go decreased with increasing irradiation time thus the hydrophobic interaction between the go and bsa should become stronger sun et al 2021 as discussed above the main interactions between the go and bsa were hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces so the enhanced hydrophobic interaction might not be the main reason accounting for the stronger affinity between bsa and the photoaged go the calculated adsorption layer on go increased with the increase of irradiation time which also supported that photoaged go had greater affinity with bsa table s6 figure s18 demonstrates the long term stability 12 h of go 1 and go 3 at different concentrations 0 25 mg l in the presence of bsa fortifying that the photoaged go were stable and could maintain their dispersion in bsa solution therefore the photoaged go exhibited better fluorescence quenching ability than go 0 which could be ascribed to the increased binding sites as a result of reduced particle size šimšíková 2016 sun et al 2020 for lysozyme there was marginal difference in the quenching ability among the go which could be attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions between them this was magnified by the large aggregates of go lysozyme conjugates observed after they were incubated for 12 h fig s18 these results indicated that interactions between go and proteins were dependent on both the physicochemical properties of go and proteins 3 4 2 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy could provide the effective microenvironmental information of proteins particularly in the vicinity of the fluorophore functional groups such as tryptophan and tyrosine residues nan et al 2019 bsa was chosen as the model protein and the fluorescence spectra are shown in figs s19 and s20 when δλ was set at 15 or 60 nm the fluorescence spectra of bsa only exhibited the characteristic fluorescence peaks of tyrosine residues or tryptophan residues xu et al 2018 the corresponding f f0 ratios as a function of the go concentrations are shown in fig 4 the fluorescence maximum emission intensity of tryptophan of bsa was much higher than that of tyrosine suggesting the fluorescence intensity of bsa was mainly contributed by tryptophan the effect of go on the change in fluorescence intensity of tryptophan residue was much higher than that of tyrosine residue compared with go 0 go 3 exhibited stronger quenching effect for both tyrosine and tryptophan residues the maximum emission peak of tyrosine kept at 284 2 nm with increasing go concentrations suggesting that the go did not change microenvironment of tyrosine residues wei and ge 2013 with increasing concentration of go 0 the maximum emission peak of tryptophan remained at 279 4 nm while with the increase of go 3 concentration the maximum emission peak of tryptophan increased from 278 4 to 280 4 nm implying that the tryptophan residues changed to a more hydrophilic microenvironment and were more exposed to the external environment wei and ge 2013 these magnified that the photoaged go displayed stronger interactions with bsa molecules and caused more serious conformational changes of bsa than the pristine go 3 4 3 three dimensional fluorescence spectra analysis three dimensional fluorescence spectra could provide visual information about change of conformational structure of bsa the isometric three dimensional contour spectra and projections of bsa 100 mg l in the absence and presence of go are displayed in figs 5 and s21 the go 0 go 1 and go 3 had low intensity of three dimensional fluorescence spectra fig s22 as shown in fig s21a and table 1 bsa itself exhibited two obvious peaks peak 1 λex em 275 355 nm and peak 2 λex em 230 355 nm peak 1 mainly revealed the characteristic fluorescence spectra of tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acid residues in bsa huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 peak 2 was the characteristic fluorescence spectra of polypeptide backbone structure of bsa huang et al 2020 in the presence of go 0 the intensity of peak 1 decreased distinctly the microenvironment of these amino acid residues changed huang et al 2020 the intensity of peak 2 also decreased implying the peptide strand structure of bsa was altered huang et al 2020 comparatively both peak 1 and peak 2 decreased to more extents as bsa was incubated with go 1 and go 3 fortifying that the photoaged go induced more serious change in conformational structure of bsa than pristine go 3 5 effect of go on fibrillation of bsa fibrillation of proteins is always related with many kinds of diseases basu et al 2020 juárez et al 2009 such as huntington s disease and is sensitive to the conformational structure of proteins thioflavin t was used as the fluorescent dye to reveal the impacts of go on the fibrillation of bsa because it displays strong fluorescence intensity when it binds with bsa guan et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 go significantly reduced the thioflavin t fluorescence intensity of bsa and go 3 incurred the strongest effect these results revealed that the go particularly the photoaged go might change the cross β sheet structures of bsa and then prevented the fibrillation of bsa these results indicated that relative to pristine go the photoaged go could remarkably change the conformational structure of bsa and finally exerted strong impacts on the biological function of bsa 4 conclusions in this study various characterization techniques were used to reveal the conformational structure and biological function of proteins after their binding with go collective results revealed that compared to pristine go photoaged go with smaller lateral size resulted in more serious changes in conformational structure and biological function of bsa as for the positively charged lysozyme the strong electrostatic attractive interaction between them diminished the photoaging effect hydrogen bonding and van der waals force as the main interaction forces were mainly responsible for the binding between the go and bsa given that photoaging is prevalent once go are released in the environment more studies are warranted in future to further understand the environmental

16124,graphene oxide go are subjected to photoaging in aquatic environment and inevitably enter biota and then interact with proteins here the interactions of pristine and photoaged go with two typical proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and lysozyme were systematically investigated due to long term photoirradiation 1 3 day the lateral size of go decreased greatly and the oxygen containing groups decreased as well while the graphitic carbon contents increased compared to pristine go the photoaged go displayed stronger binding affinities with both proteins which was mainly attributed to the increased binding sites as a result of smaller lateral size and increased hydrophobicity the photoaging effect was more obvious for the negatively charged bsa because hydrogen bonding and van der waals force were mainly involved in the enthalpy driven interactions between them while the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged lysozyme and go diminished the photoaging effect analyses of synchronous three dimensional fluorescence spectra and fibrillation experiments intensified that the photoaged go induced more serious changes in conformational structure of bsa and exhibited stronger inhibition on fibrillation of bsa compared to pristine go this study provided novel insights into the increased ecological risks of go as a result of photoaging graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords graphene oxide go proteins photoaged conformational structure fibrillation 1 introduction as one typical two dimensional carbon nanomaterial graphene oxide go has found wide applications in many fields ranging from environmental protection to nanomedicine loh et al 2010 mao et al 2013 perreault et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 consequently they are inevitably released into natural aquatic environment ren et al 2018 suarez iglesias et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 thus triggering growing concerns on their biological exposure and ecological risks park et al 2017 yao et al 2019 go could accumulate in organisms chen et al 2021 and had the potential to be transferred into human through food chain lu et al 2017 proteins are important components to maintain the life activity of organisms once go enter biological systems they may interact with proteins and a protein corona would be formed on their surface huang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 protein corona is a protein layer adsorbed onto nanoparticles upon contact with biofluids chong et al 2015 yan et al 2019 such interactions may alter the conformational structures of proteins and then affect their biological functions malik et al 2020 pandit and de 2020 therefore understanding the interactions between go and proteins and the induced changes in the protein conformational structures is crucial for predicting the biological risks of go to human health liu et al 2019 martínez negro et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 the interactions between go and protein are largely determined by the physicochemical properties of go huang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 once released into the environment go would experience aging processes under multiple actions such as photoirradiation and the physicochemical properties may change distinctly du et al 2019 sun et al 2021 reduced graphene oxides rgo could be formed as a result of chemical reduction and photoirradiation but in different extents chowdhury et al 2015b zhao et al 2014 generally chemical reduction significantly enhanced the hydrophobicity and lateral size of the rgo relative to the pristine one bai et al 2017 qi et al 2019 wei et al 2015 consequently the aggregation status of go and rgo in physiological environment were different and then greatly affected their interactions with fetal bovine serum qi et al 2019 it was demonstrated that the chemically reduced rgo exhibited lower colloidal dispersion thus lower inhibition effect on the lysozyme activity bai et al 2017 different from the chemical reduction process photoaging as a relatively mild process did not largely reduce the content of go surface oxygen containing groups but might break large nanosheets into smaller ones gao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 chowdhury et al 2015a reported that the c o ratio of go slightly increased from 1 72 to 2 0 while its effective diameter decreased from 200 nm to 130 nm after exposure to 1 kw xenon lamp for 11 h usually smaller sized nanomaterials exhibit stronger affinity with proteins due to the increased surface areas šimšíková 2016 sun et al 2020 our previous study indicated that the photoaged go displayed comparable dispersion as the pristine one while the chemically reduced rgo inclined to form large aggregates in electrolyte solution sun et al 2021 the changes induced by photoaging might result in interesting differences in the binding interactions of go with proteins concentration of protein in biological fluids is usually as high as g l gan et al 2015 and their surface charge molecular structure and weight vary distinctly chong et al 2015 these features of proteins may also affect their interactions with pristine and photoaged go and eventually change their conformational structure and biological functions in this study the interactions of pristine and photoaged go with model proteins were systematically investigated at molecular level there are various types of proteins in different body fluids table s4 and bovine serum albumin bsa and lysozyme were selected as model proteins due to their wide presence in biological environment as well as their significant different conformational structure surface charge and contents of amide acid residues bai et al 2017 gan et al 2015 both bsa and lysozyme are globular proteins and their molecular weights are 68 and 14 3 kda respectively du et al 2014 and their physicochemical properties are shown in table s5 bsa has 583 amino acid residues with 29 α helices and three structurally similar domains 35 cysteine residues of bsa are involved in 17 disulfide bridges among which there are eight double disulfide bridges nan et al 2019 lysozyme comprises of 129 amino acid residues having 6 tryptophan three tyrosine residues and 4 disulfide bonds and it was positively charged in physiological ph 7 4 du et al 2014 this study aims to disclose 1 the impacts of sunlight irradiation on the physicochemical properties of go 2 the intrinsic mechanisms accounting for the interactions between the go and both proteins 3 the impacts of the photoaged go on the protein conformational structure and biological functions this work would provide novel insights into the interactions between proteins and environmentally photoaged go and is of importance in predicting ecological risk of go in physiological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents single layer go powder was purchased from tianjin plannano energy technologies co ltd tianjin china lyophilized powder of bsa a2153 and lysozyme 62 970 1g f were both supplied by sigma aldrich company st louis mo usa the protein powders were freshly dissolved in phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 and stored at 4 phosphate buffered saline pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 was prepared by dissolving 8 0 g nacl 0 2 g kcl 2 9 g na2hpo4 and 0 2 g kh2po4 in 1 l ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of pristine and photoaged go forty mg of pristine go was put into a dried and clean glass bottle and then 400 ml of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm hhitech china was added the suspension was stirred at 600 rpm for one night and ultrasonicated in ice bath for 6 h to get the go stock solution 40 ml of go solution was added into the 50 ml transparent quartz tube with 30 mm magneton 300 rpm min photochemical reaction apparatus xpa 7 xu jiang machine plant nanjing china with a cyclic water installation was used to stimulate environmental photoaged process of go wavelength range diagram of 800 w xenon lamp is shown in figure s1 the go suspension was irradiated for 8 h per day for 3 days making a total of 3 days the samples photoaged for different periods 0 1 and 3 days were labelled as go 0 go 1 and go 3 respectively pristine and photoaged go stock solution were ultrasonicated for 10 min before each set of experiment concentrations of pristine and photoaged go were normalized to the corresponding experimental concentrations sufficient go suspensions were photoaged for different periods and freeze dried to get lyophilized powder for the following physicochemical characterization morphologies and lateral sizes of the pristine and photoaged go were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem gemini 500 zeiss germany chemical compositions and functional groups of go were characterized by uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ulvac phi japan respectively high temperature oxidation multi n c3100 analytik jena germany was used to measure the total organic carbon toc of go suspensions the detailed information for go characterizations were described in our previous studies sun et al 2018 2021 2020 2 3 hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential the intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter d h and zeta potential of pristine and photoaged go with and without proteins were conducted by time resolved dynamic light scattering on zetasizer malvern nano zs90 uk sun et al 2018 2020 the concentrations of go and proteins were fixed at 10 and 100 mg l respectively each measurement was conducted for at least three times 2 4 fluorescence spectroscopy steady state fluorescence spectra were conducted by hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer equipped with xe lamp hitachi japan fluorescence spectra of the proteins as a function of go concentration were recorded over an emission wavelength range of 290 500 nm at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm with 2 5 nm emission and excitation slit 10 ml of the go solutions at different concentrations were added into equal volume of protein suspensions at fixed concentration 100 mg l and then incubated at 289 298 and 310 k for 60 min the effect of interaction time 0 30 and 60 min on fluorescence spectra of proteins as functions of go concentrations was investigated at 298 k synchronous fluorescent spectra of protein were recorded with the excitation wavelength over a range of 200 500 nm while the emission spectra were set as 215 nm δλ 15 nm and 260 nm δλ 60 nm respectively protein concentration was kept at 100 mg l and the concentrations of pristine and photoaged go varied in the range of 0 25 mg l three dimensional fluorescence spectra of go bsa and go bsa complex were recorded on hitachi f 7000 fl spectrophotometer the excitation wavelength ranged from 200 to 500 nm while the emission wavelength was over a range of 240 to 550 nm with 5 0 nm sampling intervals of both excitation and emission the scan speed was 12 000 nm min and the emission and excitation slits were 2 5 nm the concentration of protein was 100 mg l while the pristine and photoaged go concentrations were 12 5 mg l 2 6 fibrillation of bsa in the absence and presence of pristine and photoaged go initial concentration of bsa for fibrillation was 5000 mg l to provide strong fluorescence intensity over an emission wavelength range of 450 600 nm at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm with 5 nm emission and excitation slit bsa was firstly incubated with the pristine and photoaged go for about 30 min then 120 μm thioflavin t was added and the mixed solution was incubated for another 30 min at ph 7 4 and 298 k effects of pristine and photoaged go on bsa fluorescence spectra were recorded using the corresponding go as the references 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the pristine and photoaged go simulated solar light irradiation significantly affected the physicochemical properties of go gao et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the surface morphology and lateral size of the go were examined by fesem figure s2 and the images indicated that all go samples were in the form of nanosheets and their lateral size decreased within the irradiation time as shown in figure s3 the mean lateral size of go 0 go 1 and go 3 were 1403 1 362 5 570 9 212 2 and 242 4 83 4 nm respectively consistent with the fesem results the d h of the go decreased from the original 237 1 nm to 210 6 nm after 3 days irradiation fig 1 a table s1 these revealed that the large go nanosheets were broken due to sufficient photoirradiation this change in morphology was accompanied by the decrease of toc content and that of go 3 was about 86 of go 0 table s1 previous studies reported that long term photoaging resulted in go degradation with formation of co2 and soluble low molecular weight substances hou et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 fig 1b illustrates that the uv vis absorbance of the go in the range of 250 700 nm increased with the irradiation time due to the restoration of sp2 π conjugated network li et al 2008 suggesting the formation of light absorbing transformation products which was in agreement with the darker color of photoaged go figure s4 additionally the maximum absorption wavelength shifted toward the blue region as the irradiation time increased which might be due to the decreased π conjugated domains luo et al 2010 sun et al 2020 the c 1 s xps spectra shown in figure s5 further reveal the changes of go surface functional groups the o content decreased from 32 24 for go 0 to 27 36 for go 3 and the carbon to oxygen c o ratio increased from 2 10 for go 0 to 2 66 for go 3 which evidenced that photoirradiation induced mild reduction of the go c 1 s xps profiles of the pristine and photoaged go with characteristic peaks at 284 4 286 5 287 8 and 288 8 ev which represents aromatic rings cc c c epoxy hydroxyl co c coh carbonyl c o and carboxyl oc o functional groups respectively the contents of the functional groups are listed in table s2 specially the oxygen containing functional groups including co c o and oc o groups decreased from 56 74 for the go 0 to 42 05 for go 3 while the graphitic carbon contents cc and c c groups increased from 43 26 to 57 95 in pure water without any salts the zeta potentials of the go 1 and go 3 were similar to that of go 0 which was around 45 mv table s1 indicating that light irradiation did not significantly change the surface charge of go sun et al 2021 the large negative zeta potentials of the go suggested that the all go were stable during the light exposure process gao et al 2020 3 2 stability of pristine and photoaged go in physiological environment protein stability is important to maintain its conformational structure and bioactivity huang et al 2020 yan et al 2021 for both bsa and lysozyme at different concentrations their respective uv vis and fluorescent spectra as well as the d h values in the presence of pbs did not change distinctly relative to those in the absence of pbs figure s6 s7 these results indicated that both proteins were stable and were not decomposed at the experimental conditions the colloidal states of the go in physiological environment is an important factor determining their biological effects sun et al 2021 the stability and zeta potentials of the go in the presence of proteins at 100 mg l are shown in fig 2 the isoelectric point of go was reported to be lower than 2 wu et al 2013 the isoelectric points of bsa and lysozyme are 4 7 and 11 3 respectively du et al 2014 in pbs solution the zeta potential of the go bsa conjugate was all about 23 mv the mass ratio of bsa 100 mg l to go was 10 the strong steric repulsion induced by the high concentration of bsa favored the dispersion of the go as stable colloidal states sun et al 2020 the tem images figure s8 also revealed that the photoaged go nanoparticles were well dispersed in solution of 100 mg l bsa in the presence of lysozyme all the go nanomaterials quickly formed large aggregates and their zeta potential were all 5 mv which might be attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between go and lysozyme at ph 7 4 previous study indicated that aggregation morphology remarkably affected the protein affinities of go and the go with higher reduction degree were more easily to aggregate in fetal serum albumin thus depressed their binding with proteins qi et al 2019 the different stability and dispersion states of go might induce their greatly different binding affinities with both proteins which are going to be discussed as follows 3 3 thermodynamics for the binding between go 0 and proteins go 0 was chosen as the typical quencher of protein fluorescent spectra to investigate the effect of incubation time and temperature on the interactions between go and proteins wei and ge 2013 and the results are shown in figs s9 and s10 go 0 did not show any fluorescent absorption fig s11 suggesting that the observed fluorescent spectra of the go protein complexes were originated from the proteins wei and ge 2013 bsa and lysozyme both exhibited a characteristic intrinsic fluorescence with an emission peak of 340 nm at the 280 nm excitation wavelength which was ascribed to tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acid residues in them gan et al 2015 kuchlyan et al 2015 wei et al 2015 as the go 0 concentration increased the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm decreased remarkably without significant shift of the peak position indicating that there was strong binding affinity between go and the aromatic amino acid residues of both proteins šimšíková 2016 the emission intensity of bsa decreased as the incubation time extended from 0 to 60 min fig s9d implying that it took time for them to interact with each other to form complex gradually while for lysozyme the intensity did not change much with the incubation time which might be attributed to the strong and fast electrostatic interaction between them bai et al 2017 li et al 2014 the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged go and the positively charged lysozyme was so strong that the complexion between them reached equilibrium quickly once they were incubated together li et al 2022 considering that go was unstable in the presence of lysozyme and quickly formed large aggregates bsa was chosen to further understand the thermodynamic of the go 0 and bsa interaction as shown in figure s12 the fluorescence intensity of bsa in the presence of go 0 decreased with the increase of incubation temperature the fluorescence quenching process of bsa was then analyzed by the modified stern volmer formula huang et al 2020 1 f 0 f 0 f 1 f a 1 q 1 f a k a where f 0 and f are the emission maximum values of bsa in the absence and presence of go 0 k a is the binding constant of bsa and f a is the molar fraction of solvent accessible fluorophore and q is the concentration of go mol l the molecular weight of go is 1036 g mol huang et al 2020 the calculated k a of bsa quenched by go 0 at 289 k 298 k and 310 k were 1 2 0 87 and 0 04 respectively table s3 the decrease of k a with increasing temperature indicated that it was a static quenching process with no distinct electron transfer between go 0 and bsa nan et al 2019 šimšíková 2016 wei and ge 2013 proteins could interact with go through electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds van der waals interaction and hydrophobic interactions kuchlyan et al 2015 thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between go and proteins such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were calculated as the following equations huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 2 l n k a δ h r t δ s r 3 δ g δ h t δ s the calculated δg δh and δs values are shown in table s3 and all the values were negative under the experimental temperatures the negative δg values revealed that the reaction between go 0 and bsa was spontaneous and favorable huang et al 2020 the negative δh and δs revealed that the interaction was an exothermic and entropy decreasing process and mainly driven by enthalpy nan et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the result also revealed that hydrogen bonds and van der waals force were mainly responsible for the interaction between go 0 and bsa nan et al 2019 xu et al 2018 3 4 binding affinities and mechanisms between proteins and the go 3 4 1 binding affinity between proteins and the go steady state fluorescence emission spectra of bsa and lysozymes and the f f0 ratios as a function of the go concentrations are shown in figs 3 s13 and s14 the f f0 of bsa 100 mg l quenched by go 0 go 1 and go 3 at 20 mg l were 0 41 0 27 and 0 15 respectively while the f f0 of lysozyme quenched by go 0 go 1 and go 3 at 12 5 mg l were 0 33 0 28 and 0 25 respectively these indicated that after photoaging the interactions between the go and proteins became stronger and this effect was more significant for go bsa interaction in line with this the adsorption results fig s15 certified that the photoaged go had greater affinity with bsa than pristine go in physiological environment in the process of photoaging pristine go was broken into smaller nanosheets accompanied by the formation of soluble hydroxylated and or carboxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds cao et al 2021 hou et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 which might bind with proteins strongly chen et al 2020 thus the filtrate of the go 50 mg l were collected by filtered them through a 100 nm nylon membrane fig s16 which was then incubated with the proteins the fluorescence of bsa 100 mg l did not change much as incubated with the filtrates fig s17 revealing that the low molecular weight species derived from go photoaging did not interact with bsa distinctly the surface oxygen containing groups of go decreased with increasing irradiation time thus the hydrophobic interaction between the go and bsa should become stronger sun et al 2021 as discussed above the main interactions between the go and bsa were hydrogen bonds and van der waals forces so the enhanced hydrophobic interaction might not be the main reason accounting for the stronger affinity between bsa and the photoaged go the calculated adsorption layer on go increased with the increase of irradiation time which also supported that photoaged go had greater affinity with bsa table s6 figure s18 demonstrates the long term stability 12 h of go 1 and go 3 at different concentrations 0 25 mg l in the presence of bsa fortifying that the photoaged go were stable and could maintain their dispersion in bsa solution therefore the photoaged go exhibited better fluorescence quenching ability than go 0 which could be ascribed to the increased binding sites as a result of reduced particle size šimšíková 2016 sun et al 2020 for lysozyme there was marginal difference in the quenching ability among the go which could be attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions between them this was magnified by the large aggregates of go lysozyme conjugates observed after they were incubated for 12 h fig s18 these results indicated that interactions between go and proteins were dependent on both the physicochemical properties of go and proteins 3 4 2 synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy analysis synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy could provide the effective microenvironmental information of proteins particularly in the vicinity of the fluorophore functional groups such as tryptophan and tyrosine residues nan et al 2019 bsa was chosen as the model protein and the fluorescence spectra are shown in figs s19 and s20 when δλ was set at 15 or 60 nm the fluorescence spectra of bsa only exhibited the characteristic fluorescence peaks of tyrosine residues or tryptophan residues xu et al 2018 the corresponding f f0 ratios as a function of the go concentrations are shown in fig 4 the fluorescence maximum emission intensity of tryptophan of bsa was much higher than that of tyrosine suggesting the fluorescence intensity of bsa was mainly contributed by tryptophan the effect of go on the change in fluorescence intensity of tryptophan residue was much higher than that of tyrosine residue compared with go 0 go 3 exhibited stronger quenching effect for both tyrosine and tryptophan residues the maximum emission peak of tyrosine kept at 284 2 nm with increasing go concentrations suggesting that the go did not change microenvironment of tyrosine residues wei and ge 2013 with increasing concentration of go 0 the maximum emission peak of tryptophan remained at 279 4 nm while with the increase of go 3 concentration the maximum emission peak of tryptophan increased from 278 4 to 280 4 nm implying that the tryptophan residues changed to a more hydrophilic microenvironment and were more exposed to the external environment wei and ge 2013 these magnified that the photoaged go displayed stronger interactions with bsa molecules and caused more serious conformational changes of bsa than the pristine go 3 4 3 three dimensional fluorescence spectra analysis three dimensional fluorescence spectra could provide visual information about change of conformational structure of bsa the isometric three dimensional contour spectra and projections of bsa 100 mg l in the absence and presence of go are displayed in figs 5 and s21 the go 0 go 1 and go 3 had low intensity of three dimensional fluorescence spectra fig s22 as shown in fig s21a and table 1 bsa itself exhibited two obvious peaks peak 1 λex em 275 355 nm and peak 2 λex em 230 355 nm peak 1 mainly revealed the characteristic fluorescence spectra of tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acid residues in bsa huang et al 2020 xu et al 2018 peak 2 was the characteristic fluorescence spectra of polypeptide backbone structure of bsa huang et al 2020 in the presence of go 0 the intensity of peak 1 decreased distinctly the microenvironment of these amino acid residues changed huang et al 2020 the intensity of peak 2 also decreased implying the peptide strand structure of bsa was altered huang et al 2020 comparatively both peak 1 and peak 2 decreased to more extents as bsa was incubated with go 1 and go 3 fortifying that the photoaged go induced more serious change in conformational structure of bsa than pristine go 3 5 effect of go on fibrillation of bsa fibrillation of proteins is always related with many kinds of diseases basu et al 2020 juárez et al 2009 such as huntington s disease and is sensitive to the conformational structure of proteins thioflavin t was used as the fluorescent dye to reveal the impacts of go on the fibrillation of bsa because it displays strong fluorescence intensity when it binds with bsa guan et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 go significantly reduced the thioflavin t fluorescence intensity of bsa and go 3 incurred the strongest effect these results revealed that the go particularly the photoaged go might change the cross β sheet structures of bsa and then prevented the fibrillation of bsa these results indicated that relative to pristine go the photoaged go could remarkably change the conformational structure of bsa and finally exerted strong impacts on the biological function of bsa 4 conclusions in this study various characterization techniques were used to reveal the conformational structure and biological function of proteins after their binding with go collective results revealed that compared to pristine go photoaged go with smaller lateral size resulted in more serious changes in conformational structure and biological function of bsa as for the positively charged lysozyme the strong electrostatic attractive interaction between them diminished the photoaging effect hydrogen bonding and van der waals force as the main interaction forces were mainly responsible for the binding between the go and bsa given that photoaging is prevalent once go are released in the environment more studies are warranted in future to further understand the environmental
