25090,there are two evolutionary trends in genome organization among microbes towards either amplification or reduction which evolutionary scenario overcomes depends on environmental conditions and the complexity of gene networks determining phenotypic traits such as metabolic features of cells in this simulation study we have shown that the habitats characterized by nutrient gradients allow spatial subdivision of evolutionary trends depending on the distance to the nutrient source we have considered interrelations between cell motility metabolic complexity of dominant populations and ecological features of developing communities and have shown that the distribution of local dominant ecogroups follows clear patterns in chemotaxis on and off cases chemotaxis was shown to be a factor impeding introduction of new forms and decreasing total biomass of the community our simulations have shown that ecological patterns of self organization of microbial communities cause sustainable different strategies underlying antagonistic evolutionary scenarios keywords microbial communities individual based modelling ecological modelling evolutionary modelling spatial heterogeneity stratification 1 introduction microorganisms build up the world of large communities and compact genomes however depending on the environmental conditions the evolution of prokaryotic genomes might result in genome reduction or genome amplification gene loss in vitro in bacteria mira et al 2001 genome reduction in parasites moran 2002 and genome size optimization under syntrophy kunin and ouzounis 2003 mccutcheon and moran 2011 exemplify the trend for reduction on the other hand the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes rodrıguez martinez et al 2006 händel et al 2016 acquisition of genes essential for surviving in extreme conditions nelson et al 1999 nesbo et al 2001 and symbiogenesis margulis 1970 archibald 2011 cavalier smith 2013 provorov et al 2016 present the trend towards genome amplification active processes of gene material exchange occur in microbial communities providing microorganisms with a capacity to adapt to a broad spectrum of environmental conditions without the necessity to include all the metabolic toolboxes in every particular genome barraclough et al 2012 niehus et al 2015 soucy et al 2015 therefore if an environment changes the organisms that have acquired the adaptive genes might rapidly get an advantage over other species and then get rid of extra genes when environmental conditions alter again maslov et al 2009 pang and maslov 2011 polz et al 2013 langridge et al 2015 generally such processes involve so called accessory genome gogarten and townsend 2005 the major part of accessory genes with known function in escherichia coli are known to be responsible for metabolism soucy et al 2015 mcinerney et al 2017 however a large genome size implies concomitant maintenance caused on the one hand by the increased time and resources spent on genome replication and on the other hand by increased probability of acquiring lethal mutations eigen 1971 weiße et al 2015 that leads towards so called black queen dynamics certain costly biological functions such as detoxification of hydrogen peroxide tend to concentrate in a small subset of individuals in the community which provide this function for others as a public good consequently this dynamics contribute to the development of symbiotrophic communities of mutually interdependent microbial species morris et al 2012 fullmer et al 2015 overall the above factors constrain genome expansion in prokaryotes providing a stimulus towards reductionist evolutionary scenarios another factor of evolution determining the specifics of struggle for existence in microbial ecosystems is adaptive migrations of microorganisms niehus et al 2015 bridier et al 2017 changes of environmental conditions make a population of microbes to face the following adaptive crossroads the first option is the phenotypical adaptation e g via adjusting its metabolism to alternative energy sources the second is undergoing adaptive evolution that favors more efficient utilization of the available nutrient reserves or the third way is to migrate pursuing optimal environmental conditions intruding new habitats and engaging in competition with local species callahan et al 2014 chew et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the impact of such adaptive individual behavior on a developmental scenario of the whole community is of current interest for acquiring more profound comprehension of interactions between various evolutionary mechanisms there is a number of classifications of living organisms based on ecologically significant traits the majority of them relies upon the ecological amplitude of the species projected on a certain ecological factor for instance microorganisms fall into the following ecophysiological groups zavarzin and kolotilova 2001 based on their preferred temperature of the environment psychrophiles mesophiles thermophiles extreme thermophiles and hyperthermophiles based on their preferred ph acidophiles 2 ph 6 neutrophiles 6 ph 8 and alkaliphiles 8 5 ph 11 based on oxygen conditions aerobes and anaerobes etc another classification is introduced based on the analysis of energy fluxes in an ecosystem proposing such categories as producers first second and higher order consumers and decomposers pomeroy et al 1988 there is another prominent classification based on pairwise interactions between species commensalism amensalism mutualism competition and neutralism lidicker 1979 faust and raes 2012 however besides these classifications there is a typology based on ecological function that living organisms perform in their communities for example henriette poplavskaya poplavskaya 1924 and vladimir sukachev sukachev 1928 developed such a classification for plant communities they proposed such phytosocial types as aedificators and assectators based on the role that species act upon in the community structure and its succession the former act as community builders either in natural conditions autochthonous aedificators or as a result of perturbations of the community caused by a short term disturbance by a human being or an animal degressive aedificators the latter on the other hand act as community co builders being however insignificant for its phytosocial milieu leonty ramensky ramenskyi 1935 and john grime grime 1974 independently proposed a system triangular model of primary plant strategies or csr theory classifying plants based on their adaptive strategies the following two factors were regarded as foundational stress intensity that restricts photosynthetic production and disturbance intensity that breaches the phytocenosis integrity caused by either biotic or abiotic factors three possible strategies determine such three major phytocenotypes as highly productive competitors robust stress tolerators and ruderals which are noncompetitive though rapidly colonizing recently disturbed areas in phytocenoses and there is a number of intermediate types as well the csr theory has been recently adapted to microbial functional traits for methane oxidizing bacteria and in a generalized manner ho et al 2013 krause et al 2014 agent based modelling abm is an approach that has been extensively used for modelling of ecological grimm et al 2017 and evolutionary liu et al 2017 processes in the recent decade abm allows to develop flexible models taking into account multiple factors and individual interactions between the agents in the system applying agent based modelling to microbial ecosystems shed the light on the processes of biofilm self assembly chemotaxis and other aspects of their functioning wimpenny and colasanti 1997 kreft et al 1998 picioreanu et al 2004 emonet et al 2005 bihary et al 2012 ravikrishnan and raman 2018 the models of genome amplification and reduction in various ecological conditions were investigated for well mixed environments 0d models in our previous studies lashin et al 2012 it was shown that in pessimal environmental conditions characterized by low inflow of nonspecific nutrient populations of cells with metabolically complete or metabolically rich genomes i e capable of utilizing all or almost all the nutrients that are present in the modelled environment respectively prevail in the community on the other hand it was also demonstrated that suboptimal and optimal conditions manifest a steady trend towards genome reduction the most primitive populations capable of only two metabolic activities utilization of one nonspecific and one specific nutrients displaced others in this study we have applied the haploid evolutionary constructor software package hec for more details see methods section klimenko et al 2015 2016 to investigate the impact of spatial gradients of nutrients and environment structure on genome amplification and reduction trends in communities of microorganisms inhabiting a flow through environment the aim of the study is to gain insights out of modelling and to elucidate how these spatial gradients of ecological factors and cells motility affect the ecological and population structures of developing communities and evolutionary scenarios in local habitats we turned on and off the ability of cells to migrate adaptively via chemotaxis the following problems have been addressed is there any correlation of ecological conditions and metabolic complexity genome size of the dominant population how does the chemotaxis ability affect species richness and total biomass of the community how does the chemotaxis ability influence the development of the ecological structure in evolving communities 2 methods 2 1 model the models of functioning and evolution of microbial communities were simulated using the haploid evolutionary constructor hec software package lashin et al 2007 klimenko et al 2015 which is based on the agent based approach and super individual concept scheffer et al 1995 hec meets the requirements for the next generation ecological modelling grimm and berger 2016 since it is based on the first principles linking behavior and physiology to ecology adopts trait based approach to describe microbial functional types adds microevolution enables describing heterogeneous and dynamic abiotic environments and obtains modular multi layer structure the key simulation unit in hec is a super individual like agent which describes a genetically homogeneous population of cells that interacts with its environment and other populations that are genetically different from each other all the present populations as a group constitute a microbial community the following set of objects and processes is considered in this simulation approach objects environment an aquatic flow through environment is described by a lattice of well mixed sub habitats nodes populated with cells and substances nutrients we regard any substance affecting the cell growth as a nutrient cells can either secrete nutrients that were synthesized inside them in this case we call such nutrients specific ones or consume nutrients and use them for cell s growth and reproduction those nutrients that come into the environment via the flow are called nonspecific ones nonspecific nutrients describe external energy source that nourishes microbial ecosystems that corresponds to dissolved organic matter glucose or some other kind of substrate that is widely nonspecifically used by members of microbial community for their growth and maintenance the specific nutrients can either stimulate population growth or suppress it and even cause the drastic reduction of its population size populations a population is characterized by a set of metabolic systems model genes corresponding to metabolic functions that determine which nutrients and how rapidly the cells of the population are able to consume and produce processes consumption of nutrients captured from the environment and secretion of products of cell metabolism nutrient exchange among the populations in the habitat mediated by the fluid environment reproduction in populations and natural selection mutations mutations are described as a change of allele value of a certain gene in one or several cells of the population gene loss cells might lose some genes generating a new population possessing a genome that is different from the original one horizontal gene transfer cells that belong to different populations are able to exchange genes involved in metabolism functioning resulting in an emergence of new populations these processes contributing into microbial population dynamics were described using the following equation lashin et al 2012 1 δ p f n 0 s r 0 c p g r 0 n 0 p i i c o n s u m e d c i s i p k d e a t h p 2 b g k 1 n g k 1 n g n 1 p where δ p is the change of population size abundance biomass per iteration n 0 an amount of nonspecific nutrient consumed by the cells of the population from the environment s numerical vector corresponding to amounts of the specific nutrients si are the elements of s consumed from the environment r 0 genetically determined nonspecific nutrient utilization rate c vector of specific nutrient utilization rates traits controlled by corresponding genes ci are the elements of c p population size abundance number of cells g number of metabolic systems of the population characterizes the length of the corresponding genome i c o n s u m e d set of indices of specific nutrients consumed by the cells of the population k d e a t h death coefficient b penalty coefficient k 1 a parameter that determines the threshold value for increase of genome size penalty n a degree of nonlinearity of genome size penalty actually n 0 and si are functions of p since the amount of consumed nutrients is proportional to the population size see supplementary materials for details the first term refers to uptake of energy the second term accounts for the negative density dependence and the last term describes a genome size metabolic complexity penalty the population growth rate is positively affected by an amount and number of consumed nutrients and negatively affected by both time spent on the replication in our case it depends on the number of metabolic systems and therefore metabolic complexity can be considered as an indirect measure of the genome size and time spent on utilizing the nutrients we chose k 1 n and b parameters eq 1 equal to 0 37 10 0 and 0 01 respectively which corresponds to a low genome size penalty according to the classification presented in lashin et al 2012 in the case of motile cells we regard 10 of the population as active migrants which is in broad agreement with observed values for coastal seawater samples mitchell et al 1995 we have carried out a number of simulations using the models of evolution and development of a microbial community inhabiting a spatially structured environment we considered two types of 10 noded 1d tubes the first is the tube with non permeable boundaries fig 1 c 1d simple and the second is the tube with semi permeable boundaries fig 1c 1d spb both types of tubes have reasonable physical meaning for instance sewage pipes exemplify 1d simple tubes while natural streams and brooks illustrate 1d spb environments yao and le maguer 1996 gruber et al 2011 the tubes are supplied with a nonspecific nutrient which is consumed by all cells from one side source the beginning of the tube fig 1c left side of both tubes the nonspecific nutrient as well as specific ones produced by cells of the community distribute further by diffusion and flow the flow also transports the cells through the tube from source to sink in the end of the tube sink nutrients and cells wash out of the environment fig 1c right side besides passive transport we also consider chemotaxis ability of the cells i e adaptive migrations towards more favorable environmental conditions in terms of nutrient saturation we examined both cases of the community consisting of motile chemotaxis on case and nonmotile chemotaxis off case cells hereafter we call the community that has established at the end of a simulation run as the developed community 2 1 1 model m1 deterministic model of a complete microbial community we define the deterministic model of a complete microbial community exposed to the natural selection as model m1 a complete community according to our definition is such a community that consists of populations possessing all feasible metabolic combinations for the system with three specific and one nonspecific nutrient see fig 1d initially those populations had the equal abundances one million cells for each population 105 cells per node of the tube for each population initial concentrations of nonspecific and specific nutrients n1 s1 s2 s3 were set to 10 6 m in each node of the tube we have examined the impact of cells motility on the final ecological structure that develops as a result of development of communities of a particular type thereby we have found typical distributions of ecogroup abundances independent of such stochastic factors as hgt gene loss time and place of origin and rather determined by the fitness of the populations constituting corresponding ecogroups 2 1 2 model m2 stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community we define the stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community as model m2 initially the community comprises a trophic ring of three symbiotic populations all three initial populations of cells belong to a quasi mutualist ecogroup each population produces a specific nutrient that is consumed by the following population in clock wise direction fig 1a the initial conditions regarding to the population sizes and concentrations of nutrients were set the same as in the model m1 these model genes are meant to be essential for metabolic systems of the cells providing them with an ability either to utilize or to synthesize a specific nutrient during the simulation course the processes of horizontal gene transfer and or gene loss occur with the probability equal to 10 7 per cell per generation thus novel populations characterized by novel sets of metabolic functions emerge resulting in further evolution of the community as it is previously described in fig 1b 2 2 ecological functional groups ecogroups for the convenience of further analysis we have proposed the classification that takes into account on the one hand the role of organisms in their mutual interactions and on the other hand involves their function in the community structure estimating the complexity of their metabolism therefore we classify all possible populations in the model with one nonspecific and three specific nutrients based on two features number of specific metabolic systems m the range of metabolic activities and skew u the number of metabolic systems of synthesis the number of metabolic systems of utilization of specific nutrients towards either utilization negative semi axis or synthesis positive semi axis thereby building our classification we have synthesized approaches based on pairwise interactions of species and those based on population function in the community organization we have called the resulting classes ecogroups and given them names according to their ecological role performed by their representatives in a community fig 2 the number of specific metabolic systems m can be used to distinguish populations of microorganisms possessing relatively small and large genomes and respective ranges of metabolic activities different criteria are to be applied for each of these groups considering their ecological functional status given m 3 populations possessing small genomes minimal genome the only one population that is able to utilize only nonspecific nutrient and does not produce anything producers are positioned along the altruism line a class of organisms generating metabolic impasses that can be utilized by other organisms as an energy source structural component electron donor or acceptor etc quasi commensals are positioned along the egoism line a class of organisms consuming products of others in contrast with classic commensals quasi commensals compete for a nonspecific nutrient with their breadwinners lying between egoism and altruism lines symmetrically with respect to balance line quasi mutualists constitute a class of organisms possessing a small and relatively balanced genome with respect to utilization synthesis and therefore potentially capable of making symbiotic trophic rings with other similar organisms in contrast with classic mutualists quasi mutualists compete for a nonspecific nutrient with their symbionts given 4 m 6 populations possessing large genomes given u 2 a population belongs either to quasi commensal ecogroup or to producer ecogroup depending on the u sign see fig 6 since we consider in our model only those ecogroups that can be distinguished based on three kinds of specific nutrients none of the populations can have more than three metabolic systems of the same type either utilization or synthesis that inevitably implies in case of large genomes a necessity to have metabolic systems of another type as well therefore the populations possessing a large genome skewed significantly towards either utilization or synthesis also fall into these classes respectively all other populations belong to aedificator class the populations possessing large though balanced genome and characterized by a wide range of metabolic activities and thereby transforming the environment significantly thus affecting many other populations in the community 2 3 analysis workflow we have carried out a number of simulations using the models of evolution and development of a microbial community inhabiting a spatially structured environment there is a feasible set of metabolic systems combinations in the model that can be reached as new forms emerge due to horizontal gene transfer hgt and gene loss fig 1d the populations with metabolically rich genome gather on one pole whereas metabolically poor and minimal genomes meet on another one the populations of cells characterized by a particular combination of metabolic systems may be divided into five categories according to their functional role in the ecosystem we refer to these groups as ecological functional groups or ecogroups further aedificators quasi commensals quasi mutualists producers and minimal genome for more details see the methods section the ecogroups have been used to analyze the processes of ecosystem development in the model we regard a population in the community possessing the maximum size among all of the populations as a dominant population we defined a threshold distinguishing the dominant population from non dominant populations as a number of cells that discriminate between the sizes of the dominant population with maximum size and the non dominant population with maximum size among all non dominant populations see fig s0 in supplementary materials so that multiple dominants are possible we have focused our analysis primarily on the case of the tubes with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb since this case exhibit more diverse patterns than the case of the tube with non permeable boundaries 1d simple does however we discuss the influence of the structure of the environment in detail in the 3 4 section the results of each simulation run were analyzed as follows 1 local dominant metabolic complexity analysis what locations of the environment are dominated by the populations with generalized and specialized metabolism 2 evaluation of the metabolic complexity level which of the trends detected on the 1st step are true not only for the dominant populations but for the whole community as well 3 the analysis of ecological function that locally dominant populations perform in the microbial community 4 ecogroup abundance dynamics analysis associate transformations of ecological structure of a community with its population dynamics for both motile and nonmotile cells 5 principal component analysis pca of the ecogroup abundance data revealing clusters that correspond to certain ecological structures and estimating significance of the revealed clusters by welch test for means 6 analysis of population characteristics species richness and total biomass 3 results 3 1 genetic and ecological features of developing communities we have carried out a number of simulation runs using models of microbial communities evolution see the model m2 the analysis of the dominant metabolic complexity revealed the following spatial localization patterns of species with various metabolic complexity in chemotaxis off case metabolically rich populations with large genomes tend to dominate closer to the source of the nonspecific nutrient whereas the fraction of dominant populations with metabolically poor short genomes increases in line with the distance from the source 3 1 1 metabolic complexity level a mean metabolic complexity level calculated for every sub habitat elucidates the issue of temporal stability of the previously revealed trend m c l i p i g s i i p i where p i the i th population abundance g s i number of metabolic systems for the i th population in the case of nonmotile cells metabolic complexity level decreases as the distance from the source increases see fig s1 in supplementary materials in the chemotaxis on case we have not found any patterns which indicate the fact that the developmental processes in such systems can not be explained by trivial steady trends 3 1 2 locally dominant ecological groups the metabolic complexity level alone can not say too much about the evolutionary direction of the community without taking into account spatially heterogeneous micro conditions affecting the adaptation along these lines we have made use of analytical tools that reveal the ecological meaning of the processes manifesting in the community we have analyzed a spatial distribution of dominant ecological functional groups this analysis unveiled the mechanisms underlying the detected patterns of the metabolic complexity distribution analyzing the results of the natural selection acting in the model of the community with a full set of metabolic systems combinations model m1 is very helpful before tackling the investigation of evolutionary trends in microorganisms towards metabolism augmentation and simplification the initial composition of populations consists of populations representing all feasible set of metabolic systems combinations in equal proportions see model m1 section and no new population emerge during the course of simulation though numerous populations extinct our simulations have demonstrated that in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model the natural selection acts differently upon motile and nonmotile organisms fig 3 a c in the chemotaxis off case ecosystems develop the structure of aedificators and quasi commensals notably biomasses of both ecogroups are almost equal in the sub habitats that are closer to the source of the nonspecific nutrient while in the distant sub habitats quasi commensals tend to prevail in the chemotaxis on case after 3000 generations only the metabolically complete population survives moreover the closer sub habitat to the source of the nonspecific nutrient the faster all the populations except for the metabolically complete population extinct thus in this case the natural selection favors the population that has self sufficient metabolism on the other hand the investigation of stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community m2 model sheds the light on ecological structural patterns of evolving communities a comparison of local dominant ecogroup distribution in the chemotaxis on and off cases see fig 3b d shows distinct patterns in the first case dominant ecogroups of final communities are typically aedificators or quasi commensals in the second case nonmotile cells compose spatially stratified communities where local dominant ecogroups are specifically distributed depending on their proximity to the nutrient source aedificators tend to dominate near the source while quasi commensals dominate closer to sink it is worth mentioning that the population dynamics grouped by ecogroups see supplementary files ecogroupabundancedynamics folder demonstrate that there is a biomass parity of these two ecogroups see fig 4 a for a typical example although the portions of space under control are unequal thereby it has been shown that the nonspecific nutrient gradient can cause spatial stratification of dominant ecogroups in the populations of nonmotile cells in contrast with the well mixed case 0d model lashin et al 2012 where either aedificators dominate in the ecosystem or quasi commensals do as it happens in the chemotaxis on case thus spatial heterogeneity facilitates local maintenance of antagonistic evolutionary scenarios resulting in amplification or reduction of microbial genomes in the case of chemotactically active cells in general there are two kinds of outcomes observed either the population with self sufficient metabolism aedificator see fig 4b dominates or specialized quasi commensals do due to subdominant quasi mutualists who feed them it is worth noting that unlike deterministic model of the complete community m1 model with a full set of combinations of metabolic systems where the selection favors aedificators stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community model m2 considering genetic variation processes such as hgt and gene loss exhibits one more stable distribution of ecogroup abundances quasi commensals and quasi mutualist symbiosis as a core of the community see fig 4d notably that mode is feasible not only by developing communities on their early phase but also by relatively established systems e g after 10 000 or even 18 000 generations 3 2 investigating ecological structures of developed communities with the principal component analysis 3 2 1 whole environment analysis despite the apparent fruitfulness of the aforesaid approach the data on dominant ecogroups per se is insufficient to acquire comprehensive knowledge about the ecological structure of the community therefore we have applied the principal component analysis pca to our simulation results model m2 using the information about total biomass of each ecogroup ecogroup abundance in particular for the whole environment comprised by all the nodes and for the local habitats particular nodes thereby we have obtained an opportunity to reveal the clusters corresponding to particular ecological structures the simulation results of stochastic modelling have been used as observations for the pca whereas we regard a number of cells falling to a specific ecogroup as a variable this number was measured both at simulation finish and in average thus if x is an observation corresponding to a simulation run then x aedificator total biomass producer total biomass quasi commensal total biomass quasi mutualist total biomass minimal genome total biomass resulting picture based on the data obtained at the end of simulation runs reflects the biomass distribution of ecogroups that is typical for climax communities while average biomass analysis based on the data averaged by time allows revealing those ecogroups whose participation is essential for the development of corresponding communities the analysis has shown that the chemotaxis on and off cases comprise distinct clusters and do not fuse fig 5 a c it gives us the evidence that an ability to migrate adaptively by the chemotaxis brings about distinction between the ecological structures of developed communities the significance of such differences has been approved by the welch s t test for aedificator and quasi mutualist biomasses p value 0 05 using both final and averaged observations data the results of performed statistical tests are presented in the supplementary files see t tests r the conclusion to be drawn states on average aedificator biomass is higher in ecosystems consisting of nonmotile organisms incapable of chemotaxis whereas quasi mutualist biomass is higher in the case of motile organisms for biomasses of producers quasi commensals and minimal genome bearers the differences are insignificant p value 0 05 despite the fact that producers do play a certain role in the community s development as one can see from the correlations between corresponding variable with the first two principal components calculated for averaged data the contribution of producers into the final structure of the community is absolutely negligible the absolute value of corresponding pca loading 1e 4 see the supplementary materials pca loadings folder the same reason lies behind the fact that minimal genome does not play a significant role in the explanation of observed diversity the simulation results for the chemotaxis on case fall into two clusters see fig 5a that correspond to two final ecological configurations 1 dominance of aedificators accompanied by negligible presence of other ecogroups see fig 4b 2 dominance of quasi commensals accompanied by quasi mutualists under almost complete absence of aedificators in the system see fig 4d the only exception is one simulation run where quasi mutualists dominate while aedificators act as subdominants however during 20 000 iterations the model did not reached the steady state expressing irregular dynamics the chemotaxis off cases are clustered less distinctly into three groups each of them shares common structure dominating aedificators and quasi commensals that was mentioned above and the differences concern only the quantitative balance between these two ecogroups 3 2 2 local habitat analysis we performed local habitat analysis in order to understand how spatially heterogeneous local ecological conditions of the biotope affect the structure of the ecosystem developing in this biotope m2 model in the previous subsection we have presented an approach to analyze the ecological structure of the community on a whole environment level here we apply a similar approach at the level of local habitats to identify local patterns for each individual simulation run an observation is represented by the data obtained from a local habitat rather than from the whole environment since we possess a priori knowledge about where the observations were made we are able to analyze the spatial patterns of biomass distribution of ecogroups without prior putting our knowledge into the analysis considering the fact that the total biomass decreases in line with the distance to the nonspecific nutrient source see the next section the null hypothesis states that each ecogroup preserves this trend however the analysis has shown that it is not the case see details in the supplementary materials linear regression models folder for motile cells aedificator biomass significantly increases in line with the distance to the nonspecific nutrient source p value 0 01 for both averaged and final observations the trend also is not abided for the cells with the minimal genome in the chemotaxis off case p value 0 05 for averaged data only the pca results for local biomasses of the ecogroups in the chemotaxis off case are presented in fig 5b d the variation observed through x axis appears to be explained by the distance towards the nonspecific nutrient source notably pca loadings of the variables show that each ecogroup except for the minimal genome tends to prevail near the source which causes the development of biomass gradient whereas y axis is characterized by the greatest and opposite contribution of aedificator and quasi commensal biomasses the biomass ratio between these two ecogroups mostly explain the variation through this axis see the supplementary materials pca loadings folder in the chemotaxis on case there are two major directions of variability that can be distinguished in the total biomass of quasi commensals together with quasi mutualists and in the aedificator biomass remarkably the former direction corresponds to 95 9 of explained variance and high biomass values are achieved only near the nutrient source 3 3 adaptive migration impact on species richness and total biomass in a community as we have mentioned above adaptive migrations play a significant role in the evolution therefore their impact on species richness and total biomass which includes cells of all ecogroups put together in a community becomes a reasonable object of scientific scrutiny to estimate this impact let s define two values s r s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o f f s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o n t b t o t a l b i o m a s s c h e m o f f t o t a l b i o m a s s c h e m o n where s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o f f the species richness in the whole environment averaged by the number of chemotaxis off simulation runs s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o n the species richness in the whole environment averaged by the number of chemotaxis on simulation runs t o t a l b i o m a s s c h e m o f f the total biomass averaged by the number of chemotaxis off simulation runs t o t a l b i o m a s s c h e m o n the total biomass averaged by the number of chemotaxis on simulation runs it turned out that mean number of species s r in a developed community is 2 84 fold lower and mean total biomass t b is 2 02 fold lower when the cells are able to migrate towards habitats with better conditions see fig 6 for the average results across simulations we interpret this result this way see fig s2 in supplementary materials high motility allows populations utilizing the nutrient that is present in all parts of the environment with the maximum effect it results in a rapid growth of populations utilizing available nutrients as a result well established populations of microorganisms which exhibit maximum resource utilization efficacy prevent new populations from ecological niche realization though the latter carry a potential for transforming the environment to create new ecological licenses osche 1966 schmitt 1987 levchenko and starobogatov 1990 thus we have demonstrated in this simulation study that active migrations act as an impediment to the introduction of new forms possessing novel combinations of metabolic systems and as a factor decreasing total biomass of the community that is caused by a rapid expansion of well established populations 3 4 the influence of the structure of the environment investigating the influence of the structure of the environment in the models of evolution and development of a microbial community we have arrived to a number of conclusions as we stated above different types of tubes correspond to different physical structures of the environment and can be considered as an abiotic factor influencing the formation of a community we have analyzed the patterns of dynamics of ecogroups abundances to establish the differences distinguishing both cases along these lines in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model switching the environmental structure from the tube with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb to the tube with non permeable boundaries 1d simple affects the patterns significantly only for the communities of nonmotile organisms see fig s3 in supplementary materials it results in adjusting the ratio between the abundances of two dominant ecogroups quasi commensals and aedificators as one can see from the dynamics the effect of eliminating additional effluxes targets specifically quasi commensals increasing the total biomass of this ecogroup it can be explained by the fact that non permeable tube favors the accumulation of specific nutrients boosting the growth of quasi commensals in the distant nodes in the stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community m2 model switching from 1d spb to 1d simple affects both communities of motile and nonmotile organisms in the chemotaxis off case the pattern of aedificator domination is lost for the same reasons as in m1 model since additional effluxes are no longer present see fig s4 in supplementary materials in the chemotaxis on case the patterns exhibiting oscillating or switching dynamics of ecogroups abundances no longer observed see fig s5 in supplementary materials in 1d simple environments in contrast with the tubes with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb see fig s6 in supplementary materials 3 5 discussion the computer modelling we have carried out shows that the spatial organization of the environment shapes the landscape of selection pressure mediating thereby the evolutionary processes in the ecosystem it leads to a stratification on ecosystem level resulting in spatially specific realization of various evolutionary scenarios that is in accordance with the results obtained in other investigations both theoretical goldschmidt et al 2017 and experimental callahan et al 2014 goldschmidt et al 2017 ones migrations as a process impeding expression of this stratification cause the decrease in community diversity and expansion of several fitted populations however it does not produce an increase in total biomass of the community in comparison to the communities of nonmotile organisms we explain this phenomenon with a concept of chain reduction of available ecological licenses caused by the decrease in diversity see fig s2 in supplementary materials despite the processes of genetic variation being inherently stochastic there are robust self organizing patterns on ecological structure level along with that there are multiple basins of attraction for evolution of such systems thus the space of evolutionary trajectories is channeled independently of the origin and exact metabolic sets of the populations particular configurations of ecological functional types develop and only in terms of these configurations we achieve plausible interpretations for the logic underlying the evolutionary processes in microbial communities it alludes us to the ideas of george zavarzin who pointed out that in search for knowledge on the history of biosphere evolution one has to rely on the functional traits rather than on phylogeny of contemporary bacteria i e on ecotype rather than ribotype zavarzin 2006 the importance of migration for evolutionary success of horizontal gene transfer events was shown in the work of niehus et al niehus et al 2015 the migration provides a permanent gene flow of sufficient density that allows mutants to gain a critical biomass which is necessary for the fixation in the community the fixation of a population which obtains biomass exceeding a critical value in its turn enables such a rare event as horizontal gene transfer to determine the evolution of a microbial community overcoming the constraints imposed by the harsh competitive milieu of the established community thereby the existence of such critical thresholds of biomass can lead to bi or even to multistability of the systems of motile populations at the level of the distribution of ecological groups besides things described above the energy cost of motility is a factor that might influence an outcome of evolution processes in a community though both theoretical estimates purcell 1977 mitchell 1991 and the evidence stocker and seymour 2012 indicate that for large and slowly swimming bacteria chemotaxis constitute very small fraction 0 1 of their energy budgets however bacteria living in the ocean tend to exhibit much higher velocities and energy cost of swimming is much higher for them comprising up to 50 of their total energy expenditure stocker and seymour 2012 therefore the investigation of its role is very promising and will certainly shed the light on the evolution in the communities of marine bacteria in the future using the bottom up approach at the level of microbial communities allows us to elucidate the system properties underlying self organizing patterns that we observe both in our model and in other theoretical and experimental studies matsuyama and matsushita 1993 tsyganov et al 1999 bihary et al 2012 ghoul and mitri 2016 goldschmidt et al 2017 these patterns are of a great interest for solving the problems of ecological engineering mitsch and jørgensen 2003 since that knowledge allows to predict the structure of a climax community based on its initial composition taking into account genetic variation processes inducing changes in ecological structure of a microbial community proves to be extremely important for unravelling the principles of ecosystem s self design thus in this simulation study we have shown that given even one dimensional nutrient gradient is presented in the environment feasible outcomes in the terms of dominance of particular ecogroups are distributed throughout habitats we have found that local dominant ecogroups distribution distinguishes in the chemotaxis on and off cases motile cells with a few exceptions exhibit the dominance of either aedificators or quasi commensals throughout the whole environment whereas nonmotile cells exhibit spatial stratification of dominant ecogroups in line with the distance towards nonspecific nutrient source aedificators dominate closer to the source while quasi commensals do farther from it it is worth mentioning that the analysis of abundance dynamics of the ecogroups show that there is a biomass parity trend among these two groups despite unequal portions of space under control generally aedificator biomass is higher in the ecosystems that consist of nonmotile organisms incapable of chemotaxis while quasi mutualist biomass is higher for ecosystems of motile organisms thus different evolutionary trends sustain in habitats with contrasting ecological conditions due to the nutrient gradients that structure the environment spatially the development of microbial community under natural selection in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model given start sizes of all populations are equal results in the dominance of the aedificator with a complete set of metabolic systems however the processes of horizontal gene transfer and gene loss in communities of motile microorganisms cause a novel attractor to emerge toward which the system tends to evolve in terms of biomass distribution of the ecogroups not only the developing communities on their early phase attract to that mode but also the established communities do moreover active migrations act as a factor impeding introduction of new forms and decreasing total biomass of the community that is caused by a rapid expansion of well established populations resulting in the chain reduction of available ecological licenses the structure of the environment is also a significant abiotic factor influencing the formation of a community our modelling shows that semi permeability of environmental boundaries while providing additional effluxes for the substances and cells permits more diverse ecological patterns than those reached in the tubes with non permeable boundaries along these lines the context of interactions among populations and spatially heterogeneous ecological conditions affecting the adaptation determine the selection pressure at the ecosystem level favoring those trophic configurations that appear to be the most robust in these particular conditions software availability the hec

25090,there are two evolutionary trends in genome organization among microbes towards either amplification or reduction which evolutionary scenario overcomes depends on environmental conditions and the complexity of gene networks determining phenotypic traits such as metabolic features of cells in this simulation study we have shown that the habitats characterized by nutrient gradients allow spatial subdivision of evolutionary trends depending on the distance to the nutrient source we have considered interrelations between cell motility metabolic complexity of dominant populations and ecological features of developing communities and have shown that the distribution of local dominant ecogroups follows clear patterns in chemotaxis on and off cases chemotaxis was shown to be a factor impeding introduction of new forms and decreasing total biomass of the community our simulations have shown that ecological patterns of self organization of microbial communities cause sustainable different strategies underlying antagonistic evolutionary scenarios keywords microbial communities individual based modelling ecological modelling evolutionary modelling spatial heterogeneity stratification 1 introduction microorganisms build up the world of large communities and compact genomes however depending on the environmental conditions the evolution of prokaryotic genomes might result in genome reduction or genome amplification gene loss in vitro in bacteria mira et al 2001 genome reduction in parasites moran 2002 and genome size optimization under syntrophy kunin and ouzounis 2003 mccutcheon and moran 2011 exemplify the trend for reduction on the other hand the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes rodrıguez martinez et al 2006 händel et al 2016 acquisition of genes essential for surviving in extreme conditions nelson et al 1999 nesbo et al 2001 and symbiogenesis margulis 1970 archibald 2011 cavalier smith 2013 provorov et al 2016 present the trend towards genome amplification active processes of gene material exchange occur in microbial communities providing microorganisms with a capacity to adapt to a broad spectrum of environmental conditions without the necessity to include all the metabolic toolboxes in every particular genome barraclough et al 2012 niehus et al 2015 soucy et al 2015 therefore if an environment changes the organisms that have acquired the adaptive genes might rapidly get an advantage over other species and then get rid of extra genes when environmental conditions alter again maslov et al 2009 pang and maslov 2011 polz et al 2013 langridge et al 2015 generally such processes involve so called accessory genome gogarten and townsend 2005 the major part of accessory genes with known function in escherichia coli are known to be responsible for metabolism soucy et al 2015 mcinerney et al 2017 however a large genome size implies concomitant maintenance caused on the one hand by the increased time and resources spent on genome replication and on the other hand by increased probability of acquiring lethal mutations eigen 1971 weiße et al 2015 that leads towards so called black queen dynamics certain costly biological functions such as detoxification of hydrogen peroxide tend to concentrate in a small subset of individuals in the community which provide this function for others as a public good consequently this dynamics contribute to the development of symbiotrophic communities of mutually interdependent microbial species morris et al 2012 fullmer et al 2015 overall the above factors constrain genome expansion in prokaryotes providing a stimulus towards reductionist evolutionary scenarios another factor of evolution determining the specifics of struggle for existence in microbial ecosystems is adaptive migrations of microorganisms niehus et al 2015 bridier et al 2017 changes of environmental conditions make a population of microbes to face the following adaptive crossroads the first option is the phenotypical adaptation e g via adjusting its metabolism to alternative energy sources the second is undergoing adaptive evolution that favors more efficient utilization of the available nutrient reserves or the third way is to migrate pursuing optimal environmental conditions intruding new habitats and engaging in competition with local species callahan et al 2014 chew et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the impact of such adaptive individual behavior on a developmental scenario of the whole community is of current interest for acquiring more profound comprehension of interactions between various evolutionary mechanisms there is a number of classifications of living organisms based on ecologically significant traits the majority of them relies upon the ecological amplitude of the species projected on a certain ecological factor for instance microorganisms fall into the following ecophysiological groups zavarzin and kolotilova 2001 based on their preferred temperature of the environment psychrophiles mesophiles thermophiles extreme thermophiles and hyperthermophiles based on their preferred ph acidophiles 2 ph 6 neutrophiles 6 ph 8 and alkaliphiles 8 5 ph 11 based on oxygen conditions aerobes and anaerobes etc another classification is introduced based on the analysis of energy fluxes in an ecosystem proposing such categories as producers first second and higher order consumers and decomposers pomeroy et al 1988 there is another prominent classification based on pairwise interactions between species commensalism amensalism mutualism competition and neutralism lidicker 1979 faust and raes 2012 however besides these classifications there is a typology based on ecological function that living organisms perform in their communities for example henriette poplavskaya poplavskaya 1924 and vladimir sukachev sukachev 1928 developed such a classification for plant communities they proposed such phytosocial types as aedificators and assectators based on the role that species act upon in the community structure and its succession the former act as community builders either in natural conditions autochthonous aedificators or as a result of perturbations of the community caused by a short term disturbance by a human being or an animal degressive aedificators the latter on the other hand act as community co builders being however insignificant for its phytosocial milieu leonty ramensky ramenskyi 1935 and john grime grime 1974 independently proposed a system triangular model of primary plant strategies or csr theory classifying plants based on their adaptive strategies the following two factors were regarded as foundational stress intensity that restricts photosynthetic production and disturbance intensity that breaches the phytocenosis integrity caused by either biotic or abiotic factors three possible strategies determine such three major phytocenotypes as highly productive competitors robust stress tolerators and ruderals which are noncompetitive though rapidly colonizing recently disturbed areas in phytocenoses and there is a number of intermediate types as well the csr theory has been recently adapted to microbial functional traits for methane oxidizing bacteria and in a generalized manner ho et al 2013 krause et al 2014 agent based modelling abm is an approach that has been extensively used for modelling of ecological grimm et al 2017 and evolutionary liu et al 2017 processes in the recent decade abm allows to develop flexible models taking into account multiple factors and individual interactions between the agents in the system applying agent based modelling to microbial ecosystems shed the light on the processes of biofilm self assembly chemotaxis and other aspects of their functioning wimpenny and colasanti 1997 kreft et al 1998 picioreanu et al 2004 emonet et al 2005 bihary et al 2012 ravikrishnan and raman 2018 the models of genome amplification and reduction in various ecological conditions were investigated for well mixed environments 0d models in our previous studies lashin et al 2012 it was shown that in pessimal environmental conditions characterized by low inflow of nonspecific nutrient populations of cells with metabolically complete or metabolically rich genomes i e capable of utilizing all or almost all the nutrients that are present in the modelled environment respectively prevail in the community on the other hand it was also demonstrated that suboptimal and optimal conditions manifest a steady trend towards genome reduction the most primitive populations capable of only two metabolic activities utilization of one nonspecific and one specific nutrients displaced others in this study we have applied the haploid evolutionary constructor software package hec for more details see methods section klimenko et al 2015 2016 to investigate the impact of spatial gradients of nutrients and environment structure on genome amplification and reduction trends in communities of microorganisms inhabiting a flow through environment the aim of the study is to gain insights out of modelling and to elucidate how these spatial gradients of ecological factors and cells motility affect the ecological and population structures of developing communities and evolutionary scenarios in local habitats we turned on and off the ability of cells to migrate adaptively via chemotaxis the following problems have been addressed is there any correlation of ecological conditions and metabolic complexity genome size of the dominant population how does the chemotaxis ability affect species richness and total biomass of the community how does the chemotaxis ability influence the development of the ecological structure in evolving communities 2 methods 2 1 model the models of functioning and evolution of microbial communities were simulated using the haploid evolutionary constructor hec software package lashin et al 2007 klimenko et al 2015 which is based on the agent based approach and super individual concept scheffer et al 1995 hec meets the requirements for the next generation ecological modelling grimm and berger 2016 since it is based on the first principles linking behavior and physiology to ecology adopts trait based approach to describe microbial functional types adds microevolution enables describing heterogeneous and dynamic abiotic environments and obtains modular multi layer structure the key simulation unit in hec is a super individual like agent which describes a genetically homogeneous population of cells that interacts with its environment and other populations that are genetically different from each other all the present populations as a group constitute a microbial community the following set of objects and processes is considered in this simulation approach objects environment an aquatic flow through environment is described by a lattice of well mixed sub habitats nodes populated with cells and substances nutrients we regard any substance affecting the cell growth as a nutrient cells can either secrete nutrients that were synthesized inside them in this case we call such nutrients specific ones or consume nutrients and use them for cell s growth and reproduction those nutrients that come into the environment via the flow are called nonspecific ones nonspecific nutrients describe external energy source that nourishes microbial ecosystems that corresponds to dissolved organic matter glucose or some other kind of substrate that is widely nonspecifically used by members of microbial community for their growth and maintenance the specific nutrients can either stimulate population growth or suppress it and even cause the drastic reduction of its population size populations a population is characterized by a set of metabolic systems model genes corresponding to metabolic functions that determine which nutrients and how rapidly the cells of the population are able to consume and produce processes consumption of nutrients captured from the environment and secretion of products of cell metabolism nutrient exchange among the populations in the habitat mediated by the fluid environment reproduction in populations and natural selection mutations mutations are described as a change of allele value of a certain gene in one or several cells of the population gene loss cells might lose some genes generating a new population possessing a genome that is different from the original one horizontal gene transfer cells that belong to different populations are able to exchange genes involved in metabolism functioning resulting in an emergence of new populations these processes contributing into microbial population dynamics were described using the following equation lashin et al 2012 1 δ p f n 0 s r 0 c p g r 0 n 0 p i i c o n s u m e d c i s i p k d e a t h p 2 b g k 1 n g k 1 n g n 1 p where δ p is the change of population size abundance biomass per iteration n 0 an amount of nonspecific nutrient consumed by the cells of the population from the environment s numerical vector corresponding to amounts of the specific nutrients si are the elements of s consumed from the environment r 0 genetically determined nonspecific nutrient utilization rate c vector of specific nutrient utilization rates traits controlled by corresponding genes ci are the elements of c p population size abundance number of cells g number of metabolic systems of the population characterizes the length of the corresponding genome i c o n s u m e d set of indices of specific nutrients consumed by the cells of the population k d e a t h death coefficient b penalty coefficient k 1 a parameter that determines the threshold value for increase of genome size penalty n a degree of nonlinearity of genome size penalty actually n 0 and si are functions of p since the amount of consumed nutrients is proportional to the population size see supplementary materials for details the first term refers to uptake of energy the second term accounts for the negative density dependence and the last term describes a genome size metabolic complexity penalty the population growth rate is positively affected by an amount and number of consumed nutrients and negatively affected by both time spent on the replication in our case it depends on the number of metabolic systems and therefore metabolic complexity can be considered as an indirect measure of the genome size and time spent on utilizing the nutrients we chose k 1 n and b parameters eq 1 equal to 0 37 10 0 and 0 01 respectively which corresponds to a low genome size penalty according to the classification presented in lashin et al 2012 in the case of motile cells we regard 10 of the population as active migrants which is in broad agreement with observed values for coastal seawater samples mitchell et al 1995 we have carried out a number of simulations using the models of evolution and development of a microbial community inhabiting a spatially structured environment we considered two types of 10 noded 1d tubes the first is the tube with non permeable boundaries fig 1 c 1d simple and the second is the tube with semi permeable boundaries fig 1c 1d spb both types of tubes have reasonable physical meaning for instance sewage pipes exemplify 1d simple tubes while natural streams and brooks illustrate 1d spb environments yao and le maguer 1996 gruber et al 2011 the tubes are supplied with a nonspecific nutrient which is consumed by all cells from one side source the beginning of the tube fig 1c left side of both tubes the nonspecific nutrient as well as specific ones produced by cells of the community distribute further by diffusion and flow the flow also transports the cells through the tube from source to sink in the end of the tube sink nutrients and cells wash out of the environment fig 1c right side besides passive transport we also consider chemotaxis ability of the cells i e adaptive migrations towards more favorable environmental conditions in terms of nutrient saturation we examined both cases of the community consisting of motile chemotaxis on case and nonmotile chemotaxis off case cells hereafter we call the community that has established at the end of a simulation run as the developed community 2 1 1 model m1 deterministic model of a complete microbial community we define the deterministic model of a complete microbial community exposed to the natural selection as model m1 a complete community according to our definition is such a community that consists of populations possessing all feasible metabolic combinations for the system with three specific and one nonspecific nutrient see fig 1d initially those populations had the equal abundances one million cells for each population 105 cells per node of the tube for each population initial concentrations of nonspecific and specific nutrients n1 s1 s2 s3 were set to 10 6 m in each node of the tube we have examined the impact of cells motility on the final ecological structure that develops as a result of development of communities of a particular type thereby we have found typical distributions of ecogroup abundances independent of such stochastic factors as hgt gene loss time and place of origin and rather determined by the fitness of the populations constituting corresponding ecogroups 2 1 2 model m2 stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community we define the stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community as model m2 initially the community comprises a trophic ring of three symbiotic populations all three initial populations of cells belong to a quasi mutualist ecogroup each population produces a specific nutrient that is consumed by the following population in clock wise direction fig 1a the initial conditions regarding to the population sizes and concentrations of nutrients were set the same as in the model m1 these model genes are meant to be essential for metabolic systems of the cells providing them with an ability either to utilize or to synthesize a specific nutrient during the simulation course the processes of horizontal gene transfer and or gene loss occur with the probability equal to 10 7 per cell per generation thus novel populations characterized by novel sets of metabolic functions emerge resulting in further evolution of the community as it is previously described in fig 1b 2 2 ecological functional groups ecogroups for the convenience of further analysis we have proposed the classification that takes into account on the one hand the role of organisms in their mutual interactions and on the other hand involves their function in the community structure estimating the complexity of their metabolism therefore we classify all possible populations in the model with one nonspecific and three specific nutrients based on two features number of specific metabolic systems m the range of metabolic activities and skew u the number of metabolic systems of synthesis the number of metabolic systems of utilization of specific nutrients towards either utilization negative semi axis or synthesis positive semi axis thereby building our classification we have synthesized approaches based on pairwise interactions of species and those based on population function in the community organization we have called the resulting classes ecogroups and given them names according to their ecological role performed by their representatives in a community fig 2 the number of specific metabolic systems m can be used to distinguish populations of microorganisms possessing relatively small and large genomes and respective ranges of metabolic activities different criteria are to be applied for each of these groups considering their ecological functional status given m 3 populations possessing small genomes minimal genome the only one population that is able to utilize only nonspecific nutrient and does not produce anything producers are positioned along the altruism line a class of organisms generating metabolic impasses that can be utilized by other organisms as an energy source structural component electron donor or acceptor etc quasi commensals are positioned along the egoism line a class of organisms consuming products of others in contrast with classic commensals quasi commensals compete for a nonspecific nutrient with their breadwinners lying between egoism and altruism lines symmetrically with respect to balance line quasi mutualists constitute a class of organisms possessing a small and relatively balanced genome with respect to utilization synthesis and therefore potentially capable of making symbiotic trophic rings with other similar organisms in contrast with classic mutualists quasi mutualists compete for a nonspecific nutrient with their symbionts given 4 m 6 populations possessing large genomes given u 2 a population belongs either to quasi commensal ecogroup or to producer ecogroup depending on the u sign see fig 6 since we consider in our model only those ecogroups that can be distinguished based on three kinds of specific nutrients none of the populations can have more than three metabolic systems of the same type either utilization or synthesis that inevitably implies in case of large genomes a necessity to have metabolic systems of another type as well therefore the populations possessing a large genome skewed significantly towards either utilization or synthesis also fall into these classes respectively all other populations belong to aedificator class the populations possessing large though balanced genome and characterized by a wide range of metabolic activities and thereby transforming the environment significantly thus affecting many other populations in the community 2 3 analysis workflow we have carried out a number of simulations using the models of evolution and development of a microbial community inhabiting a spatially structured environment there is a feasible set of metabolic systems combinations in the model that can be reached as new forms emerge due to horizontal gene transfer hgt and gene loss fig 1d the populations with metabolically rich genome gather on one pole whereas metabolically poor and minimal genomes meet on another one the populations of cells characterized by a particular combination of metabolic systems may be divided into five categories according to their functional role in the ecosystem we refer to these groups as ecological functional groups or ecogroups further aedificators quasi commensals quasi mutualists producers and minimal genome for more details see the methods section the ecogroups have been used to analyze the processes of ecosystem development in the model we regard a population in the community possessing the maximum size among all of the populations as a dominant population we defined a threshold distinguishing the dominant population from non dominant populations as a number of cells that discriminate between the sizes of the dominant population with maximum size and the non dominant population with maximum size among all non dominant populations see fig s0 in supplementary materials so that multiple dominants are possible we have focused our analysis primarily on the case of the tubes with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb since this case exhibit more diverse patterns than the case of the tube with non permeable boundaries 1d simple does however we discuss the influence of the structure of the environment in detail in the 3 4 section the results of each simulation run were analyzed as follows 1 local dominant metabolic complexity analysis what locations of the environment are dominated by the populations with generalized and specialized metabolism 2 evaluation of the metabolic complexity level which of the trends detected on the 1st step are true not only for the dominant populations but for the whole community as well 3 the analysis of ecological function that locally dominant populations perform in the microbial community 4 ecogroup abundance dynamics analysis associate transformations of ecological structure of a community with its population dynamics for both motile and nonmotile cells 5 principal component analysis pca of the ecogroup abundance data revealing clusters that correspond to certain ecological structures and estimating significance of the revealed clusters by welch test for means 6 analysis of population characteristics species richness and total biomass 3 results 3 1 genetic and ecological features of developing communities we have carried out a number of simulation runs using models of microbial communities evolution see the model m2 the analysis of the dominant metabolic complexity revealed the following spatial localization patterns of species with various metabolic complexity in chemotaxis off case metabolically rich populations with large genomes tend to dominate closer to the source of the nonspecific nutrient whereas the fraction of dominant populations with metabolically poor short genomes increases in line with the distance from the source 3 1 1 metabolic complexity level a mean metabolic complexity level calculated for every sub habitat elucidates the issue of temporal stability of the previously revealed trend m c l i p i g s i i p i where p i the i th population abundance g s i number of metabolic systems for the i th population in the case of nonmotile cells metabolic complexity level decreases as the distance from the source increases see fig s1 in supplementary materials in the chemotaxis on case we have not found any patterns which indicate the fact that the developmental processes in such systems can not be explained by trivial steady trends 3 1 2 locally dominant ecological groups the metabolic complexity level alone can not say too much about the evolutionary direction of the community without taking into account spatially heterogeneous micro conditions affecting the adaptation along these lines we have made use of analytical tools that reveal the ecological meaning of the processes manifesting in the community we have analyzed a spatial distribution of dominant ecological functional groups this analysis unveiled the mechanisms underlying the detected patterns of the metabolic complexity distribution analyzing the results of the natural selection acting in the model of the community with a full set of metabolic systems combinations model m1 is very helpful before tackling the investigation of evolutionary trends in microorganisms towards metabolism augmentation and simplification the initial composition of populations consists of populations representing all feasible set of metabolic systems combinations in equal proportions see model m1 section and no new population emerge during the course of simulation though numerous populations extinct our simulations have demonstrated that in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model the natural selection acts differently upon motile and nonmotile organisms fig 3 a c in the chemotaxis off case ecosystems develop the structure of aedificators and quasi commensals notably biomasses of both ecogroups are almost equal in the sub habitats that are closer to the source of the nonspecific nutrient while in the distant sub habitats quasi commensals tend to prevail in the chemotaxis on case after 3000 generations only the metabolically complete population survives moreover the closer sub habitat to the source of the nonspecific nutrient the faster all the populations except for the metabolically complete population extinct thus in this case the natural selection favors the population that has self sufficient metabolism on the other hand the investigation of stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community m2 model sheds the light on ecological structural patterns of evolving communities a comparison of local dominant ecogroup distribution in the chemotaxis on and off cases see fig 3b d shows distinct patterns in the first case dominant ecogroups of final communities are typically aedificators or quasi commensals in the second case nonmotile cells compose spatially stratified communities where local dominant ecogroups are specifically distributed depending on their proximity to the nutrient source aedificators tend to dominate near the source while quasi commensals dominate closer to sink it is worth mentioning that the population dynamics grouped by ecogroups see supplementary files ecogroupabundancedynamics folder demonstrate that there is a biomass parity of these two ecogroups see fig 4 a for a typical example although the portions of space under control are unequal thereby it has been shown that the nonspecific nutrient gradient can cause spatial stratification of dominant ecogroups in the populations of nonmotile cells in contrast with the well mixed case 0d model lashin et al 2012 where either aedificators dominate in the ecosystem or quasi commensals do as it happens in the chemotaxis on case thus spatial heterogeneity facilitates local maintenance of antagonistic evolutionary scenarios resulting in amplification or reduction of microbial genomes in the case of chemotactically active cells in general there are two kinds of outcomes observed either the population with self sufficient metabolism aedificator see fig 4b dominates or specialized quasi commensals do due to subdominant quasi mutualists who feed them it is worth noting that unlike deterministic model of the complete community m1 model with a full set of combinations of metabolic systems where the selection favors aedificators stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community model m2 considering genetic variation processes such as hgt and gene loss exhibits one more stable distribution of ecogroup abundances quasi commensals and quasi mutualist symbiosis as a core of the community see fig 4d notably that mode is feasible not only by developing communities on their early phase but also by relatively established systems e g after 10 000 or even 18 000 generations 3 2 investigating ecological structures of developed communities with the principal component analysis 3 2 1 whole environment analysis despite the apparent fruitfulness of the aforesaid approach the data on dominant ecogroups per se is insufficient to acquire comprehensive knowledge about the ecological structure of the community therefore we have applied the principal component analysis pca to our simulation results model m2 using the information about total biomass of each ecogroup ecogroup abundance in particular for the whole environment comprised by all the nodes and for the local habitats particular nodes thereby we have obtained an opportunity to reveal the clusters corresponding to particular ecological structures the simulation results of stochastic modelling have been used as observations for the pca whereas we regard a number of cells falling to a specific ecogroup as a variable this number was measured both at simulation finish and in average thus if x is an observation corresponding to a simulation run then x aedificator total biomass producer total biomass quasi commensal total biomass quasi mutualist total biomass minimal genome total biomass resulting picture based on the data obtained at the end of simulation runs reflects the biomass distribution of ecogroups that is typical for climax communities while average biomass analysis based on the data averaged by time allows revealing those ecogroups whose participation is essential for the development of corresponding communities the analysis has shown that the chemotaxis on and off cases comprise distinct clusters and do not fuse fig 5 a c it gives us the evidence that an ability to migrate adaptively by the chemotaxis brings about distinction between the ecological structures of developed communities the significance of such differences has been approved by the welch s t test for aedificator and quasi mutualist biomasses p value 0 05 using both final and averaged observations data the results of performed statistical tests are presented in the supplementary files see t tests r the conclusion to be drawn states on average aedificator biomass is higher in ecosystems consisting of nonmotile organisms incapable of chemotaxis whereas quasi mutualist biomass is higher in the case of motile organisms for biomasses of producers quasi commensals and minimal genome bearers the differences are insignificant p value 0 05 despite the fact that producers do play a certain role in the community s development as one can see from the correlations between corresponding variable with the first two principal components calculated for averaged data the contribution of producers into the final structure of the community is absolutely negligible the absolute value of corresponding pca loading 1e 4 see the supplementary materials pca loadings folder the same reason lies behind the fact that minimal genome does not play a significant role in the explanation of observed diversity the simulation results for the chemotaxis on case fall into two clusters see fig 5a that correspond to two final ecological configurations 1 dominance of aedificators accompanied by negligible presence of other ecogroups see fig 4b 2 dominance of quasi commensals accompanied by quasi mutualists under almost complete absence of aedificators in the system see fig 4d the only exception is one simulation run where quasi mutualists dominate while aedificators act as subdominants however during 20 000 iterations the model did not reached the steady state expressing irregular dynamics the chemotaxis off cases are clustered less distinctly into three groups each of them shares common structure dominating aedificators and quasi commensals that was mentioned above and the differences concern only the quantitative balance between these two ecogroups 3 2 2 local habitat analysis we performed local habitat analysis in order to understand how spatially heterogeneous local ecological conditions of the biotope affect the structure of the ecosystem developing in this biotope m2 model in the previous subsection we have presented an approach to analyze the ecological structure of the community on a whole environment level here we apply a similar approach at the level of local habitats to identify local patterns for each individual simulation run an observation is represented by the data obtained from a local habitat rather than from the whole environment since we possess a priori knowledge about where the observations were made we are able to analyze the spatial patterns of biomass distribution of ecogroups without prior putting our knowledge into the analysis considering the fact that the total biomass decreases in line with the distance to the nonspecific nutrient source see the next section the null hypothesis states that each ecogroup preserves this trend however the analysis has shown that it is not the case see details in the supplementary materials linear regression models folder for motile cells aedificator biomass significantly increases in line with the distance to the nonspecific nutrient source p value 0 01 for both averaged and final observations the trend also is not abided for the cells with the minimal genome in the chemotaxis off case p value 0 05 for averaged data only the pca results for local biomasses of the ecogroups in the chemotaxis off case are presented in fig 5b d the variation observed through x axis appears to be explained by the distance towards the nonspecific nutrient source notably pca loadings of the variables show that each ecogroup except for the minimal genome tends to prevail near the source which causes the development of biomass gradient whereas y axis is characterized by the greatest and opposite contribution of aedificator and quasi commensal biomasses the biomass ratio between these two ecogroups mostly explain the variation through this axis see the supplementary materials pca loadings folder in the chemotaxis on case there are two major directions of variability that can be distinguished in the total biomass of quasi commensals together with quasi mutualists and in the aedificator biomass remarkably the former direction corresponds to 95 9 of explained variance and high biomass values are achieved only near the nutrient source 3 3 adaptive migration impact on species richness and total biomass in a community as we have mentioned above adaptive migrations play a significant role in the evolution therefore their impact on species richness and total biomass which includes cells of all ecogroups put together in a community becomes a reasonable object of scientific scrutiny to estimate this impact let s define two values s r s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o f f s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s c h e m o n t

turned out that mean number of species s r in a developed community is 2 84 fold lower and mean total biomass t b is 2 02 fold lower when the cells are able to migrate towards habitats with better conditions see fig 6 for the average results across simulations we interpret this result this way see fig s2 in supplementary materials high motility allows populations utilizing the nutrient that is present in all parts of the environment with the maximum effect it results in a rapid growth of populations utilizing available nutrients as a result well established populations of microorganisms which exhibit maximum resource utilization efficacy prevent new populations from ecological niche realization though the latter carry a potential for transforming the environment to create new ecological licenses osche 1966 schmitt 1987 levchenko and starobogatov 1990 thus we have demonstrated in this simulation study that active migrations act as an impediment to the introduction of new forms possessing novel combinations of metabolic systems and as a factor decreasing total biomass of the community that is caused by a rapid expansion of well established populations 3 4 the influence of the structure of the environment investigating the influence of the structure of the environment in the models of evolution and development of a microbial community we have arrived to a number of conclusions as we stated above different types of tubes correspond to different physical structures of the environment and can be considered as an abiotic factor influencing the formation of a community we have analyzed the patterns of dynamics of ecogroups abundances to establish the differences distinguishing both cases along these lines in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model switching the environmental structure from the tube with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb to the tube with non permeable boundaries 1d simple affects the patterns significantly only for the communities of nonmotile organisms see fig s3 in supplementary materials it results in adjusting the ratio between the abundances of two dominant ecogroups quasi commensals and aedificators as one can see from the dynamics the effect of eliminating additional effluxes targets specifically quasi commensals increasing the total biomass of this ecogroup it can be explained by the fact that non permeable tube favors the accumulation of specific nutrients boosting the growth of quasi commensals in the distant nodes in the stochastic model of evolutionary processes in a developing microbial community m2 model switching from 1d spb to 1d simple affects both communities of motile and nonmotile organisms in the chemotaxis off case the pattern of aedificator domination is lost for the same reasons as in m1 model since additional effluxes are no longer present see fig s4 in supplementary materials in the chemotaxis on case the patterns exhibiting oscillating or switching dynamics of ecogroups abundances no longer observed see fig s5 in supplementary materials in 1d simple environments in contrast with the tubes with semi permeable boundaries 1d spb see fig s6 in supplementary materials 3 5 discussion the computer modelling we have carried out shows that the spatial organization of the environment shapes the landscape of selection pressure mediating thereby the evolutionary processes in the ecosystem it leads to a stratification on ecosystem level resulting in spatially specific realization of various evolutionary scenarios that is in accordance with the results obtained in other investigations both theoretical goldschmidt et al 2017 and experimental callahan et al 2014 goldschmidt et al 2017 ones migrations as a process impeding expression of this stratification cause the decrease in community diversity and expansion of several fitted populations however it does not produce an increase in total biomass of the community in comparison to the communities of nonmotile organisms we explain this phenomenon with a concept of chain reduction of available ecological licenses caused by the decrease in diversity see fig s2 in supplementary materials despite the processes of genetic variation being inherently stochastic there are robust self organizing patterns on ecological structure level along with that there are multiple basins of attraction for evolution of such systems thus the space of evolutionary trajectories is channeled independently of the origin and exact metabolic sets of the populations particular configurations of ecological functional types develop and only in terms of these configurations we achieve plausible interpretations for the logic underlying the evolutionary processes in microbial communities it alludes us to the ideas of george zavarzin who pointed out that in search for knowledge on the history of biosphere evolution one has to rely on the functional traits rather than on phylogeny of contemporary bacteria i e on ecotype rather than ribotype zavarzin 2006 the importance of migration for evolutionary success of horizontal gene transfer events was shown in the work of niehus et al niehus et al 2015 the migration provides a permanent gene flow of sufficient density that allows mutants to gain a critical biomass which is necessary for the fixation in the community the fixation of a population which obtains biomass exceeding a critical value in its turn enables such a rare event as horizontal gene transfer to determine the evolution of a microbial community overcoming the constraints imposed by the harsh competitive milieu of the established community thereby the existence of such critical thresholds of biomass can lead to bi or even to multistability of the systems of motile populations at the level of the distribution of ecological groups besides things described above the energy cost of motility is a factor that might influence an outcome of evolution processes in a community though both theoretical estimates purcell 1977 mitchell 1991 and the evidence stocker and seymour 2012 indicate that for large and slowly swimming bacteria chemotaxis constitute very small fraction 0 1 of their energy budgets however bacteria living in the ocean tend to exhibit much higher velocities and energy cost of swimming is much higher for them comprising up to 50 of their total energy expenditure stocker and seymour 2012 therefore the investigation of its role is very promising and will certainly shed the light on the evolution in the communities of marine bacteria in the future using the bottom up approach at the level of microbial communities allows us to elucidate the system properties underlying self organizing patterns that we observe both in our model and in other theoretical and experimental studies matsuyama and matsushita 1993 tsyganov et al 1999 bihary et al 2012 ghoul and mitri 2016 goldschmidt et al 2017 these patterns are of a great interest for solving the problems of ecological engineering mitsch and jørgensen 2003 since that knowledge allows to predict the structure of a climax community based on its initial composition taking into account genetic variation processes inducing changes in ecological structure of a microbial community proves to be extremely important for unravelling the principles of ecosystem s self design thus in this simulation study we have shown that given even one dimensional nutrient gradient is presented in the environment feasible outcomes in the terms of dominance of particular ecogroups are distributed throughout habitats we have found that local dominant ecogroups distribution distinguishes in the chemotaxis on and off cases motile cells with a few exceptions exhibit the dominance of either aedificators or quasi commensals throughout the whole environment whereas nonmotile cells exhibit spatial stratification of dominant ecogroups in line with the distance towards nonspecific nutrient source aedificators dominate closer to the source while quasi commensals do farther from it it is worth mentioning that the analysis of abundance dynamics of the ecogroups show that there is a biomass parity trend among these two groups despite unequal portions of space under control generally aedificator biomass is higher in the ecosystems that consist of nonmotile organisms incapable of chemotaxis while quasi mutualist biomass is higher for ecosystems of motile organisms thus different evolutionary trends sustain in habitats with contrasting ecological conditions due to the nutrient gradients that structure the environment spatially the development of microbial community under natural selection in the deterministic model of the complete community m1 model given start sizes of all populations are equal results in the dominance of the aedificator with a complete set of metabolic systems however the processes of horizontal gene transfer and gene loss in communities of motile microorganisms cause a novel attractor to emerge toward which the system tends to evolve in terms of biomass distribution of the ecogroups not only the developing communities on their early phase attract to that mode but also the established communities do moreover active migrations act as a factor impeding introduction of new forms and decreasing total biomass of the community that is caused by a rapid expansion of well established populations resulting in the chain reduction of available ecological licenses the structure of the environment is also a significant abiotic factor influencing the formation of a community our modelling shows that semi permeability of environmental boundaries while providing additional effluxes for the substances and cells permits more diverse ecological patterns than those reached in the tubes with non permeable boundaries along these lines the context of interactions among populations and spatially heterogeneous ecological conditions affecting the adaptation determine the selection pressure at the ecosystem level favoring those trophic configurations that appear to be the most robust in these particular conditions software availability the hec

25091,cyanobacterial blooms pose severe ecological and economical threats in lakes and reservoirs understanding the complex physical transport and biological features of cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae is important for predicting blooms in freshwater systems in this study a three dimensional model for nonhydrostatic free surface flow and microcystis sp cyanobacteria transport and associated population dynamics is presented the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using a semi implicit fractional time step finite difference method the hydrodynamic model can couple microcystis transport to a population dynamics model that simulates buoyancy vertical migration and effects of temperature light nutrients and salinity on the concentration of microcystis microcystis transport was determined by solving the convection diffusion equation the vertical migration of microcystis was simulated based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance the transient microcystis production at a given depth was calculated based on the effects of different environmental factors such as depth irradiance and temperature the model was used to analyze the transport and growth of microcystis in milford lake which is the largest man made lake in kansas transport and population dynamics of microcystis under different environmental conditions were simulated and the effects of different environmental factors were compared in a 20 hour test overall physical processes like wind mixing most effected microcystis distribution throughout the simulation when wind was low water column turbidity effected microcystis distribution more than temperature or ambient light this study is the first 3d nonhydrostatic free surface flow computational model that includes microcystis transport buoyancy regulation vertical migration and population dynamics nonhydrostatic models are needed because existing ecological models with hydrostatic approximation can be ill posed when dealing with open boundaries and hydrostatic approximation is not valid when dealing with flow over rapidly changing slopes the current model is a robust and efficient way to model microcystis transport and can be applied to studies of other surface water systems effectively keywords cyanobacteria transport finite difference method nonhydrostatic free surface flow microcystis vertical migration 3 dimensional hydrodynamic ecological modeling 1 introduction blooms of cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae are increasing globally cyanobacteria are favored over other algal taxa in warm 25 c nutrient enriched especially nitrogen and phosphorus waterbodies paerl and otten 2013 in addition to the above conditions cyanobacteria can outcompete other algal taxa in low turbulent systems because of the presence of gas vesicles which allows cyanobacteria to vertically migrate daily in the water column vertical migration helps cyanobacteria i float near the surface of the water column and shade other algal taxa in the morning and ii sink into the water column to avoid harmful uv light in the afternoon paerl and otten 2013 cyanobacterial blooms have negative consequences to surface water users negative consequences include the production of harmful toxins and volatile organic compounds that cause animal human illness and taste and odor issues in drinking water supplies respectively wu and xu 2011 because toxic cyanobacterial blooms cause negative animal and human health effects trevino garrison et al 2015 understanding the complex physical transport and growth limitations of cyanobacteria is important to predict the temporal and spatial dynamics of blooms which may ultimately prevent human exposure to harmful cyanobacterial metabolites the physical transport of cyanobacteria is dominated by water circulation and wind induced waves these factors impact daily vertical migrations of cyanobacteria in the water column ishikawa et al 2002 cao et al 2006 moreno ostos et al 2009 blottière et al 2014 wang et al 2017 studies have shown that the density of the cyanobacterium microcystis colony changes when subjected to different light intensities that occur at different times of the day kromkamp and walsby 1990 wallace et al 2000 chien et al 2013 medrano et al 2013 wang et al 2017 for the population dynamics of cyanobacteria blooms different environmental factors including nutrients irradiance temperature and salinity need to be considered xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 wu and xu 2011 ma et al 2014 the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc is a multifunctional computational modeling system capable of simulating hydrodynamics algal transport and production as well as other water quality constituents in one two and three dimensions tetra tech 2007 during the past two decades the efdc model has been applied to over 100 surface water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and coastal regions for water quality assessment park et al 1995 kuo et al 1996 shen et al 1999 moustafa and hamrick 2000 ji et al 2001 kim et al 1998 2000 tetra tech 1999 2005 albertson et al 2002 park et al 2005 luo and li 2009 wu and xu 2011 the hydrostatic primitive equations are solved in the efdc and other models blumberg and mellor 1987 leendertse 1989 casulli and cheng 1992 however 3d hydrostatic models can be ill posed when dealing with open boundaries oliger and sundström 1978 mahadevan et al 1996 and the hydrostatic assumption is not valid when fluid flows over rapidly varying slopes and short waves where the ratio of the vertical to horizontal scales is not sufficiently small casulli 1999 therefore a three dimensional 3d model including nonhydrostatic free surface flow with both physical transport and population dynamics for cyanobacterium microcystis sp is needed and developed in this study the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations by a semi implicit fractional time step finite difference method on a staggered cartesian grid where the hydrostatic components are determined first and the non hydrostatic pressure and other components are determined in a subsequent step casulli and stelling 1998 casulli 1999 liu et al 2017 the algorithm is locally and globally mass conservative and can be applied to different free surface problems ranging from hydrostatic to fully nonhydrostatic the scheme is further improved by including a mixing length turbulence model rodi 1984 which is widely used in hydraulic turbulent flows rodi 1987 reichert et al 2001 lesser et al 2004 zhang and baptista 2008 in addition the convective terms are discretized by an explicit second order upwind scheme in space zhang et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2014 which is more efficient and can reach higher order accuracy than the eulerian lagrangian method cheng et al 1984 casulli 1987 casulli and cheng 1992 used in previous applications casulli and stelling 1998 casulli 1999 liu et al 2017 the resulting algorithm is second order accurate in both time and space wind velocity on the water surface accounts for the effect of wind stress on the flow velocity which is important because wind stress can have substantial impacts on water circulation and in turn cyanobacterial transport in shallow water numerical simulations of microcystis transport are typically predicted by solving the convection diffusion equation for microcystis concentration recent studies medrano et al 2016 wang et al 2017 include the impacts of temporal and spatial light intensity on the rate of change of colony density however the population dynamics of cyanobacterial bloom i e production and basal metabolism under varying environmental conditions are not included the efdc model tetra tech 2007 has successfully simulated the population dynamics of cyanobacteria but the vertical microcystis velocity is assumed to be constant which fails to track the density changes in microcystis colonies during the diurnal light cycle the current 3d nonhydrostatic free surface flow model was coupled with a cyanobacteria model that simulates both physical transport and population dynamics i e biological vertical movement and population growth and loss processes of the cyanobacterium microcystis sp the transport of microcystis was determined by solving the transient convection diffusion equation for the microcystis concentration hedger et al 2004 the vertical migration of microcystis was calculated based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance wang et al 2017 the transient microcystis production metabolism and predation rates at a given depth were calculated based on the effects of different environmental factors including nutrients irradiance water clarity and temperature using the equations included in the efdc model tetra tech 2007 compared to the hydrostatic efdc model the 3d model presented here is more accurate because it is nonhydrostatic the simulation results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models are compared and analyzed in the appendix the current model also simulates the vertical velocity of microcystis by calculating the density of microcystis colonies under various environmental conditions for the first time nonhydrostatic free surface flow microcystis transport buoyancy regulation migration and population dynamics are included in one 3d computational model even though the method is robust it requires large amounts of computational time when applied to fully nonhydrostatic flows the performance of the model is substantially improved by implementing parallel computing techniques into the program as an example the model is used to analyze the transport and population dynamics of microcystis in milford lake which is the largest man made lake in kansas milford lake suffers from harmful microcystis blooms nearly on an annual basis the effects of wind transport vertical migration and population dynamics on microcystis populations in milford lake are simulated and compared with observed data the results of this study provide useful guidance for water quality management and microcystis bloom predictions in milford lake the current model provides a robust and efficient way to model microcystis and can be applied to studies of other surface water systems effectively 2 governing equations 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for incompressible flow which can have the following form pedlosky 1979 1 u t u u x v u y w u z p x x a h u x y a h u y z a v u z f v 2 v t u v x v v y w v z p y x a h v x y a h v y z a v v z f u 3 w t u w x v w y w w z p z x a h w x y a h w y z a v w z g where x y and z are the cartesian coordinates x from west to east y from south to north and z vertical pointing upward t is the time u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively p is the normalized pressure defined as the pressure divided by a constant reference density a h and a v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity coefficients respectively f is the coriolis frequency and g is the gravitational acceleration the mass conservation is expressed by the continuity equation for incompressible flows 4 u x v y w z 0 integrating eq 4 over depth yields the following free surface elevation equation casulli 1999 5 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z 0 where η is the free surface elevation and h is the water depth measured from the undisturbed water surface the normalized pressure p in eqs 1 to 3 includes both the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure components neglecting the convective and the eddy viscosity terms in the vertical momentum eq 3 yields casulli 1999 6 p x y z t g η x y t z q x y z t where q is the nonhydrostatic pressure component substituting eq 6 into eqs 1 to 3 and neglecting the coriolis frequency yields 7 u t u u x v u y w u z g η x q x x a h u x y a h u y z a v u z 8 v t u v x v v y w v z g η y q y x a h v x y a h v y z a v v z 9 w t u w x v w y w w z q z x a h w x y a h w y z a v w z g the current hydrodynamic model is capable of simulating both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic flows normally the vertical velocity component w is determined using eq 9 and the model is considered nonhydrostatic when the hydrostatic assumption is made eq 9 is omitted and q 0 is assumed throughout the flow field and w can be determined using the continuity eq 4 which is less accurate than the nonhydrostatic model the simulation results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models are compared in the appendix in applications for large shallow water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs the ratio of horizontal length scale to vertical length scale is relatively large as a result the horizontal eddy viscosity terms are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the vertical eddy viscosity terms and their effects are negligible therefore the horizontal eddy viscosity is neglected in this study which is consistent with other previous works e g casulli and cheng 1992 the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient is determined using the mixing length model as rodi 1984 10 a v l m 2 u z 2 v z 2 1 2 where l m is the mixing length defined as 11 l m κ z f o r κ z 0 1 h 12 l m 0 1 h f o r κ z 0 1 h where κ is the von kármán constant typically to be 0 41 and h is the total water depth defined as 13 h η h when the horizontal eddy viscosities are not negligible other turbulence models such as those in liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 should be considered the boundary conditions at the free surface are specified by prescribing the wind stresses as smith 2006 14 a v u z τ w i n d x ρ w a v v z τ w i n d y ρ w where τ w i n d x and τ w i n d y are the wind shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively and ρ w is the water density the boundary conditions at the bottom are specified by expressing the bottom shear stresses as smith 2006 15 a v u z τ b e d x ρ w a v v z τ b e d y ρ w where τ b e d x and τ b e d y are the bed shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively the wind shear stress is determined as teeter et al 2001 16 τ w i n d ρ a c d u a 2 where ρ a is the air density u a is the wind speed and c d is the atmosphere drag coefficient appropriate for wind referenced to a height of 10 m which is determined based on the empirical formula as teeter 2001 17 c d 0 4 16 11 0 5 ln h 2 48 ln u a 2 then wind shear stresses in the x and y directions can be determined as 18 τ w i n d x τ w i n d cos θ τ w i n d y τ w i n d sin θ where θ is the wind direction measured counter clockwise from east the bed shear stresses are determined as vreugdenhil 1994 19 τ b e d x ρ w c b u b 2 v b 2 1 2 u b 20 τ b e d y ρ w c b u b 2 v b 2 1 2 v b where u b v b are horizontal velocity components at a level z b near the bottom and c b is the bed friction coefficient determined as smith 2006 21 c b κ 2 ln z b z 0 2 where z 0 is the characteristic length the current model is capable of simulating both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic flows meanwhile the efdc model can only be used for hydrostatic flows as the hydrostatic assumption is only valid under limited conditions the current model can be used in more applications than the efdc when dealing with open boundaries or rapidly changing bathymetries the validation of the current hydrodynamic model is included in the appendix 2 2 microcystis transport and population dynamics model microcystis transport is governed by a convection diffusion equation including the buoyancy effect hedger et al 2004 and the microcystis population dynamics model is developed based on the equations included in the efdc model efdc 2017 the combined microcystis transport and population dynamics model can be expressed as 22 c t u c x v c y w c z w s c z x a h s c t c x y a h s c t c y z a v s c t c z p b m p r c where c is microcystis concentration c e l l s m l w s is microcystis vertical velocity which is assumed as a constant in the efdc model and determined based on the density of a colony affected by irradiance in the current model s c t is the turbulent schmidt number p is microcystis production rate b m is the basal metabolism rate and p r is the predation rate 2 2 1 microcystis buoyancy mechanism the irradiance at local depth d is determined as kromkamp and walsby 1990 23 i d i 0 e ε d where i 0 is the surface irradiance and ε is the extinction coefficient the surface irradiance at time t is kromkamp and walsby 1990 24 i 0 i m sin π t d l where i m is the maximum irradiance at noon and d l is the day length from dawn to dusk the microcystis vertical velocity w s is assumed as a constant in the efdc in the current model it is related to its buoyancy by using a modification of the stokes equation given as wang et al 2017 25 w s g d c 2 ρ w ρ c o l 18 ϑ where d c is the equivalent diameter of the microcystis colony ρ w is the density of water ρ c o l is the density of a colony and ϑ is the viscosity of water the density of a microcystis colony is calculated as wang et al 2017 26 ρ c o l ρ c e l l n c e l l 1 n g a s ρ m u c 1 n c e l l where ρ c e l l is the cell tissue density n c e l l is the cell to colony volume ratio n g a s is the volume ratio of gas vesicles to cells and ρ m u c is the mass density of the mucilage in which the microcystis cells are embedded the buoyancy mechanism is controlled by the light intensity and history based on experiments the equilibrium rate of change of cell density by accumulation of carbohydrate is visser et al 1997 27 d ρ c e l l d t e q n 0 60 i e x p i i d m a x a i i r e f b ρ c e l

wallace and hamilton 1999 in contrast there is no time lag in response when the light intensity decreases the rate of change of density is calculated as wallace and hamilton 1999 wang et al 2017 28 d

wallace and hamilton 1999 29 d ρ c e l l d t d ρ c e l l d t e q 1 e t τ r when i d 0 05 i m the density change in the dark is determined based on the averaged previous irradiance i a as kromkamp and walsby 1990 wallace and hamilton 1999 30 d ρ c e l l d t c 2 i a c 3 where c 2 is the rate constant of density decrease and c 3 is the minimal rate of density decrease the microcystis buoyancy mechanism was tested separately and the simulation results were compared with the results of wallace and hamilton 1999 fig 2 c under the same conditions for the same time period the results for light intensities of 50 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 300 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 and 1300 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 are shown in fig 1 simulation results were consistent with literature results the values of the parameters used in the vertical migration model are shown in table 1 2 2 2 algal population dynamics the algal production rate p day 1 is calculated based on nutrient availability ambient light temperature and salinity which can be expressed as efdc 2017 31 p p m f 1 n f 2 i f 3 t f 4 s where p m day 1 is the maximum growth rate under optimal conditions f 1 n is the effect of suboptimal nutrient concentration 0 f 1 1 f 2 i is the effect of suboptimal light intensity 0 f 2 1 f 3 t is the effect of suboptimal temperature 0 f 3 1 and f 4 s is the effect of salinity 0 f 4 1 because microcystis blooms generally form in freshwater eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems like milford lake where growth limiting nutrients are replete we assumed nutrient limitation and salinity would not affect microcystis population dynamics and used a value of 1 for f 1 n and f 4 s this is consistent with other models developed for hypereutrophic wang et al 2017 freshwater systems cerco et al 2004 wu and xu 2011 kim et al 2017 thus microcystis production is based on only light and temperature in this study but nutrient and salinity limitations could be used in future modeling efforts via eq 31 the formulations for f 2 i and f 3 t can be found in the efdc user manual efdc 2017 the parameters of the population dynamics model used in this study are shown in table 2 the 3d heat transport

fig 2 recent spatial assessments of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in milford lake foster et al 2015 showed the existence of cyanobacteria in all zones of the reservoir i e riverine transitional and lacustrine zones of reservoir fig 3 foster et al 2015 based on measurements by the us geological survey usgs 2017 the inflow and outflow discharge rates were set to 56 63 m 3 s and initial free surface elevation was 348 81 m the wind speed and direction were collected by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017 the computational domain is turned 75 counter clockwise from the physical domain to fit the cartesian grid flow and wind directions are also turned accordingly the size of the computational domain is 18 5 km by 13 km by 22 m which was covered by a 186 131 90 finite difference mesh with the grid sizes to be δ x δ y 100 m and δ z 0 25 m based on grid independence studies a time step of 2 s was used in all simulations fig 4 shows the land elevations of milford lake above sea level in cartesian coordinates the initial microcystis concentration distributions shown in fig 5 were set based on measurement data foster et al 2015 the inlet microcystis concentration was set as 28 000 cells ml the 20 hour simulation results were compared to measurement data at f1 shown in fig 3 from 6 00 pm 26 july to 2 00 pm 27 july in 2015 the simulation only covered 20 h due to the limited measurement data four different environmental scenarios were simulated to investigate the effects of different environmental conditions on microcystis population dynamics in milford lake which are high irradiance hot weather clear water low irradiance hot weather clear water high irradiance cold weather clear water and high irradiance hot weather turbid water conditions the maximum irradiance at noon i m was set to be 400 w m 2 and 800 w m 2 for low and high irradiance conditions respectively the corresponding surface irradiance histories for 20 h are shown in fig 6 where the day length was assumed to be 12 h and the test started at 6 00 pm the surface temperature at time t was set differently for hot temperature between 25 c and 31 c and for cold temperature between 10 c and 16 c using the conditions shown in fig 7 the light extinction coefficient in eq 23 for milford lake was calculated based on the measurement data listed in table 3 based on eq 23 the light extinction coefficient is 33 ε ln i d i 0 d the corresponding values of the light extinction coefficient calculated based on eq 33 using measurement data were ε 1 0 95 m 1 ε 2 0 87 m 1 ε 3 0 88 m 1 and ε 4 1 43 m 1 the light extinction coefficient was set to be 0 8 m 1 for clear water condition and 2 0 m 1 for turbid water condition 4 results 4 1 irradiance effects to study the effects of

clarity effects the effects of water clarity were investigated under a high irradiance and hot weather condition microcystis concentration contours approximately 0 31 m below the free surface elevation 348 5 m at t 10 and 20 h 4 a m and 2 pm on 27 jul 2015 respectively under different water clarity conditions are shown in fig 10 see video simulations in the supplemental file the histories of simulated and measured surface microcystis concentration at f1 in fig 3 were compared in fig 11 5 discussions cyanobacterial blooms primarily comprised of microcystis sp have caused annual environmental ecological and economic problems in milford lake kansas since 2010 kdhe 2018 microcystis blooms have been toxic microcystin was the detected toxin and have caused 5 animal fatalities and multiple human illnesses in milford lake to date trevino garrison et al 2015 thus 3d models that aim to predict the transport and population dynamics of harmful cyanobacterial blooms are needed to better understand cyanobacterial transport due to wind and flow and conditions favorable for microcystis blooms as an example the current model was used to study microcystis transport and its population dynamics in milford lake four different possible environmental scenarios were simulated the effects of irradiance on the buoyancy mechanism of microcystis were simulated based on equations in wallace and hamilton 1999 for increasing light intensity our study results were consistent with wallace and hamilton 1999 and other field and laboratory studies ibelings et al 1991 visser et al 1997 and showed that the density of microcystis colonies increased as light intensity increased fig 1 the effects of irradiance on microcystis population dynamics in milford lake were simulated under different maximum irradiance at noon 400 w m 2 and 800 w m 2 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under higher irradiance condition fig 8 the effects of temperature on microcystis concentrations in milford lake were simulated under hot surface temperature between 25 c and 31 c and cold surface temperature between 10 c and 16 c weather conditions fig 7 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under hot weather condition fig 9 because i algal growth rate increases exponentially with temperature imai et al 2008 and ii the hot weather condition was closer to the range of optimal cyanobacteria temperatures between 28 c and 35 c laboratory and field based research has also shown that high temperatures favor cyanobacteria over other algal taxa due to the optimal growth rate of cyanobacteria being relatively higher than other taxa paerl and huisman 2008 but see lürling et al 2013 additionally recent research has shown that toxic microcystis blooms were favored at elevated temperatures in kansas reservoirs harris and graham 2017 the effects of water clarity conditions on microcystis concentrations in milford lake were simulated under clear light extinction coefficient 0 8 m 1 and turbid water conditions light extinction coefficient 2 0 m 1 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under clear water condition fig 10 this occurred because light can limit phytoplankton growth arteaga et al 2014 including buoyant cyanobacteria walsby and booker 1980 brookes and ganf 2001 thus the clear water condition simulated non limiting light conditions for phytoplankton whereas the turbid water conditions simulated how light limitation can affect microcystis growth overall 20 hour simulations showed that vertical and horizontal microcystis concentrations were dominated by physical transport even under environmental scenarios varying in ambient light temperature and water column turbidity fig 11 physical transport may have been more impactful on microcystis concentrations than environmental conditions because milford lake is located in the windiest ecoregion of the us i e great plains ecoregion national renewable energy laboratory relatively strong persistent winds likely prevent stable vertical stratification events during summer in milford similar to other reservoirs in the region harris and graham 2017 therefore process based simulation models developed for reservoirs in the great plains region of the us may be more sensitive to changes in physical processes than environmental conditions trends shown by the simulated results did not always mimic trends shown by the observed data the simulated results showed a substantial increase in microcystis concentration between 11 pm to 4 a m but the observed data showed a marked decrease fig 11 in contrast the rise of microcystis colonies to the surface of the water column throughout mid day 9 a m to 2 pm was shown in the observed data and correctly simulated by the current model fig 11 given i physical transport seemed to overwhelm effects of environmental conditions in simulation results and ii wind speed and direction were measured every hour ranging from 0 to 14 m s and 0 to 350 counterclockwise from east figs 14 and 15 noaa 2017 respectively during our simulation differences between simulated and observed microcystis concentrations are probably due to unaccounted changes in wind direction and speed differences between simulated and observed results during the first 10 h of the simulation may be because variable wind gusts could have caused variable wind mixing which may have caused microcystis colonies to sink below 0 31 m the depth where comparisons were made much faster in the observed data compared to the simulations wind speeds diminished in the last 10 h of the simulation and differences between simulated and measured microcystis concentrations were reduced although physical processes seemed to dominate changes in microcystis concentrations environmental conditions also played a role in determining microcystis distributions in the lake when wind speeds were relatively low i e the last 10 h of the simulation the simulated model performed well compared to measurement data fig 11 wind direction and speed directly affect water column mixing which in turn can affect water column suspended sediment concentrations i e turbidity this is likely why simulations showed that differences in the turbidity caused the greatest difference in microcystis concentrations fig 11 and indicates that water column light conditions have the greatest impact on microcystis distributions when physical processes are not dominant the lack of vertical and horizontal measurement data under a wide range of physical and environmental conditions unavoidably brought differences between the simulated and measured microcystis concentrations most parameters used to simulate populations dynamics were from the literature table 2 tetra tech 2005 and thus do not represent site specific estimates of the model parameters future studies should calibrate model parameters from site specific measured in situ processes additionally wind data was collected from an airport 20 km from milford lake as opposed to a buoy on the lake surface which could differ from reality and could make the simulated results disagree with the observed data given the simulations indicate that wind is one of the dominant factors controlling microcystis distributions even relatively small differences in wind direction and speed may have disproportionally large impacts on simulation results moreover 3d model development and testing were primarily based on 2d measurements which also likely induced error between simulated and measured microcystis distributions although the scope of field testing required to accurately estimate site specific model parameters and test 3d models in time and space is expensive and challenging future process based simulation models will likely need to be developed using data with a wider range of physical and environmental conditions to improve model performance future studies could also aim to test model predictions i in less dimensions or ii at longer periods of time i e develop models with longer time steps 6 conclusions in conclusion the current model is more advanced compared to the original efdc model which has been widely used in water quality assessment for surface water systems park et al 1995 ji et al 2001 kuo et al 1996 shen et al 1999 moustafa and hamrick 2000 kim et al 1998 2000 tetra tech 1999 2005 albertson et al 2002 park et al 2005 luo and li 2009 wu and xu 2011 for hydrodynamic modeling the current model solves the governing equations for nonhydrostatic free surface flow which is more accurate than hydrostatic models fig 12 in the appendix for microcystis modeling the current model determines the vertical migration of microcystis based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance sensu wang et al 2017 the vertical microcystis velocity is assumed to be constant in the efdc which fails to track the density changes in microcystis colonies during the diurnal light cycle our simulation results show that microcystis distributions in milford lake are most affected by physical processes but can also be affected by turbidity when winds are calm therefore the current model presents a robust and comprehensive way for modeling physical and environmental effects on microcystis in surface water systems and could be applied to other systems suffering from microcystis or other buoyant cyanobacterial blooms acknowledgements the authors would like to thank kansas department of health and environment kdhe for providing financial support grant number 2017 mil2 2016 tmdl5

solutions the numerical method presented in section 2 1 was validated by comparing simulation results with analytical solutions and measurement data the first validation case was to test a two dimensional standing wave in a square basin whose length l and depth h are 10 m the flow was driven by the following initial sinusoidal free surface elevations along the x axis at t 0 1 1 η 0 1 cos π l x based on the dispersion relation lamb 1945 the analytical solution for this standing wave is given as 1 2 η x t 0 1 cos k x cos σ t where the wavenumber k 2 π λ the wave length λ 2 l the angular

size of 0 0625 m in both the horizontal and vertical directions and a time step of 0 0001 s were used to simulate the oscillations of the standing wave for 5 s the bottom friction and vertical eddy viscosity terms were neglected fig 12 shows the free surface elevation histories over the 5 s period at x 7 5 m 8 m and 10 m obtained with the current hydrostatic nonhydrostatic simulations and the analytical solutions the results simulated by the current nonhydrostatic model are substantially closer to the analytical solutions than the results simulated by the current hydrostatic model which shows the advantage of nonhydrostatic models over hydrostatic models such as the efdc efdc 2017 2 comparison with measurement data the second validation case was to test the spatial evolution of steep waves propagating over a longshore bar the simulation results were compared to the scheldt flume experimental data collected by delft hydraulics beji and battjes 1994 the flume has an overall length of 30 m and the flume geometry is shown in fig 13 a starting with zero initial velocity the water level over the horizontal bottom was 0 4 m and reduced to 0 1 m over a submerged trapezoidal bar a plane beach with a slope of 1 25 was located at the end of the flume serving as a wave absorber a grid size of δ x δ z 2 5 c m and a time step of 0 001 s were used in the simulation a sinusoidal wave of amplitude 1 cm and period of 2 02 s was specified at the left open boundary the simulated free surface elevations at 2 m and 13 5 m from the left open boundary were compared with the measurement

25091,cyanobacterial blooms pose severe ecological and economical threats in lakes and reservoirs understanding the complex physical transport and biological features of cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae is important for predicting blooms in freshwater systems in this study a three dimensional model for nonhydrostatic free surface flow and microcystis sp cyanobacteria transport and associated population dynamics is presented the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using a semi implicit fractional time step finite difference method the hydrodynamic model can couple microcystis transport to a population dynamics model that simulates buoyancy vertical migration and effects of temperature light nutrients and salinity on the concentration of microcystis microcystis transport was determined by solving the convection diffusion equation the vertical migration of microcystis was simulated based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance the transient microcystis production at a given depth was calculated based on the effects of different environmental factors such as depth irradiance and temperature the model was used to analyze the transport and growth of microcystis in milford lake which is the largest man made lake in kansas transport and population dynamics of microcystis under different environmental conditions were simulated and the effects of different environmental factors were compared in a 20 hour test overall physical processes like wind mixing most effected microcystis distribution throughout the simulation when wind was low water column turbidity effected microcystis distribution more than temperature or ambient light this study is the first 3d nonhydrostatic free surface flow computational model that includes microcystis transport buoyancy regulation vertical migration and population dynamics nonhydrostatic models are needed because existing ecological models with hydrostatic approximation can be ill posed when dealing with open boundaries and hydrostatic approximation is not valid when dealing with flow over rapidly changing slopes the current model is a robust and efficient way to model microcystis transport and can be applied to studies of other surface water systems effectively keywords cyanobacteria transport finite difference method nonhydrostatic free surface flow microcystis vertical migration 3 dimensional hydrodynamic ecological modeling 1 introduction blooms of cyanobacteria also known as blue green algae are increasing globally cyanobacteria are favored over other algal taxa in warm 25 c nutrient enriched especially nitrogen and phosphorus waterbodies paerl and otten 2013 in addition to the above conditions cyanobacteria can outcompete other algal taxa in low turbulent systems because of the presence of gas vesicles which allows cyanobacteria to vertically migrate daily in the water column vertical migration helps cyanobacteria i float near the surface of the water column and shade other algal taxa in the morning and ii sink into the water column to avoid harmful uv light in the afternoon paerl and otten 2013 cyanobacterial blooms have negative consequences to surface water users negative consequences include the production of harmful toxins and volatile organic compounds that cause animal human illness and taste and odor issues in drinking water supplies respectively wu and xu 2011 because toxic cyanobacterial blooms cause negative animal and human health effects trevino garrison et al 2015 understanding the complex physical transport and growth limitations of cyanobacteria is important to predict the temporal and spatial dynamics of blooms which may ultimately prevent human exposure to harmful cyanobacterial metabolites the physical transport of cyanobacteria is dominated by water circulation and wind induced waves these factors impact daily vertical migrations of cyanobacteria in the water column ishikawa et al 2002 cao et al 2006 moreno ostos et al 2009 blottière et al 2014 wang et al 2017 studies have shown that the density of the cyanobacterium microcystis colony changes when subjected to different light intensities that occur at different times of the day kromkamp and walsby 1990 wallace et al 2000 chien et al 2013 medrano et al 2013 wang et al 2017 for the population dynamics of cyanobacteria blooms different environmental factors including nutrients irradiance temperature and salinity need to be considered xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2011 wu and xu 2011 ma et al 2014 the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc is a multifunctional computational modeling system capable of simulating hydrodynamics algal transport and production as well as other water quality constituents in one two and three dimensions tetra tech 2007 during the past two decades the efdc model has been applied to over 100 surface water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands estuaries and coastal regions for water quality assessment park et al 1995 kuo et al 1996 shen et al 1999 moustafa and hamrick 2000 ji et al 2001 kim et al 1998 2000 tetra tech 1999 2005 albertson et al 2002 park et al 2005 luo and li 2009 wu and xu 2011 the hydrostatic primitive equations are solved in the efdc and other models blumberg and mellor 1987 leendertse 1989 casulli and cheng 1992 however 3d hydrostatic models can be ill posed when dealing with open boundaries oliger and sundström 1978 mahadevan et al 1996 and the hydrostatic assumption is not valid when fluid flows over rapidly varying slopes and short waves where the ratio of the vertical to horizontal scales is not sufficiently small casulli 1999 therefore a three dimensional 3d model including nonhydrostatic free surface flow with both physical transport and population dynamics for cyanobacterium microcystis sp is needed and developed in this study the hydrodynamic model solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations by a semi implicit fractional time step finite difference method on a staggered cartesian grid where the hydrostatic components are determined first and the non hydrostatic pressure and other components are determined in a subsequent step casulli and stelling 1998 casulli 1999 liu et al 2017 the algorithm is locally and globally mass conservative and can be applied to different free surface problems ranging from hydrostatic to fully nonhydrostatic the scheme is further improved by including a mixing length turbulence model rodi 1984 which is widely used in hydraulic turbulent flows rodi 1987 reichert et al 2001 lesser et al 2004 zhang and baptista 2008 in addition the convective terms are discretized by an explicit second order upwind scheme in space zhang et al 2011 2013 zhang et al 2014 which is more efficient and can reach higher order accuracy than the eulerian lagrangian method cheng et al 1984 casulli 1987 casulli and cheng 1992 used in previous applications casulli and stelling 1998 casulli 1999 liu et al 2017 the resulting algorithm is second order accurate in both time and space wind velocity on the water surface accounts for the effect of wind stress on the flow velocity which is important because wind stress can have substantial impacts on water circulation and in turn cyanobacterial transport in shallow water numerical simulations of microcystis transport are typically predicted by solving the convection diffusion equation for microcystis concentration recent studies medrano et al 2016 wang et al 2017 include the impacts of temporal and spatial light intensity on the rate of change of colony density however the population dynamics of cyanobacterial bloom i e production and basal metabolism under varying environmental conditions are not included the efdc model tetra tech 2007 has successfully simulated the population dynamics of cyanobacteria but the vertical microcystis velocity is assumed to be constant which fails to track the density changes in microcystis colonies during the diurnal light cycle the current 3d nonhydrostatic free surface flow model was coupled with a cyanobacteria model that simulates both physical transport and population dynamics i e biological vertical movement and population growth and loss processes of the cyanobacterium microcystis sp the transport of microcystis was determined by solving the transient convection diffusion equation for the microcystis concentration hedger et al 2004 the vertical migration of microcystis was calculated based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance wang et al 2017 the transient microcystis production metabolism and predation rates at a given depth were calculated based on the effects of different environmental factors including nutrients irradiance water clarity and temperature using the equations included in the efdc model tetra tech 2007 compared to the hydrostatic efdc model the 3d model presented here is more accurate because it is nonhydrostatic the simulation results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models are compared and analyzed in the appendix the current model also simulates the vertical velocity of microcystis by calculating the density of microcystis colonies under various environmental conditions for the first time nonhydrostatic free surface flow microcystis transport buoyancy regulation migration and population dynamics are included in one 3d computational model even though the method is robust it requires large amounts of computational time when applied to fully nonhydrostatic flows the performance of the model is substantially improved by implementing parallel computing techniques into the program as an example the model is used to analyze the transport and population dynamics of microcystis in milford lake which is the largest man made lake in kansas milford lake suffers from harmful microcystis blooms nearly on an annual basis the effects of wind transport vertical migration and population dynamics on microcystis populations in milford lake are simulated and compared with observed data the results of this study provide useful guidance for water quality management and microcystis bloom predictions in milford lake the current model provides a robust and efficient way to model microcystis and can be applied to studies of other surface water systems effectively 2 governing equations 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for incompressible flow which can have the following form pedlosky 1979 1 u t u u x v u y w u z p x x a h u x y a h u y z a v u z f v 2 v t u v x v v y w v z p y x a h v x y a h v y z a v v z f u 3 w t u w x v w y w w z p z x a h w x y a h w y z a v w z g where x y and z are the cartesian coordinates x from west to east y from south to north and z vertical pointing upward t is the time u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively p is the normalized pressure defined as the pressure divided by a constant reference density a h and a v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity coefficients respectively f is the coriolis frequency and g is the gravitational acceleration the mass conservation is expressed by the continuity equation for incompressible flows 4 u x v y w z 0 integrating eq 4 over depth yields the following free surface elevation equation casulli 1999 5 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z 0 where η is the free surface elevation and h is the water depth measured from the undisturbed water surface the normalized pressure p in eqs 1 to 3 includes both the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure components neglecting the convective and the eddy viscosity terms in the vertical momentum eq 3 yields casulli 1999 6 p x y z t g η x y t z q x y z t where q is the nonhydrostatic pressure component substituting eq 6 into eqs 1 to 3 and neglecting the coriolis frequency yields 7 u t u u x v u y w u z g η x q x x a h u x y a h u y z a v u z 8 v t u v x v v y w v z g η y q y x a h v x y a h v y z a v v z 9 w t u w x v w y w w z q z x a h w x y a h w y z a v w z g the current hydrodynamic model is capable of simulating both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic flows normally the vertical velocity component w is determined using eq 9 and the model is considered nonhydrostatic when the hydrostatic assumption is made eq 9 is omitted and q 0 is assumed throughout the flow field and w can be determined using the continuity eq 4 which is less accurate than the nonhydrostatic model the simulation results of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic models are compared in the appendix in applications for large shallow water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs the ratio of horizontal length scale to vertical length scale is relatively large as a result the horizontal eddy viscosity terms are typically orders of magnitude smaller than the vertical eddy viscosity terms and their effects are negligible therefore the horizontal eddy viscosity is neglected in this study which is consistent with other previous works e g casulli and cheng 1992 the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient is determined using the mixing length model as rodi 1984 10 a v l m 2 u z 2 v z 2 1 2 where l m is the mixing length defined as 11 l m κ z f o r κ z 0 1 h 12 l m 0 1 h f o r κ z 0 1 h where κ is the von kármán constant typically to be 0 41 and h is the total water depth defined as 13 h η h when the horizontal eddy viscosities are not negligible other turbulence models such as those in liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 should be considered the boundary conditions at the free surface are specified by prescribing the wind stresses as smith 2006 14 a v u z τ w i n d x ρ w a v v z τ w i n d y ρ w where τ w i n d x and τ w i n d y are the wind shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively and ρ w is the water density the boundary conditions at the bottom are specified by expressing the bottom shear stresses as smith 2006 15 a v u z τ b e d x ρ w a v v z τ b e d y ρ w where τ b e d x and τ b e d y are the bed shear stresses in the x and y directions respectively the wind shear stress is determined as teeter et al 2001 16 τ w i n d ρ a c d u a 2 where ρ a is the air density u a is the wind speed and c d is the atmosphere drag coefficient appropriate for wind referenced to a height of 10 m which is determined based on the empirical formula as teeter 2001 17 c d 0 4 16 11 0 5 ln h 2 48 ln u a 2 then wind shear stresses in the x and y directions can be determined as 18 τ w i n d x τ w i n d cos θ τ w i n d y τ w i n d sin θ where θ is the wind direction measured counter clockwise from east the bed shear stresses are determined as vreugdenhil 1994 19 τ b e d x ρ w c b u b 2 v b 2 1 2 u b 20 τ b e d y ρ w c b u b 2 v b 2 1 2 v b where u b v b are horizontal velocity components at a level z b near the bottom and c b is the bed friction coefficient determined as smith 2006 21 c b κ 2 ln z b z 0 2 where z 0 is the characteristic length the current model is capable of simulating both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic flows meanwhile the efdc model can only be used for hydrostatic flows as the hydrostatic assumption is only valid under limited conditions the current model can be used in more applications than the efdc when dealing with open boundaries or rapidly changing bathymetries the validation of the current hydrodynamic model is included in the appendix 2 2 microcystis transport and population dynamics model microcystis transport is governed by a convection diffusion equation including the buoyancy effect hedger et al 2004 and the microcystis population dynamics model is developed based on the equations included in the efdc model efdc 2017 the combined microcystis transport and population dynamics model can be expressed as 22 c t u c x v c y w c z w s c z x a h s c t c x y a h s c t c y z a v s c t c z p b m p r c where c is microcystis concentration c e l l s m l w s is microcystis vertical velocity which is assumed as a constant in the efdc model and determined based on the density of a colony affected by irradiance in the current model s c t is the turbulent schmidt number p is microcystis production rate b m is the basal metabolism rate and p r is the predation rate 2 2 1 microcystis buoyancy mechanism the irradiance at local depth d is determined as kromkamp and walsby 1990 23 i d i 0 e ε d where i 0 is the surface irradiance and ε is the extinction coefficient the surface irradiance at time t is kromkamp and walsby 1990 24 i 0 i m sin π t d l where i m is the maximum irradiance at noon and d l is the day length from dawn to dusk the microcystis vertical velocity w s is assumed as a constant in the efdc in the current model it is related to its buoyancy by using a modification of the stokes equation given as wang et al 2017 25 w s g d c 2 ρ w ρ c o l 18 ϑ where d c is the equivalent diameter of the microcystis colony ρ w is the density of water ρ c o l is the density of a colony and ϑ is the viscosity of water the density of a microcystis colony is calculated as wang et al 2017 26 ρ c o l ρ c e l l n c e l l 1 n g a s ρ m u c 1 n c e l l where ρ c e l l is the cell tissue density n c e l l is the cell to colony volume ratio n g a s is the volume ratio of gas vesicles to cells and ρ m u c is the mass density of the mucilage in which the microcystis cells are embedded the buoyancy mechanism is controlled by the light intensity and history based on experiments the equilibrium rate of change of cell density by accumulation of carbohydrate is visser et al 1997 27 d ρ c e l l d t e q n 0 60 i e x p i i d m a x a i i r e f b ρ c e l

wallace and hamilton 1999 in contrast there is no time lag in response when the light intensity decreases the rate of change of density is calculated as wallace and hamilton 1999 wang et al 2017 28 d

wallace and hamilton 1999 29 d ρ c e l l d t d ρ c e l l d t e q 1 e t τ r when i d 0 05 i m the density change in the dark is determined based on the averaged previous irradiance i a as kromkamp and

mechanism was tested separately and the simulation results were compared with the results of wallace and hamilton 1999 fig 2 c under the same conditions for the same time period the results for light intensities of 50 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 300 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 and 1300 μ m o l photons m 2 s 1 are shown in fig 1 simulation results were consistent with literature results the values of the parameters used in the vertical migration model are shown in table 1 2 2 2 algal population dynamics the algal production rate p day 1 is calculated based on nutrient availability ambient light temperature and salinity which can be expressed as efdc 2017 31 p p m f 1 n f 2 i f 3 t f 4 s where p m day 1 is the maximum growth rate under optimal conditions f 1 n is the effect of suboptimal nutrient concentration 0 f 1 1 f 2 i is the effect of suboptimal light intensity 0 f 2 1 f 3 t is the effect of suboptimal temperature 0 f 3 1 and f 4 s is the effect of salinity 0 f 4 1 because microcystis blooms generally form in freshwater eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems like milford lake where growth limiting nutrients are replete we assumed nutrient limitation and salinity would not affect microcystis population dynamics and used a value of 1 for f 1 n and f 4 s this is consistent with other models developed for hypereutrophic wang et al 2017 freshwater systems cerco et al 2004 wu and xu 2011 kim et al 2017 thus microcystis production is based on only light and temperature in this study but nutrient and salinity limitations could be used in future modeling efforts via eq 31 the formulations for f 2 i and f 3 t can be found in the efdc user manual efdc 2017 the parameters of the population dynamics model used in this study are shown in table 2 the 3d heat transport

fig 2 recent spatial assessments of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in milford lake foster et al 2015 showed the existence of cyanobacteria in all zones of the reservoir i e riverine transitional and lacustrine zones of reservoir fig 3 foster et al 2015 based on measurements by the us geological survey usgs 2017 the inflow and outflow discharge rates were set to 56 63 m 3 s and initial free surface elevation was 348 81 m the wind speed and direction were collected by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2017 the computational domain is turned 75 counter clockwise from the physical domain to fit the cartesian grid flow and wind directions are also turned accordingly the size of the computational domain is 18 5 km by 13 km by 22 m which was covered by a 186 131 90 finite difference mesh with the grid sizes to be δ x δ y 100 m and δ z 0 25 m based on grid independence studies a time step of 2 s was used in all simulations fig 4 shows the land elevations of milford lake above sea level in cartesian coordinates the initial microcystis concentration distributions shown in fig 5 were set based on measurement data foster et al 2015 the inlet microcystis concentration was set as 28 000 cells ml the 20 hour simulation results were compared to measurement data at f1 shown in fig 3 from 6 00 pm 26 july to 2 00 pm 27 july in 2015 the simulation only covered 20 h due to the limited measurement data four different environmental scenarios were simulated to investigate the effects of different environmental conditions on microcystis population dynamics in milford lake which are high irradiance hot weather clear water low irradiance hot weather clear water high irradiance cold weather clear water and high irradiance hot weather turbid water conditions the maximum irradiance at noon i m was set to be 400 w m 2 and 800 w m 2 for low and high irradiance conditions respectively the corresponding surface irradiance histories for 20 h are shown in fig 6 where the day length was assumed to be 12 h and the test started at 6 00 pm the surface temperature at time t was set differently for hot temperature between 25 c and 31 c and for cold temperature between 10 c and 16 c using the conditions shown in fig 7 the light extinction coefficient in eq 23 for milford lake was calculated based on the measurement data listed in table 3 based on eq 23 the light extinction coefficient is 33 ε ln i d i 0 d the corresponding values of the light extinction coefficient calculated based on eq 33 using measurement data were ε 1 0 95 m 1 ε 2 0 87 m 1 ε 3 0 88 m 1 and ε 4 1 43 m 1 the light extinction coefficient was set to be 0 8 m 1 for clear water condition and 2 0 m 1 for turbid water condition 4 results 4 1 irradiance effects to study the effects of irradiance tests were simulated under a hot weather and clear water condition the effects of water clarity and temperature are discussed later microcystis concentration contours approximately 0 31 m below the free surface elevation 348 5 m at t 10 and 20 h 4 a m and 2 pm on 27 jul 2015 respectively under different irradiance conditions are shown in fig 8 see video simulations in the supplemental file 4 2 temperature effects the effects of temperature were investigated under a high irradiance and hot weather condition microcystis concentration contours approximately 0 31 m below the free surface elevation 348 5 m at t 10 and 20 h 4 a m and 2 pm on 27 jul 2015 respectively under different temperature conditions are shown in fig 9 see video simulations in the supplemental file 4 3 water clarity effects the effects of water clarity were investigated under a high irradiance and hot weather condition microcystis concentration contours approximately 0 31 m below the free surface elevation 348 5 m at t 10 and 20 h 4 a m and 2 pm on 27 jul 2015 respectively under different water clarity conditions are shown in fig 10 see video simulations in the supplemental file the histories of simulated and measured surface microcystis concentration at f1 in fig 3 were compared in fig 11 5 discussions cyanobacterial blooms primarily comprised of microcystis sp have caused annual environmental ecological and economic problems in milford lake kansas since 2010 kdhe 2018 microcystis blooms have been toxic microcystin was the detected toxin and have caused 5 animal fatalities and multiple human illnesses in milford lake to date trevino garrison et al 2015 thus 3d models that aim to predict the transport and population dynamics of harmful cyanobacterial blooms are needed to better understand cyanobacterial transport due to wind and flow and conditions favorable for microcystis blooms as an example the current model was used to study microcystis transport and its population dynamics in milford lake four different possible environmental scenarios were simulated the effects of irradiance on the buoyancy mechanism of microcystis were simulated based on equations in wallace and hamilton 1999 for increasing light intensity our study results were consistent with wallace and hamilton 1999 and other field and laboratory studies ibelings et al 1991 visser et al 1997 and showed that the density of microcystis colonies increased as light intensity increased fig 1 the effects of irradiance on microcystis population dynamics in milford lake were simulated under different maximum irradiance at noon 400 w m 2 and 800 w m 2 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under higher irradiance condition fig 8 the effects of temperature on microcystis concentrations in milford lake were simulated under hot surface temperature between 25 c and 31 c and cold surface temperature between 10 c and 16 c weather conditions fig 7 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under hot weather condition fig 9 because i algal growth rate increases exponentially with temperature imai et al 2008 and ii the hot weather condition was closer to the range of optimal cyanobacteria temperatures between 28 c and 35 c laboratory and field based research has also shown that high temperatures favor cyanobacteria over other algal taxa due to the optimal growth rate of cyanobacteria being relatively higher than other taxa paerl and huisman 2008 but see lürling et al 2013 additionally recent research has shown that toxic microcystis blooms were favored at elevated temperatures in kansas reservoirs harris and graham 2017 the effects of water clarity conditions on microcystis concentrations in milford lake were simulated under clear light extinction coefficient 0 8 m 1 and turbid water conditions light extinction coefficient 2 0 m 1 microcystis concentration approximately 0 31 m below the free surface was denser at 10 h and 20 h under clear water condition fig 10 this occurred because light can limit phytoplankton growth arteaga et al 2014 including buoyant cyanobacteria walsby and booker 1980 brookes and ganf 2001 thus the clear water condition simulated non limiting light conditions for phytoplankton whereas the turbid water conditions simulated how light limitation can affect microcystis growth overall 20 hour simulations showed that vertical and horizontal microcystis concentrations were dominated by physical transport even under environmental scenarios varying in ambient light temperature and water column turbidity fig 11 physical transport may have been more impactful on microcystis concentrations than environmental conditions because milford lake is located in the windiest ecoregion of the us i e great plains ecoregion national renewable energy laboratory relatively strong persistent winds likely prevent stable vertical stratification events during summer in milford similar to other reservoirs in the region harris and graham 2017 therefore process based simulation models developed for reservoirs in the great plains region of the us may be more sensitive to changes in physical processes than environmental conditions trends shown by the simulated results did not always mimic trends shown by the observed data the simulated results showed a substantial increase in microcystis concentration between 11 pm to 4 a m but the observed data showed a marked decrease fig 11 in contrast the rise of microcystis colonies to the surface of the water column throughout mid day 9 a m to 2 pm was shown in the observed data and correctly simulated by the current model fig 11 given i physical transport seemed to overwhelm effects of environmental conditions in simulation results and ii wind speed and direction were measured every hour ranging from 0 to 14 m s and 0 to 350 counterclockwise from east figs 14 and 15 noaa 2017 respectively during our simulation differences between simulated and observed microcystis concentrations are probably due to unaccounted changes in wind direction and speed differences between simulated and observed results during the first 10 h of the simulation may be because variable wind gusts could have caused variable wind mixing which may have caused microcystis colonies to sink below 0 31 m the depth where comparisons were made much faster in the observed data compared to the simulations wind speeds diminished in the last 10 h of the simulation and differences between simulated and measured microcystis concentrations were reduced although physical processes seemed to dominate changes in microcystis concentrations environmental conditions also played a role in determining microcystis distributions in the lake when wind speeds were relatively low i e the last 10 h of the simulation the simulated model performed well compared to measurement data fig 11 wind direction and speed directly affect water column mixing which in turn can affect water column suspended sediment concentrations i e turbidity this is likely why simulations showed that differences in the turbidity caused the greatest difference in microcystis concentrations fig 11 and indicates that water column light conditions have the greatest impact on microcystis distributions when physical processes are not dominant the lack of vertical and horizontal measurement data under a wide range of physical and environmental conditions unavoidably brought differences between the simulated and measured microcystis concentrations most parameters used to simulate populations dynamics were from the literature table 2 tetra tech 2005 and thus do not represent site specific estimates of the model parameters future studies should calibrate model parameters from site specific measured in situ processes additionally wind data was collected from an airport 20 km from milford lake as opposed to a buoy on the lake surface which could differ from reality and could make the simulated results disagree with the observed data given the simulations indicate that wind is one of the dominant factors controlling microcystis distributions even relatively small differences in wind direction and speed may have disproportionally large impacts on simulation results moreover 3d model development and testing were primarily based on 2d measurements which also likely induced error between simulated and measured microcystis distributions although the scope of field testing required to accurately estimate site specific model parameters and test 3d models in time and space is expensive and challenging future process based simulation models will likely need to be developed using data with a wider range of physical and environmental conditions to improve model performance future studies could also aim to test model predictions i in less dimensions or ii at longer periods of time i e develop models with longer time steps 6 conclusions in conclusion the current model is more advanced compared to the original efdc model which has been widely used in water quality assessment for surface water systems park et al 1995 ji et al 2001 kuo et al 1996 shen et al 1999 moustafa and hamrick 2000 kim et al 1998 2000 tetra tech 1999 2005 albertson et al 2002 park et al 2005 luo and li 2009 wu and xu 2011 for hydrodynamic modeling the current model solves the governing equations for nonhydrostatic free surface flow which is more accurate than hydrostatic models fig 12 in the appendix for microcystis modeling the current model determines the vertical migration of microcystis based on buoyancy density changes of a colony at a given depth and time due to irradiance sensu wang et al 2017 the vertical microcystis velocity is assumed to be constant in the efdc which fails to track the density changes in microcystis colonies during the diurnal light cycle our simulation results show that microcystis distributions in milford lake are most affected by physical processes but can also be affected by turbidity when winds are calm therefore the current model presents a robust and comprehensive way for modeling physical and environmental effects on microcystis in surface water systems and could be applied to other systems suffering from microcystis or

solutions the numerical method presented in section 2 1 was validated by comparing simulation results with analytical solutions and measurement data the first validation case was to test a two dimensional standing wave in a square basin whose length l and depth h are 10 m the flow was driven by the following initial sinusoidal free surface elevations along the x axis at t 0 1 1 η 0 1 cos π l x based on the dispersion relation lamb 1945 the analytical solution for this standing wave is given as 1 2 η x t 0 1 cos k x cos σ t where the wavenumber k 2 π λ the wave length λ 2 l the angular

size of 0 0625 m in both the horizontal and vertical directions and a time step of 0 0001 s were used to simulate the oscillations of the standing wave for 5 s the bottom friction and vertical eddy viscosity terms were neglected fig 12 shows the free surface elevation histories over the 5 s period at x 7 5 m 8 m and 10 m obtained with the current hydrostatic nonhydrostatic simulations and the analytical solutions the results simulated by the current nonhydrostatic model are substantially closer to the analytical solutions than the results simulated by the current hydrostatic model which shows the advantage of nonhydrostatic models over hydrostatic models such as the efdc efdc 2017 2 comparison with measurement data the second validation case was to test the spatial evolution of steep waves propagating over a longshore bar the simulation results were compared to the scheldt flume experimental data collected by delft hydraulics beji and battjes 1994 the flume has an overall length of 30 m and the flume geometry is shown in fig 13 a starting with zero initial velocity the water level over the horizontal bottom was 0 4 m and reduced to 0 1 m over a submerged trapezoidal bar a plane beach with a slope of 1 25 was located at the end of the flume serving as a wave absorber a grid size of δ x δ z 2 5 c m and a time step of 0 001 s were used in the simulation a sinusoidal wave of amplitude 1 cm and period of 2 02 s was specified at the left open boundary the simulated free surface elevations at 2 m and 13 5 m from the left open boundary were compared with the measurement

25092,equilibrium based methods are widely used in the literature on population ecology to analyze the sustainability of the management strategy this approach fails to account for many factors such as age specific natural mortality rates the cohort survival rates the possibility of extinction the characterization of the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics we propose here a method based on the theory of non linear dynamic systems that determines necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in age structured models using time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function the method characterizes the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics depending on the cohort survival rates we find that there are two opposite scenarios extinction or positive equilibrium in the latter case we also find the possibility of collapse with slow recovery we demonstrate that the stock tends to equilibrium at an exponential rate in both scenarios considering the northern cod gadus morhua stock by way of illustration we find that slow recovery of the stock could be expected at sufficiently low cohort survival rates despite the fact that the condition for the stability of the equilibrium was met during the moratorium period positive equilibrium this result is consistent with the species lack of expected recovery in contrast to equilibrium based methods under constant natural mortality rates and the precautionary approach framework we also find the possibility of extinction at sufficiently low cohort survival rates even in the absence of harvesting keywords dynamic systems age structured models equilibrium stability transient dynamics hockey stick stock recruitment population dynamics 1 introduction equilibrium based methods are widely used in the literature on fisheries research in most cases simulation based approaches are used to analyze the sustainability of the main reference points by projecting an age structured model to equilibrium under different fishing mortality rates different reasonable scenarios with different assumptions about the stock recruitment relationship and a constant natural mortality rate e g morgan et al 2014a b for cod stocks the hockey stick stock recruitment function hs srf is commonly used in these simulation based approaches e g duplisea 2012 ices 2014 morgan et al 2014a b natural mortality is also typically assumed to be constant over age in fish stock assessments and evaluation of management plans this approach fails to account for age specific natural mortality rates the characterization of the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics dynamics toward equilibrium which characterize the behavior of a dynamical system before long term equilibrium is reached understanding transient dynamics remains one of the challenges in ecology and fisheries management hastings 2004 white et al 2013 stott 2016 transient dynamics have only recently started to getting attention from the ecological literature using density independence linear matrix population models to analyze short term population responses to perturbations stott 2016 and references therein arnoldi et al 2018 in white et al 2013 a density independence age structured model is used to analyze transient dynamics in the implementation of no take marine reserves due to the absence of a stock recruitment function density independence models are appropriate only for representing the initial increase in abundance within an overexploited fish stock white et al 2013 continuous time dynamic systems have proven to be a useful tool to guarantee sustainability in different settings in which transient dynamics lafuite and loreau 2017 and multiple equilibria dorsey and hardy 2018 are evaluated numerically there is a clear need for greater research on transient dynamics in density dependence models stott 2016 this need becomes even more urgent in fisheries research if we consider that transient dynamics are crucial in understanding the observed collapse and lack of expected recovery of many fish stocks which are far away from their long term equilibriums frank et al 2011 in addition the duration of the transient is expected to increase in collapsed fisheries which could take a long time to recover despite the fact that fishing mortality has been reduced or even when a moratorium is in effect one of the most dramatic collapses in the history of fisheries has been the collapse of the northern cod stock ncs the ncs comprising populations of atlantic cod from southern labrador and eastern newfoundland nafo divisions 2j3kl was once one of the world s largest commercial fisheries however after decades of severe overexploitation the ncs collapsed in 1992 and a moratorium on fishing had to be imposed even after a 27 year moratorium the fishery has not yet recovered the aim of this paper is to develop a method based on the theory of non linear discrete time dynamic systems which allows us to analyze the equilibrium and transient dynamics in density dependence models in particular the method allows us to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in deterministic age structured models using time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hs srf the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics are also established limit reference points based on the spawning stock biomass ssb only are commonly used by management agencies like the international council for the exploration of the sea ices to indicate the ssb limit reference point below which there is a higher risk that fish stocks could collapse the definition of collapse is based on the precautionary approach pa framework developed by ices for providing precautionary fisheries management advice in the ices pa framework collapse does not mean that a stock is at high risk of biological extinction however recovery is likely to be slow ices 2005 the above framework does not provide the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics in addition it does not contemplate all possible scenarios of collapse as its definition is based only on the ssb limit reference point in which the cohort survival rates are not taken into account moreover it does not contemplate the possibility of extinction dulvy et al 2003 2004 which is not taken into account in the pa framework and consequently they assume that recovery is always possible hauge et al 2007 considering the ncs by way of illustration we show that the model fits well with the growth of the ssb observed during short term periods and consequently it allows us to analyze short term population responses to variations in survival rates we also show that the species should have already been recovered under constant natural mortality rates which is not consistent with what really happened we also show that even in the absence of harvesting if age specific natural mortality rates are considered limit reference points based only on the ssb might not be safe enough to prevent collapse with slow recovery and even extinction of the species 2 material and methods 2 1 age structured model the population is divided into n age groups cohorts where x k i denotes the population numbers of age i at time k i 1 n k 0 1 2 in each period k there is a unique mature cohort n plus age group x k n which gives rise to the population of age 1 recruitment in period k 1 x k 1 1 through a nonlinear function f e g the hockey stick stock recruitment function see section 2 2 such that x k 1 1 f x k n w n where x k n w n is the ssb and w n the mean weighted weight measured in kg at age n the mature cohort assuming constant survival rates time independent β i for each cohort x k i the deterministic cohort population autonomous model is given by 1 x 1 k 1 f x k n w n x i k 1 β i 1 x i 1 k i 2 n 1 x n k 1 β n 1 x n 1 k β n x n k the cohort population model as defined in 1 is a nonlinear and autonomous dynamic system in luenberger 1979 a cohort population model as defined in 1 is analyzed but assuming a linear function f denoting the mature population in equilibrium by x n e as measured in population numbers the equilibrium conditions are given by 2 x 1 e f x n e w n x i e β i 1 x i 1 e i 2 n 1 x n e β n 1 x n 1 e β n x n e inserting the first equation of the system 2 into the second equation x 2 e β 1 f x n e w n the system 2 can be solved recursively as follows 3 x i e β i 1 β i 2 β 1 f x n e w n i 2 n 1 x n e β n 1 β n 2 β 1 f x n e w n β n x n e the mature population in equilibrium from which the equilibria of all other cohorts can easily be obtained can now be derived by rewriting the last equation of the system 3 4 x n e β f x n e w n where β β n 1 β n 2 β 1 1 β n the stability of the equilibrium in age structured models will be analyzed using the theory of non linear dynamic systems 2

level breaking point x min of ssb 5 f x c if x x min c x min x if x x min where f x is recruitment and x is ssb fig 1 in the hs srf recruitment increases linearly until x min is reached density dependent recruitment and recruitment remains constant density independent recruitment thereafter barrowman and myers 2000 the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics will be established in the case of the hs srf the northern cod stock will be considered as an illustration 2 3 the northern cod stock the most iconic case of unrecovered fishery is the northern cod stock ncs where 27 years after imposing a moratorium the stock has yet to recover in most stock assessment models of marine fish populations the natural mortality is usually assumed to be constant in cadigan 2016a c a state space integrated assessment model for the ncs ncam is used to estimate age specific fishing f and age specific natural mortality m rates separately whereas in previous population dynamics models of the ncs m was an assumed constant value m 0 2 ncam is used in recent stock assessments dfo 2016a in addition the results of ncam remain the best available and objective tool for scientific advice on stock status dfo 2018 the hs srf which has previously been used for cod stocks duplisea 2012 ices 2014 morgan et al 2014a b fits the data estimated by ncam dfo 2016a for the ncs reasonably well fig 1 a more rigorous estimation of the hs srf for this species is beyond the scope of this paper see froese et al 2016 for different estimation methods of a hs srf since the late 1980s the ncs has been maturing at about age 5 which is younger than in previous years dfo 2016a the cohort population model for the ncs as defined in 1 has n 4 age groups with the mature cohort being the ssb at age 5 a plus 5 14 group which gives rise to the population of age 2 recruitment through the hs srf described above the official start of the moratorium year 1992 does not concur with the observed data for fishing mortality during the 1992 1994 period where high fishing mortality non compliance with the moratorium is thought to have driven the species to extremely low levels in 1994 dfo 2017 2018 in this sense the 1995 2014 period can be considered as the moratorium period for analyzing the stability of the equilibrium without loss of generality the fishing mortality rate is assumed to be constant f 0 during the moratorium period considered 1995 2014 in order to analyze the lack of expected recovery of the ncs even in the absence of harvesting as described below managers may find the comparison of a zero catch scenario useful for decision making using age specific data estimated by ncam cadigan 2016a c dfo 2016a as described above in this paper we analyze the stability of the equilibrium and transient dynamics for the ncs during the moratorium period 1995 2014 under the hypothesis that the survival rates are constantly equal to their average values 3 results 3 1 necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium using 2 4 and the theory of non linear dynamic systems appendix a the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the equilibrium for non decreasing stock recruitment functions f x 0 is given by 6 f x n e w n 1 β n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 w n f x n e w n x n e w n the condition for the stability of the equilibrium cse as defined in 6 is met for a concave stock recruitment function like a beverton holt type barrowman and myers 2000 as its derivative is always lower than the average slope 3 2 the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function in the case of the hs srf as defined in 5 the cse is not met if x n e w n x min due to the fact that f x n e w n c x min f x n e w n x n e w n on the contrary the cse is met if x n e w n x min due to the fact that f x n e w n 0 f x n e w n x n e w n thus the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the equilibrium in the case of a hs srf is given by x n e w n x min positive ssb equilibrium which using 4 can be rewritten as 7 γ c w n x min where γ 1 β and β as defined in 4 it should be noted in eqs 4 and 7 that if cohort survival rates β i increase γ decreases 3 3 characterization of the equilibrium points and their stability properties the characterization of equilibrium points and their stability properties in terms of the n 3 parameters of the model β 1 β n c x min and w n can be established in the following cases appendix b i if the cohort survival rates are sufficiently high γ c w n x min then there is a unique asymptotically stable ssb equilibrium x c w n γ x min and ii if the cohort survival rates are sufficiently low γ c w n x min then there is a unique asymptotically stable ssb equilibrium x 0 extinction of the species in principle the cohort population model depends on the n 3 parameters β 1 β 2 β n c x m i n and w n however the results above show that the characterization of ssb equilibriums and their stability properties depend only on the slope at the origin c x min of the hs srf w n and the reciprocal γ 1 β as defined in 7 of the composite cohort survival rate β as defined in 4 3 4 transient dynamics the population dynamics of the ssb the mature cohort is given by eq 8 below which is a finite difference equation of order n number of cohorts that describes well the population dynamics of the ssb which is autonomous dependent on itself but with a delay of n reproductive periods in particular eq 8 gives the ssb at period k 1 x n k 1 w n as a function of the ssb survivor at period k β n x n k w n and the recruitment survivor at period k 1 n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 f x n k 1 n w n w n which is incorporated into the ssb at period k 1 the recruitment survivor depends on the ssb in the year that the current adults were recruited 8 x n k 1 w n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 f x n k 1 n w n w n β n x n k w n the cse as defined in 6 is valid for general non linear stock recruitment functions f x where x is ssb however eq 8 is a homogeneous linear equation because the hs srf is piecewise linear and consequently the theory of linear dynamic systems can be used to analyze transient dynamics in this way the dynamics of both the extinction case ii and the positive ssb equilibrium case i can be analyzed using 8 in particular in appendix c we show that in case ii the ssb equilibrium x 0 is asymptotically stable and that the ssb tends to zero at an exponential rate λ n k where λ n is the largest real root of the characteristic polynomial of the homogeneous linear eq 8 luenberger 1979 pp 32 33 in case i we show that the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ x min at an exponential rate λ n k if the total mortality rate z i that affects the number of fish of age i is broken down into age specific fishing mortality f i and age specific natural mortality m i then the survival rate at age i can be expressed as 9 β i e z i e f i m i it should be noted in eq 9 that if fi and or mi increase cohort survival rates β i decrease and consequently γ increases as defined in eq 7 in this case it may be possible to go from a positive ssb equilibrium case i to the extinction of the species case ii an illustration of the above scenarios is given in fig 2 in terms of the replacement line with slope equal to 1 spr where ssb per recruit spr is the cumulative spawner biomass produced by one recruit over its lifespan e g morgan et al 2014a a population can persist as long as the slope of the replacement line 1 spr is less than the slope of the stock recruitment function at the origin sissenwine and shepherd 1987 goodyear 1993 in this case its intersection with the stock recruitment function determines the positive ssb equilibrium this is the case i as described above where the replacement line rl1 intersects with the hs srf fig 2 in the case of extinction of the species case ii the replacement line rl2 does not intersect with the hs srf fig 2 due to lower spr which decreases with increasing mortality decreasing cohort survival rates and consequently the slope of the replacement line increases as described below the collapse of the species in case i can be contemplated at low cohort survival rates but still sufficiently high so as to ensure the existence of a positive ssb equilibrium if the ssb and consequently the remaining cohorts is below x min then very slow growth of the ssb may be possible as measured by the exponential rate λ n k with λ n greater than but close to 1 in this case the positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ is greater than but close to x min 3 5 the northern cod stock the cse as defined in 7 was met during the moratorium period 1995 2014 due to the low value of γ 1 4 which was lower than 2 9 table 1 this means that the case i γ c w n x min was met during the moratorium period 1995 2014 if age specific natural mortality rates are used in this case the ssb tends to the positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ 1199 x min 600 1000 tons which is greater than x min fig 2 the ssb tends to the positive ssb equilibrium x at an exponential rate λ n k despite the fact that the ssb equilibrium x is two times higher than x min this is the case of collapse as described above this is due both to the low growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 1 which is greater than but close to 1 which means that the ssb growth is slow and to the extremely low ssb level at the start of the moratorium period in the year 1995 where x 9 68 1000 tons which is the lowest ssb level observed during the period 1983 2014 dfo 2016a thus the combined effects of the extremely low ssb level at the start of the moratorium period in the year 1995 and the slow growth of the ssb during much of the moratorium period would negatively offset the significant increases in the ssb growth in recent years to such extent that the entire moratorium period 1995 2014 would correspond to the case of collapse this result is consistent with the observed slow recovery of the species during the moratorium period 1995 2014 where recovery could be expected to be slow because the ssb is kept far below x min the stock has increased considerably over the past decade but remains within the critical zone dfo 2016a 2017 2018 the method developed in this paper also allows us to predict the growth of the ssb during short term periods taking into account that the ssb tends to the ssb equilibrium x at an exponential rate λ n k this means that the predicted growth of the ssb by the model during a period of k years is given by 10 x k x k 0 λ n k where x k is the ssb level achieved at the end of the k year period if x k 0 is the ssb level at the start of the period using 10 the growth of the species during the period considered can be illustrated with numerical experiments which use the model to simulate this growth from the beginning of the period by predicting the ssb level achieved at the end of the k year period fig 3 shows two clearly differentiated intervals in terms of the ssb growth during the moratorium period 1995 2014 dfo 2016a in particular we can observe that the ssb growth was extremely low during the 1997 2005 period where ssb levels in 2005 x 2005 25 1000 tons were similar to values from 1997 x 1997 21 1000 tons using 10 the predictive power of the model is evaluated during the 1997 2005 period by comparing its ssb predictions under age specific natural mortality rates mas with those obtained under constant natural mortality rates mc 0 2 both cases are compared with the ssb estimated by dfo 2016a for that period the cse was met during the 1997 2005 period under both mas and mc due to γ 2 41 in both cases table 2 this means that the case i γ c w n x min was met during the 1997 2005 period in both cases however as described below the positive ssb equilibrium and transient dynamics are quite different in both cases in the case of mas the ssb equilibrium x 613 7 is greater than but close to x min 600 table 2 this is the case of collapse where ssb growth is practically non existent due to the low growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 005 which is close to 1 table 2 in addition the ssb predicted by the model at the end of the 8 year period x 2005 22 table 2 if x 1997 21 is the ssb level at the start of the period is close to that estimated by dfo for that year x 2005 25 dfo 2016a this result is consistent with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period fig 3 in the case of mc the ssb equilibrium x 4370 73 is significantly greater than x min 600 table 2 in this case the ssb growth is high due to the high growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 35 which is significantly greater than 1 table 2 in addition the ssb predicted by the model at the end of the 8 year period x 2005 232 table 2 if x 1997 21 is the ssb level at the start of the period is significantly greater to that estimated by dfo for that year x 2005 25 dfo 2016a this result is not consistent with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period the above results seem to confirm that the model developed in this paper based on mas provides much better predictive power than obtained by using the standard mc based on mc further numerical experiments show that the species should have recovered during the 1997 2010 period by achieving a high ssb level x 2010 1039 greater than the ssb limit reference point b lim 967 estimated by dfo for this species dfo 2016b which is not consistent with what really happens on the contrary based on mas the above results concur with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period the above results also seem to confirm that high natural mortality rates are the primary cause for the slow recovery of the species even in the absence of harvesting because they remain very high during the 1997 2005 period in particular the mean natural mortality rates are around three times higher for ages 2 3 and 5 and twice as high for age 4 than the constant natural mortality rate mc 0 2 assumed in traditional stock assessments table 3 in addition in the case of mas further numerical experiments show that if there is a slight increase in age specific natural mortality rates a slight increase in γ it may be possible to go from the positive ssb equilibrium x 613 7 to the extinction of the species case ii taking into account that γ 2 35 is close to the limit for which the cse is met γ 2 41 table 2 this means that the species might have been at risk of extinction during the 1997 2005 period where all age classes were affected by high natural mortality rates table 3 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we have developed a method based on the theory of non linear discrete time dynamic systems which allows us to analyze the equilibrium and transient dynamics in density dependence models taking as a starting point a cohort population model with n age groups cohorts which depends on n 3 parameters we have shown that the cse depends only on the slope at the origin of the stock recruitment function the mean weighted weight at age n the mature cohort and a composite cohort survival rate which simplifies empirical analysis of equilibrium and transient dynamics 4 1 equilibrium collapse and extinction the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function simulation based approaches are widely used in the literature on fisheries research to analyze the sustainability of the main reference points by projecting age structured models to equilibrium under constant natural mortality rates in this framework and in the case of a hs srf the main reference points are sustainable if the replacement line intersects the hs srf to the right of the breaking point x min fig 2 on the contrary they are not sustainable if the replacement line does not intersect the hs srf fig 2 this case is defined in the literature on fisheries research as population decline and eventually collapse of the species e g morgan et al 2014a the definition of collapse is based on the precautionary approach pa framework developed by ices in the case of a hs srf ices suggests a ssb limit reference point b lim at the breaking point x min ices 2003 below which there is a higher risk that the stock could collapse suffering from severely reduced productivity the above frameworks do not provide the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics in addition they do not contemplate the possibility of extinction and consequently they assume that recovery is always possible moreover they do not contemplate all possible scenarios of collapse as its definition is based only on the ssb breaking point x min froese et al 2016 in which the cohort survival rates are not taken into account all of these issues are crucial to guarantee sustainability based reference points in this paper we have established necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in age structured models using both time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hs srf the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics have also been developed in this paper we have shown that there are two opposite scenarios the extinction of the species at sufficiently low cohort survival rates or a positive ssb equilibrium x x min at sufficiently high cohort survival rates in the latter case we have shown that the collapse of the species can be contemplated at low but still sufficiently high cohort survival rates if the ssb fall below x min in this case very slow recovery could be expected despite the fact that the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium x x min in addition we have shown that the ssb tends to equilibrium positive or extinction at an exponential rate we have shown that extinction is unavoidable at sufficiently low cohort survival rates in contrast to the simulation based approaches and the pa framework where it is referred to as collapse due to the lack of intersection between the replacement line and the hs srf in this case empirical evidence is crucial to avoid the extinction of the species our framework is most appropriate for cases where empirical evidence has shown that cohort survival rates tend to worsen with the decline of the ssb however if the empirical evidence suggests the contrary then collapse but not extinction would be possible due to compensatory mechanisms at low ssb levels this case could be analyzed in our framework by considering stock dependent cohort survival rates such that they tend to improve at low ssb levels and eventually the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium further research is required in this direction thus the method developed in this paper can provide theoretical support to the aforementioned simulation based approaches as described below it can also be a useful tool for analyzing scenarios that are not contemplated by management agencies or in the simulation based approaches such as the possibility of extinction which is not part of the pa or the possibility of collapse even in the case of a positive ssb equilibrium which is not considered in the simulation based approaches 4 2 the case of the northern cod stock considering the ncs by way of illustration and using age specific data estimated by ncam cadigan 2016a c dfo 2016a we have shown that the cse was met during the moratorium period according to the empirical evidence we have shown that the ssb which is far below x min tends to a positive ssb equilibrium greater than x min but at a low exponential growth rate due to low but still sufficiently high cohort survival rates this result concurs with the species lack of expected recovery we have also shown that the model fits well with the growth of the ssb observed during short term periods and consequently it allows us to analyze short term population responses to variations in survival rates variations in both age specific fishing and age specific natural mortality rates according to the empirical evidence we have shown that the model developed in this paper based on age specific natural mortality rates mas provides much better predictive power than obtained by using the standard constant natural mortality rates mc 0 2 in particular we have shown that the species should have already recovered under mc which is not consistent with what really happened we have also shown that in the case of mas the positive ssb equilibrium x 613 7 is greater than x min 600 during the 1997 2005 period this means that the ssb limit reference point suggested by ices b lim x min 600 would have been sustainable according to simulation based approaches due to the replacement line intersects with the hs srf however we have shown that this is the case of collapse with slow recovery even in the case of a positive ssb equilibrium which is consistent with what really happened in addition we have also shown the possibility of extinction which is not part of the ices pa framework if cohort survival rates are low enough the above results seem to confirm that limit reference points based only on the ssb might not be safe enough to prevent collapse with slow recovery and even extinction of the species in this sense the method developed in this paper can be a useful tool for providing scientific advice which could be altered drastically by high natural mortalities in the rebuilding of depleted stocks scientific advice based only on the ssb under constant low natural mortality rates could give rise to unsustainable references points with the consequent stock collapse lack of expected recovery and even the extinction of the species our results suggest that cohort survival rates and age specific natural mortality rates should play a central role for providing precautionary fisheries management advice in this sense the method can be a useful tool for providing sustainability based reference points that take them into account as pointed out above our framework is most appropriate for cases where empirical evidence has shown that cohort survival rates tend to worsen with the decline of the ssb this behavior can be attributed to depensatory mechanisms at low population sizes which might be linked to the slow recovery of many depleted fish stocks in this sense the method developed in this paper can be a useful tool for analyzing the slow recovery of species which exhibits depensatory dynamics more generally it can be a useful tool for analyzing the evidence that many collapsed stocks have failed to recover despite the fact that fishing mortality has been reduced or even when a moratorium is in effect hutchings 2015 the model developed in this paper can also analyze important depleted or previously depleted and recovering fish stocks e g morgan et al 2016 for ground fish stocks in the northwest atlantic as well as short lived species with high natural mortality rates which can be periodically collapsed e g uriarte et al 2016 for the bay of biscay anchovy in this paper the fishing mortality rate has been assumed to be constant f 0 during the moratorium period considered 1995 2014 in order to analyze the lack of expected recovery of the ncs and the possibility of extinction even in the absence of harvesting in addition managers may find the comparison of a zero catch scenario useful for decision making dfo 2018 taking into account that researchers agreed that cautious management would limit exploitation to a level that left sufficient biomass in the stock to be resilient to variations in natural mortality rate dfo 2018 fishing mortality was low during 1995 1997 when inshore fishing was highly restricted but increased for ages 7 9 when a directed inshore fishery for cod was reopened in 1998 2002 brattey et al 2018 closure of the directed inshore fishery in 2003 2005 along with a decrease in natural mortality rates from the year 2005 could have caused the increase in ssb over the past decade fig 3 further research is required in this direction in order to show how the stability of the equilibrium has been affected over the past decade by different management strategies on directed inshore fishery and by lower natural mortality rates one limitation of classical recruitment models is that they assume that recruitment is a function of ssb if the reproductive contribution of fish changes with age or size these models are unlikely to match observed recruitment old fish may produce more recruits on a per unit mass basis with higher survival probability e g charbonneau et al 2018 shelton et al 2015 in addition overexploited fish populations frequently exhibit truncated age structure due to the largest oldest individuals are removed shelton et al 2015 and references therein charbonneau et al 2018 the ncs provides an illustration of this shelton et al 2015 the method developed in this paper incorporates the age and size structure of the mature cohort ages 5 14 in the case of the ncs by considering the mean weighted weight wn at age n which plays a central role in characterizing the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics this means that for a period of k years the mean weight at age for that period the abundance at age at the end of the k year period and the total abundance at the end of the k year period are used in calculating wn for that period in this sense the influence of the age and size structure of the mature cohort on the equilibrium could be analyzed in a simple way taking into account that an increase in the oldest largest individuals will imply an increase in wn in this way a sensitivity analysis associated with wn could be performed to test the influence of the oldest individuals on the equilibrium and transient dynamics more generally the model could also be extended by assuming that recruitment is a function of egg production which takes into account the fecundity at age brunel and piet 2013 shelton et al 2015 further research is required in this direction in order to show that the model developed in this paper could be a useful tool for understanding other important transient dynamics such as fluctuating age size structure 4 3 uncertainty the scientific advice provided by management agencies is commonly based on deterministic reference points due to unclear management of uncertainty when providing advice morgan et al 2014a in this sense as general practice for most stocks our analyses have not included uncertainty in the hs srf dulvy et al 2004 morgan et al 2014a however the hs srf commonly exhibits high recruitment variability froese et al 2016 in addition the pa requires the inclusion of uncertainty in particular when extinction is a possibility as is the case in our analysis different sources of uncertainty affecting recruitment and the remaining cohorts differently could be analyzed in our framework in order to estimate a stochastic hs srf in this way stochastic equilibrium analysis could be developed in order to provide theoretical support to the stochastic simulation based approaches recently suggested by stock assessments ices 2011 2015 thus the method developed in this paper has provided a theoretically grounded practical starting point for equilibrium and transient dynamics analysis in age structured models as pointed out above it could be used for a wide range of different applications in order to ensure long term sustainability of fish stocks appendix the following analysis addresses the stability in a neighborhood of the equilibrium at points at which the stock recruitment function f is

25092,equilibrium based methods are widely used in the literature on population ecology to analyze the sustainability of the management strategy this approach fails to account for many factors such as age specific natural mortality rates the cohort survival rates the possibility of extinction the characterization of the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics we propose here a method based on the theory of non linear dynamic systems that determines necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in age structured models using time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function the method characterizes the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics depending on the cohort survival rates we find that there are two opposite scenarios extinction or positive equilibrium in the latter case we also find the possibility of collapse with slow recovery we demonstrate that the stock tends to equilibrium at an exponential rate in both scenarios considering the northern cod gadus morhua stock by way of illustration we find that slow recovery of the stock could be expected at sufficiently low cohort survival rates despite the fact that the condition for the stability of the equilibrium was met during the moratorium period positive equilibrium this result is consistent with the species lack of expected recovery in contrast to equilibrium based methods under constant natural mortality rates and the precautionary approach framework we also find the possibility of extinction at sufficiently low cohort survival rates even in the absence of harvesting keywords dynamic systems age structured models equilibrium stability transient dynamics hockey stick stock recruitment population dynamics 1 introduction equilibrium based methods are widely used in the literature on fisheries research in most cases simulation based approaches are used to analyze the sustainability of the main reference points by projecting an age structured model to equilibrium under different fishing mortality rates different reasonable scenarios with different assumptions about the stock recruitment relationship and a constant natural mortality rate e g morgan et al 2014a b for cod stocks the hockey stick stock recruitment function hs srf is commonly used in these simulation based approaches e g duplisea 2012 ices 2014 morgan et al 2014a b natural mortality is also typically assumed to be constant over age in fish stock assessments and evaluation of management plans this approach fails to account for age specific natural mortality rates the characterization of the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics dynamics toward equilibrium which characterize the behavior of a dynamical system before long term equilibrium is reached understanding transient dynamics remains one of the challenges in ecology and fisheries management hastings 2004 white et al 2013 stott 2016 transient dynamics have only recently started to getting attention from the ecological literature using density independence linear matrix population models to analyze short term population responses to perturbations stott 2016 and references therein arnoldi et al 2018 in white et al 2013 a density independence age structured model is used to analyze transient dynamics in the implementation of no take marine reserves due to the absence of a stock recruitment function density independence models are appropriate only for representing the initial increase in abundance within an overexploited fish stock white et al 2013 continuous time dynamic systems have proven to be a useful tool to guarantee sustainability in different settings in which transient dynamics lafuite and loreau 2017 and multiple equilibria dorsey and hardy 2018 are evaluated numerically there is a clear need for greater research on transient dynamics in density dependence models stott 2016 this need becomes even more urgent in fisheries research if we consider that transient dynamics are crucial in understanding the observed collapse and lack of expected recovery of many fish stocks which are far away from their long term equilibriums frank et al 2011 in addition the duration of the transient is expected to increase in collapsed fisheries which could take a long time to recover despite the fact that fishing mortality has been reduced or even when a moratorium is in effect one of the most dramatic collapses in the history of fisheries has been the collapse of the northern cod stock ncs the ncs comprising populations of atlantic cod from southern labrador and eastern newfoundland nafo divisions 2j3kl was once one of the world s largest commercial fisheries however after decades of severe overexploitation the ncs collapsed in 1992 and a moratorium on fishing had to be imposed even after a 27 year moratorium the fishery has not yet recovered the aim of this paper is to develop a method based on the theory of non linear discrete time dynamic systems which allows us to analyze the equilibrium and transient dynamics in density dependence models in particular the method allows us to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in deterministic age structured models using time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hs srf the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics are also established limit reference points based on the spawning stock biomass ssb only are commonly used by management agencies like the international council for the exploration of the sea ices to indicate the ssb limit reference point below which there is a higher risk that fish stocks could collapse the definition of collapse is based on the precautionary approach pa framework developed by ices for providing precautionary fisheries management advice in the ices pa framework collapse does not mean that a stock is at high risk of biological extinction however recovery is likely to be slow ices 2005 the above framework does not provide the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics in addition it does not contemplate all possible scenarios of collapse as its definition is based only on the ssb limit reference point in which the cohort survival rates are not taken into account moreover it does not contemplate the possibility of extinction dulvy et al 2003 2004 which is not taken into account in the pa framework and consequently they assume that recovery is always possible hauge et al 2007 considering the ncs by way of illustration we show that the model fits well with the growth of the ssb observed during short term periods and consequently it allows us to analyze short term population responses to variations in survival rates we also show that the species should have already been recovered under constant natural mortality rates which is not consistent with what really happened we also show that even in the absence of harvesting if age specific natural mortality rates are considered limit reference points based only on the ssb might not be safe enough to prevent collapse with slow recovery and even extinction of the species 2 material and methods 2 1 age structured model the population is divided into n age groups cohorts where x k i denotes the population numbers of age i at time k i 1 n k 0 1 2 in each period k there is a unique mature cohort n plus age group x k n which gives rise to the population of age 1 recruitment in period k 1 x k 1 1 through a nonlinear function f e g the hockey stick stock recruitment function see section 2 2 such that x k 1 1 f x k n w n where x k n w n is the ssb and w n the mean weighted weight measured in kg at age n the mature cohort assuming constant survival rates time independent β i for each cohort x k i the deterministic cohort population autonomous model is given by 1 x 1 k 1 f x k n w n x i k 1 β i 1 x i 1 k i 2 n 1 x n k 1 β n 1 x n 1 k β n x n k the cohort population model as defined in 1 is a nonlinear and autonomous dynamic system in luenberger 1979 a cohort population model as defined in 1 is analyzed but assuming a linear function f denoting the mature population in equilibrium by x n e as measured in population numbers the equilibrium conditions are given by 2 x 1 e f x n e w n x i e β i 1 x i 1 e i 2 n 1 x n e β n 1

transient dynamics will be established in the case of the hs srf the northern cod stock will be considered as an illustration 2 3 the northern cod stock the most iconic case of unrecovered fishery is the northern cod stock ncs where 27 years after imposing a moratorium the stock has yet to recover in most stock assessment models of marine fish populations the natural mortality is usually assumed to be constant in cadigan 2016a c a state space integrated assessment model for the ncs ncam is used to estimate age specific fishing f and age specific natural mortality m rates separately whereas in previous population dynamics models of the ncs m was an assumed constant value m 0 2 ncam is used in recent stock assessments dfo 2016a in addition the results of ncam remain the best available and objective tool for scientific advice on stock status dfo 2018 the hs srf which has previously been used for cod stocks duplisea 2012 ices 2014 morgan et al 2014a b fits the data estimated by ncam dfo 2016a for the ncs reasonably well fig 1 a more rigorous estimation of the hs srf for this species is beyond the scope of this paper see froese et al 2016 for different estimation methods of a hs srf since the late 1980s the ncs has been maturing at about age 5 which is younger than in previous years dfo 2016a the cohort population model for the ncs as defined in 1 has n 4 age groups with the mature cohort being the ssb at age 5 a plus 5 14 group which gives rise to the population of age 2 recruitment through the hs srf described above the official start of the moratorium year 1992 does not concur with the observed data for fishing mortality during the 1992 1994 period where high fishing mortality non compliance with the moratorium is thought to have driven the species to extremely low levels in 1994 dfo 2017 2018 in this sense the 1995 2014 period can be considered as the moratorium period for analyzing the stability of the equilibrium without loss of generality the fishing mortality rate is assumed to be constant f 0 during the moratorium period considered 1995 2014 in order to analyze the lack of expected recovery of the ncs even in the absence of harvesting as described below managers may find the comparison of a zero catch scenario useful for decision making using age specific data estimated by ncam cadigan 2016a c dfo 2016a as described above in this paper we analyze the stability of the equilibrium and transient dynamics for the ncs during the moratorium period 1995 2014 under the hypothesis that the survival rates are constantly equal to their average values 3 results 3 1 necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium using 2 4 and the theory of non linear dynamic systems appendix a the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the equilibrium for non decreasing stock recruitment functions f x 0 is given by 6 f x n e w n 1 β n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 w n f x n e w n x n e w n the condition for the stability of the equilibrium cse as defined in 6 is met for a concave stock recruitment function like a beverton holt type barrowman and myers 2000 as its derivative is always lower than the average slope 3 2 the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function in the case of the hs srf as defined in 5 the cse is not met if x n e w n x min due to the fact that f x n e w n c x min f x n e w n x n e w n on the contrary the cse is met if x n e w n x min due to the fact that f x n e w n 0 f x n e w n x n e w n thus the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the equilibrium in the case of a hs srf is given by x n e w n x min positive ssb equilibrium which using 4 can be rewritten as 7 γ c w n x min where γ 1 β and β as defined in 4 it should be noted in eqs 4 and 7 that if cohort survival rates β i increase γ decreases 3 3 characterization of the equilibrium points and their stability properties the characterization of equilibrium points and their stability properties in terms of the n 3 parameters of the model β 1 β n c x min and w n can be established in the following cases appendix b i if the cohort survival rates are sufficiently high γ c w n x min then there is a unique asymptotically stable ssb equilibrium x c w n γ x min and ii if the cohort survival rates are sufficiently low γ c w n x min then there is a unique asymptotically stable ssb equilibrium x 0 extinction of the species in principle the cohort population model depends on the n 3 parameters β 1 β 2 β n c x m i n and w n however the results above show that the characterization of ssb equilibriums and their stability properties depend only on the slope at the origin c x min of the hs srf w n and the reciprocal γ 1 β as defined in 7 of the composite cohort survival rate β as defined in 4 3 4 transient dynamics the population dynamics of the ssb the mature cohort is given by eq 8 below which is a finite difference equation of order n number of cohorts that describes well the population dynamics of the ssb which is autonomous dependent on itself but with a delay of n reproductive periods in particular eq 8 gives the ssb at period k 1 x n k 1 w n as a function of the ssb survivor at period k β n x n k w n and the recruitment survivor at period k 1 n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 f x n k 1 n w n w n which is incorporated into the ssb at period k 1 the recruitment survivor depends on the ssb in the year that the current adults were recruited 8 x n k 1 w n β n 1 β n 2 β 1 f x n k 1 n w n w n β n x n k w n the cse as defined in 6 is valid for general non linear stock recruitment functions f x where x is ssb however eq 8 is a homogeneous linear equation because the hs srf is piecewise linear and consequently the theory of linear dynamic systems can be used to analyze transient dynamics in this way the dynamics of both the extinction case ii and the positive ssb equilibrium case i can be analyzed using 8 in particular in appendix c we show that in case ii the ssb equilibrium x 0 is asymptotically stable and that the ssb tends to zero at an exponential rate λ n k where λ n is the largest real root of the characteristic polynomial of the homogeneous linear eq 8 luenberger 1979 pp 32 33 in case i we show that the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ x min at an exponential rate λ n k if the total mortality rate z i that affects the number of fish of age i is broken down into age specific fishing mortality f i and age specific natural mortality m i then the survival rate at age i can be expressed as 9 β i e z i e f i m i it should be noted in eq 9 that if fi and or mi increase cohort survival rates β i decrease and consequently γ increases as defined in eq 7 in this case it may be possible to go from a positive ssb equilibrium case i to the extinction of the species case ii an illustration of the above scenarios is given in fig 2 in terms of the replacement line with slope equal to 1 spr where ssb per recruit spr is the cumulative spawner biomass produced by one recruit over its lifespan e g morgan et al 2014a a population can persist as long as the slope of the replacement line 1 spr is less than the slope of the stock recruitment function at the origin sissenwine and shepherd 1987 goodyear 1993 in this case its intersection with the stock recruitment function determines the positive ssb equilibrium this is the case i as described above where the replacement line rl1 intersects with the hs srf fig 2 in the case of extinction of the species case ii the replacement line rl2 does not intersect with the hs srf fig 2 due to lower spr which decreases with increasing mortality decreasing cohort survival rates and consequently the slope of the replacement line increases as described below the collapse of the species in case i can be contemplated at low cohort survival rates but still sufficiently high so as to ensure the existence of a positive ssb equilibrium if the ssb and consequently the remaining cohorts is below x min then very slow growth of the ssb may be possible as measured by the exponential rate λ n k with λ n greater than but close to 1 in this case the positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ is greater than but close to x min 3 5 the northern cod stock the cse as defined in 7 was met during the moratorium period 1995 2014 due to the low value of γ 1 4 which was lower than 2 9 table 1 this means that the case i γ c w n x min was met during the moratorium period 1995 2014 if age specific natural mortality rates are used in this case the ssb tends to the positive ssb equilibrium x c w n γ 1199 x min 600 1000 tons which is greater than x min fig 2 the ssb tends to the positive ssb equilibrium x at an exponential rate λ n k despite the fact that the ssb equilibrium x is two times higher than x min this is the case of collapse as described above this is due both to the low growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 1 which is greater than but close to 1 which means that the ssb growth is slow and to the extremely low ssb level at the start of the moratorium period in the year 1995 where x 9 68 1000 tons which is the lowest ssb level observed during the period 1983 2014 dfo 2016a thus the combined effects of the extremely low ssb level at the start of the moratorium period in the year 1995 and the slow growth of the ssb during much of the moratorium period would negatively offset the significant increases in the ssb growth in recent years to such extent that the entire moratorium period 1995 2014 would correspond to the case of collapse this result is consistent with the observed slow recovery of the species during the moratorium period 1995 2014 where recovery could be expected to be slow because the ssb is kept far below x min the stock has increased considerably over the past decade but remains within the critical zone dfo 2016a 2017 2018 the method developed in this paper also allows us to predict the growth of the ssb during short term periods taking into account that the ssb tends to the ssb equilibrium x at an exponential rate λ n k this means that the predicted growth of the ssb by the model during a period of k years is given by 10 x k x k 0 λ n k where x k is the ssb level achieved at the end of the k year period if x k 0 is the ssb level at the start of the period using 10 the growth of the species during the period considered can be illustrated with numerical experiments which use the model to simulate this growth from the beginning of the period by predicting the ssb level achieved at the end of the k year period fig 3 shows two clearly differentiated intervals in terms of the ssb growth during the moratorium period 1995 2014 dfo 2016a in particular we can observe that the ssb growth was extremely low during the 1997 2005 period where ssb levels in 2005 x 2005 25 1000 tons were similar to values from 1997 x 1997 21 1000 tons using 10 the predictive power of the model is evaluated during the 1997 2005 period by comparing its ssb predictions under age specific natural mortality rates mas with those obtained under constant natural mortality rates mc 0 2 both cases are compared with the ssb estimated by dfo 2016a for that period the cse was met during the 1997 2005 period under both mas and mc due to γ 2 41 in both cases table 2 this means that the case i γ c w n x min was met during the 1997 2005 period in both cases however as described below the positive ssb equilibrium and transient dynamics are quite different in both cases in the case of mas the ssb equilibrium x 613 7 is greater than but close to x min 600 table 2 this is the case of collapse where ssb growth is practically non existent due to the low growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 005 which is close to 1 table 2 in addition the ssb predicted by the model at the end of the 8 year period x 2005 22 table 2 if x 1997 21 is the ssb level at the start of the period is close to that estimated by dfo for that year x 2005 25 dfo 2016a this result is consistent with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period fig 3 in the case of mc the ssb equilibrium x 4370 73 is significantly greater than x min 600 table 2 in this case the ssb growth is high due to the high growth exponential rate λ n k where λ n 1 35 which is significantly greater than 1 table 2 in addition the ssb predicted by the model at the end of the 8 year period x 2005 232 table 2 if x 1997 21 is the ssb level at the start of the period is significantly greater to that estimated by dfo for that year x 2005 25 dfo 2016a this result is not consistent with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period the above results seem to confirm that the model developed in this paper based on mas provides much better predictive power than obtained by using the standard mc based on mc further numerical experiments show that the species should have recovered during the 1997 2010 period by achieving a high ssb level x 2010 1039 greater than the ssb limit reference point b lim 967 estimated by dfo for this species dfo 2016b which is not consistent with what really happens on the contrary based on mas the above results concur with the observed lack of recovery of the species during the 1997 2005 period the above results also seem to confirm that high natural mortality rates are the primary cause for the slow recovery of the species even in the absence of harvesting because they remain very high during the 1997 2005 period in particular the mean natural mortality rates are around three times higher for ages 2 3 and 5 and twice as high for age 4 than the constant natural mortality rate mc 0 2 assumed in traditional stock assessments table 3 in addition in the case of mas further numerical experiments show that if there is a slight increase in age specific natural mortality rates a slight increase in γ it may be possible to go from the positive ssb equilibrium x 613 7 to the extinction of the species case ii taking into account that γ 2 35 is close to the limit for which the cse is met γ 2 41 table 2 this means that the species might have been at risk of extinction during the 1997 2005 period where all age classes were affected by high natural mortality rates table 3 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we have developed a method based on the theory of non linear discrete time dynamic systems which allows us to analyze the equilibrium and transient dynamics in density dependence models taking as a starting point a cohort population model with n age groups cohorts which depends on n 3 parameters we have shown that the cse depends only on the slope at the origin of the stock recruitment function the mean weighted weight at age n the mature cohort and a composite cohort survival rate which simplifies empirical analysis of equilibrium and transient dynamics 4 1 equilibrium collapse and extinction the case of a hockey stick stock recruitment function simulation based approaches are widely used in the literature on fisheries research to analyze the sustainability of the main reference points by projecting age structured models to equilibrium under constant natural mortality rates in this framework and in the case of a hs srf the main reference points are sustainable if the replacement line intersects the hs srf to the right of the breaking point x min fig 2 on the contrary they are not sustainable if the replacement line does not intersect the hs srf fig 2 this case is defined in the literature on fisheries research as population decline and eventually collapse of the species e g morgan et al 2014a the definition of collapse is based on the precautionary approach pa framework developed by ices in the case of a hs srf ices suggests a ssb limit reference point b lim at the breaking point x min ices 2003 below which there is a higher risk that the stock could collapse suffering from severely reduced productivity the above frameworks do not provide the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics in addition they do not contemplate the possibility of extinction and consequently they assume that recovery is always possible moreover they do not contemplate all possible scenarios of collapse as its definition is based only on the ssb breaking point x min froese et al 2016 in which the cohort survival rates are not taken into account all of these issues are crucial to guarantee sustainability based reference points in this paper we have established necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibrium in age structured models using both time independent survival rates autonomous and age specific natural mortality rates in the case of a hs srf the characterization of the ssb equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics have also been developed in this paper we have shown that there are two opposite scenarios the extinction of the species at sufficiently low cohort survival rates or a positive ssb equilibrium x x min at sufficiently high cohort survival rates in the latter case we have shown that the collapse of the species can be contemplated at low but still sufficiently high cohort survival rates if the ssb fall below x min in this case very slow recovery could be expected despite the fact that the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium x x min in addition we have shown that the ssb tends to equilibrium positive or extinction at an exponential rate we have shown that extinction is unavoidable at sufficiently low cohort survival rates in contrast to the simulation based approaches and the pa framework where it is referred to as collapse due to the lack of intersection between the replacement line and the hs srf in this case empirical evidence is crucial to avoid the extinction of the species our framework is most appropriate for cases where empirical evidence has shown that cohort survival rates tend to worsen with the decline of the ssb however if the empirical evidence suggests the contrary then collapse but not extinction would be possible due to compensatory mechanisms at low ssb levels this case could be analyzed in our framework by considering stock dependent cohort survival rates such that they tend to improve at low ssb levels and eventually the ssb tends to a positive ssb equilibrium further research is required in this direction thus the method developed in this paper can provide theoretical support to the aforementioned simulation based approaches as described below it can also be a useful tool for analyzing scenarios that are not contemplated by management agencies or in the simulation based approaches such as the possibility of extinction which is not part of the pa or the possibility of collapse even in the case of a positive ssb equilibrium which is not considered in the simulation based approaches 4 2 the case of the northern cod stock considering the ncs by way of illustration and using age specific data estimated by ncam cadigan 2016a c dfo 2016a we have shown that the cse was met during the moratorium period according to the empirical evidence we have shown that the ssb which is far below x min tends to a positive ssb equilibrium greater than x min but at a low exponential growth rate due to low but still sufficiently high cohort survival rates this result concurs with the species lack of expected recovery we have also shown that the model fits well with the growth of the ssb observed during short term periods and consequently it allows us to analyze short term population responses to variations in survival rates variations in both age specific fishing and age specific natural mortality rates according to the empirical evidence we have shown that the model developed in this paper based on age specific natural mortality rates mas provides much better predictive power than obtained by using the standard constant natural mortality rates mc 0 2 in particular we have shown that the species should have already recovered under mc which is not consistent with what really happened we have also shown that in the case of mas the positive ssb equilibrium x 613 7 is greater than x min 600 during the 1997 2005 period this means that the ssb limit reference point suggested by ices b lim x min 600 would have been sustainable according to simulation based approaches due to the replacement line intersects with the hs srf however we have shown that this is the case of collapse with slow recovery even in the case of a positive ssb equilibrium which is consistent with what really happened in addition we have also shown the possibility of extinction which is not part of the ices pa framework if cohort survival rates are low enough the above results seem to confirm that limit reference points based only on the ssb might not be safe enough to prevent collapse with slow recovery and even extinction of the species in this sense the method developed in this paper can be a useful tool for providing scientific advice which could be altered drastically by high natural mortalities in the rebuilding of depleted stocks scientific advice based only on the ssb under constant low natural mortality rates could give rise to unsustainable references points with the consequent stock collapse lack of expected recovery and even the extinction of the species our results suggest that cohort survival rates and age specific natural mortality rates should play a central role for providing precautionary fisheries management advice in this sense the method can be a useful tool for providing sustainability based reference points that take them into account as pointed out above our framework is most appropriate for cases where empirical evidence has shown that cohort survival rates tend to worsen with the decline of the ssb this behavior can be attributed to depensatory mechanisms at low population sizes which might be linked to the slow recovery of many depleted fish stocks in this sense the method developed in this paper can be a useful tool for analyzing the slow recovery of species which exhibits depensatory dynamics more generally it can be a useful tool for analyzing the evidence that many collapsed stocks have failed to recover despite the fact that fishing mortality has been reduced or even when a moratorium is in effect hutchings 2015 the model developed in this paper can also analyze important depleted or previously depleted and recovering fish stocks e g morgan et al 2016 for ground fish stocks in the northwest atlantic as well as short lived species with high natural mortality rates which can be periodically collapsed e g uriarte et al 2016 for the bay of biscay anchovy in this paper the fishing mortality rate has been assumed to be constant f 0 during the moratorium period considered 1995 2014 in order to analyze the lack of expected recovery of the ncs and the possibility of extinction even in the absence of harvesting in addition managers may find the comparison of a zero catch scenario useful for decision making dfo 2018 taking into account that researchers agreed that cautious management would limit exploitation to a level that left sufficient biomass in the stock to be resilient to variations in natural mortality rate dfo 2018 fishing mortality was low during 1995 1997 when inshore fishing was highly restricted but increased for ages 7 9 when a directed inshore fishery for cod was reopened in 1998 2002 brattey et al 2018 closure of the directed inshore fishery in 2003 2005 along with a decrease in natural mortality rates from the year 2005 could have caused the increase in ssb over the past decade fig 3 further research is required in this direction in order to show how the stability of the equilibrium has been affected over the past decade by different management strategies on directed inshore fishery and by lower natural mortality rates one limitation of classical recruitment models is that they assume that recruitment is a function of ssb if the reproductive contribution of fish changes with age or size these models are unlikely to match observed recruitment old fish may produce more recruits on a per unit mass basis with higher survival probability e g charbonneau et al 2018 shelton et al 2015 in addition overexploited fish populations frequently exhibit truncated age structure due to the largest oldest individuals are removed shelton et al 2015 and references therein charbonneau et al 2018 the ncs provides an illustration of this shelton et al 2015 the method developed in this paper incorporates the age and size structure of the mature cohort ages 5 14 in the case of the ncs by considering the mean weighted weight wn at age n which plays a central role in characterizing the equilibriums their stability properties and transient dynamics this means that for a period of k years the mean weight at age for that period the abundance at age at the end of the k year period and the total abundance at the end of the k year period are used in calculating wn for that period in this sense the influence of the age and size structure of the mature cohort on the equilibrium could be analyzed in a simple way taking into account that an increase in the oldest largest individuals will imply an increase in wn in this way a sensitivity analysis associated with wn could be performed to test the influence of the oldest individuals on the equilibrium and transient dynamics more generally the model could also be extended by assuming that recruitment is a function of egg production which takes into account the fecundity at age brunel and piet 2013 shelton et al 2015 further research is required in this direction in order to show that the model developed in this paper could be a useful tool for understanding other important transient dynamics such as fluctuating age size structure 4 3 uncertainty the scientific advice provided by management agencies is commonly based on deterministic reference points due to unclear management of uncertainty when providing advice morgan et al 2014a in this sense as general practice for most stocks our analyses have not included uncertainty in the hs srf dulvy et al 2004 morgan et al 2014a however the hs srf commonly exhibits high recruitment variability froese et al 2016 in addition the pa requires the inclusion of uncertainty in particular when extinction is a possibility as is the case in our analysis different sources of uncertainty affecting recruitment and the remaining cohorts differently could be analyzed in our framework in order to estimate a stochastic hs srf in this way stochastic equilibrium analysis could be developed in order to provide theoretical support to the stochastic simulation based approaches recently suggested by stock assessments ices 2011 2015 thus the method developed in this paper has provided a theoretically grounded practical starting point for equilibrium and transient dynamics analysis in age structured models as pointed out above it could be used for a wide range of different applications in order to ensure long term sustainability of fish stocks appendix the following analysis addresses the stability in a neighborhood of the equilibrium at points at which the stock recruitment function f is

addition the solution of eq c 3 with initial condition x n 0 converges at exponential rate λ n k luenberger 1979 pp 26 33 and in a monotonically decreasing way to y this shows that if x n 0 x min then using c 2 in a finite period of time k 0 x n k y k x min holds for k k 0 and if k k 0 n 1 then using c 1 the ssb starts to follow the homogeneous linear equation of order n c 5 x n k 1 β n 1 β n 2 β 1

and the ssb tends to zero at an exponential rate λ n k it should also be noted that by the arguments provided above transient dynamics in the case of a positive ssb equilibrium case i γ c w n x min in

25093,developing population models is of great interest as these models enable to extrapolate toxicity observed at the molecular or individual levels to the population level and thus improve environmental risk assessment of chemical substances for this purpose accounting for natural variations of environmental conditions and prey dynamics along with the chemical stress is needed in this study an individual based model ibm coupled to a dynamic energy budget deb model was developed in order to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in semi controlled stream experiments in mesocosms datasets obtained in mesocosms offer the opportunity to develop and evaluate the model predictions the most sensitive parameters of the deb ibm were identified by sensitivity analyses and were calibrated based on data from two independent mesocosm experiments the predictive capacities of our model were subsequently evaluated using three independent mesocosm datasets under different environmental scenarios finally our model was applied to a theoretical case of toxic effects to show an example of application of the model in a regulatory context while the most uncertain population processes in particular competition for food in mesocosms in our three spined stickleback deb ibm could be modelled more accurately our model can already serve to assess the impacts of toxicants at the population level by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments in decreasing the uncertainty of the experimental results therefore in a second step it could be used to predict the consequences on viability of a population exposed to a contaminant under various environmental and exposure scenarios keywords individual based model bioenergetics three spined stickleback mesocosm risk assessment 1 introduction in a regulatory context predicting chronic exposure and effects of pollutants on aquatic ecosystem endpoints is of a great interest adams 2002 ruden et al 2016 however as ecosystems are dynamic entities which exhibit a complex network of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment current ecological risk assessment approaches often fail to predict toxicant effects accurately on population and ecosystem endpoints adams 2002 indeed toxicant effects are mainly studied at an individual level and extrapolation towards a higher level of organization is often too simplistic forbes et al 2017 ecological risk assessment should be a comprehensive and integrated approach able to assess toxicant impacts in complex ecosystems in particular a focus should be made on the bottom up and top down processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems and make risk assessment a challenge galic et al 2010 for this purpose ecological modeling has been suggested as a relevant tool to improve the understanding of ecosystem functioning and interactions between biocenosis and biotope indeed the potential of models towards enhancing ecological realism in current risk assessment is increasingly recognized beaudouin et al 2015 forbes et al 2011 2017 galic et al 2010 grimm et al 2017 furthermore individual based modelling ibm has demonstrated its ability to predict population dynamics by modelling the interactions between individuals and their environment grimm and railsback 2005 furthermore including individual energy budgets in ibms was suggested to be essential for realistic modelling of populations affected by food availability sibly et al 2013 in particular in risk assessment among the different existing approaches for energy budgets embedding a dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 2010 into an ibm is a convenient way of extrapolating impacts of toxicants from organism to population level beaudouin et al 2012a 2015 martin et al 2013 thus providing considerable insight into the possible range of effects of chemicals galic et al 2017 although demand for deb ibms in ecotoxicology is rising special attention should be paid to their outcomes so that the models may be relevant tools for risk assessment and decision making indeed the model should be able to accurately predict real world ecosystem and the population properties under a variety of environmental conditions food availability and seasonal variations of the environment without chemical stress unfortunately the predictive capacities of deb ibms are rarely evaluated because there are rarely enough data to both calibrate and evaluate these models furthermore detailed and accurate comparisons between simulations and observations often require a sound knowledge of the populations characteristics size of the population sex length of the individuals data on the state of maturity etc these data are often scarce because multiple samplings in the same environment are costly logistically difficult and time consuming mesocosm experiments are of a great interest because they are a convenient tool to perform high tier ecotoxicological studies i e studies performed at the population level or higher efsa 2013 among species used for mesocosm studies fish species are of a specific interest for assessing impacts of contaminants in the environment van der oost et al 2003 specifically the teleost fish three spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus is one of the fish species that can be used in mesocosms oecd 2006 this species is native of the northern hemisphere and its ecology and biology have been well studied bell and foster 1994 wootton 1984 moreover effects of toxicants have been studied both in laboratory and mesocosms on stickleback individuals and populations de kermoysan et al 2013a maunder et al 2007 naslund et al 2017 roussel et al 2007 mesocosm experiments have the advantage of mimicking the complexity of a natural ecosystem by exhibiting a high level of biological organization caquet 2002 caquet et al 2000 and they can provide interesting datasets for developing ecological models however these studies are mostly performed using few replicates and exhibit an important variability of the results due to the natural variability inherent of high levels of biological organization efsa 2013 sanderson 2002 consequently these experiments are characterized by a low statistical power when comparing the control and the chemical exposed populations which could be improved by using ibms beaudouin et al 2012b consequently developing an ibm to predict the stickleback population dynamics in mesocosm would help to analyze the ecotoxicological experiment and offers the opportunity to evaluate an ecological model later applied to risk assessment an ibm has recently been developed for sticklebacks in field conditions mintram et al 2018 to predict endocrine disruption however this model does not integrate some ecological factors like photoperiod water temperature and food availability nor a bioenergetic model which would describe physiological processes at the organism level hence as suggested by the authors a more mechanistical approach which would take into account interactions between the effect of a toxicant and ecological factors would help to improve the realism of the ibm predictions in this paper we developed a deb ibm to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms we used this model to analyze data from mesocosm experiments that included relevant information on the environmental conditions food density temperature and photoperiod the predictive capacities of our model were assessed by calibrating and evaluating it on several independent datasets of mesocosm experiments in this study we showed how individual based modelling can provide realistic simulated population dynamics in mesocosms furthermore to illustrate usage in a risk assessment context we used our model to assess the impacts of hypothetical toxicants on stickleback population dynamics in mesocosm experiments 2 material and methods 2 1 mesocosm experiments 2 1 1 experimental design five independent experiments from 2010 to 2014 with an identical protocol were performed using artificial streams of 20 m long and 1 m wide located in the north of france ineris verneuil en halatte france the two first mesocosm experiments 2010 and 2011 were conducted with 9 and 8 replicates of mesocosms respectively whereas experiments performed in 2012 2013 and 2014 were conducted with 3 replicates the same experimental design was used for each experiment a detailed description is given in de kermoysan et al 2013a briefly the same protocol of species introduction was used for each experiment each mesocosm was set up with sediments macrophytes and macroinvertebrates between october and december the experiments started in march when 15 females and 10 male sticklebacks with homogenous length see appendix part i 1 2 tables a 1 and a 2 were introduced after called the founders the sex identification of the founders was performed with the model developed by de kermoysan et al 2013b founders were individually marked with 1 2 mm x 2 7 mm alphanumeric tags vi alpha tags northwesr marine technology shaw island wa usa the different species as well as the physico chemical parameters of the environment varied naturally throughout the experiments and the freshwater temperature and stickleback prey abundances were monitored over time water temperature was recorded every 10 min by two temperature sensors hobo0257 prosensor amanvilliers france placed in the surface at 5 m from the inlet of water and at 15 m at a water depth of 70 cm macroinvertebrates were sampled every four weeks by specific sampling devices i e tubes tiles or mesocosm walls zooplankton were also sampled every four weeks with a perspex tube of 5 cm in diameter and 0 8 m in height see david et al 2018 for more details on temperature measurements and prey samplings mesocosms were emptied in october and fish were killed by an overdose of ms 222 and stored in 4 formalin before being individually measured and weighed fish shorter than 26 mm in length were assumed to be immature and thus classified as juveniles de kermoysan et al 2013a sexes of fish longer than 26 mm were determined by visual observations the ethics committee of the national institute of industrial environment and risks ineris approved all the experiments performed and described in this manuscript 2 1 2 descriptive variables of the stickleback populations the descriptive variables of each fish population at the end of the experiments were the population abundance n tot female and juvenile frequencies f f and f j and the mean lengths and coefficients of variation of the lengths of five categories of individuals male and female founders l m c00 l f c00 cv m c00 cv f c00 males and females born in the mesocosms l m cxx l f cxx cv m cxx cv f cxx and juveniles l j cv j finally observations of gonad maturity of males immature vs mature were also made and the frequency of mature males among the total number of males f m m was calculated as well as the mean length of mature males and the coefficient of variation of their lengths l m m and cv m m observed endpoint values for each year can be found in appendix part i 1 3 tables a 3 and a 4 2 2 deb ibm description the deb theory is based on a mathematical description of the energy fluxes within the organism it describes the rates at which the organism assimilates energy from food and uses it for maintenance growth and reproduction rates of ingestion and allocation depend on body size and temperature kooijman 2010 individual based modelling simulates population dynamics by describing the interactions between individuals as well as with their environment grimm and railsback 2005 our deb ibm description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2010 the detailed description of the design concepts initialization input data and submodels are provided in appendix part ii 1 the model was implemented under netlogo 6 0 2 and the script of the model is provided in appendix part iv 2 2 1 purpose the deb ibm was developed to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in mesocom experiments to this end the model includes relevant information about the environment i e temperature photoperiod and prey dynamics the deb model was previously developed with laboratory data on life history traits of three spined sticklebacks leloutre et al 2018 and validated for founder sticklebacks in mesocosms david et al 2018 the objective of the model is to help improve current risk assessment of chemicals by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments beaudouin et al 2012b 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model is based on daily timesteps and the simulated mesocosm is a channel of 20 m² based on the mesocosm surface areas at ineris the depth is not taken into account the model includes two entities individuals and environment individuals are divided into three categories juveniles female and male adults individuals are characterized by variables describing their physiology in terms of sex length mass energetic processes maturity and reproductive states the eggs and larvae are not explicitly modelled as individuals because they still use their energy from their yolk sac and thus do not assimilate food however they are taken into account in the reproduction processes the eggs larvae and nests are modelled as a whole entity and are represented as an attribute of males the second entity in the model environment is defined by three main variables temperature photoperiod and mesocosm food density these variables are updated daily from the data recorded during the experiments briefly temperature and food scenarios were respectively defined daily from the freshwater temperature measurements averaged per day and per location of the sensors and the prey samplings abundance data converted into energy made in mesocosms using the same framework than in david et al 2018 daily photoperiod data were from the astronomical applications department of the u s naval observatory http aa usno navy mil data docs dur oneyear php figures a 1 and a 2 present the inputs for each of the five years and details are given in appendix part i 1 1 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling full details of all processes and the associated equations eq a 1 to a 16 can be found in the odd protocol provided in appendix part ii 1 fig 1 presents the overall scheduling of events within one timestep at each timestep the environment global variables are updated temperature photoperiod and food density followed by the fish variables see fig 1 global environment box individuals can move in their environment fig 1 move and their growth energy for maturity and reproduction dynamics are described by the individual deb models fig 1 deb model to introduce inter individual variability the p a m φ e h p a n d e h b deb parameters are individual specific and are lognormally distributed as suggested by kooijman et al 1989 and explained in appendix part i 1 1 the amount of food foraged depends on the individual predation distance r ref and l ref parameters on the prey size an individual has access to a food b food ratio f and on the boldness of males bold m competition for food is modeled taking into account the total fish biomass and modulates the intake of energy from food k dens a kdens see table 1 when they reach 26 mm long juveniles are classified as males or females as in the experimentally collected data sexual maturity of the individuals is predicted by the deb model fig 1 puberty processes furthermore when males have mature gonads they need to accumulate enough energy to support the reproduction processes then reproduction processes are modelled for females based on the clutch sizes they can produce and the fraction of eggs they can spawn in a nest fig 1 reproduction of the females the reproductive behavior of males is more complex fig 1 reproduction of the males as they must defend a territory if enough space is available build a nest attract females harvest eggs and take care of them until hatching wootton 1984 each nest has a daily probability to be destroyed males can make several nests until the end of the breeding period besides the season the end of the reproduction processes for males also depends on the number of successful nests mori 1993 at the end of the incubation period in the nest the number of surviving larvae determines the number of newly created juveniles fig 1 hatch individuals can die due to the temperature and density dependent stochastic mortality sub model fig 1 mortality finally inter mesocosm variability is included on the mortality and the food density and inter annual variability is included on one parameter responsible for competition for food the simulations run for the same length of time as the real mesocosm experiments and the deb ibm simulation outputs are the endpoints monitored in the mesocosm experiments see 2 1 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis in order to highlight the parameters affecting the most the model outputs and to prepare the calibration process local and global sensitivity analyses of the ibm were conducted a sensitivity analysis for the deb model had already been performed in leloutre et al 2018 for the ibm a local sensitivity analysis was first performed using 5 variation on the parameters in order to assess the direct effects of the parameters on the model outputs according to the method described in ginot et al 2006 to account for the interactions between parameters a sensitivity analysis using the morris method was also performed morris 1991 in case of complex models this method allows to sort the factors according to their influence using a specific exploration process this method is described in beaudouin et al 2015 briefly 80 trajectories were carried out using 30 replicates of each set of parameters see appendix part ii 2 2 finally the variance based sobol method saltelli et al 2010 sobol et al 2007 was used to obtain detailed information on the interactions between the most important parameters that had been identified previously using the local and morris sensitivity analysis the sobol method was performed with 10 of variations on the parameter values 2 4 model calibration calibration of the deb model had already been performed with laboratory experiments in leloutre et al 2018 and the relevance of the model for predicting the physiological processes of founder sticklebacks was presented in david et al 2018 values and descriptions of the deb parameters is given in appendix part ii 3 table a 6 only one deb parameter representing energy at puberty j was refitted to better predict the maturity of males in mesocosms calibration of the population model was an iterative process using a genetic algorithm available within the software behaviorsearch grimm and railsback 2005 the distance to minimize was the weighted sum of least squares wls between the predictions and the observations of the endpoints of the population eq 1 1 w l s 1 n i 1 n s i m i μ o b s i ² σ o b s i ² with n the number of observed outputs s i m i the value of the simulated outputs μ o b s the mean of the observed outputs and σ o b s the standard deviation of the observed outputs uncertainty range of the parameters to calibrate were specified based on the parameter values either from the literature see table 1 or from historical laboratory experiments on three spined sticklebacks performed at ineris de kermoysan 2013 they are provided in appendix part ii 3 table a 7 when necessary ratios between parameters were introduced to cope with collinearity the parameters for the generic algorithm were 0 01 100 0 7 3 respectively for the mutation rate the population size the crossover rate and the tournament size the model was calibrated on two datasets obtained in control mesocosms experiments 2010 and 2011 9 and 8 populations respectively joined together thus the final function to minimize was the sum of the wls for both years the parameters with the higher impacts on the outputs according to the sensitivity analyses were calibrated five independent calibrations were performed final parameters values were kept when less than 5 of variations in parameter values between the independent calibrations was found finally after the mean dynamics of the populations were calibrated the inter mesocosm variability was calibrated to this purpose the cv of the food scenarios and the mortality see table 1 were calibrated minimizing the weighted sum of least squares wls between the predictions cv of the outputs calculated on 100 simulations and the observations of the cv of the outputs for both experiments to assess the relevance of the calibration the comparison of the predicted distributions of the descriptive variables of the stickleback population in mesocosms to the observed data for both years was made using a kolmogorov smirnov test a focus was made on the data used for the calibration indeed when the mesocosms were emptied the recovery rate of the fry was lower than for other fish size classes due to multiple factors such as small length and cannibalism after collection however they represent a small fraction of the population 2 2 and 8 0 of the population monitored in 2010 and 2011 respectively we therefore excluded data relative to juveniles shorter than 15 mm to reduce the uncertainty linked to this specific class size during the calibration process 2 5 model evaluation the predictions of the model were assessed for three independent datasets experiments 2012 2013 and 2014 by comparing the observed and predicted values of the descriptive variables of the stickleback populations at the end of the experiments 1000 model simulations were run for each year of experiments and were compared to the observed endpoints in mesocosms in three replicates the parameter values were the same in each simulation the distributions of the descriptive variables of the populations is a result of the stochasticity of the model 2 6 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment in order to demonstrate added values of the deb ibm in a context of mesocosms and risk assessment we simulated mesocosm experiments testing hypothetical stressors that impact the physiological processes of sticklebacks and used the model to simulate the control distributions of the population endpoints for these experiments we tested the five debtox classical modes of action of toxicants billoir et al 2008 but we chose the one with the strongest impacts on the model outputs the so called synthesis cost impact where reproduction and growth are both impacted by an increase of the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure eg eq 2 we presented another hypothetical toxicant which impacts directly the basal mortality m n eq 3 to model effects on survival 2 e g t e g 1 s c t w i t h 0 s c t 1 3 m n t m n 1 s c t w i t h 0 s c t 1 with c t the toxicant concentration and s c t the stress level these two modes of action were tested separately the toxicant concentration c t at time t was modeled to lead to a stress level s c t which we integrated in the model the tested values for the stress level s c t ranged from 0 to 0 9 with an increment of 0 1 inputs of year 2013 were used for the simulations the stress levels of the toxicants during the simulation were modeled as constant as the experimental mesocosm platform comprises 12 artificial streams one control and three chemical concentrations can be tested with three replicates per condition to be representative of this experimental design we designed hypothetical 1000 mesocosm experiments by simulating the population endpoints with three replicates of population per dose and three doses were kept leading to a stress level of 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 then we compared two statistical methods to assess the toxicant effects on the population endpoints first the data in contaminated mesocosms was compared to the data in control conditions as usually made in mesocosm experiments de kermoysan et al 2013a this comparison was performed for each population endpoint at each concentration level with three replicates per condition using a dunnett s post hoc test hereafter referred as the classical methodology secondly the deb ibm was used to simulate the distribution of the control endpoints with 1000 simulations then each population endpoint at each concentration level with three replicates was compared to the estimated distribution of the endpoints in control conditions using a kolmogorov smirnov test hereafter referred to as the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions thus the data collected in the control conditions of the mesocosm experiment would therefore not be used in this comparison we used both methodologies to determine the lowest observed effect concentrations loecs for each endpoint the level of significance for the tests was 5 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the local sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters that influenced the most the endpoints at the end of experiments were a parameter related to the male reproduction processes breeding period the optimal temperature for the individual bioenergetic processes cto and parameters related to the food parameters determining the foraged water column volume l ref r ref the prey size according to the mouth size a food b food ratio f and the impact of the population density on the food availability appendix part ii 2 1 figure a 7 based on the morris sensitivity analysis appendix part ii 2 2 figure a 8 we analyzed the importance of the different parameters on the outputs regarding population abundance m dens was clearly the most influential parameter regarding mean lengths and coefficients of variation the parameters related to the food r ref l ref a food b food and to a lesser degree k dens as well as parameters involved in male reproduction processes r diff proba stop were the most influential parameters regarding the frequencies of females and juveniles all parameters mentioned above were influent these parameters presented both important means and standard deviations meaning that they have an overall strong influence on the outputs and present non linear effects or strong interactions with other parameters based on the local and morris sensitivity analyses the ten most influent parameters were prioritized for calibration the density dependent mortality m dens the time between two reproduction events the breeding period and the probability of stopping the reproduction processes for males r diff breeding period and proba stop as well as the food parameters r ref l ref a food b food k dens and a kdens we also added two other parameters in the calibration the inter individual variability because it was only calibrated for founder sticklebacks in mesocosms david et al 2018 and the parameter bold m responsible for the boldness of males in a foraging context as we had no information in literature results of the sensitivity analyses using the sobol method on the twelve chosen parameters figs 2 and a 9 highlighted the fact that interactions between these parameters were very important suggesting that the calibration should be performed keeping all the chosen parameters together 3 2 model calibration the five independent calibrations of the parameters including the calibrations of the cv of the outputs converged to the same values which can be found in table 1 and a 7 fig 3 shows that the predictions of the population endpoints were consistent with the observations as all points were lined up on the identity line the statistical analyses showed no significant differences p value 0 05 between the observed and the simulated distributions of the descriptive variables of the population except for l f c00 l f cxx and cv f cxx of 2010 however for these endpoints the medians of the simulations were still included in the interval of confidence of the observed medians see appendix part ii 3 2 figure a 10 furthermore if the 36 outputs for both years are considered to be independent binomial variates 0 to 5 false positive results are expected α 0 05 distributions of the length frequencies of all sticklebacks and of mature males were well predicted for both years as seen in appendix part ii 3 2 figures a 11 and a 12 3 3 model evaluation daily mean temperatures follow the same dynamics in the 2012 2013 and 2014 mesocosm experiments see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2a the largest variation was observed in 2013 when the most extreme temperatures were observed 4 3 and 21 3 c daylight data were the same every year see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2b concerning data on food availability zooplankton dynamics were similar in all three experiments see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2c a peak of zooplankton energy occurred during late spring and early summer every year about 100 days after the beginning of the experiment energy from macroinvertebrates was lower in 2014 for both small 5 mm and large 5 mm macroinvertebrates finally a peak was observed for both small and large macroinvertebrates during spring 80 100 days after the beginning of the experiments only in 2013 the model gave overall good predictions of the population endpoints figs 4 and a 14 the model was able to reproduce differences in the population endpoints including inter year variations between 2012 2013 and 2014 indeed the observed endpoints were within the interval range of the predictions however mean lengths of the founders of 2012 were slightly overestimated and the frequency of mature males in 2013 were overestimated appendix part ii 6 figure a 14 furthermore our deb ibm gave overall good predictions of the length distributions fig 5 as all observations were within the predicted interval and the medians followed the shape of the observed frequencies in details a shift of the juvenile frequency peak was however observed in 2014 observed peak at 18 mm and simulated peak lower at 22 mm which could be explained by the last breeding events at the end of the breeding period occurring latter than predicted fig 5c 3 4 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment figs 6 and a 15 show predictions in an example of mesocosm experimental design three simulated population dynamics where stickleback populations were exposed to a hypothetical toxicant with increasing stress levels as well as the 95 prediction interval computed on 1000 model simulations in control conditions overall the hypothetical toxicants impacted the population endpoints at stress levels greater than 60 the toxicant targeting the survival having greater impacts than the one targeting the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure fig 6 fig 7 presents the comparison of the loec for the total abundance endpoint using the data in the three control replicates or using the estimation of the distribution of the abundance in control conditions in the case of a toxicant targeting basal mortality the mean loec assessed using the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distribution by the model was lower 0 72 than using the classical methodology 0 80 furthermore in 26 of the cases the classical methodology would have led us to conclude that there was no effect of the toxicant whereas there is one whereas this occurred in 4 8 of cases with the methodology presented here based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions the results were the same for the other population endpoints see appendix part iii 2 figures a 16 and a 17 4 discussion the objective of this study was to develop a relevant tool to analyze data from mesocosm experiments and show its potential to better understand effects of hypothetical toxicants on population endpoints for this purpose we developed a deb ibm which describes stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms based on the deb model developed by leloutre et al 2018 and evaluated for founders in mesocosm david et al 2018 this original modelling approach integrates some ecological factors photoperiod water temperature and food availability and their interactions with the physiological processes at the organism level consequently our model can help us explore the interactions between biotic abiotic conditions as well as chemical exposure in mesocosm and improve the data analyze of these high tier ecotoxicological studies 4 1 model calibration the deb ibm was calibrated on two independent datasets of population dynamics and was evaluated on three others these datasets included data on stickleback population endpoints and the environmental conditions climatic and physico chemical conditions as well as data on the food webs communities and were independent calibration of ibms is not straightforward as they generally have many parameters with complex and interacting effects on outputs beaudouin et al 2008 grimm and railsback 2005 and using two datasets exhibiting different environmental conditions high and low food level in 2010 and 2011 respectively see appendix part i 1 1 1 figure a 1 increases the difficulty of the calibration but avoids making the model too specific to some environmental conditions to facilitate the calibration processes we reduced the number of parameters to calibrate to twelve the choice of parameters was based on the results of the sensitivity analyses and the level of knowledge of these parameters beaudouin et al 2008 grimm and railsback 2005 thus some parameters which appeared to be important in the sensitivity analyses were not recalibrated for example the optimal temperature was not refitted as it has been extensively studied and thus was well known hovel et al 2015 finally the expected values of the endpoints of the calibration datasets were accurately predicted by our model furthermore the inter mesocosm variability of food density and mortality were calibrated and the overall variability of the endpoints resulting from inter individual and inter mesocosm variability was found to be realistic 4 2 density dependent processes and inter annual variability density dependent mortality and growth were widely recognized as key mechanisms for fish population dynamics and were extensively studied hazlerigg et al 2012 lorenzen and enberg 2002 webster 2004 in our model density dependent mortality was calculated based on the total number of individuals in the environment whereas effects of density dependence on growth were dependent on the fish biomass as suggested by lorenzen and enberg 2002 and hazlerigg et al 2012 it is also well documented that in fish populations competitive interactions between size classes produce complex dynamics claessen et al 2000 persson 1988 persson et al 2000 webster 2004 especially when attacking the same prey power relationships are unequal between adult and juvenile sticklebacks gill and hart 1996 as they do not have the same foraging capacities which explains why larger sticklebacks could be more dominant during competition for food furthermore intense intra cohort competition may occur for juveniles because of their high density in mesocosms compared to the adult cohorts claessen et al 2000 as observed for length frequencies figs 5 and a 11 to take into account these characteristics a stronger density dependent effect on juvenile growth was introduced compared to adults for a given population biomass in order to use the model in a regulatory context robust validation is essential however by comparing data on stickleback populations over time we observed that the mean lengths of the adult sticklebacks born in mesocosms decreased from 2010 to 2014 see appendix part ii 5 figure a 13 this result could not be linked either to the food level which was not particularly low in 2012 2013 and 2014 or to the temperature scenarios or to the founder lengths at the beginning of the experiment which were in the same range as 2011 to capture this process as in several ibms beaudouin et al 2008 cao et al 2016 kellner and swihart 2017 a year dependent variation was integrated on one parameter k dens level of density dependence for growth and this strongly improved the predictions of the model for 2012 to 2014 indeed as seen in fig 5 the model successfully captured the length frequencies of these years meaning that the different cohorts of sticklebacks were well predicted this parameter re adjusted for each year is representative of the level of density dependence for growth and thus is indirectly linked to the environmental and biological conditions in which the sticklebacks evolved another solution could have been to readjust the deb parameters influencing growth for example increasing the energetic cost per unit of structure would decrease the individual growth billoir et al 2008 however we did not keep this solution as individual growth data in mesocosms would be required to recalibrate the deb model and the observed decrease in length might be reversible if the environment changes another ibm for sticklebacks shows the same limits as our model regarding the difficulty of quantifying density dependent growth for sticklebacks as a readjustment of the ibm was required mintram et al 2018 several hypotheses could explain these inter annual differences first the annual variability of the natural vegetation establishment or colonization of the preys e g chironomidae and predators e g dytiscidae in mesocosms probably resulted in inter annual variability of the habitat complexity and heterogeneity as well as differences in the food availability secondly as this decrease seems to be linear over time another explanation could be an acclimatization of the reared stickleback strains used for the mesocosm experiments as sticklebacks are known to rapidly evolve depending on their environment barrett et al 2011 crivelli and britton 1987 mori and takamura 2004 spence et al 2013 4 3 model improvements globally the mechanisms that contribute to population regulation are still not fully integrated in our deb ibm and represent a source of uncertainty to improve the modeling it would be interesting to acquire more information on population dynamics with different density levels in mesocosms as well as on genetic selective changes that could occur in captivity even when there is a new introduction of wild organisms ford 2002 and on the phenomena of phenotypic plasticity via and lande 1985 in three spined sticklebacks it has been shown that both phenotypic plasticity and standing genetic variation could interact with traits related to the biomechanics of feeding showing a stronger genetic predisposition whereas traits related to locomotion are mainly plastic lucek et al 2014 mori and takamura 2004 also showed changes in stickleback body size but did not conclude about whether these morphological changes were related to adaptive phenotypic plasticity or to genetic divergence other processes relative to food foraging and some reproduction processes could represent a source of uncertainty in the model indeed the development of our model showed that modeling predation processes and stickleback foraging behavior was essential as revealed by the sensitivity analyses parameters related to food foraging had a strong influence on the outputs and exhibited strong interactions with other parameters with increasing size fish can become more explorative exploiting different ecological niches and generally increase the mean size of prey that is eaten persson 1988 therefore in our deb ibm the size of the prey a stickleback can have access to varied linearly as a function of the mouth length of the stickleback as suggested by gill and hart 1994 furthermore as explained in david et al 2018 we calculated the available food density each day and for each individual juveniles had a reduced predation distance as they tend to be hidden in the vegetation as a refuge from cannibalism and thus have a less bold and explorative behavior during foraging foster et al 1988 inversely males were considered to be slightly more bold than females as they show greater exploration of their environment in a foraging context king et al 2013 accordingly the adult male lengths results from two opposing processes greater boldness of males leading to a faster growth of the young males i e males born in mesocosms had slighter higher mean lengths than females in all experiments and the parental cares leading to a lower growth for the active reproductive males male founders in mesocosms concerning the reproduction processes egg production of females was described by the deb model and the size of the clutch was estimated as a linear function of the female length fitted on laboratory data appendix part i 3 1 figure a 3 and eq a 10 however female sticklebacks can retain their eggs for a short time if they do not find a nest to spawn afterward they can spawn the clutch even if a male is not present or occasionally develop overripe eggs lam et al 2011 sokołowska 2006 wootton 1984 for more realism this phenomenon was introduced in the model however uncertainties on the process are important as it is still poorly understood in particular the length of time a female can keep the eggs in the ovarian cavity is not well known nevertheless the sensitivity analyses of our model revealed that the length of time during which females can keep eggs had a low impact on the model outputs in comparison to females stickleback males exhibit an important energy investment in reproductive behavior smith and wootton 1999 van iersel 1953 wootton 1984 in our deb ibm an approach to link the energy expenditure in reproductive behavior to the energy for reproduction predicted by the deb model was developed to do that we extrapolated the amount of energy needed for the duration of one reproduction success based on the study of smith and wootton 1999 and mori 1993 to use it as a threshold for males thus males which do not have enough energy to accomplish one reproduction process would not acquire their reproductive behavior i e get a territory build a nest harvest and take care of the eggs furthermore males in the field need to be at least 1 or 2 years old to start the reproduction processes baker 1994 dufresne et al 1990 this was consistent with the absence of sexual dimorphism observed in our mesocosm between young adult female and male sticklebacks i e adults born in mesocosm due to the absence of reproductive behavior during the first year in young males in our modeling of their reproductive behavior males born in mesocosms do not start the reproduction processes during their first spring in addition another interest of using the energy for reproduction predicted by the deb model for both males and females is that the reproduction performances would depend on environmental conditions as widely described in literature borg 1982 hopkins et al 2010 wootton 1973 1984 although it has been shown that temperature and a photoperiod threshold seem to induce the beginning of the breeding period wootton 1984 factors influencing the end of this period are still not well understood as the breeding period typically takes place between late march and early august sokołowska 2006 wootton 1984 the duration of the breeding period was introduced as a parameter in the model to control reproduction however the understanding of the environmental causes influencing the end of the reproduction should be increased because as seen in the sensitivity analyses the parameter breeding period had a strong influence on the model outputs another factor controlling the end of the reproduction is the number of successful nests mori 1993 the number of successful nests predicted by the model between one and four for the mesocosm experiments of 2010 and 2011 is consistent with the observations of mori 1993 in field i e between one and three successful nests during the breeding period finally improving our deb ibm by modeling spatial variations of the environment in addition to the temporal variations of some variables would be highly interesting to account for specific interactions between individuals and their environment nursery areas refuge from predation deferential exploitation of the food patches etc spatially explicit bioenergetics ibms have already been developed for fish populations boyd et al 2018 politikos et al 2015 and performed well in modelling the fish habitat as well as the movements towards favorable feeding areas furthermore modelling fish distribution in response to an environmental change would be interesting in environmental management and risk assessment 4 4 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment the predictions of our model in control conditions could represent a relevant baseline for determining magnitude and statistical significance of the effects in exposed populations and could help to better understand toxicant impacts on stickleback populations indeed the small number of mesocosm replicates combined with the important variability due to the high levels of biological organization efsa 2013 sanderson 2002 have been presented as a major drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals in mesocosms as it is a source of false negative results i e concluding a chemical has no effect when it really has shaw et al 1994 beaudouin et al 2008 efsa 2013 here we illustrated an application of our deb ibm to mesocosm experiments by integrating effects of hypothetical toxicants having different modes of action galic et al 2017 martin et al 2013 overall a toxicant which would affect the basal mortality as well as the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure would have strong effects on the population structure by comparing the classical methodology to the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions we showed that the loecs calculated with the model simulations were lower than the ones calculated using the three replicates of the control this highlights the interest of our approach which could improve environmental risk assessment by decreasing the risk of false negative results when analyzing data from mesocosms indeed using ibms to simulate the endpoint distributions of populations in mesocosms allows to estimate the descriptive variables of the populations i e the shape expectation and variance compared to a simple estimation from the observed data from mesocosms beaudouin et al 2012b furthermore we assumed here only one type of effect by toxicants explaining why the populational effects have been mainly seen with a high stress level fig 5 however toxicants could have multiple impacts i e combined effects on survival and reproduction for example which could increase the populational responses finally although the ecological realism of mesocosm experiments is strongly improved compared to laboratory tests theses aquatic model ecosystems are characterized by a reduction in size and complexity when compared to natural aquatic ecosystems caquet et al 2000 efsa 2013 as they are designed to answer to a specific question consequently other natural processes could occur in natural ecosystems as for example competition between several fish species which does not occur in our mesocosm experiments and thus are not modelled in our ibm 5 conclusions a model which accurately predicts population dynamics over time and takes into account relevant information on the environment is of great interest for ecological management long term decision making and risk assessment here we developed a deb ibm for predicting stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms taking into account the main environmental factors the model was successfully calibrated and the predictions of the population dynamics in control conditions were accurate hence as seen with the case study of hypothetical toxicants the model can help extrapolate from individual mechanistic responses to the population level the deb ibm should then help us to have a closer understanding of toxicant effects on stickleback population dynamics and

25093,developing population models is of great interest as these models enable to extrapolate toxicity observed at the molecular or individual levels to the population level and thus improve environmental risk assessment of chemical substances for this purpose accounting for natural variations of environmental conditions and prey dynamics along with the chemical stress is needed in this study an individual based model ibm coupled to a dynamic energy budget deb model was developed in order to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in semi controlled stream experiments in mesocosms datasets obtained in mesocosms offer the opportunity to develop and evaluate the model predictions the most sensitive parameters of the deb ibm were identified by sensitivity analyses and were calibrated based on data from two independent mesocosm experiments the predictive capacities of our model were subsequently evaluated using three independent mesocosm datasets under different environmental scenarios finally our model was applied to a theoretical case of toxic effects to show an example of application of the model in a regulatory context while the most uncertain population processes in particular competition for food in mesocosms in our three spined stickleback deb ibm could be modelled more accurately our model can already serve to assess the impacts of toxicants at the population level by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments in decreasing the uncertainty of the experimental results therefore in a second step it could be used to predict the consequences on viability of a population exposed to a contaminant under various environmental and exposure scenarios keywords individual based model bioenergetics three spined stickleback mesocosm risk assessment 1 introduction in a regulatory context predicting chronic exposure and effects of pollutants on aquatic ecosystem endpoints is of a great interest adams 2002 ruden et al 2016 however as ecosystems are dynamic entities which exhibit a complex network of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their environment current ecological risk assessment approaches often fail to predict toxicant effects accurately on population and ecosystem endpoints adams 2002 indeed toxicant effects are mainly studied at an individual level and extrapolation towards a higher level of organization is often too simplistic forbes et al 2017 ecological risk assessment should be a comprehensive and integrated approach able to assess toxicant impacts in complex ecosystems in particular a focus should be made on the bottom up and top down processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems and make risk assessment a challenge galic et al 2010 for this purpose ecological modeling has been suggested as a relevant tool to improve the understanding of ecosystem functioning and interactions between biocenosis and biotope indeed the potential of models towards enhancing ecological realism in current risk assessment is increasingly recognized beaudouin et al 2015 forbes et al 2011 2017 galic et al 2010 grimm et al 2017 furthermore individual based modelling ibm has demonstrated its ability to predict population dynamics by modelling the interactions between individuals and their environment grimm and railsback 2005 furthermore including individual energy budgets in ibms was suggested to be essential for realistic modelling of populations affected by food availability sibly et al 2013 in particular in risk assessment among the different existing approaches for energy budgets embedding a dynamic energy budget deb model kooijman 2010 into an ibm is a convenient way of extrapolating impacts of toxicants from organism to population level beaudouin et al 2012a 2015 martin et al 2013 thus providing considerable insight into the possible range of effects of chemicals galic et al 2017 although demand for deb ibms in ecotoxicology is rising special attention should be paid to their outcomes so that the models may be relevant tools for risk assessment and decision making indeed the model should be able to accurately predict real world ecosystem and the population properties under a variety of environmental conditions food availability and seasonal variations of the environment without chemical stress unfortunately the predictive capacities of deb ibms are rarely evaluated because there are rarely enough data to both calibrate and evaluate these models furthermore detailed and accurate comparisons between simulations and observations often require a sound knowledge of the populations characteristics size of the population sex length of the individuals data on the state of maturity etc these data are often scarce because multiple samplings in the same environment are costly logistically difficult and time consuming mesocosm experiments are of a great interest because they are a convenient tool to perform high tier ecotoxicological studies i e studies performed at the population level or higher efsa 2013 among species used for mesocosm studies fish species are of a specific interest for assessing impacts of contaminants in the environment van der oost et al 2003 specifically the teleost fish three spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus is one of the fish species that can be used in mesocosms oecd 2006 this species is native of the northern hemisphere and its ecology and biology have been well studied bell and foster 1994 wootton 1984 moreover effects of toxicants have been studied both in laboratory and mesocosms on stickleback individuals and populations de kermoysan et al 2013a maunder et al 2007 naslund et al 2017 roussel et al 2007 mesocosm experiments have the advantage of mimicking the complexity of a natural ecosystem by exhibiting a high level of biological organization caquet 2002 caquet et al 2000 and they can provide interesting datasets for developing ecological models however these studies are mostly performed using few replicates and exhibit an important variability of the results due to the natural variability inherent of high levels of biological organization efsa 2013 sanderson 2002 consequently these experiments are characterized by a low statistical power when comparing the control and the chemical exposed populations which could be improved by using ibms beaudouin et al 2012b consequently developing an ibm to predict the stickleback population dynamics in mesocosm would help to analyze the ecotoxicological experiment and offers the opportunity to evaluate an ecological model later applied to risk assessment an ibm has recently been developed for sticklebacks in field conditions mintram et al 2018 to predict endocrine disruption however this model does not integrate some ecological factors like photoperiod water temperature and food availability nor a bioenergetic model which would describe physiological processes at the organism level hence as suggested by the authors a more mechanistical approach which would take into account interactions between the effect of a toxicant and ecological factors would help to improve the realism of the ibm predictions in this paper we developed a deb ibm to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms we used this model to analyze data from mesocosm experiments that included relevant information on the environmental conditions food density temperature and photoperiod the predictive capacities of our model were assessed by calibrating and evaluating it on several independent datasets of mesocosm experiments in this study we showed how individual based modelling can provide realistic simulated population dynamics in mesocosms furthermore to illustrate usage in a risk assessment context we used our model to assess the impacts of hypothetical toxicants on stickleback population dynamics in mesocosm experiments 2 material and methods 2 1 mesocosm experiments 2 1 1 experimental design five independent experiments from 2010 to 2014 with an identical protocol were performed using artificial streams of 20 m long and 1 m wide located in the north of france ineris verneuil en halatte france the two first mesocosm experiments 2010 and 2011 were conducted with 9 and 8 replicates of mesocosms respectively whereas experiments performed in 2012 2013 and 2014 were conducted with 3 replicates the same experimental design was used for each experiment a detailed description is given in de kermoysan et al 2013a briefly the same protocol of species introduction was used for each experiment each mesocosm was set up with sediments macrophytes and macroinvertebrates between october and december the experiments started in march when 15 females and 10 male sticklebacks with homogenous length see appendix part i 1 2 tables a 1 and a 2 were introduced after called the founders the sex identification of the founders was performed with the model developed by de kermoysan et al 2013b founders were individually marked with 1 2 mm x 2 7 mm alphanumeric tags vi alpha tags northwesr marine technology shaw island wa usa the different species as well as the physico chemical parameters of the environment varied naturally throughout the experiments and the freshwater temperature and stickleback prey abundances were monitored over time water temperature was recorded every 10 min by two temperature sensors hobo0257 prosensor amanvilliers france placed in the surface at 5 m from the inlet of water and at 15 m at a water depth of 70 cm macroinvertebrates were sampled every four weeks by specific sampling devices i e tubes tiles or mesocosm walls zooplankton were also sampled every four weeks with a perspex tube of 5 cm in diameter and 0 8 m in height see david et al 2018 for more details on temperature measurements and prey samplings mesocosms were emptied in october and fish were killed by an overdose of ms 222 and stored in 4 formalin before being individually measured and weighed fish shorter than 26 mm in length were assumed to be immature and thus classified as juveniles de kermoysan et al 2013a sexes of fish longer than 26 mm were determined by visual observations the ethics committee of the national institute of industrial environment and risks ineris approved all the experiments performed and described in this manuscript 2 1 2 descriptive variables of the stickleback populations the descriptive variables of each fish population at the end of the experiments were the population abundance n tot female and juvenile frequencies f f and f j and the mean lengths and coefficients of variation of the lengths of five categories of individuals male and female founders l m c00 l f c00 cv m c00 cv f c00 males and females born in the mesocosms l m cxx l f cxx cv m cxx cv f cxx and juveniles l j cv j finally observations of gonad maturity of males immature vs mature were also made and the frequency of mature males among the total number of males f m m was calculated as well as the mean length of mature males and the coefficient of variation of their lengths l m m and cv m m observed endpoint values for each year can be found in appendix part i 1 3 tables a 3 and a 4 2 2 deb ibm description the deb theory is based on a mathematical description of the energy fluxes within the organism it describes the rates at which the organism assimilates energy from food and uses it for maintenance growth and reproduction rates of ingestion and allocation depend on body size and temperature kooijman 2010 individual based modelling simulates population dynamics by describing the interactions between individuals as well as with their environment grimm and railsback 2005 our deb ibm description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2010 the detailed description of the design concepts initialization input data and submodels are provided in appendix part ii 1 the model was implemented under netlogo 6 0 2 and the script of the model is provided in appendix part iv 2 2 1 purpose the deb ibm was developed to predict three spined stickleback population dynamics in mesocom experiments to this end the model includes relevant information about the environment i e temperature photoperiod and prey dynamics the deb model was previously developed with laboratory data on life history traits of three spined sticklebacks leloutre et al 2018 and validated for founder sticklebacks in mesocosms david et al 2018 the objective of the model is to help improve current risk assessment of chemicals by improving the analyses of mesocosm experiments beaudouin et al 2012b 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model is based on daily timesteps and the simulated mesocosm is a channel of 20 m² based on the mesocosm surface areas at ineris the depth is not taken into account the model includes two entities individuals and environment individuals are divided into three categories juveniles female and male adults individuals are characterized by variables describing their physiology in terms of sex length mass energetic processes maturity and reproductive states the eggs and larvae are not explicitly modelled as individuals because they still use their energy from their yolk sac and thus do not assimilate food however they are taken into account in the reproduction processes the eggs larvae and nests are modelled as a whole entity and are represented as an attribute of males the second entity in the model environment is defined by three main variables temperature photoperiod and mesocosm food density these variables are updated daily from the data recorded during the experiments briefly temperature and food scenarios were respectively defined daily from the freshwater temperature measurements averaged per day and per location of the sensors and the prey samplings abundance data converted into energy made in mesocosms using the same framework than in david et al 2018 daily photoperiod data were from the astronomical applications department of the u s naval observatory http aa usno navy mil data docs dur oneyear php figures a 1 and a 2 present the inputs for each of the five years and details are given in appendix part i 1 1 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling full details of all processes and the associated equations eq a 1 to a 16 can be found in the odd protocol provided in appendix part ii 1 fig 1 presents the overall scheduling of events within one timestep at each timestep the environment global variables are updated temperature photoperiod and food density followed by the fish variables see fig 1 global environment box individuals can move in their environment fig 1 move and their growth energy for maturity and reproduction dynamics are described by the individual deb models fig 1 deb model to introduce inter individual variability the p a m φ e h p a n d e h b deb parameters are individual specific and are lognormally distributed as suggested by kooijman et al 1989 and explained in appendix part i 1 1 the amount of food foraged depends on the individual predation distance r ref and l ref parameters on the prey size an individual has access to a food b food ratio f and on the boldness of males bold m competition for food is modeled taking into account the total fish biomass and modulates the intake of energy from food k dens a kdens see table 1 when they reach 26 mm long juveniles are classified as males or females as in the experimentally collected data sexual maturity of the individuals is predicted by the deb model fig 1 puberty processes furthermore when males have mature gonads they need to accumulate enough energy to support the reproduction processes then reproduction processes are modelled for females based on the clutch sizes they can produce and the fraction of eggs they can spawn in a nest fig 1 reproduction of the females the reproductive behavior of males is more complex fig 1 reproduction of the males as they must defend a territory if enough space is available build a nest attract females harvest eggs and take care of them until hatching wootton 1984 each nest has a daily probability to be destroyed males can make several nests until the end of the breeding period besides the season the end of the reproduction processes for males also depends on the number of successful nests mori 1993 at the end of the incubation period in the nest the number of surviving larvae determines the number of newly created juveniles fig 1 hatch individuals can die due to the temperature and density dependent stochastic mortality sub model fig 1 mortality finally inter mesocosm variability is included on the mortality and the food density and inter annual variability is included on one parameter responsible for competition for food the simulations run for the same length of time as the real mesocosm experiments and the deb ibm simulation outputs are the endpoints monitored in the mesocosm experiments see 2 1 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis in order to highlight the parameters affecting the most the model outputs and to prepare the calibration process local and global sensitivity analyses of the ibm were conducted a sensitivity analysis for the deb model had already been performed in leloutre et al 2018 for the ibm a local sensitivity analysis was first performed using 5 variation on the parameters in order to assess the direct effects of the parameters on the model outputs according to the method described in ginot et al 2006 to account for the interactions between parameters a sensitivity analysis using the morris method was also performed morris 1991 in case of complex models this method allows to sort the factors according to their influence using a specific exploration process this method is described in beaudouin et al 2015 briefly 80 trajectories were carried out using 30 replicates of each set of parameters see appendix part ii 2 2 finally the variance based sobol method saltelli et al 2010 sobol et al 2007 was used to obtain detailed information on the interactions between the most important parameters that had been identified previously using the local and morris sensitivity analysis the sobol method was performed with 10 of variations on the parameter values 2 4 model calibration calibration of the deb model had already been performed with laboratory experiments in leloutre et al 2018 and the relevance of the model for predicting the physiological processes of founder sticklebacks was presented in david et al 2018 values and descriptions of the deb parameters is given in appendix part ii 3 table a 6 only one deb parameter representing energy at puberty j was refitted to better predict the maturity of males in mesocosms calibration of the population model was an iterative process using a genetic algorithm available within the software behaviorsearch grimm and railsback 2005 the distance to minimize was the weighted sum of least squares wls between the predictions and the observations of the endpoints of the population eq 1 1 w l s 1 n i 1 n s i m i μ o b s i ² σ o b s i ² with n the number of observed outputs s i m i the value of the simulated outputs μ o b s the mean of the observed outputs and σ o b s the standard deviation of the observed outputs uncertainty range of the parameters to calibrate were specified based on the parameter values either from the literature see table 1 or from historical laboratory experiments on three spined sticklebacks performed at ineris de kermoysan 2013 they are provided in appendix part ii 3 table a 7 when necessary ratios between parameters were introduced to cope with collinearity the parameters for the generic algorithm were 0 01 100 0 7 3 respectively for the mutation rate the population size the crossover rate and the tournament size the model was calibrated on two datasets obtained in control mesocosms experiments 2010 and 2011 9 and 8 populations respectively joined together thus the final function to minimize was the sum of the wls for both years the parameters with the higher impacts on the outputs according to the sensitivity analyses were calibrated five independent calibrations were performed final parameters values were kept when less than 5 of variations in parameter values between the independent calibrations was found finally after the mean dynamics of the populations were calibrated the inter mesocosm variability was calibrated to this purpose the cv of the food scenarios and the mortality see table 1 were calibrated minimizing the weighted sum of least squares wls between the predictions cv of the outputs calculated on 100 simulations and the observations of the cv of the outputs for both experiments to assess the relevance of the calibration the comparison of the predicted distributions of the descriptive variables of the stickleback population in mesocosms to the observed data for both years was made using a kolmogorov smirnov test a focus was made on the data used for the calibration indeed when the mesocosms were emptied the recovery rate of the fry was lower than for other fish size classes due to multiple factors such as small length and cannibalism after collection however they represent a small fraction of the population 2 2 and 8 0 of the population monitored in 2010 and 2011 respectively we therefore excluded data relative to juveniles shorter than 15 mm to reduce the uncertainty linked to this specific class size during the calibration process 2 5 model evaluation the predictions of the model were assessed for three independent datasets experiments 2012 2013 and 2014 by comparing the observed and predicted values of the descriptive variables of the stickleback populations at the end of the experiments 1000 model simulations were run for each year of experiments and were compared to the observed endpoints in mesocosms in three replicates the parameter values were the same in each simulation the distributions of the descriptive variables of the populations is a result of the stochasticity of the model 2 6 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment in order to demonstrate added values of the deb ibm in a context of mesocosms and risk assessment we simulated mesocosm experiments testing hypothetical stressors that impact the physiological processes of sticklebacks and used the model to simulate the control distributions of the population endpoints for these experiments we tested the five debtox classical modes of action of toxicants billoir et al 2008 but we chose the one with the strongest impacts on the model outputs the so called synthesis cost impact where reproduction and growth are both impacted by an increase of the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure eg eq 2 we presented another hypothetical toxicant which impacts directly the basal mortality m n eq 3 to model effects on survival 2 e g t e g 1 s c t w i t h 0 s c t 1 3 m n t m n 1 s c t w i t h 0 s c t 1 with c t the toxicant concentration and s c t the stress level these two modes of action were tested separately the toxicant concentration c t at time t was modeled to lead to a stress level s c t which we integrated in the model the tested values for the stress level s c t ranged from 0 to 0 9 with an increment of 0 1 inputs of year 2013 were used for the simulations the stress levels of the toxicants during the simulation were modeled as constant as the experimental mesocosm platform comprises 12 artificial streams one control and three chemical concentrations can be tested with three replicates per condition to be representative of this experimental design we designed hypothetical 1000 mesocosm experiments by simulating the population endpoints with three replicates of population per dose and three doses were kept leading to a stress level of 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 then we compared two statistical methods to assess the toxicant effects on the population endpoints first the data in contaminated mesocosms was compared to the data in control conditions as usually made in mesocosm experiments de kermoysan et al 2013a this comparison was performed for each population endpoint at each concentration level with three replicates per condition using a dunnett s post hoc test hereafter referred as the classical methodology secondly the deb ibm was used to simulate the distribution of the control endpoints with 1000 simulations then each population endpoint at each concentration level with three replicates was compared to the estimated distribution of the endpoints in control conditions using a kolmogorov smirnov test hereafter referred to as the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions thus the data collected in the control conditions of the mesocosm experiment would therefore not be used in this comparison we used both methodologies to determine the lowest observed effect concentrations loecs for each endpoint the level of significance for the tests was 5 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the local sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters that influenced the most the endpoints at the end of experiments were a parameter related to the male reproduction processes breeding period the optimal temperature for the individual bioenergetic processes cto and parameters related to the food parameters determining the foraged water column volume l ref r ref the prey size according to the mouth size a food b food ratio f and the impact of the population density on the food availability appendix part ii 2 1 figure a 7 based on the morris sensitivity analysis appendix part ii 2 2 figure a 8 we analyzed the importance of the different parameters on the outputs regarding population abundance m dens was clearly the most influential parameter regarding mean lengths and coefficients of variation the parameters related to the food r ref l ref a food b food and to a lesser degree k dens as well as parameters involved in male reproduction processes r diff proba stop were the most influential parameters regarding the frequencies of females and juveniles all parameters mentioned above were influent these parameters presented both important means and standard deviations meaning that they have an overall strong influence on the outputs and present non linear effects or strong interactions with other parameters based on the local and morris sensitivity analyses the ten most influent parameters were prioritized for calibration the density dependent mortality m dens the time between two reproduction events the breeding period and the probability of stopping the reproduction processes for males r diff breeding period and proba stop as well as the food parameters r ref l ref a food b food k dens and a kdens we also added two other parameters in the calibration the inter individual variability because it was only calibrated for founder sticklebacks in mesocosms david et al 2018 and the parameter bold m responsible for the boldness of males in a foraging context as we had no information in literature results of the sensitivity analyses using the sobol method on the twelve chosen parameters figs 2 and a 9 highlighted the fact that interactions between these parameters were very important suggesting that the calibration should be performed keeping all the chosen parameters together 3 2 model calibration the five independent calibrations of the parameters including the calibrations of the cv of the outputs converged to the same values which can be found in table 1 and a 7 fig 3 shows that the predictions of the population endpoints were consistent with the observations as all points were lined up on the identity line the statistical analyses showed no significant differences p value 0 05 between the observed and the simulated distributions of the descriptive variables of the population except for l f c00 l f cxx and cv f cxx of 2010 however for these endpoints the medians of the simulations were still included in the interval of confidence of the observed medians see appendix part ii 3 2 figure a 10 furthermore if the 36 outputs for both years are considered to be independent binomial variates 0 to 5 false positive results are expected α 0 05 distributions of the length frequencies of all sticklebacks and of mature males were well predicted for both years as seen in appendix part ii 3 2 figures a 11 and a 12 3 3 model evaluation daily mean temperatures follow the same dynamics in the 2012 2013 and 2014 mesocosm experiments see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2a the largest variation was observed in 2013 when the most extreme temperatures were observed 4 3 and 21 3 c daylight data were the same every year see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2b concerning data on food availability zooplankton dynamics were similar in all three experiments see appendix part i 1 1 2 figure a 2c a peak of zooplankton energy occurred during late spring and early summer every year about 100 days after the beginning of the experiment energy from macroinvertebrates was lower in 2014 for both small 5 mm and large 5 mm macroinvertebrates finally a peak was observed for both small and large macroinvertebrates during spring 80 100 days after the beginning of the experiments only in 2013 the model gave overall good predictions of the population endpoints figs 4 and a 14 the model was able to reproduce differences in the population endpoints including inter year variations between 2012 2013 and 2014 indeed the observed endpoints were within the interval range of the predictions however mean lengths of the founders of 2012 were slightly overestimated and the frequency of mature males in 2013 were overestimated appendix part ii 6 figure a 14 furthermore our deb ibm gave overall good predictions of the length distributions fig 5 as all observations were within the predicted interval and the medians followed the shape of the observed frequencies in details a shift of the juvenile frequency peak was however observed in 2014 observed peak at 18 mm and simulated peak lower at 22 mm which could be explained by the last breeding events at the end of the breeding period occurring latter than predicted fig 5c 3 4 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment figs 6 and a 15 show predictions in an example of mesocosm experimental design three simulated population dynamics where stickleback populations were exposed to a hypothetical toxicant with increasing stress levels as well as the 95 prediction interval computed on 1000 model simulations in control conditions overall the hypothetical toxicants impacted the population endpoints at stress levels greater than 60 the toxicant targeting the survival having greater impacts than the one targeting the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure fig 6 fig 7 presents the comparison of the loec for the total abundance endpoint using the data in the three control replicates or using the estimation of the distribution of the abundance in control conditions in the case of a toxicant targeting basal mortality the mean loec assessed using the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distribution by the model was lower 0 72 than using the classical methodology 0 80 furthermore in 26 of the cases the classical methodology would have led us to conclude that there was no effect of the toxicant whereas there is one whereas this occurred in 4 8 of cases with the methodology presented here based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions the results were the same for the other population endpoints see appendix part iii 2 figures a 16 and a 17 4 discussion the objective of this study was to develop a relevant tool to analyze data from mesocosm experiments and show its potential to better understand effects of hypothetical toxicants on population endpoints for this purpose we developed a deb ibm which describes stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms based on the deb model developed by leloutre et al 2018 and evaluated for founders in mesocosm david et al 2018 this original modelling approach integrates some ecological factors photoperiod water temperature and food availability and their interactions with the physiological processes at the organism level consequently our model can help us explore the interactions between biotic abiotic conditions as well as chemical exposure in mesocosm and improve the data analyze of these high tier ecotoxicological studies 4 1 model calibration the deb ibm was calibrated on two independent datasets of population dynamics and was evaluated on three others these datasets included data on stickleback population endpoints and the environmental conditions climatic and physico chemical conditions as well as data on the food webs communities and were independent calibration of ibms is not straightforward as they generally have many parameters with complex and interacting effects on outputs beaudouin et al 2008 grimm and railsback 2005 and using two datasets exhibiting different environmental conditions high and low food level in 2010 and 2011 respectively see appendix part i 1 1 1 figure a 1 increases the difficulty of the calibration but avoids making the model too specific to some environmental conditions to facilitate the calibration processes we reduced the number of parameters to calibrate to twelve the choice of parameters was based on the results of the sensitivity analyses and the level of knowledge of these parameters beaudouin et al 2008 grimm and railsback 2005 thus some parameters which appeared to be important in the sensitivity analyses were not recalibrated for example the optimal temperature was not refitted as it has been extensively studied and thus was well known hovel et al 2015 finally the expected values of the endpoints of the calibration datasets were accurately predicted by our model furthermore the inter mesocosm variability of food density and mortality were calibrated and the overall variability of the endpoints resulting from inter individual and inter mesocosm variability was found to be realistic 4 2 density dependent processes and inter annual variability density dependent mortality and growth were widely recognized as key mechanisms for fish population dynamics and were extensively studied hazlerigg et al 2012 lorenzen and enberg 2002 webster 2004 in our model density dependent mortality was calculated based on the total number of individuals in the environment whereas effects of density dependence on growth were dependent on the fish biomass as suggested by lorenzen and enberg 2002 and hazlerigg et al 2012 it is also well documented that in fish populations competitive interactions between size classes produce complex dynamics claessen et al 2000 persson 1988 persson et al 2000 webster 2004 especially when attacking the same prey power relationships are unequal between adult and juvenile sticklebacks gill and hart 1996 as they do not have the same foraging capacities which explains why larger sticklebacks could be more dominant during competition for food furthermore intense intra cohort competition may occur for juveniles because of their high density in mesocosms compared to the adult cohorts claessen et al 2000 as observed for length frequencies figs 5 and a 11 to take into account these characteristics a stronger density dependent effect on juvenile growth was introduced compared to adults for a given population biomass in order to use the model in a regulatory context robust validation is essential however by comparing data on stickleback populations over time we observed that the mean lengths of the adult sticklebacks born in mesocosms decreased from 2010 to 2014 see appendix part ii 5 figure a 13 this result could not be linked either to the food level which was not particularly low in 2012 2013 and 2014 or to the temperature scenarios or to the founder lengths at the beginning of the experiment which were in the same range as 2011 to capture this process as in several ibms beaudouin et al 2008 cao et al 2016 kellner and swihart 2017 a year dependent variation was integrated on one parameter k dens level of density dependence for growth and this strongly improved the predictions of the model for 2012 to 2014 indeed as seen in fig 5 the model successfully captured the length frequencies of these years meaning that the different cohorts of sticklebacks were well predicted this parameter re adjusted for each year is representative of the level of density dependence for growth and thus is indirectly linked to the environmental and biological conditions in which the sticklebacks evolved another solution could have been to readjust the deb parameters influencing growth for example increasing the energetic cost per unit of structure would decrease the individual growth billoir et al 2008 however we did not keep this solution as individual growth data in mesocosms would be required to recalibrate the deb model and the observed decrease in length might be reversible if the environment changes another ibm for sticklebacks shows the same limits as our model regarding the difficulty of quantifying density dependent growth for sticklebacks as a readjustment of the ibm was required mintram et al 2018 several hypotheses could explain these inter annual differences first the annual variability of the natural vegetation establishment or colonization of the preys e g chironomidae and predators e g dytiscidae in mesocosms probably resulted in inter annual variability of the habitat complexity and heterogeneity as well as differences in the food availability secondly as this decrease seems to be linear over time another explanation could be an acclimatization of the reared stickleback strains used for the mesocosm experiments as sticklebacks are known to rapidly evolve depending on their environment barrett et al 2011 crivelli and britton 1987 mori and takamura 2004 spence et al 2013 4 3 model improvements globally the mechanisms that contribute to population regulation are still not fully integrated in our deb ibm and represent a source of uncertainty to improve the modeling it would be interesting to acquire more information on population dynamics with different density levels in mesocosms as well as on genetic selective changes that could occur in captivity even when there is a new introduction of wild organisms ford 2002 and on the phenomena of phenotypic plasticity via and lande 1985 in three spined sticklebacks it has been shown that both phenotypic plasticity and standing genetic variation could interact with traits related to the biomechanics of feeding showing a stronger genetic predisposition whereas traits related to locomotion are mainly plastic lucek et al 2014 mori and takamura 2004 also showed changes in stickleback body size but did not conclude about whether these morphological changes were related to adaptive phenotypic plasticity or to genetic divergence other processes relative to food foraging and some reproduction processes could represent a source of uncertainty in the model indeed the development of our model showed that modeling predation processes and stickleback foraging behavior was essential as revealed by the sensitivity analyses parameters related to food foraging had a strong influence on the outputs and exhibited strong interactions with other parameters with increasing size fish can become more explorative exploiting different ecological niches and generally increase the mean size of prey that is eaten persson 1988 therefore in our deb ibm the size of the prey a stickleback can have access to varied linearly as a function of the mouth length of the stickleback as suggested by gill and hart 1994 furthermore as explained in david et al 2018 we calculated the available food density each day and for each individual juveniles had a reduced predation distance as they tend to be hidden in the vegetation as a refuge from cannibalism and thus have a less bold and explorative behavior during foraging foster et al 1988 inversely males were considered to be slightly more bold than females as they show greater exploration of their environment in a foraging context king et al 2013 accordingly the adult male lengths results from two opposing processes greater boldness of males leading to a faster growth of the young males i e males born in mesocosms had slighter higher mean lengths than females in all experiments and the parental cares leading to a lower growth for the active reproductive males male founders in mesocosms concerning the reproduction processes egg production of females was described by the deb model and the size of the clutch was estimated as a linear function of the female length fitted on laboratory data appendix part i 3 1 figure a 3 and eq a 10 however female sticklebacks can retain their eggs for a short time if they do not find a nest to spawn afterward they can spawn the clutch even if a male is not present or occasionally develop overripe eggs lam et al 2011 sokołowska 2006 wootton 1984 for more realism this phenomenon was introduced in the model however uncertainties on the process are important as it is still poorly understood in particular the length of time a female can keep the eggs in the ovarian cavity is not well known nevertheless the sensitivity analyses of our model revealed that the length of time during which females can keep eggs had a low impact on the model outputs in comparison to females stickleback males exhibit an important energy investment in reproductive behavior smith and wootton 1999 van iersel 1953 wootton 1984 in our deb ibm an approach to link the energy expenditure in reproductive behavior to the energy for reproduction predicted by the deb model was developed to do that we extrapolated the amount of energy needed for the duration of one reproduction success based on the study of smith and wootton 1999 and mori 1993 to use it as a threshold for males thus males which do not have enough energy to accomplish one reproduction process would not acquire their reproductive behavior i e get a territory build a nest harvest and take care of the eggs furthermore males in the field need to be at least 1 or 2 years old to start the reproduction processes baker 1994 dufresne et al 1990 this was consistent with the absence of sexual dimorphism observed in our mesocosm between young adult female and male sticklebacks i e adults born in mesocosm due to the absence of reproductive behavior during the first year in young males in our modeling of their reproductive behavior males born in mesocosms do not start the reproduction processes during their first spring in addition another interest of using the energy for reproduction predicted by the deb model for both males and females is that the reproduction performances would depend on environmental conditions as widely described in literature borg 1982 hopkins et al 2010 wootton 1973 1984 although it has been shown that temperature and a photoperiod threshold seem to induce the beginning of the breeding period wootton 1984 factors influencing the end of this period are still not well understood as the breeding period typically takes place between late march and early august sokołowska 2006 wootton 1984 the duration of the breeding period was introduced as a parameter in the model to control reproduction however the understanding of the environmental causes influencing the end of the reproduction should be increased because as seen in the sensitivity analyses the parameter breeding period had a strong influence on the model outputs another factor controlling the end of the reproduction is the number of successful nests mori 1993 the number of successful nests predicted by the model between one and four for the mesocosm experiments of 2010 and 2011 is consistent with the observations of mori 1993 in field i e between one and three successful nests during the breeding period finally improving our deb ibm by modeling spatial variations of the environment in addition to the temporal variations of some variables would be highly interesting to account for specific interactions between individuals and their environment nursery areas refuge from predation deferential exploitation of the food patches etc spatially explicit bioenergetics ibms have already been developed for fish populations boyd et al 2018 politikos et al 2015 and performed well in modelling the fish habitat as well as the movements towards favorable feeding areas furthermore modelling fish distribution in response to an environmental change would be interesting in environmental management and risk assessment 4 4 model application to analyze mesocosm experiment the predictions of our model in control conditions could represent a relevant baseline for determining magnitude and statistical significance of the effects in exposed populations and could help to better understand toxicant impacts on stickleback populations indeed the small number of mesocosm replicates combined with the important variability due to the high levels of biological organization efsa 2013 sanderson 2002 have been presented as a major drawback for detecting significant effects of chemicals in mesocosms as it is a source of false negative results i e concluding a chemical has no effect when it really has shaw et al 1994 beaudouin et al 2008 efsa 2013 here we illustrated an application of our deb ibm to mesocosm experiments by integrating effects of hypothetical toxicants having different modes of action galic et al 2017 martin et al 2013 overall a toxicant which would affect the basal mortality as well as the cost of synthesis of a unit of structure would have strong effects on the population structure by comparing the classical methodology to the methodology based on the estimation of the control endpoint distributions we showed that the loecs calculated with the model simulations were lower than the ones calculated using the three replicates of the control this highlights the interest of our approach which could improve environmental risk assessment by decreasing the risk of false negative results when analyzing data from mesocosms indeed using ibms to simulate the endpoint distributions of populations in mesocosms allows to estimate the descriptive variables of the populations i e the shape expectation and variance compared to a simple estimation from the observed data from mesocosms beaudouin et al 2012b furthermore we assumed here only one type of effect by toxicants explaining why the populational effects have been mainly seen with a high stress level fig 5 however toxicants could have multiple impacts i e combined effects on survival and reproduction for example which could increase the populational responses finally although the ecological realism of mesocosm experiments is strongly improved compared to laboratory tests theses aquatic model ecosystems are characterized by a reduction in size and complexity when compared to natural aquatic ecosystems caquet et al 2000 efsa 2013 as they are designed to answer to a specific question consequently other natural processes could occur in natural ecosystems as for example competition between several fish species which does not occur in our mesocosm experiments and thus are not modelled in our ibm 5 conclusions a model which accurately predicts population dynamics over time and takes into account relevant information on the environment is of great interest for ecological management long term decision making and risk assessment here we developed a deb ibm for predicting stickleback population dynamics in mesocosms taking into account the main environmental factors the model was successfully calibrated and the predictions of the population dynamics in control conditions were accurate hence as seen with the case study of hypothetical toxicants the model can help extrapolate from individual mechanistic responses to the population level the deb ibm should then help us to have a closer understanding of toxicant effects on stickleback population dynamics and improve environmental risk assessment by lowering the uncertainty of the toxic thresholds acknowledgments the authors wish to thank g de kermoysan and all the interns y guénand p miguet d georges n

25094,the nakdong river has suffered from hydrological alterations in the river channel and riverine area during the four major rivers restoration project fmrrp as these anthropogenic modifications have induced intensive algal blooms the prediction of algal abundances has become an important issue for securing a source of drinking water and ecosystem stability this study aimed to assess the changed river system in terms of chlorophyll a concentrations using artificial neural network ann models trained for the pre fmrrp period and tested for the post fmrrp period in the middle reaches of such a river reservoir system and identify the descriptors that consistently affect algal dynamics a total of 19 variables representing biweekly water quality and meteo hydrological data over 10 years were used to develop models based on different ann algorithms to identify the major descriptor to the algal dynamics sensitivity analyses were performed the best and most feasible model incorporating five parameters wind velocity conductivity alkalinity total nitrogen and dam discharge based on the topology of a probabilistic neural network with a smoothing parameter of 0 028 showed satisfactory results r 0 752 p 0 01 some mismatches were found in the post fmrrp period which may be due to a discrete event with a newly adapted over wintering species and different causes of the summer growth of cyanobacteria owing to the river alteration based on the lowest sensitivity of dam discharge and the combination results of environmental management with total nitrogen ann modelling indicated that short term water quality variables are persistent factors shaping algal dynamics keywords artificial neural network chlorophyll a sensitivity analysis river modification algal blooms regulated river 1 introduction river damming has modified the characteristics of water body from those of a natural riverine ecosystem to those of a man made lentic ecosystem because these physical alterations have the potential to induce eutrophication or dramatic changes in the hydrology and ecology it is difficult to obtain a precise and detailed prediction of their ecological impact friedl and wüest 2002 physical processes of water transport and mixing not only determine the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients and solids but also regulate the ecological conditions for biological processes rueda et al 2006 in the river reservoir system changes in the water types can alter the pattern of phytoplankton proliferation in a species specific manner for example increased water residence time due to extensive river fragmentation and flow regulation allows some algal species which have the ability to adapt to stagnant conditions to dominate leading to algal blooms tomás et al 2010 algal blooms are a prevalent ecological issue resulting in the deterioration of the water quality and disturbance to the ecosystem hallegraeff 2003 conroy et al 2005 although numerous freshwater phytoplankton genera are capable of forming blooms harmful algal blooms i e cyanobacteria are cumbersome because of their toxicity and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions paerl et al 2001 therefore by monitoring and predicting the dynamics of algal communities it is necessary to understand the impact of fundamental processes including growth characteristics toxicity and the bloom forming response to nutrients light and other environmental conditions as well as the factors affecting the management of algal blooms glibert and burkholder 2006 several studies on the prediction of the growth and abundance of algal communities have illustrated that light and nutrient resources are key factors for determining algal dynamics reynolds 2006 while the relationships between abiotic and biotic factors and algal biomass have been largely discovered the complexity of the inter relationships causes difficulties for identifying the factors responsible for the processes associated with algal structures oh et al 2007 one promising method for understanding complex water quality interactions and evaluating the main contributors to algal dynamics is employing a prediction model because of the strength of their nonlinearity anns have been used to model chla using various types of algorithms such as back propagation probabilistic neural networks pnns and self organizing maps jeong et al 2006 oh et al 2007 liu et al 2015 although anns have a severe limitation as a black box model in terms of providing little explanatory insight into the contribution of the independent parameters in the prediction they are undoubtedly a powerful tool for delineating nonlinearity furthermore several methods e g garson s algorithm sensitivity analysis and a randomization approach have been suggested for interpreting the relative influence of the descriptors and this criticism has been challenged as the inner workings of neural networks have been illuminated olden and jackson 2002 beck 2015 the nakdong river which is the second longest river in south korea is a eutrophic and flow regulated river system the river has been characterized by having two annual algal blooms one in summer season by blue green algae causing harmful toxins and odorous compounds in high temperature water and the other in winter by diatom ha et al 1998 various deterministic models have been developed for predicting the chla concentration and biomass of microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii in the lower nakdong river leading to the successful delineation of the driving factors and behavior of algal blooms jeong et al 2006 kim et al 2007 these studies delineate the relationships between abiotic factors and chla and the blooming species under the ecological conditions of the upstream weirs and estuarine barrages however further assessment of changes in the water type is required because eight weirs were additionally constructed during the implementation of the four major rivers restoration project fmrrp from 2009 to 2011 shin and chung 2011 our hypothesis is that the data pertaining to the abundance of algae in various conditions in the time periods before hydrologic alterations could predict the algal dynamics after the alteration and especially short term water quality variables are likely persistent factors shaping algal dynamics because algae respond rapidly and predictably to wide range of water quality conditions rather than hydrological alteration which occur over a relatively long period of time holling 1973 therefore the specific aims of this study were i to assess the changed river system in terms of algal dynamics using ann models trained for the pre fmrrp period and ii to identify the consistently important descriptors of algal blooms excluding the impact of anthropogenic riverine alterations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site and data acquisition the nakdong river is one of the main river channels in south korea it is located in the southeastern part and is the second longest river in the country with a length of approximately 530 km the study site maegok lies near the middle of the nakdong river and plays a key role in the supply of drinking water to the daegu metropolitan city which has a population of 2 5 million and contains six water purification plants because of the variable rainfall and monsoon climate to protect against flood and drought damage the fmrrp was conducted from november 2009 to november 2011 through this national project the channels of four major rivers were dredged and deepened and 3 multi purpose dams and 16 weirs were built to increase the water storage capacity as a total of eight weirs were newly constructed in the nakdong river this river has been highly regulated by four multi purpose dams at the origin an estuarine barrage at the river mouth and weirs at mean intervals of 29 6 19 4 km our study site is situated above the gangjeong goryeong weir with four weirs located upstream and four weirs downstream fig 1 water samplings were conducted biweekly at a floating dock approximately 20 m off the shore of maegok the site has a continuous mixing regime through the entire water column because of the relatively shallow depth of the site as well as the wind unpublished data samples were collected within 0 5 m of the river surface over 10 years from 2006 to 2015 the water quality data include 13 parameters water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do conductivity co ph turbidity tu transparency tr alkalinity al total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nitrate no phosphate po silicate si and chla concentration the wt and do were measured using a ysi model 58 dissolved oxygen probe and the co was measured using a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi usa the ph tu and tr were measured using an orion model 407 a ionanalyzer orion usa micro100 turbidity meter hf scientific inc usa and a 20 cm diameter secchi disc the al was determined by titrating h2so4 against a water sample for the measurement of nutrients unfiltered water for tn and tp and filtered water for no po and si were analyzed via spectrophotometry the chla concentrations were determined using a shimadzu uv 1601 spectrophotometer shimadzu corp japan following a previously published extraction method wetzel and likens 1991 other environmental data were also obtained for the model development the data pertaining to five meteorological parameters sunshine hours radiation wind velocity precipitation and 7 day totaled precipitation were collected from the daegu local meteorological station which is the station nearest to the study site because precipitation was intermittent we added the parameter of 7 day totaled precipitation daily hydrological data of dam and river discharge were supported by the national water resource management information system two hydrological parameters were included dam discharge was represented by the sum of discharge from two major upstream dams andong and imha and river discharge was represented by the discharge from the nearest upstream station waegwan to prepare the dataset with water quality variables we used the values of the seven parameters corresponding to our survey date to test whether the water quality meteorological and hydrological variables differed between the pre and post period fmrrp t test was performed at the 5 level of significance zar 1999 2 2 theoretical background of ann and model selection the ann is a model based on the information processing of synaptic neurons in the human brain it resembles the brain in that knowledge is acquired through a learning process and interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store that knowledge the weights of the network are modified to attain a desired design objective by performing iterative learning processes haykin 1994 the structure of the ann consists of two or more layers composed of processing nodes including input hidden and output layers that are connected by links with varying weights fig 2 to be used as training patterns for neural networks the datasets were transformed for being treated differently by dependent and independent variables as neural networks use the sigmoid function in their development the raw values of dependent variable chla were scaled into a 0 1 interval to standardize the measurement scales of the input descriptors z score normalization i e mean 0 standard deviation 1 was applied olden and jackson 2002 in this study 19 explanatory descriptors and the dependent variable of chla were converted using the above methods table 1 neurosolutions infinity was used to develop the ann model this program provides an efficient approach for selecting a set of input vectors topology and configuration that is otherwise costly and time consuming this program automatically configures the architectures of the anns adds or removes input descriptors optimizes the number of neurons or pnn smoothing parameters or varies hidden layers to determine the optimum forecast model for each dataset to promote the best model the experiment score was evaluated using a pre set formula incorporating the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r to select potential input variables they were automatically scored in a combination of ways i according to the correlation of the input to the desired output and ii according to the performance in a neural network model for the objective of prediction the desired output could be set manually on rows in advance neurodimension inc gainesville fl usa in addition collinearity diagnostics were run to test for possible multicollinearity among the explanatory variables using the durbin watson test as some of descriptors may have been correlated we used the variance inflation factor vif to estimate the model stability values 10 represent highly correlated descriptors ter braak 1986 to identify descriptors common to both pre and post period fmrrp the datasets for training were assigned to the pre fmrrp period and those for testing were assigned to the post fmrrp period of a total of 257 exemplars 105 40 from 2006 to 2009 were repeatedly trained to determine the appropriate weights and develop a reasonable model for predicting chla to provide an unbiased estimation of the predictive success of the network concurrent with optimal training and ensure a feasible model design the rmse was also computed for cross validation accounting for 30 of the exemplars from 2010 to 2012 the network training was set to terminate immediately if the rmse within the training or cross validation datasets fell below 0 01 or began to increase which indicates that the network is over trained to assess the predictive performance of the models we used 20 fold cross validation in this procedure data were segmented into 20 subsamples to apply the leave one out algorithm a single subsample was retained as the validation data to test the model and the remaining 19 subsamples were used as training data the testing process involved applying a trained network with frozen weights to a data subset remaining 30 of exemplars from 2013 to 2015 2 3 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to examine how chla responded to each descriptor to shed light on the inner workings of neural networks a number of methods that can evaluate the influence of the independent variable have been proposed in the ecological literature olden and jackson 2002 gevrey et al 2003 from the results of the relative contribution and or the contribution profile of the input descriptors it is possible to determine the feasibility of neural networks for understanding the causal relationship between the input and output choi and choi 1992 when the weights of the neural network are fixed and one of the input dithers the effect of the input can be revealed at the output neurosolution infinity software shows this corresponding change in output as the percentage effect additionally in this study to delineate the individual contributions of each descriptor and the response of chla the profile method was additionally used we constructed contribution plots with 101 scales from the minimum to the maximum of each input descriptor while the others were blocked at their minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum with the output repeatedly obtained through the execution of ann the relative contributions of each descriptor were expressed by the range values maximum minimum of their contributions 2 4 optimal combination of environmental management scenario analysis is traditionally considered the domain of process based models which execute process equations based on scenario specific parameters and input settings the simulated scenarios affect the output and other input descriptors through the resulting state trajectories because anns are the connection between descriptors and outputs with significantly non linear components they are not appropriate for the indication of mechanistic or causal relationships hornik 1991 cheng et al 2018 nevertheless in this study to provide information for the management of the proliferation of phytoplankton using the developed neural network we observed the response of chla to the orthogonal combinations of two descriptors tn and dam discharge for tn criteria we referred to the suggestion of water quality standard in kim et al 2015 the very good level is below 1 5 mg l 1 the fair level is below 4 0 mg l 1 and the very poor level is above 8 0 mg l 1 dd regimes were created from historical data and by referenced the scenario of river regulation mechanism in jeong et al 2007 being divided into a rainy season june september and non rainy season october may the differences in the chla responses between the combinations were analyzed by kruskal wallis test and a posteriori test all statistical analyses were performed using the software ibm spss 23 zar 1999 ibm inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 limnological features of pre and post period fmrrp there was a drastic change in the physical structure and the hydrology of the nakdong river after the four major rivers restoration project the cross sectional area of the maegok station increased from 1104 2 66 0 m2 to 2006 3 44 4 m2 se and the flow velocity decreased from 0 6 0 1 m s 1 to 0 2 to 0 0 m s 1 se p 0 05 in contrast no meteorological parameter radiation time radiation amount rainfall and accumulated rainfall showed significant difference between the pre and post periods p 0 05 accumulated rainfall values were highest in july with the maximum value of 277 6 mm confirming the temperate monsoon climate of the river contrary to hydrologic changes water quality variables did not show significant differences between the pre and post periods of the project except for turbidity tp and inorganic nutrients in the pre fmrrp period the mean values of tp no si and po were lower than those during the post fmrrp period p 0 05 despite the decrease in tp concentration the river was classified as eutrophic because of the mean value of tp 26 0 μg l 1 while chla did not show a significant difference between the pre and post period fmrrp the mean values of chla slightly increased after showing lower values during the project 3 2 development and selection of ann model the prediction results which were based on the post fmrrp period of january 2013 to december 2015 showed satisfying accuracy in timing but a little underestimated in peak concentration r 0 752 p 0 01 even though the model was trained to fit the pre fmrrp period fig 3 among the total of 51 518 trials with 80 experiments the network based on the pnn topology with a smoothing parameter of 0 028 exhibited the highest score the selected set of inputs comprised five variables wind velocity wv co al tn and dam discharge dd there was no significant collinearity neither among descriptors all values were below 10 nor between each descriptor and output variable there were models that used other descriptors such as wt rd tp and inorganic nutrients with high input scores but they showed worse correspondence between the measured and forecasted chla than the selected model these models including either wt or rd as high scored input needed 16 other descriptors to present their best performance it was possible to develop a model using tp rather than tn with a few other descriptors but the predictability was lower than the one using tn in terms of inorganic nutrients it was also possible to construct an ann model with a few descriptors in this case too the model performance was not as good as that of the selected final model 3 3 sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance and validity of descriptors in the developed models sensitivity analyses were performed according to the results of the sensitivity studies in fig 4 a the importance of the descriptors in recognizing and predicting chla dynamics can be clearly seen wv had the highest impact on the output 27 9 followed by co 27 5 al 18 6 and tn 16 0 and dd was lowest as 10 0 the profile of chla according to the increase of each descriptor provided two elements of information 1 the order of contribution as the variation range and 2 the mode of action fig 4b among the five descriptors co had the greatest effect on chla over the large range followed by al tn and wv dd had the lowest effect on chla variation the contribution plots of co and dd showed higher values of chla at descriptors lower values while that of wv had higher values of chla at its higher values al contributed the greatest at intermediate values and had a greater effect in the range of 56 8 121 2 mg l 1 the influence of tn on chla was observed differently by the values of other descriptors when other descriptors were low at the minimum and 1st quartile levels tn had its greatest impact at high values on the contrary when the other descriptors were at medium and 3rd quartile levels tn had its greatest impact at intermediate values 3 4 response of chlorophyll a according to environmental changes using orthogonal design a latin table of tn at three levels and dd at two regimes was designed and six simulated outputs for these new inputs are listed in table 2 the average change in tn which was sensitive to anthropogenic impacts and could be prevented in practice was empirically changed at three levels 1 5 4 0 and 8 0 mg l 1 in terms of dd with the total amount fixed two flow regimes were defined 15 in rainy season with 15 in non rainy season and 15 in rainy season with 15 in non rainy season at the tn level of very good and fair regardless of flow regimes the chla concentration decreased by 17 6 0 8 17 7 0 7 17 1 1 0 and 17 2 1 0 μg l 1 mean se in addition when dd increased in rainy season and decreased in non rainy season chla showed lower values than in the reverse condition however there is no statistically significant difference with its original condition contrarily an increase in tn up to the very poor level would induce a significant increase of chla for the poor level of tn controlling through dd timing and magnitude did not result in a change in chla 20 5 0 7 mg l 1 vs 20 5 0 7 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 limnological features and the maintenance of chlorophyll a concentration our study aimed to understand the dominant forcing factors in the pre and post period fmrrp in the middle reach of the nakdong river which is used for water supply the results highlighted the importance of persistent descriptors in explaining the phytoplankton biomass despite hydrological alterations descriptors such as dam discharge conductivity alkalinity and wind velocity related to the physical condition of the water column had a higher explanatory power to predict algal dynamics in the river in contrast descriptors such as light sources and water temperature which are essential in the process based models for the estimation of algal dynamics were not incorporated in our model suggesting that a direct relation of the descriptors with chla was not detected in this study an ann has been found to have tremendous potential as a forecasting tool and is faster even with minimal inputs palani et al 2008 thus our modelling approach with ann enables the selection of the most effective descriptors to predict algal dynamics in both pre and post period fmrrp but cannot delineate the direct relationship between descriptors and chla among five nutrient associated factors the developed model only included tn as an explanatory descriptor phosphorus family nutrients were not included in the best performing model because they exhibited a lower score than selected the input descriptors except dd of 49 9 table 1 according to the mean values of the tn tp ratio molar of 123 1 for the nakdong river which were observed at low values 20 1 only eight times throughout the 10 years in the study period phosphorus appears to be the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth downing and mccauley 1992 moreover with newly implemented total maximum daily load and installation of water quality improvement facilities the concentrations of tp and po were significantly decreased shin and chung et al 2011 this suggested either the existence of nonlinear relationships between tn and p limited adapted algae or the necessity for n reduction although p load reduction is the prime strategy to secure water quality n load reduction is also essential for controlling the magnitude and duration of algal blooms xu et al 2010 while the importance of p associated nutrients could be increased in the post period fmrrp availability of n is a key factor for the proliferation and maintenance of cyanobacterial blooms if both pre and post periods of the project are considered 4 2 modelling of chla in post fmrrp period although the ecosystem of the nakdong river has suffered from drastic changes in hydrological factors mainly caused by the fmrrp over two years the ann model yielded accurate results for the test period of post fmrrp considering that these anthropogenic changes to the river occurred abruptly and their consequences were unpredictable the data analysis by ann modelling was successful similarly in the yuqiao reservoir significant changes in the ecosystem due to the natural evolution of the submerged vegetation over decades causes difficulties for the model long term series chla data obtained using anns but the level of precision for the testing data was satisfactory liu et al 2015 compared with other studies involving the prediction of the chla concentration in relatively consistent aquatic environments such as the juam reservoir of korea park et al 2015 baiyangdian lake of china wang et al 2013 and the kielstau catchment of germany wu et al 2014 our model showed a good correspondence this indicated that the patterns of algal communities might not be immediately sensitive to slowly evolving changes in the physical characteristics of the river and be affected after a long period of time friedl and wüest 2002 interestingly the model did predict the first great peak 100 μg l 1 in the test data but did not predict the second smaller peak about 50 μg l 1 and the second and third great peak this may be because the first peak from may 8 2013 represents a similar type of event as the algal growth event in the pre fmrrp period in contrast the discrepancy observed at the second smaller peak and the second great peak of late fall winter season could be a different phenomenon caused by over wintering cyanobacteria aphanizomenon spp yu et al 2014 and ryu et al 2016 reported that aphanizomenon flos aquae abruptly showed development in the fall winter season and had a great tolerance for water temperature in the range of 5 15 in the nakdong river the other underestimated value at the third great peak observed on july 3 2015 can be attributed to a decrease in the dam discharge effect due to the newly constructed upstream weirs the significance of these is that the network has not trained on extensive data with this phenomenon included i e a peak of over wintering cyanobacteria and it would not necessarily then be able to predict a discrete event with a newly adapted species and different causes for the summer growth of cyanobacteria in this study the topology of the pnn for a smoothing factor of 0 028 exhibited the best performance among the nine topologies i e five non temporal networks and four temporal networks the pnn is an ann algorithm that is mainly employed to classify patterns in multidimensional datasets having non linear relationships with the input pattern summation and output layers specht 1990 the algorithm has become an effective tool for solving many problems because of its ease in training and sound statistical foundation strobl et al 2007 however in some studies on forecasting the chla concentration using the pnn topology the precision was lower than that for temporal anns liu et al 2015 two factors that could affect the efficiency of the classification system are the smoothing factor which represents the width of the calculated gaussian curve for each probability density function and the training dataset yu and chen 2007 examined the effect of the smoothing factors and noted that when the value of the factor increases the specificity sensitivities and the overall classification accuracy decrease thus this might be because of the differences in the data allocation and training sequences or the lack of consideration of the optimal smoothing parameter for the combination of input vectors an n day ahead input vector can be used to give any developed model the capability to make short term predictions recknagel et al 1997 with the objective of controlling the algal blooms various time lag effects for the input parameter at the intervals of a day a week or a year on predicting the chla concentration were calculated based on successful ann models yabunaka et al 1997 lee et al 2003 in our study an ann model with 28 d ahead data as the input was selected that is matching the 28 day ahead environmental data to today s dataset is reasonable for forecasting the level of chla in the middle reach of the nakdong river the applicability domain of the ann model would be different between the pre and post period fmrrp ann modelling is a promising and useful tool that optimizes monitoring networks by identifying essential monitoring parameters thereby permitting cost reduction in the pre fmrrp period summer cyanobacterial blooms and winter diatom bloom which would be interpreted as increased chla concentrations could be forecast without monitoring other related variables such as water temperature radiation and p associated nutrient concentrations although there was a lack of fit between the observed and estimated data in the post period fmrrp it is possible to infer new patterns caused by river damming and the factors influencing those events for example the recruitment of aphanizomenon akinetes from the sediments because of dredging of the riverbed allowed them to germinate in the late fall winter season karlsson elfgren and brunberg 2004 kim et al 2005 4 3 sensitivity analyses through sensitivity analyses we would know the effect that each of the descriptors have on the chla concentration this provides feedback regarding which input channels are the most significant allowing the simplification of the interpretation of neural networks by reducing the number of axon pathways olden and jackson 2002 with the automated selection of input parameters wind velocity wv and conductivity co were observed as important descriptors to pattern chla dynamics co was selected as the most influential descriptors and may be selected to reflect the water mass characteristics it has been an essential descriptor in profiling the chemical and physical characteristics through the entire water column with respect to the temperature and depth to represent water mass fluctuations berry et al 2017 in a previous modeling study on the lower nakdong river to optimize the equations enabling the prediction of winter bloom diatoms co was selected as an input parameter with a high frequency kim et al 2007 for the same site recknagel et al 2017 predicted the response of two major blooming species microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii with the co as a flow dependent variable by using inferential models through model ensembles although the middle reach in the nakdong river were less affected by river regulation than the lower region in the pre fmrrp period co seems to be an important descriptor in the prediction of chla both before and after alteration wind induced resuspension and entrainment of algal species would result in the increase of chla which is consistent with the wv sensitivity profile of our network in shallow lakes the stabilization of the retention zone may cause meroplankton to dominate and increase in community size carrick et al 1993 in terms of highly buoyant cyanobacteria increase in wind velocity would decrease their biomass in surface water ha et al 2000 however large colonies of microcystis aeruginosa from 36 to 120 μm seem to have an ability to overcome the entraining forces of turbulence and access the surface region therefore they are mainly concentrated in the surface layer wu and kong 2009 moreover intense mixing with wind induced hydrodynamic disturbance can increase the chance of the aggregation of cyanobacteria wu et al 2013 these positive relationships between wind velocity and algal biomass were well presented in our network which attempted to predict chla in a shallow mixing and frequently bloom forming river according to the contribution plot al has a smaller effect on chla at lower and higher values and a large effect at middle values many studies regarding water quality using multivariate statistics in freshwater ecosystems have suggested that al exhibits seasonality with co interlandi and crockett 2003 singh et al 2004 in this study the highest correlation between al and co r 0 349 with a small variation in the mean of al from pre fmrrp to post fmrrp which indicates that al was an influential descriptor in chla dynamics regardless of the hydrological alteration tn was only one nutrient descriptor in the network and the sensitivity differed in the function of the values other descriptors eutrophication with anthropogenic nutrient inputs to aquatic ecosystems is a major cause of the increase in algal blooms hallegraeff 2003 however in particular phytoplankton nutrient deficiency would be differed depending on river flow when there are the low and intermediate discharge nitrogen is limiting to phytoplankton growth in contrast phytoplankton were nutrient replete in high discharge condition thus the response of chla to tn showed high values at the intermediate values chaffin et al 2014 in both sensitivity results dd had the lowest importance but clearly exhibited the greatest influence at its lower values the increase in river flow with the dam operation has been widely accepted as a target to suppress algal blooms maier et al 2001 2004 salmaso and braioni 2008 similarly with the sensitivity of dd chla had a significantly negative relationship with flow and flood pulses compared with the isolation condition in river floodplain ecosystems palijan 2012 although li et al 2013 asserted that a universal critical velocity for the management of algal communities does not exist the parameter of dd could be an important role in determining the extent and timing of phytoplankton proliferation 4 4 management on algal blooms according to the output of the combinations of environmental control the increase in tn would be greatly associated with the increase in chla from 18 0 to 20 5 mg l 1 and the change in the dam discharge regime would have a small impact on the remediation of chla controlling the nutrient loadings and securing the water quality of rivers may be effective in restoring their former conditions williamson et al 1999 the decline of tn to the level of very good slightly lowered chla which highlights the necessity of the management on n to prevent further increases furthermore in the regulated river system dam should be operated to recover the natural flow regime as well as to secure the water requirement nilsson et al 2005 on this account recknagel et al 2017 asserted that adaptive management of seasonal water release from dams and weirs is necessary to remediate algal blooms but in this study the effect was not significant this result would suggest that i it is only the consequence from the lowest weight of dam discharge in the network and ii alternatives in discharge management are required such as pulsed flow discharge 5 conclusions our modelling approach with ann indicates that the dataset collected during the pre fmrrp period reflects the pattern of chla response for the post fmrrp period which emphasizes that the dominant forcing factors were similar in those periods relative to hydrologic changes occurring on longer time scales although there was a lack of fit between the observed and estimated values in the post period fmrrp this provided an inference for new patterns caused by river damming and the factors influencing those events moreover the sensitivity results clearly delineate the validity of the network and selected components driving the algal dynamics excluding the impact of anthropogenic riverine alterations desirable combinations of tn and dd which would effectively remediate algal blooms are obtained furthermore we observed that the constructed upstream weirs would attenuate the effectiveness of adaptive management on dam discharge therefore for the management or remediation of increasing algal blooms due to river regulations a consistent descriptor of the algal abundance that considers time periods before the hydrological alterations must be formulated acknowledgments this work was supported by the both grants from the basic research nrf 2016r1d1a1b01009492 supported

25094,the nakdong river has suffered from hydrological alterations in the river channel and riverine area during the four major rivers restoration project fmrrp as these anthropogenic modifications have induced intensive algal blooms the prediction of algal abundances has become an important issue for securing a source of drinking water and ecosystem stability this study aimed to assess the changed river system in terms of chlorophyll a concentrations using artificial neural network ann models trained for the pre fmrrp period and tested for the post fmrrp period in the middle reaches of such a river reservoir system and identify the descriptors that consistently affect algal dynamics a total of 19 variables representing biweekly water quality and meteo hydrological data over 10 years were used to develop models based on different ann algorithms to identify the major descriptor to the algal dynamics sensitivity analyses were performed the best and most feasible model incorporating five parameters wind velocity conductivity alkalinity total nitrogen and dam discharge based on the topology of a probabilistic neural network with a smoothing parameter of 0 028 showed satisfactory results r 0 752 p 0 01 some mismatches were found in the post fmrrp period which may be due to a discrete event with a newly adapted over wintering species and different causes of the summer growth of cyanobacteria owing to the river alteration based on the lowest sensitivity of dam discharge and the combination results of environmental management with total nitrogen ann modelling indicated that short term water quality variables are persistent factors shaping algal dynamics keywords artificial neural network chlorophyll a sensitivity analysis river modification algal blooms regulated river 1 introduction river damming has modified the characteristics of water body from those of a natural riverine ecosystem to those of a man made lentic ecosystem because these physical alterations have the potential to induce eutrophication or dramatic changes in the hydrology and ecology it is difficult to obtain a precise and detailed prediction of their ecological impact friedl and wüest 2002 physical processes of water transport and mixing not only determine the spatial and temporal distributions of nutrients and solids but also regulate the ecological conditions for biological processes rueda et al 2006 in the river reservoir system changes in the water types can alter the pattern of phytoplankton proliferation in a species specific manner for example increased water residence time due to extensive river fragmentation and flow regulation allows some algal species which have the ability to adapt to stagnant conditions to dominate leading to algal blooms tomás et al 2010 algal blooms are a prevalent ecological issue resulting in the deterioration of the water quality and disturbance to the ecosystem hallegraeff 2003 conroy et al 2005 although numerous freshwater phytoplankton genera are capable of forming blooms harmful algal blooms i e cyanobacteria are cumbersome because of their toxicity and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions paerl et al 2001 therefore by monitoring and predicting the dynamics of algal communities it is necessary to understand the impact of fundamental processes including growth characteristics toxicity and the bloom forming response to nutrients light and other environmental conditions as well as the factors affecting the management of algal blooms glibert and burkholder 2006 several studies on the prediction of the growth and abundance of algal communities have illustrated that light and nutrient resources are key factors for determining algal dynamics reynolds 2006 while the relationships between abiotic and biotic factors and algal biomass have been largely discovered the complexity of the inter relationships causes difficulties for identifying the factors responsible for the processes associated with algal structures oh et al 2007 one promising method for understanding complex water quality interactions and evaluating the main contributors to algal dynamics is employing a prediction model because of the strength of their nonlinearity anns have been used to model chla using various types of algorithms such as back propagation probabilistic neural networks pnns and self organizing maps jeong et al 2006 oh et al 2007 liu et al 2015 although anns have a severe limitation as a black box model in terms of providing little explanatory insight into the contribution of the independent parameters in the prediction they are undoubtedly a powerful tool for delineating nonlinearity furthermore several methods e g garson s algorithm sensitivity analysis and a randomization approach have been suggested for interpreting the relative influence of the descriptors and this criticism has been challenged as the inner workings of neural networks have been illuminated olden and jackson 2002 beck 2015 the nakdong river which is the second longest river in south korea is a eutrophic and flow regulated river system the river has been characterized by having two annual algal blooms one in summer season by blue green algae causing harmful toxins and odorous compounds in high temperature water and the other in winter by diatom ha et al 1998 various deterministic models have been developed for predicting the chla concentration and biomass of microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii in the lower nakdong river leading to the successful delineation of the driving factors and behavior of algal blooms jeong et al 2006 kim et al 2007 these studies delineate the relationships between abiotic factors and chla and the blooming species under the ecological conditions of the upstream weirs and estuarine barrages however further assessment of changes in the water type is required because eight weirs were additionally constructed during the implementation of the four major rivers restoration project fmrrp from 2009 to 2011 shin and chung 2011 our hypothesis is that the data pertaining to the abundance of algae in various conditions in the time periods before hydrologic alterations could predict the algal dynamics after the alteration and especially short term water quality variables are likely persistent factors shaping algal dynamics because algae respond rapidly and predictably to wide range of water quality conditions rather than hydrological alteration which occur over a relatively long period of time holling 1973 therefore the specific aims of this study were i to assess the changed river system in terms of algal dynamics using ann models trained for the pre fmrrp period and ii to identify the consistently important descriptors of algal blooms excluding the impact of anthropogenic riverine alterations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site and data acquisition the nakdong river is one of the main river channels in south korea it is located in the southeastern part and is the second longest river in the country with a length of approximately 530 km the study site maegok lies near the middle of the nakdong river and plays a key role in the supply of drinking water to the daegu metropolitan city which has a population of 2 5 million and contains six water purification plants because of the variable rainfall and monsoon climate to protect against flood and drought damage the fmrrp was conducted from november 2009 to november 2011 through this national project the channels of four major rivers were dredged and deepened and 3 multi purpose dams and 16 weirs were built to increase the water storage capacity as a total of eight weirs were newly constructed in the nakdong river this river has been highly regulated by four multi purpose dams at the origin an estuarine barrage at the river mouth and weirs at mean intervals of 29 6 19 4 km our study site is situated above the gangjeong goryeong weir with four weirs located upstream and four weirs downstream fig 1 water samplings were conducted biweekly at a floating dock approximately 20 m off the shore of maegok the site has a continuous mixing regime through the entire water column because of the relatively shallow depth of the site as well as the wind unpublished data samples were collected within 0 5 m of the river surface over 10 years from 2006 to 2015 the water quality data include 13 parameters water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do conductivity co ph turbidity tu transparency tr alkalinity al total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp nitrate no phosphate po silicate si and chla concentration the wt and do were measured using a ysi model 58 dissolved oxygen probe and the co was measured using a ysi model 30 salinity meter ysi usa the ph tu and tr were measured using an orion model 407 a ionanalyzer orion usa micro100 turbidity meter hf scientific inc usa and a 20 cm diameter secchi disc the al was determined by titrating h2so4 against a water sample for the measurement of nutrients unfiltered water for tn and tp and filtered water for no po and si were analyzed via spectrophotometry the chla concentrations were determined using a shimadzu uv 1601 spectrophotometer shimadzu corp japan following a previously published extraction method wetzel and likens 1991 other environmental data were also obtained for the model development the data pertaining to five meteorological parameters sunshine hours radiation wind velocity precipitation and 7 day totaled precipitation were collected from the daegu local meteorological station which is the station nearest to the study site because precipitation was intermittent we added the parameter of 7 day totaled precipitation daily hydrological data of dam and river discharge were supported by the national water resource management information system two hydrological parameters were included dam discharge was represented by the sum of discharge from two major upstream dams andong and imha and river discharge was represented by the discharge from the nearest upstream station waegwan to prepare the dataset with water quality variables we used the values of the seven parameters corresponding to our survey date to test whether the water quality meteorological and hydrological variables differed between the pre and post period fmrrp t test was performed at the 5 level of significance zar 1999 2 2 theoretical background of ann and model selection the ann is a model based on the information processing of synaptic neurons in the human brain it resembles the brain in that knowledge is acquired through a learning process and interneuron connection strengths known as synaptic weights are used to store that knowledge the weights of the network are modified to attain a desired design objective by performing iterative learning processes haykin 1994 the structure of the ann consists of two or more layers composed of processing nodes including input hidden and output layers that are connected by links with varying weights fig 2 to be used as training patterns for neural networks the datasets were transformed for being treated differently by dependent and independent variables as neural networks use the sigmoid function in their development the raw values of dependent variable chla were scaled into a 0 1 interval to standardize the measurement scales of the input descriptors z score normalization i e mean 0 standard deviation 1 was applied olden and jackson 2002 in this study 19 explanatory descriptors and the dependent variable of chla were converted using the above methods table 1 neurosolutions infinity was used to develop the ann model this program provides an efficient approach for selecting a set of input vectors topology and configuration that is otherwise costly and time consuming this program automatically configures the architectures of the anns adds or removes input descriptors optimizes the number of neurons or pnn smoothing parameters or varies hidden layers to determine the optimum forecast model for each dataset to promote the best model the experiment score was evaluated using a pre set formula incorporating the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r to select potential input variables they were automatically scored in a combination of ways i according to the correlation of the input to the desired output and ii according to the performance in a neural network model for the objective of prediction the desired output could be set manually on rows in advance neurodimension inc gainesville fl usa in addition collinearity diagnostics were run to test for possible multicollinearity among the explanatory variables using the durbin watson test as some of descriptors may have been correlated we used the variance inflation factor vif to estimate the model stability values 10 represent highly correlated descriptors ter braak 1986 to identify descriptors common to both pre and post period fmrrp the datasets for training were assigned to the pre fmrrp period and those for testing were assigned to the post fmrrp period of a total of 257 exemplars 105 40 from 2006 to 2009 were repeatedly trained to determine the appropriate weights and develop a reasonable model for predicting chla to provide an unbiased estimation of the predictive success of the network concurrent with optimal training and ensure a feasible model design the rmse was also computed for cross validation accounting for 30 of the exemplars from 2010 to 2012 the network training was set to terminate immediately if the rmse within the training or cross validation datasets fell below 0 01 or began to increase which indicates that the network is over trained to assess the predictive performance of the models we used 20 fold cross validation in this procedure data were segmented into 20 subsamples to apply the leave one out algorithm a single subsample was retained as the validation data to test the model and the remaining 19 subsamples were used as training data the testing process involved applying a trained network with frozen weights to a data subset remaining 30 of exemplars from 2013 to 2015 2 3 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were performed to examine how chla responded to each descriptor to shed light on the inner workings of neural networks a number of methods that can evaluate the influence of the independent variable have been proposed in the ecological literature olden and jackson 2002 gevrey et al 2003 from the results of the relative contribution and or the contribution profile of the input descriptors it is possible to determine the feasibility of neural networks for understanding the causal relationship between the input and output choi and choi 1992 when the weights of the neural network are fixed and one of the input dithers the effect of the input can be revealed at the output neurosolution infinity software shows this corresponding change in output as the percentage effect additionally in this study to delineate the individual contributions of each descriptor and the response of chla the profile method was additionally used we constructed contribution plots with 101 scales from the minimum to the maximum of each input descriptor while the others were blocked at their minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum with the output repeatedly obtained through the execution of ann the relative contributions of each descriptor were expressed by the range values maximum minimum of their contributions 2 4 optimal combination of environmental management scenario analysis is traditionally considered the domain of process based models which execute process equations based on scenario specific parameters and input settings the simulated scenarios affect the output and other input descriptors through the resulting state trajectories because anns are the connection between descriptors and outputs with significantly non linear components they are not appropriate for the indication of mechanistic or causal relationships hornik 1991 cheng et al 2018 nevertheless in this study to provide information for the management of the proliferation of phytoplankton using the developed neural network we observed the response of chla to the orthogonal combinations of two descriptors tn and dam discharge for tn criteria we referred to the suggestion of water quality standard in kim et al 2015 the very good level is below 1 5 mg l 1 the fair level is below 4 0 mg l 1 and the very poor level is above 8 0 mg l 1 dd regimes were created from historical data and by referenced the scenario of river regulation mechanism in jeong et al 2007 being divided into a rainy season june september and non rainy season october may the differences in the chla responses between the combinations were analyzed by kruskal wallis test and a posteriori test all statistical analyses were performed using the software ibm spss 23 zar 1999 ibm inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 limnological features of pre and post period fmrrp there was a drastic change in the physical structure and the hydrology of the nakdong river after the four major rivers restoration project the cross sectional area of the maegok station increased from 1104 2 66 0 m2 to 2006 3 44 4 m2 se and the flow velocity decreased from 0 6 0 1 m s 1 to 0 2 to 0 0 m s 1 se p 0 05 in contrast no meteorological parameter radiation time radiation amount rainfall and accumulated rainfall showed significant difference between the pre and post periods p 0 05 accumulated rainfall values were highest in july with the maximum value of 277 6 mm confirming the temperate monsoon climate of the river contrary to hydrologic changes water quality variables did not show significant differences between the pre and post periods of the project except for turbidity tp and inorganic nutrients in the pre fmrrp period the mean values of tp no si and po were lower than those during the post fmrrp period p 0 05 despite the decrease in tp concentration the river was classified as eutrophic because of the mean value of tp 26 0 μg l 1 while chla did not show a significant difference between the pre and post period fmrrp the mean values of chla slightly increased after showing lower values during the project 3 2 development and selection of ann model the prediction results which were based on the post fmrrp period of january 2013 to december 2015 showed satisfying accuracy in timing but a little underestimated in peak concentration r 0 752 p 0 01 even though the model was trained to fit the pre fmrrp period fig 3 among the total of 51 518 trials with 80 experiments the network based on the pnn topology with a smoothing parameter of 0 028 exhibited the highest score the selected set of inputs comprised five variables wind velocity wv co al tn and dam discharge dd there was no significant collinearity neither among descriptors all values were below 10 nor between each descriptor and output variable there were models that used other descriptors such as wt rd tp and inorganic nutrients with high input scores but they showed worse correspondence between the measured and forecasted chla than the selected model these models including either wt or rd as high scored input needed 16 other descriptors to present their best performance it was possible to develop a model using tp rather than tn with a few other descriptors but the predictability was lower than the one using tn in terms of inorganic nutrients it was also possible to construct an ann model with a few descriptors in this case too the model performance was not as good as that of the selected final model 3 3 sensitivity analyses to assess the relative importance and validity of descriptors in the developed models sensitivity analyses were performed according to the results of the sensitivity studies in fig 4 a the importance of the descriptors in recognizing and predicting chla dynamics can be clearly seen wv had the highest impact on the output 27 9 followed by co 27 5 al 18 6 and tn 16 0 and dd was lowest as 10 0 the profile of chla according to the increase of each descriptor provided two elements of information 1 the order of contribution as the variation range and 2 the mode of action fig 4b among the five descriptors co had the greatest effect on chla over the large range followed by al tn and wv dd had the lowest effect on chla variation the contribution plots of co and dd showed higher values of chla at descriptors lower values while that of wv had higher values of chla at its higher values al contributed the greatest at intermediate values and had a greater effect in the range of 56 8 121 2 mg l 1 the influence of tn on chla was observed differently by the values of other descriptors when other descriptors were low at the minimum and 1st quartile levels tn had its greatest impact at high values on the contrary when the other descriptors were at medium and 3rd quartile levels tn had its greatest impact at intermediate values 3 4 response of chlorophyll a according to environmental changes using orthogonal design a latin table of tn at three levels and dd at two regimes was designed and six simulated outputs for these new inputs are listed in table 2 the average change in tn which was sensitive to anthropogenic impacts and could be prevented in practice was empirically changed at three levels 1 5 4 0 and 8 0 mg l 1 in terms of dd with the total amount fixed two flow regimes were defined 15 in rainy season with 15 in non rainy season and 15 in rainy season with 15 in non rainy season at the tn level of very good and fair regardless of flow regimes the chla concentration decreased by 17 6 0 8 17 7 0 7 17 1 1 0 and 17 2 1 0 μg l 1 mean se in addition when dd increased in rainy season and decreased in non rainy season chla showed lower values than in the reverse condition however there is no statistically significant difference with its original condition contrarily an increase in tn up to the very poor level would induce a significant increase of chla for the poor level of tn controlling through dd timing and magnitude did not result in a change in chla 20 5 0 7 mg l 1 vs 20 5 0 7 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 limnological features and the maintenance of chlorophyll a concentration our study aimed to understand the dominant forcing factors in the pre and post period fmrrp in the middle reach of the nakdong river which is used for water supply the results highlighted the importance of persistent descriptors in explaining the phytoplankton biomass despite hydrological alterations descriptors such as dam discharge conductivity alkalinity and wind velocity related to the physical condition of the water column had a higher explanatory power to predict algal dynamics in the river in contrast descriptors such as light sources and water temperature which are essential in the process based models for the estimation of algal dynamics were not incorporated in our model suggesting that a direct relation of the descriptors with chla was not detected in this study an ann has been found to have tremendous potential as a forecasting tool and is faster even with minimal inputs palani et al 2008 thus our modelling approach with ann enables the selection of the most effective descriptors to predict algal dynamics in both pre and post period fmrrp but cannot delineate the direct relationship between descriptors and chla among five nutrient associated factors the developed model only included tn as an explanatory descriptor phosphorus family nutrients were not included in the best performing model because they exhibited a lower score than selected the input descriptors except dd of 49 9 table 1 according to the mean values of the tn tp ratio molar of 123 1 for the nakdong river which were observed at low values 20 1 only eight times throughout the 10 years in the study period phosphorus appears to be the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth downing and mccauley 1992 moreover with newly implemented total maximum daily load and installation of water quality improvement facilities the concentrations of tp and po were significantly decreased shin and chung et al 2011 this suggested either the existence of nonlinear relationships between tn and p limited adapted algae or the necessity for n reduction although p load reduction is the prime strategy to secure water quality n load reduction is also essential for controlling the magnitude and duration of algal blooms xu et al 2010 while the importance of p associated nutrients could be increased in the post period fmrrp availability of n is a key factor for the proliferation and maintenance of cyanobacterial blooms if both pre and post periods of the project are considered 4 2 modelling of chla in post fmrrp period although the ecosystem of the nakdong river has suffered from drastic changes in hydrological factors mainly caused by the fmrrp over two years the ann model yielded accurate results for the test period of post fmrrp considering that these anthropogenic changes to the river occurred abruptly and their consequences were unpredictable the data analysis by ann modelling was successful similarly in the yuqiao reservoir significant changes in the ecosystem due to the natural evolution of the submerged vegetation over decades causes difficulties for the model long term series chla data obtained using anns but the level of precision for the testing data was satisfactory liu et al 2015 compared with other studies involving the prediction of the chla concentration in relatively consistent aquatic environments such as the juam reservoir of korea park et al 2015 baiyangdian lake of china wang et al 2013 and the kielstau catchment of germany wu et al 2014 our model showed a good correspondence this indicated that the patterns of algal communities might not be immediately sensitive to slowly evolving changes in the physical characteristics of the river and be affected after a long period of time friedl and wüest 2002 interestingly the model did predict the first great peak 100 μg l 1 in the test data but did not predict the second smaller peak about 50 μg l 1 and the second and third great peak this may be because the first peak from may 8 2013 represents a similar type of event as the algal growth event in the pre fmrrp period in contrast the discrepancy observed at the second smaller peak and the second great peak of late fall winter season could be a different phenomenon caused by over wintering cyanobacteria aphanizomenon spp yu et al 2014 and ryu et al 2016 reported that aphanizomenon flos aquae abruptly showed development in the fall winter season and had a great tolerance for water temperature in the range of 5 15 in the nakdong river the other underestimated value at the third great peak observed on july 3 2015 can be attributed to a decrease in the dam discharge effect due to the newly constructed upstream weirs the significance of these is that the network has not trained on extensive data with this phenomenon included i e a peak of over wintering cyanobacteria and it would not necessarily then be able to predict a discrete event with a newly adapted species and different causes for the summer growth of cyanobacteria in this study the topology of the pnn for a smoothing factor of 0 028 exhibited the best performance among the nine topologies i e five non temporal networks and four temporal networks the pnn is an ann algorithm that is mainly employed to classify patterns in multidimensional datasets having non linear relationships with the input pattern summation and output layers specht 1990 the algorithm has become an effective tool for solving many problems because of its ease in training and sound statistical foundation strobl et al 2007 however in some studies on forecasting the chla concentration using the pnn topology the precision was lower than that for temporal anns liu et al 2015 two factors that could affect the efficiency of the classification system are the smoothing factor which represents the width of the calculated gaussian curve for each probability density function and the training dataset yu and chen 2007 examined the effect of the smoothing factors and noted that when the value of the factor increases the specificity sensitivities and the overall classification accuracy decrease thus this might be because of the differences in the data allocation and training sequences or the lack of consideration of the optimal smoothing parameter for the combination of input vectors an n day ahead input vector can be used to give any developed model the capability to make short term predictions recknagel et al 1997 with the objective of controlling the algal blooms various time lag effects for the input parameter at the intervals of a day a week or a year on predicting the chla concentration were calculated based on successful ann models yabunaka et al 1997 lee et al 2003 in our study an ann model with 28 d ahead data as the input was selected that is matching the 28 day ahead environmental data to today s dataset is reasonable for forecasting the level of chla in the middle reach of the nakdong river the applicability domain of the ann model would be different between the pre and post period fmrrp ann modelling is a promising and useful tool that optimizes monitoring networks by identifying essential monitoring parameters thereby permitting cost reduction in the pre fmrrp period summer cyanobacterial blooms and winter diatom bloom which would be interpreted as increased chla concentrations could be forecast without monitoring other related variables such as water temperature radiation and p associated nutrient concentrations although there was a lack of fit between the observed and estimated data in the post period fmrrp it is possible to infer new patterns caused by river damming and the factors influencing those events for example the recruitment of aphanizomenon akinetes from the sediments because of dredging of the riverbed allowed them to germinate in the late fall winter season karlsson elfgren and brunberg 2004 kim et al 2005 4 3 sensitivity analyses through sensitivity analyses we would know the effect that each of the descriptors have on the chla concentration this provides feedback regarding which input channels are the most significant allowing the simplification of the interpretation of neural networks by reducing the number of axon pathways olden and jackson 2002 with the automated selection of input parameters wind velocity wv and conductivity co were observed as important descriptors to pattern chla dynamics co was selected as the most influential descriptors and may be selected to reflect the water mass characteristics it has been an essential descriptor in profiling the chemical and physical characteristics through the entire water column with respect to the temperature and depth to represent water mass fluctuations berry et al 2017 in a previous modeling study on the lower nakdong river to optimize the equations enabling the prediction of winter bloom diatoms co was selected as an input parameter with a high frequency kim et al 2007 for the same site recknagel et al 2017 predicted the response of two major blooming species microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii with the co as a flow dependent variable by using inferential models through model ensembles although the middle reach in the nakdong river were less affected by river regulation than the lower region in the pre fmrrp period co seems to be an important descriptor in the prediction of chla both before and after alteration wind induced resuspension and entrainment of algal species would result in the increase of chla which is consistent with the wv sensitivity profile of our network in shallow lakes the stabilization of the retention zone may cause meroplankton to dominate and increase in community size carrick et al 1993 in terms of highly buoyant cyanobacteria increase in wind velocity would decrease their biomass in surface water ha et al 2000 however large colonies of microcystis aeruginosa from 36 to 120 μm seem to have an ability to overcome the entraining forces of turbulence and access the surface region therefore they are mainly concentrated in the surface layer wu and kong 2009 moreover intense mixing with wind induced hydrodynamic disturbance can increase the chance of the aggregation of cyanobacteria wu et al 2013 these positive relationships between wind velocity and algal biomass were well presented in our network which attempted to predict chla in a shallow mixing and frequently bloom forming river according to the contribution plot al has a smaller effect on chla at lower and higher values and a large effect at middle values many studies regarding water quality using multivariate statistics in freshwater ecosystems have suggested that al exhibits seasonality with co interlandi and crockett 2003 singh et al 2004 in this study the highest correlation between al and co r 0 349 with a small variation in the mean of al from pre fmrrp to post fmrrp which indicates that al was an influential descriptor in chla dynamics regardless of the hydrological alteration tn was only one nutrient descriptor in the network and the sensitivity differed in the function of the values other descriptors eutrophication with anthropogenic nutrient inputs to aquatic ecosystems is a major cause of the increase in algal blooms hallegraeff 2003 however in particular phytoplankton nutrient deficiency would be differed depending on river flow when there are the low and intermediate discharge nitrogen is limiting to phytoplankton growth in contrast phytoplankton were nutrient replete in high discharge condition thus the response of chla to tn showed high values at the intermediate values chaffin et al 2014 in both sensitivity results dd had the lowest importance but clearly exhibited the greatest influence at its lower values the increase in river flow with the dam operation has been widely accepted as a target to suppress algal blooms maier et al 2001 2004 salmaso and braioni 2008 similarly with the sensitivity of dd chla had a significantly negative relationship with flow and flood pulses compared with the isolation condition in river floodplain ecosystems palijan 2012 although li et al 2013 asserted that a universal critical velocity for the management of algal communities does not exist the parameter of dd could be an important role in determining the extent and timing of phytoplankton proliferation 4 4 management on algal blooms according to the output of the combinations of environmental control the increase in tn would be greatly associated with the increase in chla from 18 0 to 20 5 mg l 1 and the change in the dam discharge regime would have a small impact on the remediation of chla controlling the nutrient loadings and securing the water quality of rivers may be effective in restoring their former conditions williamson et al 1999 the decline of tn to the level of very good slightly lowered chla which highlights the necessity of the management on n to prevent further increases furthermore in the regulated river system dam should be operated to recover the natural flow regime as well as to secure the water requirement nilsson et al 2005 on this account recknagel et al 2017 asserted that adaptive management of seasonal water release from dams and weirs is necessary to remediate algal blooms but in this study the effect was not significant this result would suggest that i it is only the consequence from the lowest weight of dam discharge in the network and ii alternatives in discharge management are required such as pulsed flow discharge 5 conclusions our modelling approach with ann indicates that the dataset collected during the pre fmrrp period reflects the pattern of chla response for the post fmrrp period which emphasizes that the dominant forcing factors were similar in those periods relative to hydrologic changes occurring on longer time scales although there was a lack of fit between the observed and estimated values in the post period fmrrp this provided an inference for new patterns caused by river damming and the factors influencing those events moreover the sensitivity results clearly delineate the validity of the network and selected components driving the algal dynamics excluding the impact of anthropogenic riverine alterations desirable combinations of tn and dd which would effectively remediate algal blooms are obtained furthermore we observed that the constructed upstream weirs would attenuate the effectiveness of adaptive management on dam discharge therefore for the management or remediation of increasing algal blooms due to river regulations a consistent descriptor of the algal abundance that considers time periods before the hydrological alterations must be formulated acknowledgments this work was supported by the both grants from the basic research nrf 2016r1d1a1b01009492 supported
