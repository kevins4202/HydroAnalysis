23540,current is a key ocean environmental factor and exhibits strong non stationary random characteristics the complexities of current modeling present significant challenges for deep sea oil exploitation the multiyear return period extreme current model is one of the key factors for the reliable design of marine structures recently due to limitations of design specifications and guidelines improved methods to predict extreme values for the south china sea based on prototype monitoring are required in contrast to the traditional extreme value analytical method the newly developed average conditional exceedance rate acer method is robust and shows good accuracy for estimations of ocean environmental loading the method offers good reliability for short term prototype monitoring data this study performs multiyear return period extreme value prediction of the current profile based on prototype monitoring data collected in the liuhua lh11 1 oil field that was recorded by an in situ monitoring system the 1 year and 10 year return period current velocity design indexes were obtained using the acer method the present current velocity profiles of multi year return periods were compared with two design current load indexes of two floating platforms in liuhua area the consistency with comparison to tlp platform design indexes shows that the acer method provides the accuracy and flexibility of the results needed in the construction of current load models in the south china sea these results could provide the basis and reference for the design of offshore structure keywords south china sea current profile characteristic prototype monitoring acer extreme prediction 1 introduction although the south china sea is rich in oil and gas resources with great exploration value development of the deep water fields is faced with significant challenges and uncertainty due to difficult observation and prediction of main environmental loads like wind wave and current the ocean current has become a major load factor in the structural design of offshore oil and gas exploitation equipment especially for use in deep water regions there are several influences of ocean current on offshore engineering structures first a large drag force will be generated on the structure under the effect of high velocity current causing strong resistance for towing and positioning this can cause the tension in the anchoring and riser system of the platform to exceed acceptable limits second viv vortex induced vibration of pipes will be generated in addition to the interaction of drag force when the ocean current flows through the middle part of the riser this long term viv will bring about fatigue failure to the riser for these reasons a study of the current distribution is critical to solve the load problem in the design of offshore engineering structure in the deep sea many recent studies he et al 2012 liu et al 2002 yang et al 2013 have been performed to analyze ocean currents in the south china sea numerous studies based on meteorological observations and ocean hydrological telemetering have been conducted with a main focus on the description of the regularity of observation results however extensive studies of the loading targeted for engineering applications are still in their preliminary stage in general prediction and analysis of current velocity of multiyear return periods are important to understand current loading for offshore engineering structures to predict potential extreme values extreme value theory and curve fitting methods are usually adopted to determine the long term distribution of offshore loads then an appropriate theoretical frequency curve can be determined by coordinate transformation and then extended to obtain the extreme value for multiyear return periods ma 2006 wang 2005 carollo et al 2005 utilized gev generalized extreme value distribution and gpd generalized pareto distribution to negotiate the vertical structure of current extreme values in the faroe bank channel and compared these methods to the foam forecasting ocean assimilation model numerical model jonathan et al studied multivariate extreme value problems of ocean engineering including ocean current profile and wave height jonathan et al 2010 2012 ewans and jonathan 2014 based on the model of multivariate conditional extreme value proposed by heffernan and tawn 2004 dong 2009 adopted the pearson type ⅲ distribution to calculate the extreme values of wind driven currents at bohai gulf and determined the final extreme value distribution of currents with tide vectors ge et al 2009 used a 3 parameter weibull extreme value distribution based on numerical simulation and data assimilation to calculate the return values of wind waves and current in four representative deep water areas of the south china sea these estimation methods of extreme values are empirical models like experience frequency and pearson type ⅲ methods or models based on extreme value theory like gumbel weibull and the pot model chen 1991 the latter is derived from the extreme value theory with a theoretical basis and is widely used to determine the major distribution form of extreme values of ocean variables and these methods are mostly based on asymptotic theory smith 2002 where extreme value samples are assumed to comply with a particular form of asymptotic distribution however the distribution of samples is hard to predict in advance and the applicability of the above prediction methods should be further improved recently researchers have paid attention to the analysis of the interlayer inherent correlation of current profiles forristall and cooper 1997 lima et al 2009 but due to the difficulties such as modal losses linear assumptions the research achievements are still limited prediction using current profile models by considering inherent correlation is still in the preliminary stage the authors are studying the regularities of current distributions and the interlayer inherent correlation and results from this work will be published in the future to overcome the indicated defects of traditional asymptotic extreme value prediction methods naess and gaidai 2009 proposed a more flexible extreme value analysis method the average conditional exceedance rate acer method which does not depend on traditional asymptotic extreme value theory this method can adopt the forms of asymptotic distribution indirectly and maintain the asymptotic characteristics of the original data samples this increases the accuracy of the prediction and reaches the asymptotic consistency of traditional extreme value theory the acer method was based on the average conditional exceedance rate function or the mean upcrossing rate function in earlier time in 2008 naess and gaidai utilized the mean upcrossing rate function to perform numerical simulation on the extreme value response of the dynamical system through monte carlo simulation with verification of universality and robustness of the method greatly reducing calculation time next they improved the original method using revised are functions to be applicable to a generalized time series and even a non stationary random process naess and gaidai 2009 the random responses of narrow band and dual peak spectra were utilized to carry out numerical verification of the acer method and the results indicated the reliability and accuracy of the acer method naess et al 2007 2010 naess and gaidai 2009 karpa and naess 2013 conducted extreme value predictions of wind speed samples from three observation stations in coastal norway through the acer method and compared the results with results obtained from traditional gumbel and pot methods the comparison showed that the acer method provided better accuracy stability and insensitivity to anomalous points the design of offshore engineering equipment in china has always adopted api and dnv design criteria due to the lack of long time prototype measured data the specification of dnv no 30 5 has been adopted as the design basis of ocean environment loads veritas 2000 ndrc 2004 the specification provides a mechanical description of environmental conditions and environmental loads however the current load was presented as a general formula of drag force unlike the more detailed descriptions of the wind and wave loads thus the current load design basis and computational method has not yet been demonstrated clearly the spatial distributions in existing specifications were obtained from beach and coastal areas due to the lack of applicability for the deep water environment it is insufficient to serve as an actual reference basis to define the current load for offshore engineering design at the same time current load models including international specifications were obtained based on data analysis of other sea regions however the applicability of these models must be verified due to the complexity of the south china sea overall it is essential to study current loads based on prototype data measured in the south china sea to address this need the goal of this study was to investigate current loads at the lh 11 1 sea region based on the prototype monitoring system built by nanhaitiaozhan fps and the acer extreme value analysis method in this paper an acer based extreme value prediction method was applied to predict the extreme current and two design indexes are subsequently verified the achievements of the current model for multiyear return periods can provide significant guidance for load selection and application in offshore engineering design especially in the south china sea 2 prototype monitoring of offshore engineering structure theoretical analysis numerical simulation and model testing are the main research methods applied to the design of offshore equipment structures however integral analysis of the structure of large offshore platform systems containing a variety of complex substructures cannot be conducted with full dependence on the theoretical analysis derivation and calculation the inevitable simplifications of the structure may distort the analysis results numerical simulations include model approximation linearization decoupling calculation and other processes of simplification that can produce large errors model testing is an essential aspect of offshore engineering equipment design but there are limits due to complex real sea conditions limited by the size of the testing pool truncation and scale effects are inevitable in the test designed to overcome the above defects of traditional methods the prototype monitoring method aims to obtain the actual load and structural dynamic response through prototype testing under real sea conditions structural analysis based on data from prototype monitoring should be more reliable unfortunately without enough data from prototype testing only limited specifications and guides could be applied to offshore structural design in the south china sea for example related specifications ndrc 2004 indicate that the following formula can be employed to calculate the gradient of current velocity if there is no available current data for a shallow ocean area water depth less than 150 m 1 v c v t y h 1 7 v w y h where v t is the current velocity of the tide v w is the velocity of the wind driven current y is the depth from the ocean bottom and h is the water depth however the computation of eq 1 is complex especially when it is generally difficult to obtain actual values of v t or v w additionally the formula is only valid for the estimation of currents in shallow water but not the actual current load distribution in deep water or a complex sea region therefore it has become increasingly important to analyze the current model using prototype monitoring 2 1 the prototype monitoring system of the nanhaitiaozhan fps nhtz fps the nhtz fps is a semi submersible drilling platform serving the lh11 1 oil field fig 1 and fig 2 in the south china sea it has a weight of 16735 tons total length of 90 m molded breadth of 75 m molded depth of 40 m and total height of 110 m in this region of the lh11 1 oil field the water depths range from 260 m to 300 m qu et al 2013 a prototype monitoring system has been designed implemented and installed on nhtz fps to measure comprehensive environmental loads and structural dynamic response du et al 2016 wu et al 2013 yuan 2013 prototype data can be used for guidance in structural design safety assessment and platform operation the prototype monitoring system as shown in fig 3 is mainly composed of a power supply system a network system an environmental collection system and a response collection system this system can collect environmental and structural response data using an individual power supply system even under extreme weather like a typhoon in this study long term prototype monitoring data were utilized for ocean current analysis 2 2 overview of prototype monitoring scheme of the ocean current the nhtz fps is located in deep water in the lh 11 1 oilfield and here typhoons and harsh sea states are frequent directly affected by the northeast monsoon and offshore forcing kuroshio intrusion this sea area has strong wind high waves and fast current part of the severest dynamic environment in the south china sea two adcp acoustic doppler current profile current gauges fig 4 are deployed in the prototype monitoring system to measure the full current profile including velocity and direction in the surface and the deep water respectively the current directions are defined clockwise from north the surface current gauge was installed at depths between 15 and 20 m the measuring range was divided into 12 layers along the water depth with an interval of 1 m and a sampling rate of 10 min the deep water current gauge was installed at depths between 20 and 25 m the measuring range water depth about 150 m was divided into 14 layers with an interval of 7 m and a sampling rate of 10 min in this study data measured from jun 3rd 2013 to jul 2nd 2015 were used to generate current profile analysis and predict the extreme values of multiyear return periods based on the acer method fig 5 shows characteristic data of the partial currents in the prototype monitoring procedure 3 multiyear return period values and the acer method 3 1 sea condition in multiyear return period the load condition of extreme offshore environments of a multiyear return period must be seriously considered in the design of an offshore engineering structure various structural failures are easy to trigger in such an extreme environment statistically the multiyear return period value describes the average level of probability that the value can occur during the corresponding return period and the return period is the average time interval in which a certain event occurs repeatedly estimation of the corresponding extreme sea conditions of a return period can be done when the distribution of the extreme values is known assuming that the maximum value of a certain ocean environment factor during one year is x m its distribution function can be represented as f 2 f η p r o b x m η η f x d x p where η is a particular threshold value of the ocean environment factor p is the probability of the event x m η and f x is the probability density function of the distribution f in general the corresponding return period in years of η is defined as 3 t 1 p 1 1 p the extreme value distribution f and the return period t possess the following relationship 4 f η p r o b x m η p 1 1 t where η corresponds to the extreme value level exceeded on the average once every t years 3 2 characteristics and advantages of the acer method the acer method is a recently developed approach to analyze and predict extreme values naess et al 2007 2010 and naess and gaidai 2008 2009 conducted numerical verifications to validate the method for many extreme value responses of dynamic systems the simulation results showed that the acer method can be utilized for more accurate estimation of the extreme value distribution of sample data compared with traditional extreme value methods when combined with the recommended extrapolation algorithm the extrapolated results of the acer method are insensitive to abnormal values and become more robust additionally application of the procedure is simple and user friendly acer is an effective diagnostic tool to evaluate the degree of correlation of time series data by the calculation and analysis of different acer functions without requirements about independent data the acer method possesses universal applicability and can be used for extreme value analysis of time series for multiple random processes the acer method has been extended to practical applications for the prediction of extreme values of ocean environment variables like wind speed karpa and naess 2013 wave heights naess and karpa 2015 and sea water levels in coastal areas skjong et al 2013 the successful applications of the acer method suggest that the use of this system to analyze and predict current extreme values will be of great reference value 3 3 basic principle of the acer method the acer method focuses on the relationship between the average conditional exceedance rate or acer functions of a time series and a given threshold value η in this way the study of extreme value distributions can be skillfully converted into research on acer functions the acer function ε k η is defined as follows naess et al 2010 5 ε k η 1 n k 1 j k n α k j η k 1 2 where n is the total number of samples in a given time series x 1 x 2 x j x n k a constant less than n means that each sample point in the time series is assumed to depend only on the previous k 1 sample points α k j η p r o b x j η x j 1 η x j k 1 η is the conditional probability of the event when the j th sample point x j exceeds the given threshold η while the previous k 1 sample points x j 1 x j k 1 do not exceed this threshold the event can be called a conditional exceedance event then j k n α k j η represents the mathematical expectation of the frequency of occurrence of the event i e the expectation of conditional exceedances in general ε k η n k 1 equals the average number of conditional exceedances as described by naess and gaidai 2009 the acer function and the extreme value distribution f η possess the following relationship derived by the method called cascade of conditioning approximations 6 f η exp n k 1 ε k η η η extreme k k c where η extreme is noted as extreme value k c an appropriate value of k for the kth order cascade of conditioning approximations the right side of equation 6 will converge to the correct extreme value distribution when k n is large enough for the cascade of approximations to have practical significance it should be verified that the property k k c n is indeed satisfied for the data analyzed the appropriate k to choose to account for dependence in the time series will be clearly revealed by the plot of the estimated acer functions that will be presented in section 4 2 1 since the focus is on the extreme levels any function that provides correct estimates of the extreme distribution function at the extreme levels can be used therefore the study of the extreme value distribution can be converted to direct analysis of the tail η η 1 η 1 is the truncation point or the tail marker of the acer functions naess and gaidai 2009 gave the following specific mathematical form for its truncated distribution 7 ε k η q k exp a k η b k c k η η 1 where a k b k c k and q k are constants the current conditions for a multiyear return period can be calculated using the acer functions when the above parameters have been determined the following revised acer functions are adopted in the actual calculation to perform empirical estimation considering a non stationary random process cf karpa and naess 2013 the revised acer function is presented as 8 ε k η j k n e a k j η n k 1 where a k j is the indicator function of conditional exceedance event meaning that a k j 1 when a conditional exceedance event occurs e denotes the expectation operator for more than one sample of time series the empirical estimation is as follows 9 f η exp n k 1 ε ˆ k η ε ˆ k η 1 r r 1 r ε ˆ r η ε ˆ r η 1 n k 1 j k n a k j r η where the total amount of samples is represented as r each sub sample is represented as r a k j r is realizations in each sub sample corresponding to a k j r representing whether the j th point is exceeding the value of a k j r is also obtained as 1 or 0 and ε ˆ k η is the acer function obtained by the empirical estimation after empirical estimation ε ˆ k η needs to be fitted by 7 which can be transformed into a linear regression problem by coordinate transformation to obtain a solution by application of the constrained levenberg marquardt least squares optimization method the main algorithm of the optimization process is as follows the objective function is 10 f o b j a b c q i 1 n w i log ε ˆ k η i log q a η i b c 2 where the weight factor w i w i j 1 n w j and w i log c i η i log c i η i 2 c i and c i correspond to the upper and the lower limits of the confidence interval for ε ˆ k η and they are expressed as follows 11 c i η ε ˆ k η τ s ˆ k η r in which s ˆ k is the standard deviation of ε ˆ k η and τ t 1 1 0 95 2 r 1 is the corresponding quantile of the student s t distribution with r 1 degrees of freedom in case only one realization is available the way to estimate a confidence interval is to assume that the number of conditional exceedances ε k η n k 1 follows the poisson distribution which asymptotically is gaussian distribution therefore an approximate confidence interval of ε ˆ k η and also ε k η can be written as karpa and naess 2013 12 c i η ε ˆ k η 1 ν n k 1 ε ˆ k η where ν is the corresponding quantile of the gaussian distribution then the procedure of the parameter optimizing algorithm can be presented as 13 f o b j a b c q min log q a η i b c 0 i 1 n a b c q s s a b c q ℝ 4 a c q 0 b 0 η 1 the inequality constraint in the above formula is because ε ˆ k r η 1 n k 1 j k n α k j r η is satisfied in the empirical estimation of the acer functions thus ε ˆ k η 1 r r 1 r ε ˆ k r η 1 and log ε ˆ k η i 0 that is the left side of the inequality should be less than or equal to 0 and s is the restricted domain where the four constants a b c q will be determined by the previous discussion we can see that the original time series can be directly analyzed through the acer method in this way the complex process and the problem of insufficient samples due to extraction of extreme value samples from the original for example short term period measured data can be avoided for the non narrow band random process for the actual application empirical estimations should first be conducted on acer functions for different k values by 5 or 9 among these empirical estimations simply select one of them to perform the optimal fitting of the curve 7 the details are discussed in section 4 2 1 then the tail marker η 1 needs to be determined to carry out optimal fitting of the curve to obtain acer functions by combining eq 10 with eq 13 finally the extreme value of multiyear return periods of the ocean current can be deduced using acer functions as shown by eq 6 which describes the relationship of the distribution of extreme values and acer functions moreover an optimal confidence interval will be significant for quantifying the uncertainty on acer function for estimation of the optimal confidence interval the empirical confidence band from measurement data is first reanchored to the fitted optimal curve then the optimal curve fitting procedure is applied to the reanchored confidence band to determine a final optimal confidence interval band the confidence interval of the predicted return value can therefore be obtained from the extrapolated optimal confidence interval band this procedure seems to give confidence intervals that are consistent in length but slightly shifted compared with the results obtained by a non parametric bootstrapping method karpa and naess 2013 4 profile distribution analysis and prediction of the extreme value of the prototype monitoring current 4 1 distribution of current profile the prototype monitoring system of nhtz fps acquires the long term current profile data by adcp gauges for the lh11 1 sea area here current profile data measured in the deep water were selected for analysis and prediction of the extreme value to avoid the effects of waves on surface current in general the analysis of extreme values of wind current and other factors ignore the effect of direction for example current direction is neglected when analyzing the reliable design of a riser such as viv similarly current direction is not considered in this paper for further research in the future related published work e g robinson and tawn 1997 jonathan et al 2012 can provide significant support and references fig 6 presents several representative velocity profile distributions from prototype measurements it can be seen that the current velocity profile is complex exhibiting different spatial shapes in different periods the trend is not obvious at times although the upper current velocity is larger than the lower one in most cases it should be noted that the current velocity of the middle depth profile 8 10 layers 86 100 m is obviously lower than that of the upper and bottom layers fig 6 c during some periods of our observation in this case the current velocity profile decreases initially and then increases with increased water depth with a long duration fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the mean value of each layer of the velocity profile two vertical axes of coordinates are used to show the current layer of the mean profile with its corresponding depth the 95 confidence interval is obtained by a nonparametric bootstrap method with a sample size of 10000 assuming that the mean value follows the normal distribution the estimated confidence interval can be expressed by the following formula 14 c i m e a n v ˆ m 1 96 s m v ˆ m 1 96 s m where v ˆ m denotes the estimated mean velocity and s m denotes the standard deviation of the mean velocity as shown in fig 7 the mean profile and attached 95 confidence interval are marked with solid and dashed lines respectively similarly the small current velocity distribution behavior can also be detected in some parts of the middle lower layers marks indicated with red dashed lines the overall spatial distribution of the mean velocity value displays a shear flow characteristic the mean values of the upper and lower layers changed slightly with depth the mean velocity value of middle layer changed obviously with increased depth and a large gradient 4 2 prediction of the extreme value of current profile based on the acer method 4 2 1 empirical estimates of acer functions for different water depths similar to kth order markov approximation the k value at each sample point is assumed to rely only on the previous k 1 sample points hence the determination of the k value in the acer function depends on the inherent dependence of sample points in the original time series the dependence can be clearly revealed by the plot of the estimated acer functions taking the first layer of current data as an example the plot of the empirically estimated acer functions for k from 1 to 10 is presented in fig 8 in order to facilitate the observation fig 8 has been split into two subgraphs fig 8a aims to demonstrate the difference of the acer functions fig 8b focuses on the zoom effects with η 0 8 to explore the convergence of the tail acer functions the different values of k corresponding to different acer functions represents the kth order extreme value distribution approximation in eq 6 the k value should be increased until the acer functions have converged at least in the tail as indicated in section 3 3 the right side of eq 6 will converge to the extreme value distribution when k n is large enough for our data there is a clear indication that the acer functions show asymptotic convergence in the tail in this case with k k c as an example the sample points can be assumed to be conditional on the previous k 1 sample points in extreme value analysis in other words the sample data used in the traditional pot method can be regarded as statistically independent when the sampling interval is more than k c on the other hand the acer method does not require independent data that is all the data are processed and there is no need for initial declustering of the data the acer function of k k c which extract the extreme value samples inherent is enough and appropriate for further extreme analysis therefore consistent extreme value analysis can be performed if the selected acer function satisfy the asymptotic convergence condition the acer functions plot can help to reveal the dependence structure of the current velocity in the time domain and can be regarded as a diagnostic tool to determine the value of k for consistent extreme value estimation as shown in fig 8 acer functions can be regarded as showing asymptotic convergence in the tail at least when k 6 the corresponding time interval t k δ t 6 10 min 1 h with a sampling interval δ t 10 min thus the time series of current velocity show significant dependence of the 6 sample points in a 1 h increment when the sampling time interval exceeds 1 h the sample data for the extreme value analysis can be considered independent here the empirically estimated acer function as shown in fig 9 of k 8 is selected for the optimal curve fitting analysis 4 2 2 determination of the optimal curve fitting parameters the acer function exhibits a decreasing trend with the increase of η however there will be a spurious peak in the non stationary process when η is small in general acer function focus more on the distribution behavior of the tail so that the peak value should be neglected while selecting the truncated point tail marker i e η 1 on the other hand overly large η 1 will cause insufficient tail data available for subsequent optimal fitting hence we advise that η 1 should be slightly larger than the corresponding value of the peak moreover it has been observed that the predicted return value is not very sensitive to the choice of η 1 naess and gaidai 2009 considering the fewer data points when η is big there may be considerable uncertainty with low data reliability the tail uncertainty δ can be measured by the relative confidence band width naess and gaidai 2009 according to eq 11 or 12 eq 12 is adopted here when only one realization of measured current is available for high levels of η in the tail an approximate 95 confidence interval of ε ˆ k η and also ε k η can be written as 15 c i η ε ˆ k η 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k η then δ can be defined by the relative confidence band width as 16 δ 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k η 0 5 1 quality control of the tail data marked in dashed box of fig 9 can be realized by adjusting δ for δ more than a certain value such as 0 6 corresponding tail data will be filtered out as outliers this processing effects can differ for different data types in the practical work δ provides a limited control effect for the quality of the data under some conditions in the current velocity data process another pre processing was conducted as follows in the tail part of the data before the calculation and processing described above as shown in fig 10 the amount of tail data that should be prepared for pre processing can be identified by the histogram and approximate probability density curve the tail data for which the probability density approaches zero will be removed the one in a thousand upper quantile in the tail was selected as the criterion where the probability density functions of measured current velocity is assumed close to zero because a current velocity exceeding this criterion indicates a rare event in statistics and will be highly uncertain as shown in fig 10 that is 0 97 which is the one in a thousand upper quantile and prototype monitoring data larger than the corresponding value were first removed and then the quality control of the tail data could be realized sequentially by δ once quality control is finished the optimal curve fitting described in eq 13 can work quite well by the levenberg marquardt least squares optimization method combined with the objective function in eq 10 the extreme value of multiyear return periods of the ocean current can be extrapolated based on an assumed tail behavior of the acer function curve obtained from optimal curve fitting 4 2 3 calculation of multi year return period interval and comparisons of environmental design indexes after optimal fitting of the curve extrapolated predictions were conducted by the fitted curve on the recurrence interval of 1 year and 10 year for current profile in the lh11 1 sea area the predictions with corresponding confidence intervals of current velocity for the 1st 7th and 14th layer for the 1 year return period are presented in figs 11 13 the optimal curve and confidence interval band are represented by a solid line and two dashed lines respectively though there are a few points in the tail part whose acer function values are relatively small those points with large uncertainties cannot determine the overall trend of the curve because the weighted least square method was adopted in the optimal fitting in this way we can find that the acer algorithm tries to perform optimal fitting of acer functions using a sufficient amount of data of relatively high precision to obtain reliable results according to the calculation results shown in figs 11 13 the predicted current velocity results of the 1 year return period at the 1st 7th and 14th layer are 1 22 m s 1 1 m s and 0 965 m s respectively prediction results as shown in fig 14 a please see table 1 for the detailed data for multiyear return periods of the overall velocity profile indicates that the extreme value of current velocity under the given return period is similar to the hypothesized situation where the current velocity is close to the shear flow the overall trend of current velocity of the multiyear return period decreases as the depth increases but the distribution curve is partially complex and zigzag as a result when the depth does not change greatly the current velocity in the upper layer may be smaller than that of the lower layer at present there are only a few floating platforms in south china sea the ocean environmental design indexes are different depending on the time of the design even in the same sea area especially for early platform design it is difficult to obtain the accurate ocean environmental design criteria without the effective in situ monitoring data in the south china sea two current design indexes are selected to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the acer method in predicting the multi year return values fig 14b and c give the comparison of current profiles between the predicted results and the design indexes of two floating platforms both in same liuhua sea area among the design indexes fps corresponds to a semisubmersible platform which design in 1980s and tlp corresponds to a new design platform with sufficient ocean observational data observing fig 14b and c please see tables 2 and 3 for detailed data the initial design index for fps exhibited a large span of the velocity in depth the profile of current velocity was simplified to such an extent that the current velocity of the initial design index in deep water was excessively underestimated with a large descending gradient observed in the 50 100 m depth layer for 1 year return values and 65 110m for 10 year return values on the other hand the variation of current velocity in the tlp design index is relatively smooth with depth and is much closer to the predicted results in spite of the fact that both design indexes of the upper layer for the 10 year return period were larger than the predicted values shown in fig 14c the vast majority of the indexes for the tlp were located in the confidence band of predictions in conclusion the difference between the two design indexes indicates that the early research on the extreme environmental conditions of the sea area was indeed not sufficient meanwhile prototype monitoring technology has become an effective technical methodology predicted results via monitoring data and acer show the consistency with the current design index of the tlp platform moreover the present results in this paper reveal a more prominent advantage than the existing research on extreme current in the south china sea firstly the monitoring data is more reliable than the others which were mainly based on the numerical model or approximate estimation by wind field and tide secondly in terms of extreme value prediction method the acer method avoids artificial aspects of data sampling for the extreme value analysis and shows robustness and weak sensitivity to abnormal values with the accumulation of monitoring data the predicted results will continually refine and optimize the current design parameters 5 conclusions profile analysis and prediction of extreme values of currents in the lh11 1 sea area were carried out based on actual data obtained by the prototype monitoring system of the nhtz pfs the main conclusions are presented as follows 1 the measured velocity profile was relatively complex presenting different forms and spatial shapes in different time periods with the main space shapes of shear flow the current velocity in the middle layer was obviously less than that of other layers during some specific time periods 2 for the mean current velocity profile affected by small flow velocity of the middle layer as described above it s difficult especially in the middle lower layer to produce a complete shape of shear flow and the middle layer showed an obvious trend of changes where the current velocity decreased with depth with a large gradient 3 the current velocity extreme profile in multiyear return periods was predicted with the acer method the results for one year and decade return periods were obtained to some extent the spatial shapes were more or less similar for the extreme velocity profile and the mean profile overall the upper current was stronger than the lower one with partially tortuous profile shapes 4 the comparison of predicted results with two design indexes showed that the current velocity determined by the existing design indexes of fps has a large span of value varying with depth the design index for fps should be updated for practical engineering application the design index for tlp is consistent with the predicted results by the acer method the main purpose of this paper was to perform design verification in the lh11 1 area of the south china sea and aimed to provide beneficial guidance for load analysis structural design and production operation based on the prototype measured data to do this a few typical space shapes and characteristics of the measured current profile were first analyzed then a more accurate estimate for extreme current has been tried using the latest acer extreme value analysis method however this present research is only a preliminary application of the measured data and more extensive research and analysis approaches are still required for example the current univariate acer method like the other univariate extreme value methods does not consider correlation between current layers and how to consider the relevance of layered current to optimize existing results will be an important focus of future research in recent studies some scholars have first applied a reduced dimensions method such as empirical orthogonal function to compress the data and reduce the variables before further analysis in a future study such kind of approaches will be incorporated with a multivariate extreme value methododology for an optimal design current profile of the south china sea simultaneously a directional consideration will be introduced to determine the extreme characteristics of the current finally combining spatial correlation and direction considerations we hope to provide a current design criterion that is a fully three dimensional design surface rather than only the 2d profile generated by most research efforts thus all the current extremal characteristics will be presented in 3d space at present part of the periodic work has been completed and more results and details will be presented in future work overall all the

23540,current is a key ocean environmental factor and exhibits strong non stationary random characteristics the complexities of current modeling present significant challenges for deep sea oil exploitation the multiyear return period extreme current model is one of the key factors for the reliable design of marine structures recently due to limitations of design specifications and guidelines improved methods to predict extreme values for the south china sea based on prototype monitoring are required in contrast to the traditional extreme value analytical method the newly developed average conditional exceedance rate acer method is robust and shows good accuracy for estimations of ocean environmental loading the method offers good reliability for short term prototype monitoring data this study performs multiyear return period extreme value prediction of the current profile based on prototype monitoring data collected in the liuhua lh11 1 oil field that was recorded by an in situ monitoring system the 1 year and 10 year return period current velocity design indexes were obtained using the acer method the present current velocity profiles of multi year return periods were compared with two design current load indexes of two floating platforms in liuhua area the consistency with comparison to tlp platform design indexes shows that the acer method provides the accuracy and flexibility of the results needed in the construction of current load models in the south china sea these results could provide the basis and reference for the design of offshore structure keywords south china sea current profile characteristic prototype monitoring acer extreme prediction 1 introduction although the south china sea is rich in oil and gas resources with great exploration value development of the deep water fields is faced with significant challenges and uncertainty due to difficult observation and prediction of main environmental loads like wind wave and current the ocean current has become a major load factor in the structural design of offshore oil and gas exploitation equipment especially for use in deep water regions there are several influences of ocean current on offshore engineering structures first a large drag force will be generated on the structure under the effect of high velocity current causing strong resistance for towing and positioning this can cause the tension in the anchoring and riser system of the platform to exceed acceptable limits second viv vortex induced vibration of pipes will be generated in addition to the interaction of drag force when the ocean current flows through the middle part of the riser this long term viv will bring about fatigue failure to the riser for these reasons a study of the current distribution is critical to solve the load problem in the design of offshore engineering structure in the deep sea many recent studies he et al 2012 liu et al 2002 yang et al 2013 have been performed to analyze ocean currents in the south china sea numerous studies based on meteorological observations and ocean hydrological telemetering have been conducted with a main focus on the description of the regularity of observation results however extensive studies of the loading targeted for engineering applications are still in their preliminary stage in general prediction and analysis of current velocity of multiyear return periods are important to understand current loading for offshore engineering structures to predict potential extreme values extreme value theory and curve fitting methods are usually adopted to determine the long term distribution of offshore loads then an appropriate theoretical frequency curve can be determined by coordinate transformation and then extended to obtain the extreme value for multiyear return periods ma 2006 wang 2005 carollo et al 2005 utilized gev generalized extreme value distribution and gpd generalized pareto distribution to negotiate the vertical structure of current extreme values in the faroe bank channel and compared these methods to the foam forecasting ocean assimilation model numerical model jonathan et al studied multivariate extreme value problems of ocean engineering including ocean current profile and wave height jonathan et al 2010 2012 ewans and jonathan 2014 based on the model of multivariate conditional extreme value proposed by heffernan and tawn 2004 dong 2009 adopted the pearson type ⅲ distribution to calculate the extreme values of wind driven currents at bohai gulf and determined the final extreme value distribution of currents with tide vectors ge et al 2009 used a 3 parameter weibull extreme value distribution based on numerical simulation and data assimilation to calculate the return values of wind waves and current in four representative deep water areas of the south china sea these estimation methods of extreme values are empirical models like experience frequency and pearson type ⅲ methods or models based on extreme value theory like gumbel weibull and the pot model chen 1991 the latter is derived from the extreme value theory with a theoretical basis and is widely used to determine the major distribution form of extreme values of ocean variables and these methods are mostly based on asymptotic theory smith 2002 where extreme value samples are assumed to comply with a particular form of asymptotic distribution however the distribution of samples is hard to predict in advance and the applicability of the above prediction methods should be further improved recently researchers have paid attention to the analysis of the interlayer inherent correlation of current profiles forristall and cooper 1997 lima et al 2009 but due to the difficulties such as modal losses linear assumptions the research achievements are still limited prediction using current profile models by considering inherent correlation is still in the preliminary stage the authors are studying the regularities of current distributions and the interlayer inherent correlation and results from this work will be published in the future to overcome the indicated defects of traditional asymptotic extreme value prediction methods naess and gaidai 2009 proposed a more flexible extreme value analysis method the average conditional exceedance rate acer method which does not depend on traditional asymptotic extreme value theory this method can adopt the forms of asymptotic distribution indirectly and maintain the asymptotic characteristics of the original data samples this increases the accuracy of the prediction and reaches the asymptotic consistency of traditional extreme value theory the acer method was based on the average conditional exceedance rate function or the mean upcrossing rate function in earlier time in 2008 naess and gaidai utilized the mean upcrossing rate function to perform numerical simulation on the extreme value response of the dynamical system through monte carlo simulation with verification of universality and robustness of the method greatly reducing calculation time next they improved the original method using revised are functions to be applicable to a generalized time series and even a non stationary random process naess and gaidai 2009 the random responses of narrow band and dual peak spectra were utilized to carry out numerical verification of the acer method and the results indicated the reliability and accuracy of the acer method naess et al 2007 2010 naess and gaidai 2009 karpa and naess 2013 conducted extreme value predictions of wind speed samples from three observation stations in coastal norway through the acer method and compared the results with results obtained from traditional gumbel and pot methods the comparison showed that the acer method provided better accuracy stability and insensitivity to anomalous points the design of offshore engineering equipment in china has always adopted api and dnv design criteria due to the lack of long time prototype measured data the specification of dnv no 30 5 has been adopted as the design basis of ocean environment loads veritas 2000 ndrc 2004 the specification provides a mechanical description of environmental conditions and environmental loads however the current load was presented as a general formula of drag force unlike the more detailed descriptions of the wind and wave loads thus the current load design basis and computational method has not yet been demonstrated clearly the spatial distributions in existing specifications were obtained from beach and coastal areas due to the lack of applicability for the deep water environment it is insufficient to serve as an actual reference basis to define the current load for offshore engineering design at the same time current load models including international specifications were obtained based on data analysis of other sea regions however the applicability of these models must be verified due to the complexity of the south china sea overall it is essential to study current loads based on prototype data measured in the south china sea to address this need the goal of this study was to investigate current loads at the lh 11 1 sea region based on the prototype monitoring system built by nanhaitiaozhan fps and the acer extreme value analysis method in this paper an acer based extreme value prediction method was applied to predict the extreme current and two design indexes are subsequently verified the achievements of the current model for multiyear return periods can provide significant guidance for load selection and application in offshore engineering design especially in the south china sea 2 prototype monitoring of offshore engineering structure theoretical analysis numerical simulation and model testing are the main research methods applied to the design of offshore equipment structures however integral analysis of the structure of large offshore platform systems containing a variety of complex substructures cannot be conducted with full dependence on the theoretical analysis derivation and calculation the inevitable simplifications of the structure may distort the analysis results numerical simulations include model approximation linearization decoupling calculation and other processes of simplification that can produce large errors model testing is an essential aspect of offshore engineering equipment design but there are limits due to complex real sea conditions limited by the size of the testing pool truncation and scale effects are inevitable in the test designed to overcome the above defects of traditional methods the prototype monitoring method aims to obtain the actual load and structural dynamic response through prototype testing under real sea conditions structural analysis based on data from prototype monitoring should be more reliable unfortunately without enough data from prototype testing only limited specifications and guides could be applied to offshore structural design in the south china sea for example related specifications ndrc 2004 indicate that the following formula can be employed to calculate the gradient of current velocity if there is no available current data for a shallow ocean area water depth less than 150 m 1 v c v t y h 1 7 v w y h where v t is the current velocity of the tide v w is the velocity of the wind driven current y is the depth from the ocean bottom and h is the water depth however the computation of eq 1 is complex especially when it is generally difficult to obtain actual values of v t or v w additionally the formula is only valid for the estimation of currents in shallow water but not the actual current load distribution in deep water or a complex sea region therefore it has become increasingly important to analyze the current model using prototype monitoring 2 1 the prototype monitoring system of the nanhaitiaozhan fps nhtz fps the nhtz fps is a semi submersible drilling platform serving the lh11 1 oil field fig 1 and fig 2 in the south china sea it has a weight of 16735 tons total length of 90 m molded breadth of 75 m molded depth of 40 m and total height of 110 m in this region of the lh11 1 oil field the water depths range from 260 m to 300 m qu et al 2013 a prototype monitoring system has been designed implemented and installed on nhtz fps to measure comprehensive environmental loads and structural dynamic response du et al 2016 wu et al 2013 yuan 2013 prototype data can be used for guidance in structural design safety assessment and platform operation the prototype monitoring system as shown in fig 3 is mainly composed of a power supply system a network system an environmental collection system and a response collection system this system can collect environmental and structural response data using an individual power supply system even under extreme weather like a typhoon in this study long term prototype monitoring data were utilized for ocean current analysis 2 2 overview of prototype monitoring scheme of the ocean current the nhtz fps is located in deep water in the lh 11 1 oilfield and here typhoons and harsh sea states are frequent directly affected by the northeast monsoon and offshore forcing kuroshio intrusion this sea area has strong wind high waves and fast current part of the severest dynamic environment in the south china sea two adcp acoustic doppler current profile current gauges fig 4 are deployed in the prototype monitoring system to measure the full current profile including velocity and direction in the surface and the deep water respectively the current directions are defined clockwise from north the surface current gauge was installed at depths between 15 and 20 m the measuring range was divided into 12 layers along the water depth with an interval of 1 m and a sampling rate of 10 min the deep water current gauge was installed at depths between 20 and 25 m the measuring range water depth about 150 m was divided into 14 layers with an interval of 7 m and a sampling rate of 10 min in this study data measured from jun 3rd 2013 to jul 2nd 2015 were used to generate current profile analysis and predict the extreme values of multiyear return periods based on the acer method fig 5 shows characteristic data of the partial currents in the prototype monitoring procedure 3 multiyear return period values and the acer method 3 1 sea condition in multiyear return period the load condition of extreme offshore environments of a multiyear return period must be seriously considered in the design of an offshore engineering structure various structural failures are easy to trigger in such an extreme environment statistically the multiyear return period value describes the average level of probability that the value can occur during the corresponding return period and the return period is the average time interval in which a certain event occurs repeatedly estimation of the corresponding extreme sea conditions of a return period can be done when the distribution of the extreme values is known assuming that the maximum value of a certain ocean environment factor during one year is x m its distribution function can be represented as f 2 f η p r o b x m η η f x d x p where η is a particular threshold value of the ocean environment factor p is the probability of the event x m η and f x is the probability density function of the distribution f in general the corresponding return period in years of η is defined as 3 t 1 p 1 1 p the extreme value distribution f and the return period t possess the following relationship 4 f η p r o b x m η p 1 1 t where η corresponds to the extreme value level exceeded on the average once every t years 3 2 characteristics and advantages of the acer method the acer method is a recently developed approach to analyze and predict extreme values naess et al 2007 2010 and naess and gaidai 2008 2009 conducted numerical verifications to validate the method for many extreme value responses of dynamic systems the simulation results showed that the acer method can be utilized for more accurate estimation of the extreme value distribution of sample data compared with traditional extreme value methods when combined with the recommended extrapolation algorithm the extrapolated results of the acer method are insensitive to abnormal values and become more robust additionally application of the procedure is simple and user friendly acer is an effective diagnostic tool to evaluate the degree of correlation of time series data by the calculation and analysis of different acer functions without requirements about independent data the acer method possesses universal applicability and can be used for extreme value analysis of time series for multiple random processes the acer method has been extended to practical applications for the prediction of extreme values of ocean environment variables like wind speed karpa and naess 2013 wave heights naess and karpa 2015 and sea water levels in coastal areas skjong et al 2013 the successful applications of the acer method suggest that the use of this system to analyze and predict current extreme values will be of great reference value 3 3 basic principle of the acer method the acer method focuses on the relationship between the average conditional exceedance rate or acer functions of a time series and a given threshold value η in this way the study of extreme value distributions can be skillfully converted into research on acer functions the acer function ε k η is defined as follows naess et al 2010 5 ε k η 1 n k 1 j k n α k j η k 1 2 where n is the total number of samples in a given time series x 1 x 2 x j x n k a constant less than n means that each sample point in the time series is assumed to depend only on the previous k 1 sample points α k j η p r o b x j η x j 1 η x j k 1 η is the conditional probability of the event when the j th sample point x j exceeds the given threshold η while the previous k 1 sample points x j 1 x j k 1 do not exceed this threshold the event can be called a conditional exceedance event then j k n α k j η represents the mathematical expectation of the frequency of occurrence of the event i e the expectation of conditional exceedances in general ε k η n k 1 equals the average number of conditional exceedances as described by naess and gaidai 2009 the acer function and the extreme value distribution f η possess the following relationship derived by the method called cascade of conditioning approximations 6 f η exp n k 1 ε k η η η extreme k k c where η extreme is noted as extreme value k c an appropriate value of k for the kth order cascade of conditioning approximations the right side of equation 6 will converge to the correct extreme value distribution when k n is large enough for the cascade of approximations to have practical significance it should be verified that the property k k c n is indeed satisfied for the data analyzed the appropriate k to choose to account for dependence in the time series will be clearly revealed by the plot of the estimated acer functions that will be presented in section 4 2 1 since the focus is on the extreme levels any function that provides correct estimates of the extreme distribution function at the extreme levels can be used therefore the study of the extreme value distribution can be converted to direct analysis of the tail η η 1 η 1 is the truncation point or the tail marker of the acer functions naess and gaidai 2009 gave the following specific mathematical form for its truncated distribution 7 ε k η q k exp a k η b k c k η η 1 where a k b k c k and q k are constants the current conditions for a multiyear return period can be calculated using the acer functions when the above parameters have been determined the following revised acer functions are adopted in the actual calculation to perform empirical estimation considering a non stationary random process cf karpa and naess 2013 the revised acer function is presented as 8 ε k η j k n e a k j η n k 1 where a k j is the indicator function of conditional exceedance event meaning that a k j 1 when a conditional exceedance event occurs e denotes the expectation operator for more than one sample of time series the empirical estimation is as follows 9 f η exp n k 1 ε ˆ k η ε ˆ k η 1 r r 1 r ε ˆ r η ε ˆ r η 1 n k 1 j k n a k j r η where the total amount of samples is represented as r each sub sample is represented as r a k j r is realizations in each sub sample corresponding to a k j r representing whether the j th point is exceeding the value of a k j r is also obtained as 1 or 0 and ε ˆ k η is the acer function obtained by the empirical estimation after empirical estimation ε ˆ k η needs to be fitted by 7 which can be transformed into a linear regression problem by coordinate transformation to obtain a solution by application of the constrained levenberg marquardt least squares optimization method the main algorithm of the optimization process is as follows the objective function is 10 f o b j a b c q i 1 n w i log ε ˆ k η i log q a η i b c 2 where the weight factor w i w i j 1 n w j and w i log c i η i log c i η i 2 c i and c i correspond to the upper and the lower limits of the confidence interval for ε ˆ k η and they are expressed as follows 11 c i η ε ˆ k η τ s ˆ k η r in which s ˆ k is the standard deviation of ε ˆ k η and τ t 1 1 0 95 2 r 1 is the corresponding quantile of the student s t distribution with r 1 degrees of freedom in case only one realization is available the way to estimate a confidence interval is to assume that the number of conditional exceedances ε k η n k 1 follows the poisson distribution which asymptotically is gaussian distribution therefore an approximate confidence interval of ε ˆ k η and also ε k η can be written as karpa and naess 2013 12 c i η ε ˆ k η 1 ν n k 1 ε ˆ k η where ν is the corresponding quantile of the gaussian distribution then the procedure of the parameter optimizing algorithm can be presented as 13 f o b j a b c q min log q a η i b c 0 i 1 n a b c q s s a b c q ℝ 4 a c q 0 b 0 η 1 the inequality constraint in the above formula is because ε ˆ k r η 1 n k 1 j k n α k j r η is satisfied in the empirical estimation of the acer functions thus ε ˆ k η 1 r r 1 r ε ˆ k r η 1 and log ε ˆ k η i 0 that is the left side of the inequality should be less than or equal to 0 and s is the restricted domain where the four constants a b c q will be determined by the previous discussion we can see that the original time series can be directly analyzed through the acer method in this way the complex process and the problem of insufficient samples due to extraction of extreme value samples from the original for example short term period measured data can be avoided for the non narrow band random process for the actual application empirical estimations should first be conducted on acer functions for different k values by 5 or 9 among these empirical estimations simply select one of them to perform the optimal fitting of the curve 7 the details are discussed in section 4 2 1 then the tail marker η 1 needs to be determined to carry out optimal fitting of the curve to obtain acer functions by combining eq 10 with eq 13 finally the extreme value of multiyear return periods of the ocean current can be deduced using acer functions as shown by eq 6 which describes the relationship of the distribution of extreme values and acer functions moreover an optimal confidence interval will be significant for quantifying the uncertainty on acer function for estimation of the optimal confidence interval the empirical confidence band from measurement data is first reanchored to the fitted optimal curve then the optimal curve fitting procedure is applied to the reanchored confidence band to determine a final optimal confidence interval band the confidence interval of the predicted return value can therefore be obtained from the extrapolated optimal confidence interval band this procedure seems to give confidence intervals that are consistent in length but slightly shifted compared with the results obtained by a non parametric bootstrapping method karpa and naess 2013 4 profile distribution analysis and prediction of the extreme value of the prototype monitoring current 4 1 distribution of current profile the prototype monitoring system of nhtz fps acquires the long term current profile data by adcp gauges for the lh11 1 sea area here current profile data measured in the deep water were selected for analysis and prediction of the extreme value to avoid the effects of waves on surface current in general the analysis of extreme values of wind current and other factors ignore the effect of direction for example current direction is neglected when analyzing the reliable design of a riser such as viv similarly current direction is not considered in this paper for further research in the future related published work e g robinson and tawn 1997 jonathan et al 2012 can provide significant support and references fig 6 presents several representative velocity profile distributions from prototype measurements it can be seen that the current velocity profile is complex exhibiting different spatial shapes in different periods the trend is not obvious at times although the upper current velocity is larger than the lower one in most cases it should be noted that the current velocity of the middle depth profile 8 10 layers 86 100 m is obviously lower than that of the upper and bottom layers fig 6 c during some periods of our observation in this case the current velocity profile decreases initially and then increases with increased water depth with a long duration fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the mean value of each layer of the velocity profile two vertical axes of coordinates are used to show the current layer of the mean profile with its corresponding depth the 95 confidence interval is obtained by a nonparametric bootstrap method with a sample size of 10000 assuming that the mean value follows the normal distribution the estimated confidence interval can be expressed by the following formula 14 c i m e a n v ˆ m 1 96 s m v ˆ m 1 96 s m where v ˆ m denotes the estimated mean velocity and s m denotes the standard deviation of the mean velocity as shown in fig 7 the mean profile and attached 95 confidence interval are marked with solid and dashed lines respectively similarly the small current velocity distribution behavior can also be detected in some parts of the middle lower layers marks indicated with red dashed lines the overall spatial distribution of the mean velocity value displays a shear flow characteristic the mean values of the upper and lower layers changed slightly with depth the mean velocity value of middle layer changed obviously with increased depth and a large gradient 4 2 prediction of the extreme value of current profile based on the acer method 4 2 1 empirical estimates of acer functions for different water depths similar to kth order markov approximation the k value at each sample point is assumed to rely only on the previous k 1 sample points hence the determination of the k value in the acer function depends on the inherent dependence of sample points in the original time series the dependence can be clearly revealed by the plot of the estimated acer functions taking the first layer of current data as an example the plot of the empirically estimated acer functions for k from 1 to 10 is presented in fig 8 in order to facilitate the observation fig 8 has been split into two subgraphs fig 8a aims to demonstrate the difference of the acer functions fig 8b focuses on the zoom effects with η 0 8 to explore the convergence of the tail acer functions the different values of k corresponding to different acer functions represents the kth order extreme value distribution approximation in eq 6 the k value should be increased until the acer functions have converged at least in the tail as indicated in section 3 3 the right side of eq 6 will converge to the extreme value distribution when k n is large enough for our data there is a clear indication that the acer functions show asymptotic convergence in the tail in this case with k k c as an example the sample points can be assumed to be conditional on the previous k 1 sample points in extreme value analysis in other words the sample data used in the traditional pot method can be regarded as statistically independent when the sampling interval is more than k c on the other hand the acer method does not require independent data that is all the data are processed and there is no need for initial declustering of the data the acer function of k k c which extract the extreme value samples inherent is enough and appropriate for further extreme analysis therefore consistent extreme value analysis can be performed if the selected acer function satisfy the asymptotic convergence condition the acer functions plot can help to reveal the dependence structure of the current velocity in the time domain and can be regarded as a diagnostic tool to determine the value of k for consistent extreme value estimation as shown in fig 8 acer functions can be regarded as showing asymptotic convergence in the tail at least when k 6 the corresponding time interval t k δ t 6 10 min 1 h with a sampling interval δ t 10 min thus the time series of current velocity show significant dependence of the 6 sample points in a 1 h increment when the sampling time interval exceeds 1 h the sample data for the extreme value analysis can be considered independent here the empirically estimated acer function as shown in fig 9 of k 8 is selected for the optimal curve fitting analysis 4 2 2 determination of the optimal curve fitting parameters the acer function exhibits a decreasing trend with the increase of η however there will be a spurious peak in the non stationary process when η is small in general acer function focus more on the distribution behavior of the tail so that the peak value should be neglected while selecting the truncated point tail marker i e η 1 on the other hand overly large η 1 will cause insufficient tail data available for subsequent optimal fitting hence we advise that η 1 should be slightly larger than the corresponding value of the peak moreover it has been observed that the predicted return value is not very sensitive to the choice of η 1 naess and gaidai 2009 considering the fewer data points when η is big there may be considerable uncertainty with low data reliability the tail uncertainty δ can be measured by the relative confidence band width naess and gaidai 2009 according to eq 11 or 12 eq 12 is adopted here when only one realization of measured current is available for high levels of η in the tail an approximate 95 confidence interval of ε ˆ k η and also ε k η can be written as 15 c i η ε ˆ k η 1 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k η then δ can be defined by the relative confidence band width as 16 δ 1 96 n k 1 ε ˆ k η 0 5 1 quality control of the tail data marked in dashed box of fig 9 can be realized by adjusting δ for δ more than a certain value such as 0 6 corresponding tail data will be filtered out as outliers this processing effects can differ for different data types in the practical work δ provides a limited control effect for the quality of the data under some conditions in the current velocity data process another pre processing was conducted as follows in the tail part of the data before the calculation and processing described above as shown in fig 10 the amount of tail data that should be prepared for pre processing can be identified by the histogram and approximate probability density curve the tail data for which the probability density approaches zero will be removed the one in a thousand upper quantile in the tail was selected as the criterion where the probability density functions of measured current velocity is assumed close to zero because a current velocity exceeding this criterion indicates a rare event in statistics and will be highly uncertain as shown in fig 10 that is 0 97 which is the one in a thousand upper quantile and prototype monitoring data larger than the corresponding value were first removed and then the quality control of the tail data could be realized sequentially by δ once quality control is finished the optimal curve fitting described in eq 13 can work quite well by the levenberg marquardt least squares optimization method combined with the objective function in eq 10 the extreme value of multiyear return periods of the ocean current can be extrapolated based on an assumed tail behavior of the acer function curve obtained from optimal curve fitting 4 2 3 calculation of multi year return period interval and comparisons of environmental design indexes after optimal fitting of the curve extrapolated predictions were conducted by the fitted curve on the recurrence interval of 1 year and 10 year for current profile in the lh11 1 sea area the predictions with corresponding confidence intervals of current velocity for the 1st 7th and 14th layer for the 1 year return period are presented in figs 11 13 the optimal curve and confidence interval band are represented by a solid line and two dashed lines respectively though there are a few points in the tail part whose acer function values are relatively small those points with large uncertainties cannot determine the overall trend of the curve because the weighted least square method was adopted in the optimal fitting in this way we can find that the acer algorithm tries to perform optimal fitting of acer functions using a sufficient amount of data of relatively high precision to obtain reliable results according to the calculation results shown in figs 11 13 the predicted current velocity results of the 1 year return period at the 1st 7th and 14th layer are 1 22 m s 1 1 m s and 0 965 m s respectively prediction results as shown in fig 14 a please see table 1 for the detailed data for multiyear return periods of the overall velocity profile indicates that the extreme value of current velocity under the given return period is similar to the hypothesized situation where the current velocity is close to the shear flow the overall trend of current velocity of the multiyear return period decreases as the depth increases but the distribution curve is partially complex and zigzag as a result when the depth does not change greatly the current velocity in the upper layer may be smaller than that of the lower layer at present there are only a few floating platforms in south china sea the ocean environmental design indexes are different depending on the time of the design even in the same sea area especially for early platform design it is difficult to obtain the accurate ocean environmental design criteria without the effective in situ monitoring data in the south china sea two current design indexes are selected to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the acer method in predicting the multi year return values fig 14b and c give the comparison of current profiles between the predicted results and the design indexes of two floating platforms both in same liuhua sea area among the design indexes fps corresponds to a semisubmersible platform which design in 1980s and tlp corresponds to a new design platform with sufficient ocean observational data observing fig 14b and c please see tables 2 and 3 for detailed data the initial design index for fps exhibited a large span of the velocity in depth the profile of current velocity was simplified to such an extent that the current velocity of the initial design index in deep water was excessively underestimated with a large descending gradient observed in the 50 100 m depth layer for 1 year return values and 65 110m for 10 year return values on the other hand the variation of current velocity in the tlp design index is relatively smooth with depth and is much closer to the predicted results in spite of the fact that both design indexes of the upper layer for the 10 year return period were larger than the predicted values shown in fig 14c the vast majority of the indexes for the tlp were located in the confidence band of predictions in conclusion the difference between the two design indexes indicates that the early research on the extreme environmental conditions of the sea area was indeed not sufficient meanwhile prototype monitoring technology has become an effective technical methodology predicted results via monitoring data and acer show the consistency with the current design index of the tlp platform moreover the present results in this paper reveal a more prominent advantage than the existing research on extreme current in the south china sea firstly the monitoring data is more reliable than the others which were mainly based on the numerical model or approximate estimation by wind field and tide secondly in terms of extreme value prediction method the acer method avoids artificial aspects of data sampling for the extreme value analysis and shows robustness and weak sensitivity to abnormal values with the accumulation of monitoring data the predicted results will continually refine and optimize the current design parameters 5 conclusions profile analysis and prediction of extreme values of currents in the lh11 1 sea area were carried out based on actual data obtained by the prototype monitoring system of the nhtz pfs the main conclusions are presented as follows 1 the measured velocity profile was relatively complex presenting different forms and spatial shapes in different time periods with the main space shapes of shear flow the current velocity in the middle layer was obviously less than that of other layers during some specific time periods 2 for the mean current velocity profile affected by small flow velocity of the middle layer as described above it s difficult especially in the middle lower layer to produce a complete shape of shear flow and the middle layer showed an obvious trend of changes where the current velocity decreased with depth with a large gradient 3 the current velocity extreme profile in multiyear return periods was predicted with the acer method the results for one year and decade return periods were obtained to some extent the spatial shapes were more or less similar for the extreme velocity profile and the mean profile overall the upper current was stronger than the lower one with partially tortuous profile shapes 4 the comparison of predicted results with two design indexes showed that the current velocity determined by the existing design indexes of fps has a large span of value varying with depth the design index for fps should be updated for practical engineering application the design index for tlp is consistent with the predicted results by the acer method the main purpose of this paper was to perform design verification in the lh11 1 area of the south china sea and aimed to provide beneficial guidance for load analysis structural design and production operation based on the prototype measured data to do this a few typical space shapes and characteristics of the measured current profile were first analyzed then a more accurate estimate for extreme current has been tried using the latest acer extreme value analysis method however this present research is only a preliminary application of the measured data and more extensive research and analysis approaches are still required for example the current univariate acer method like the other univariate extreme value methods does not consider correlation between current layers and how to consider the relevance of layered current to optimize existing results will be an important focus of future research in recent studies some scholars have first applied a reduced dimensions method such as empirical orthogonal function to compress the data and reduce the variables before further analysis in a future study such kind of approaches will be incorporated with a multivariate extreme value methododology for an optimal design current profile of the south china sea simultaneously a directional consideration will be introduced to determine the extreme characteristics of the current finally combining spatial correlation and direction considerations we hope to provide a current design criterion that is a fully three dimensional design surface rather than only the 2d profile generated by most research efforts thus all the current extremal characteristics will be presented in 3d space at present part of the periodic work has been completed and more results and details will be presented in future work overall all the work aims at improving the problem of insufficient current specifications and the lack of effective reference data for engineering efforts in the south china sea acknowledgements the authors are

23541,the novel testing technique for ship seakeeping behavior which includes conducting large scale model trial in realistic sea waves has been given special attention by naval architects in recent years large scale model measurement provides obvious advantages in the investigation of ship hydrodynamics in many aspects however there still exist some challenges that need addressing to improve this kind of testing technique one of the great challenges is the reproduction of full scale ocean waves when conducting downscaled model experiments in natural sea environment this paper aims to explore the possibility of reproduction of full scale wave states in coastal sea areas criteria such as significant wave height mean period spectral shape and directional spreading are involved in the wave similarity judgment various factors including season climate model scaling coastal space and time are taken into account to determine suitable waves for model measurement the wave selection principle and methodology proposed in this paper are demonstrated through a case study using coastal wave data of the puerto rico virgin islands and the gulf of maine keywords large scale model measurement seakeeping experiment coastal waves ocean wave reproduction model scaling site selection 1 introduction ship seakeeping experiments are conventionally carried out in laboratory wave tanks by using small scale models there however exist some drawbacks with respect to the tank measurement technique for example the waves are not real the model sailing distance is limited and scale effects may not be ignored there is therefore an increasing tendency towards conducting seakeeping measurement in realistic sea states for better understanding of motion and loads responses of hull in short crested ocean waves although full scale trial is the most reliable way to obtain ship responses in ocean waves it is complex expensive and time consuming the full scale trial cannot thus be a general approach for scientific research based on the above conditions large scale models are developed and tested in natural sea environment this testing approach has an intrinsic appeal for its apparent realism and is much cheaper than full scale trials jiao et al 2016a although reynolds scale effects cannot be fully overcome by using large scale models this method still provides unique advantages over tank models and full scale ships in many aspects large scale model testing technique was also highlighted during the 25 27th ittc 2008 2011 and 2014 reports of seakeeping committee to date large scale model measurements have been carried out by some advanced ship research institutions for different proposes which include resistance and propulsion maneuverability and seakeeping parametric roll stability and floodability investigations leguen and frechou 2007 reported a 1 5 scaled 25 m long elastic model of frigate and a series of tests including seakeeping hydroelasticity and roll damping were carried out in the grand towing tank facility of french marine institute to validate numerical results the structure of the large model is similar to that of the prototype when considering the elastic property and vibrational mode characteristics coraddu et al 2013 tested a 7 2 m long large frigate model s asymmetric propeller behavior in a calm volcano lake the model was mainly used to conduct manoeuvrability tests fossati et al 2015 investigated the aerodynamic forces acting on the sail and wave loads acting on the hull structure of a full scale yacht 10 m long when sailing at sea the french navy constructed a 1 12 scaled approximately 20 m long aircraft carrier large scale model to mainly test typical devices such as fin stabilizer and transverse stabilization system onboard the model this paper particularly concentrates on the investigation of large scale model s seakeeping measurement technique currently publications regarding large scale model seakeeping measurement are limited for various reasons however increasing efforts are being devoted towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique in the recent years the pioneering works by grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 introduced the measurement procedures for large scale model seakeeping tests at sea sun et al 2010 established a scheme for remote control and telemetry system for large scale model seakeeping measurements the testing system was initially checked in a river and then sea trials were conducted in coastal waves jiao et al 2016b reviewed the large scale model seakeeping testing techniques developed in china and proposed a large scale segmented model testing scheme for loads and structural responses of a ship in sea waves comparative and benchmarking studies were also undertaken between the results obtained by large scale model trial small scale model tank test and numerical simulation to date the existing research regarding large scale model seakeeping measurement is mainly focusing on testing techniques including experimental setup testing procedure collected data analysis and evaluation although some achievements have been made with respect to large scale model seakeeping technique there still exist challenges in the measurements it is important to ensure that the experimental sea waves are similar to the full scale waves the sea states and weather conditions during field experiments are not controllable thus the desired sea state may be difficult to find therefore the fundamental challenge for large scale model seakeeping measurement is to meet the required sea state which well reproduces full scale waves there is no published paper dealing with this issue yet as far as the authors knowledge is concerned with this in mind this paper is therefore aimed at addressing the wave reproduction and site selection issues this study will also lay a foundation for the subsequent research regarding large scale model measurements the structure of this paper is arranged as follows a brief description of large scale model seakeeping measurements is introduced in section 2 the principle and challenges involved in the selection of wave state for downscaled model seakeeping measurement are proposed in section 3 in sections 4 and 5 the feasibility and methodology of finding suitable waves for large scale model measurement are explored on the basis of the coastal wave data of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine lastly main conclusions and perspectives are summarized in section 6 2 description of large scale model seakeeping test large scale models are usually designed with a length of the order of 10 30 m while the model scale ratio usually lies between 1 25 and 1 5 there are basically two kinds of models in use for large scale model seakeeping measurement the rigid model and the elastic model the former is mainly used for global motion measurement while the later which includes both the segmented model and fully flexible model allows for the measurement of hull structural loads in addition to rigid body motions maron and kapsenberg 2014 fig 1 a and b are examples of a rigid model and a segmented model respectively both of the two illustrative models are of the order of 12 m long and 4 tonnes mass we developed these two large scale models in the year 2014 on behalf of and supported by the chinese navy the corresponding seakeeping measurements were conducted in the autumn of 2014 and 2015 in a nearshore bay of huludao china jiao et al 2016b the self propelled large scale free running model can be powered by diesel engine or electric motor jiao et al 2016c the model s global motion measuring instrumentation similar to that adopted in full scale trials such as global position system inertial navigation system gps ins can be used for large scale model motion measurement the model s motion accelerations and loads are measured by accelerometers and strain gauges respectively pressure sensors can be arranged on hull in alternate wet and dry areas to measure the slamming load during the field experiment propulsion speed and sailing heading of the unmanned large scale model are controlled by radio signal submitted from an auxiliary yacht see fig 2 a meanwhile an in situ directional wave buoy is adopted to measure the short crested sea waves see fig 2 b hirakawa et al 2012 moreover it is recommended to adopt an onboard wave probe at the bow for measurement of incoming wave elevation in real time jiao et al 2017 the wind and current parameters should also be monitored during sea trial measurement since they have certain influence on hydrodynamic performance of ships two anemometers are adopted to measure the winds one is mounted on the top of model to measure the relative speed and direction of the wind field with respect to the advancing model the other is mounted on the in situ environment measuring boat to record the absolute wind speed and direction see fig 3 a for ships with small superstructure the wind effects on ship seakeeping and wave loads performance are usually not considered for ship resistance measurements the wind added resistance should be accurately evaluated by using the measured ship navigational information and the wind data moreover an in situ tachometer is immersed in water at a depth of about 5 10 m to record the speed and direction of ocean current see fig 3 b according to our experience the current speed is usually lower than 0 2 m s in sheltered coastal areas and this is negligible for high speed vessel seakeeping test for low speed vessel tests the model relative sailing speed with respect to a calm water field can also be obtained by using the ship true navigational speed and ocean current speed information the large scale model experimental scheme and testing procedure are displayed in fig 4 it is noted that the experimental sea area should be some distance away from the shore to prevent the effects of wave reflection and shoaling glejin et al 2016 during the seakeeping test three experimental strategies are controlled and monitored wave state model sailing speed and heading angle the model sailing route is designed as shown in the insert of fig 4 to ensure different heading conditions can be attained effectively nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 for the designed route direction 1 corresponds to head sea direction 2 to following sea direction 3 to port quarter direction 4 to starboard bow direction 5 to port beam and direction 6 corresponds to starboard beam as post voyage analysis the wave model motion acceleration and load spectra and their statistics are obtained in a similar way as at full scale processing method lloyd 1989 full scale motions and load responses are then extrapolated by using similitude law time domain processing methods are also applicable especially for strong nonlinear motion loads and slamming event analyses sun et al 2009 moreover playback of video recordings can be viewed and used to identify events such as slamming green water on deck and propeller cavitation 3 challenges in full scale wave reproduction the downscaled model hydrodynamic testing research is guided by the similitude law therefore providing an experimental sea state which well represents full scale waves is the very first and critical effort prior to experimental measurement in the laboratory tank tests expected waves of designated parameters can be conveniently generated by computerized wave makers when it comes to the natural environment the sea waves have a stochastic characteristic which largely depends on space and time therefore a fundamental technique issue is how to reproduce full scale sea state during large scale model test this problem is systematically discussed in this section 3 1 principle of experimental sea state determination according to the knowledge of stochastic theory random waves are described by wave spectrum and its statistical parameters thus four criteria are involved in the similarity analysis of waves between full scale and model scale i spectral shape ii significant wave height iii mean period and iv directional spreading a set of sea states at full scale which are of interest should be determined prior to model design and measurement the wave parameters at full scale are determined as follows the significant wave height h p is first determined according to the ship type dimensions and its operational sea area and then the associated characteristic period t p is usually chosen to be the most probable one for the selected wave height as per a specified wave scatter diagram e g table 1 as is known the similitude criteria involved in ship hydrodynamic experiments are reynolds number re froude number fr strouhal number st and euler number eu during the downscaled model seakeeping measurement the fr and st must be strictly similar to those of the prototype li 2003 thus the expected significant wave height h m and characteristic period t m at model scale are derived by using the froude similitude law which are expressed as follows 1 h m h p λ 2 t m t p λ 3 2 problem statement the similarity in spectral shape between nearshore waves and deep ocean waves has been preliminarily validated by comparing the dimensionless spectral curves in authors previous work jiao et al 2016b however the similarity in wave spectral parameters i e significant wave height mean period and directional spreading has not been investigated or reported so far thus the following discussion attempts to address this issue thoroughly assume that the occurrence probability of a specified full scale wave state described by wave height h p and period t p is p h p t p and the probability of the corresponding model scale sea state derived by eqs 1 2 is p h m t m it is expected that the p h m t m to be a large value of probability for the sake of minimizing waiting time for the expected experimental sea state as aforementioned the t p is usually selected as the most probable one whose probability is p h p t p for the given significant wave height h p in other words both p h p t p and p h m t m are expected to be the largest possibility for the respective wave height in order to investigate the h t joint distribution of open ocean waves the north atlantic sea states are selected as representative for full scale waves in this study the scatter diagram of significant wave height with characteristic period zero crossing period for the north atlantic sea states is shown in table 1 hogben et al 1986 dai et al 2007 the north atlantic sea area is of interest because a sizeable number of navy ships and approximately one third of worldwide merchant ships operate across the north atlantic ocean moreover the coastal areas adopted in section 4 belong to the north atlantic ocean in fig 5 the blue squares denote the weighted mean most probable characteristic periods at different significant wave heights on the basis of data in table 1 it is noted that the weighted mean periods were calculated by considering all the periods and corresponding possibility at each significant wave height a histogram is also displayed to explain the corresponding probability of each significant wave height then both linear function and cubic polynomial are used to fit the h t scatters in fig 5 as can be seen from the fitted results the significant wave height is almost linear with respect to the mean period over the range h 1 3 2 5 m whereas there is a slight declining tendency of the realistic mean period from the linear fitted line in the range of h 1 3 2 5 m when large scale model trials are conducted in the open ocean the model will thus be subjected to a sea state which has the same statistical distribution characteristics as full scale wave state as a matter of fact the extrapolated mean periods are generally much higher than the realistic ones in addition the difference increases dramatically with the increasing scaling factor moreover it is noted that the commonly observed wave height in the open ocean is higher than 2 m thus the extrapolated full scale sea states may be too high for prototype seakeeping investigation according to the above analysis it can be concluded that it is difficult to reproduce the full scale sea states in the open ocean for large scale model measurements therefore this may dictate selecting the testing zone near the shore since the wave heights and periods of coastal waves are generally lower than those in the open seas it is nevertheless worth mentioning that the extrapolated large wave period will lead to a wave encounter frequency that is closer to ship s natural frequency this allows for the scientific investigation on ship responses especially in dangerous conditions e g harmonics or springing responses 3 3 strategies involved in wave reproduction the scaling factor of testing models is also associated with the wave reproduction issue generally a scaling factor of the order of 10 is a typical choice as a compromise between the costs technique feasibility and the requirements for physical simulation too large scaling factor λ will cause difficulty in reproducing the full scale wave state in an ordinary coastal experimental field on the contrary the construction and test conduction costs will be highly increased with the increasing model dimensions i e small λ case besides cost reasons the scaling factor λ should not be too small so as to be able to reproduce high wave states in coastal zones for example for a typical vessel with length of the order of 200 m a model scaling factor λ 5 is a reasonable choice from the aspect of similarity in wave parameters however only low and middle sea states h p 5 m are reproducible since high seas h m 1 m may be difficult to find in coastal areas ship performance in high and extreme sea states are of particular interest especially for naval ships investigation to summarize large scale model testing scheme should be established and optimized by taking into consideration all the mission measurement requirements and technique feasibility during the model design stage the model dimensions and scaling factor which should be determined first are mainly evaluated by the project budget technique feasibility and possibility of full scale wave reproduction the factors involved in experimental wave selection include sea site climate season weather offshore distance and testing time etc the framework of large scale model experimental wave selection is summarized in fig 6 4 case investigation of coastal and offshore waves as concluded from the above analysis it is difficult to reproduce the full scale waves in open sea areas for large scale model measurement the following content is therefore aimed at investigating the feasibility of reproducing full scale sea state in coastal areas fortunately it is preferable to conduct large scale model measurements in coastal and offshore areas due to convenience and crew safety reasons 4 1 study areas and buoys the analysis of coastal wave characteristics needs large amounts of extended periods of wave data observation in this study the open access wave data from the caribbean integrated coastal ocean observing system caricoos and the university of maine ocean observing system umoos is used the caricoos and umoos provide past present and forecasted ocean data sets including wind waves tides ocean color and currents for coastal areas of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine respectively views of the buoy locations for the two cases are displayed in fig 7 a total of 12 wave buoys are adopted in this study three buoys i e pr1 pr2 and vi1 see fig 7 a are adopted in caricoos and nine buoys i e 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 see fig 7 b are adopted in umoos the details of the selected buoys are listed in table 2 the wave data was measured by in situ wave buoys which are anchored by mooring system the statistical datasets in the year 2016 are used as representative for investigation in this study the wave information such as significant wave height wave period spectrum and direction are calculated every 1 h by using the latest 20 min collected buoy data the coastal and offshore wave data are downloaded from website http gyre umeoce maine edu caricoos 4 2 wave data description there are approximately 8760 365 day by 24 h dataset records for each of the yearly buoy measurements the status regarding wave data availability is summarized in table 3 here symbol o denotes available symbol x denotes temporal partially available due to device maintenance reasons n a denotes not available wdir denotes wind direction swh denotes significant wave height dpd denotes dominant wave period peak period apd denotes average wave period zero crossing period mwd denotes mean wave direction mwds denotes mean wave directional spread and spec denotes wave spectra fig 8 illustrates some examples of recorded time domain hourly wave data at 44007 in the year 2016 in fig 8 c the unit of energy density is m2 s and the scale is logarithmic 4 3 wave periods transformation the coastal waves comprise both wind waves and swell waves and their spectral curves are sometimes characterized by multi peaks o reilly et al 2016 therefore the use of mean wave period zero crossing period in the representation of statistical sea states is more reasonable than peak period due to the fact that the caricoos provides only peak period for buoys pr1 pr2 and vi1 the following experiential formula is implemented to obtain the mean period of waves 3 t z t p 1 451 eq 3 was concluded by li 2007a b by comprehensively regressing large amounts of wave data on the basis of jonswap spectra wen s spectra field measurements and laboratory tests where the introduction to jonswap and wen spectra can be found in wen and yu 1984 the coefficient of 1 451 was also noted to be reliable in a wide range of conditions in order to validate eq 3 the average ratio coefficients of peak period to mean period at 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 are calculated by using the known year round 1 h statistical data and the results are listed in table 4 it can be confirmed that the calculated coefficients are on the overall in good agreement with the coefficient 1 451 and within an average error of 1 01 however the period coefficient for 44013 and 44007 are respectively 10 13 and 8 13 larger than the coefficient 1 451 which may be due to the relatively sheltered characteristics of the two area while for other coastal wave sites in relatively open areas the errors are acceptably within 5 thus the use of eq 3 for mean period acquisition is feasible and acceptable for pr1 pr2 and vi1 where the sea areas are relatively open 5 data statistical analyses for experimental wave selection in this section statistical analyses regarding the coastal and offshore wave data from caricoos and umoos are undertaken to explore how to find suitable coastal waves for large scale model seakeeping measurement the demonstration of wave similarity between model and full scales is systematically done by analyzing the influence of season climate scaling factor and sea area on the parameters of coastal waves the recurrence probability of expected coastal wave states is also taken into account to evaluate the experimental waiting time moreover the similarity in spectral characteristics and directional spreading angle between coastal and ocean waves are also discussed 5 1 monthly variation of coastal wave parameters to investigate the variation of wave parameters with respect to coastal location and season monthly averaged statistical significant wave height and mean period are calculated and displayed in fig 9 as seen from the statistical results for coastal waves of puerto rico us virgin islands the wave parameters for pr1 and vi1 fluctuate over the seasons gently due to the tropical rainforest climatic characteristics both significant wave height and mean period for pr2 are obviously higher from october to april and lower from may to september due to the strong cold wind blowing from the northeast see fig 7 a the coastal and offshore waves in the gulf of maine are affected by the temperate continental climatic conditions the significant wave height is generally lower in summer than in other seasons as seen from fig 9 a the highest mean significant wave height generally occurs in january or february while the lowest occurs in july or august in addition the annual variation of significant wave height is particularly more obvious in the relatively open sea sites e g 44008 44011 and 44018 whereas the height of waves in the nearshore sites e g 44013 and 44020 is not so sensitive to the season change on the other hand as seen in fig 9 b the mean period exhibited less variation with the various seasons compared with the significant wave height the mean period in summer is slightly lower than that in winter 5 2 the influence of model scaling factor the statistical significant wave height and mean period represented by h m and t m of coastal and offshore waves in fig 9 are used to extrapolate the full scale sea states the corresponding full scale sea state parameters h p t p with respect to different model scaling factors λ 1 15 are extrapolated by using eqs 1 2 the corresponding realistic mean period t r at full scale wave height h p was subsequently estimated by interpolating the fitted cubic curve for h p 16 5 m or straight line for h p 16 5 m in fig 5 then the difference between extrapolated period t p and realistic period t r is used to evaluate wave similarity which is estimated by the following equation 4 e r r t t p t r t r 100 the estimated errors err t for the different cases and the datum planes err t 0 which are used to aid observation and evaluation are summarized in fig 10 as seen from the results it seems that the pr1 and 44020 are the preferable candidate sites for large scale model seakeeping measurement the reasons can be attributed to the following aspects i relatively small size economic models with large scaling factor λ 6 8 can be used for seakeeping measurement in coastal waves of pr1 and 44020 ii experiments by such models can suitably be conducted in almost all the months regardless of season change iii since the significant wave height fluctuates within a certain range different levels of sea states can be experienced by a model with a specified scaling factor for the other sites i e pr2 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 and 44027 only quite large models with small scaling factor λ 2 4 are suitable to be tested considering the wave similarity aspect for site vi1 suitable wave states are easily found for models with large scaling factor λ 6 8 only in may june and july therefore pr1 and 44020 are the selected sites for experimental investigations as seen from fig 10 a and k the most appropriate model scaling factor in pr1 and 44020 lies in the range λ 6 8 moreover it is seen that the yearly average period errors for model with a scaling of λ 15 are 27 8 and 25 9 for pr1 and 44020 respectively in fact since the realistic period appears within a certain range the expected sea states may also be frequently observed for a 1 15 scaled economic model for instance for a 300 m ship prototype a 1 15 scaled model 20 m long is a sound choice considering economic cost technique feasibility and the wave reproducibility aspects to summarize the coastal areas with relatively lower wave period with an equivalent wave height are best suited for the reproduction of full scale waves using an economic small model moreover the preferable significant wave height for large scale model measurement should be less than 1 m for crew safety 5 3 joint distribution of wave height with period the statistical wave height or period fluctuates around its average value over a certain range this thus provides potential opportunities for the reproduction of ocean waves in a wide range since only monthly averaged wave parameters are considered in the above analysis further analysis regarding the distribution of wave parameters is made in this section fig 11 shows the scatter diagrams of significant wave height versus mean period of the year round 1 h wave data for pr1 pr2 and vi1 note that the mean periods are obtained from peak periods using eq 3 as seen from the scatter plots the periods have a discrete distribution this is because the peak period was extracted from the estimated wave spectrum which is represented by discrete values moreover the waves especially the low waves are associated with broad range of period due to the contribution of swell waves to the total spectra amrutha et al 2017 the occurrence of swell is more frequent at pr2 than at pr1 and vi1 the wave heights at pr1 and vi1 are relatively lower than at pr2 due to the fact that winds are blowing from the northeast all the year round at pr2 fig 12 shows the scatter diagrams of significant wave height versus mean period of the year round 1 h wave data for 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 as seen from these scatter plots the high waves h 1 3 2 m are associated with a narrow range of mean period while low waves h 1 3 2 m are associated with a relatively wider range of mean period this means that the periods at low wave state domain can be reproduced in a wider range than those at high wave state domain the waves at 44020 are obviously lower than the others due to the fact that it is a sheltered area with limited depth and fetch length from figs 11 and 12 an interesting phenomenon was observed that the boundary between the scatters domain and the bottom blank domain can be described by straight line which means that the h t joint distributions have a strong relation the reason can be explained by the fact that the waves will break when exceeding certain steepness yu 2003 the boundary lines are useful information for experimental site selection for comparison the lower wave period boundaries red lines in each of the figures are summarized in fig 13 a as seen in the figure different sea areas have different boundary lines the difference is especially pronounced at significant wave height range h 1 3 2 m at which the model tests are usually conducted therefore the boundary lines can be referred as critical condition of wave state occurrence at each candidate site for example one could judge whether a specified wave condition can be observed or not at a specified site in other words a wave state may occur at some sites while it may never occur at some other sites in addition the boundary lines can generally be classified into three groups by their slopes the first group includes pr1 pr2 and vi1 the second group includes 44007 44013 and 44020 and the third group includes the remaining six buoys the classification also revealed trends in accordance with the buoy locations and their offshore distance and it is found that the slope of boundary lines decreases with the increasing buoy offshore distance for example the offshore distance of pr1 pr2 and vi1 are much shorter than others thus their slopes are relatively larger moreover the line slopes saw a decreasing trend by the following order of buoys 44007 offshore distance 22 km 44013 30 km 44020 30 km 44018 44 km 44017 43 km 44027 37 km 44008 100 km 44005 144 km and 44011 315 km in addition it is noted that there is a common interaction point for all of the boundary lines at about h 1 3 2 6 m and t z 5 4 s the average periods at different wave heights are also calculated and fitted by lines which are displayed using green lines in figs 11 and 12 note that these lines are not derived by fitting the scatters directly since the high density points at low wave height domain would dominate the trend of the line and cause distortion of the line they are however obtained by fitting the average periods in each of the wave height bands with a step of 0 2 m the average period lines are also important information for experimental site selection since they reveal the most probable wave mean period at different significant wave height for a specified site for example after the determination of a range of model testing sea states the testing site can be preselected as per the average period line information to minimize waiting time for the expected experimental sea states see fig 6 the blue box for comparison the average period lines in each of the figures are summarized in fig 13 b as is seen the slopes for pr1 and pr2 are relatively larger than the remaining ones while the slopes of the remaining ones are almost the same even though with different intercepts another interesting phenomenon observed in figs 11 and 12 is that the intersection points of boundary line and mean period line in each of the figures are located at the largest wave height domain except for the cases of pr1 and pr2 5 4 recurrence probability of expected coastal waves to improve experiment operational efficiency the return period of expected coastal waves should also be considered besides the wave parameter similarity issue a comparison of mean periods between waves at model scale λ 1 different scaling extrapolated scaling λ 5 15 and the expected north atlantic sea states are presented in fig 14 for cases pr1 and 44020 in addition bars are also illustrated on the curves to reflect the occurrence probability of corresponding wave height as seen in fig 14 when considering the aspect of wave parameter similarity the most suitable model scaling factor for measurement at pr1 and 44020 is about λ 5 7 however when considering also the recurrence probabilities of experimental waves the problem becomes complex it indicates that full scale waves seem to be reproducible only for a limited range of wave height at a specified scaling factor for example as seen in fig 14 a full scale wave states under 10 m may be well reproduced at scaling factor λ 5 7 full scale wave states over 10 m may be reproduced at λ 10 15 the extrapolated wave periods are generally larger than the expected ones similarly as seen in fig 14 b although both the period and probability coincide well between the expected values and those by λ 6 extrapolated only full scale wave states under 6 m may be reproducible since the sea states at 44020 are generally lower than 1 m full scale wave states over 6 m may be reproduced using λ 10 15 models the extrapolated wave periods are generally larger than the expected ones it should be mentioned that the simplified linear functions are used to match and compare with the targeted real condition cubic polynomial in this study in fact the real problem is more complex fig 15 shows the statistical probability of exceedance of significant wave height on the basis of the year round wave data which will be helpful for the general understanding of wave state information at different buoys as is seen the probability of exceedance for significant wave height 1 m is found to be only about 10 for 44020 the significant wave height is about 1 3 m for pr1 at a same probability of exceedance level of 10 on the other hand large waves h 1 3 2 m are frequently observed at farther offshore areas e g 44005 44008 44011 44017 44018 and 44027 the occurrence probability of large waves h 1 3 2 m is over 20 5 5 analysis of coastal wave spectra in this section the wave spectral characteristics at 44020 are analyzed and discussed for simplification coastal waves in january april july and october are selected as representative of winter spring summer and autumn respectively the contour plots of wave spectral energy density in frequency time domain for different seasons are presented in fig 16 where the unit of energy density is m2 s and the scale is logarithmic moreover the hourly mean periods are also marked in the contour plots using pink cross as observed the mean period is relatively stable and fluctuates gently around 0 3 hz whereas the significant wave height varies over a range of 0 2 m also see figs 9 and 12 h and changes continually for further analysis of the spectral shape the hourly wave frequency spectra on 5 january 2016 are presented in fig 17 as an example as is seen the spectral shape during 1 00 to 12 00 gmt shows good agreement with theoretical spectrum e g ittc issc or jonswap spectra the comparison of dimensionless spectra between the coastal waves during 1 00 to 12 00 and the issc target spectrum are shown in fig 18 in addition the variations of significant wave height and wave periods during the day are shown in fig 19 the spectra decayed from 13 00 to 24 00 as the wave height decreased from 1 5 m to 0 5 m gradually meanwhile double peak spectra are also observed due to the effect of wind direction change the dominant peak frequency was much more stable during 1 00 to 14 00 while it increased slowly from 0 22 hz to 0 28 hz during the following hours 5 6 analysis of directional spreading of coastal waves in this section the wave directional spreading characteristics at pr1 pr2 and vi1 are analyzed and discussed the hourly recording of data of mean wave directional spreading at the buoys in coast of puerto rico us virgin islands are shown in fig 20 in general the hourly mean wave directional spread shows a steady trend that fluctuates gently around the mean value all the year around the statistical parameters of the mean wave directional spread angle for the coastal waves at the different stations are listed in table 5 in addition a commonly used theoretical formula for directional spreading function is expressed as follows issc 1964 yu 2003 5 d ω θ γ n 2 1 π γ n 2 1 2 cos n θ π 2 θ π 2 where γ n denotes gama function the directional spreading functions corresponding to cases of n 1 8 are illustrated in fig 21 the mean wave directional spreading angles calculated for different spreading functions are summarized in table 6 the values are obtained by acquiring the abscissa position of centroid of area below the curve in addition a comparison of the mean wave directional spreading angles between the theoretical and measured values is shown in fig 22 according to the ittc recommendations li 2003 n 2 is widely used to describe the short crested ocean waves acting on ships and offshore structures therefore it turned out that the averaged mean directional spreading angle of coastal waves 31 073 is close to that of deep ocean waves 27 268 6 conclusions and perspectives this paper explores the possibility of ocean wave reproduction in coastal sea areas for large scale model seakeeping measurement the coastal and offshore wave data of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine are used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed methodology the influence of control strategies such as season climate model scaling sea site and offshore distance on the possibility of ocean wave reproduction was comprehensively investigated the proposed methodology for coastal wave and site selection will lay a firm foundation for large scale model seakeeping testing technique with appropriate coastal wave states being observed and experienced by large scale model the full scale ship responses can be extrapolated based on the testing results directly by using the similitude law the case study illustrated in this study leads to the following conclusions 1 relatively small dimension models with large scaling factor λ 5 15 can be used for seakeeping measurement in sheltered nearshore areas e g pr1 and 44020 only quite large models with small scaling factor λ 2 4 can be tested in farther and deeper sea areas e g pr2 44005 and 44007 so as to satisfy the similarity requirement of wave parameters 2 the climate and season change may have great influence on wave parameters therefore for coastal waves of puerto rico us virgin islands large scale model seakeeping measurement should be conducted in months from april to september when using relatively small models large λ case in contrast the most suitable season for model seakeeping measurement may be winter in gulf of maine 3 when considering the recurrence probabilities of experimental waves full scale waves seem to be reproducible only for a limited range of wave height at a specified model scaling factor therefore it is almost impossible to reproduce a comprehensive range wave heights by a specified model scaling in a given coastal sea area 4 the mean period is generally much more stable compared with the significant wave height thus the spectral peak or mean frequency is stable while the spectral power density changes frequently during a day moreover spectra which show good agreement with theoretical spectrum in spectral shape can be frequently observed in coastal areas the mean wave directional spreading of coastal waves is also close to that of deep ocean waves 5 generally the most promising testing sites are pr1 and 44020 among the 12 sites this is because it is easy to reproduce the open ocean waves with relatively large model scaling factor λ 5 15 moreover the extrapolated full scale wave states will lie in 0 15 m which are in accordance with the scientific research range although this paper provides the possibility of ocean wave reproduction for large scale model measurement there still exist waiting time and recurrence probability issues due to the uncertainty and uncontrollability of the natural ocean environment in order to overcome these limitations we are devoted to developing a numerical extrapolation technique which will allow the prediction of full scale ship responses on the basis of large scale model measured data under any given dissimilar wave state a system identification based algorithm is being developed the ship intrinsic time domain response function will be numerically identified by large scale model measured data in a given experimental wave condition and then be used to extrapolate ship responses under other expected wave conditions performing large scale model tests in natural environment is an increasing trend for the future development of ship hydrodynamics experimental investigation there is still a lot of work that need to be done to further develop this kind of testing technique and our research project is still in progress acknowledgements this work was developed within the scope of the national natural science foundation of china no 51679049 and the china postdoctoral science foundation no 2017m622696 special thanks are also due to the caribbean regional association and the us national data buoy center of national oceanic and atmospheric administration for making the coastal wave data available for analysis 
23541,the novel testing technique for ship seakeeping behavior which includes conducting large scale model trial in realistic sea waves has been given special attention by naval architects in recent years large scale model measurement provides obvious advantages in the investigation of ship hydrodynamics in many aspects however there still exist some challenges that need addressing to improve this kind of testing technique one of the great challenges is the reproduction of full scale ocean waves when conducting downscaled model experiments in natural sea environment this paper aims to explore the possibility of reproduction of full scale wave states in coastal sea areas criteria such as significant wave height mean period spectral shape and directional spreading are involved in the wave similarity judgment various factors including season climate model scaling coastal space and time are taken into account to determine suitable waves for model measurement the wave selection principle and methodology proposed in this paper are demonstrated through a case study using coastal wave data of the puerto rico virgin islands and the gulf of maine keywords large scale model measurement seakeeping experiment coastal waves ocean wave reproduction model scaling site selection 1 introduction ship seakeeping experiments are conventionally carried out in laboratory wave tanks by using small scale models there however exist some drawbacks with respect to the tank measurement technique for example the waves are not real the model sailing distance is limited and scale effects may not be ignored there is therefore an increasing tendency towards conducting seakeeping measurement in realistic sea states for better understanding of motion and loads responses of hull in short crested ocean waves although full scale trial is the most reliable way to obtain ship responses in ocean waves it is complex expensive and time consuming the full scale trial cannot thus be a general approach for scientific research based on the above conditions large scale models are developed and tested in natural sea environment this testing approach has an intrinsic appeal for its apparent realism and is much cheaper than full scale trials jiao et al 2016a although reynolds scale effects cannot be fully overcome by using large scale models this method still provides unique advantages over tank models and full scale ships in many aspects large scale model testing technique was also highlighted during the 25 27th ittc 2008 2011 and 2014 reports of seakeeping committee to date large scale model measurements have been carried out by some advanced ship research institutions for different proposes which include resistance and propulsion maneuverability and seakeeping parametric roll stability and floodability investigations leguen and frechou 2007 reported a 1 5 scaled 25 m long elastic model of frigate and a series of tests including seakeeping hydroelasticity and roll damping were carried out in the grand towing tank facility of french marine institute to validate numerical results the structure of the large model is similar to that of the prototype when considering the elastic property and vibrational mode characteristics coraddu et al 2013 tested a 7 2 m long large frigate model s asymmetric propeller behavior in a calm volcano lake the model was mainly used to conduct manoeuvrability tests fossati et al 2015 investigated the aerodynamic forces acting on the sail and wave loads acting on the hull structure of a full scale yacht 10 m long when sailing at sea the french navy constructed a 1 12 scaled approximately 20 m long aircraft carrier large scale model to mainly test typical devices such as fin stabilizer and transverse stabilization system onboard the model this paper particularly concentrates on the investigation of large scale model s seakeeping measurement technique currently publications regarding large scale model seakeeping measurement are limited for various reasons however increasing efforts are being devoted towards adopting and refining this kind of testing technique in the recent years the pioneering works by grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 introduced the measurement procedures for large scale model seakeeping tests at sea sun et al 2010 established a scheme for remote control and telemetry system for large scale model seakeeping measurements the testing system was initially checked in a river and then sea trials were conducted in coastal waves jiao et al 2016b reviewed the large scale model seakeeping testing techniques developed in china and proposed a large scale segmented model testing scheme for loads and structural responses of a ship in sea waves comparative and benchmarking studies were also undertaken between the results obtained by large scale model trial small scale model tank test and numerical simulation to date the existing research regarding large scale model seakeeping measurement is mainly focusing on testing techniques including experimental setup testing procedure collected data analysis and evaluation although some achievements have been made with respect to large scale model seakeeping technique there still exist challenges in the measurements it is important to ensure that the experimental sea waves are similar to the full scale waves the sea states and weather conditions during field experiments are not controllable thus the desired sea state may be difficult to find therefore the fundamental challenge for large scale model seakeeping measurement is to meet the required sea state which well reproduces full scale waves there is no published paper dealing with this issue yet as far as the authors knowledge is concerned with this in mind this paper is therefore aimed at addressing the wave reproduction and site selection issues this study will also lay a foundation for the subsequent research regarding large scale model measurements the structure of this paper is arranged as follows a brief description of large scale model seakeeping measurements is introduced in section 2 the principle and challenges involved in the selection of wave state for downscaled model seakeeping measurement are proposed in section 3 in sections 4 and 5 the feasibility and methodology of finding suitable waves for large scale model measurement are explored on the basis of the coastal wave data of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine lastly main conclusions and perspectives are summarized in section 6 2 description of large scale model seakeeping test large scale models are usually designed with a length of the order of 10 30 m while the model scale ratio usually lies between 1 25 and 1 5 there are basically two kinds of models in use for large scale model seakeeping measurement the rigid model and the elastic model the former is mainly used for global motion measurement while the later which includes both the segmented model and fully flexible model allows for the measurement of hull structural loads in addition to rigid body motions maron and kapsenberg 2014 fig 1 a and b are examples of a rigid model and a segmented model respectively both of the two illustrative models are of the order of 12 m long and 4 tonnes mass we developed these two large scale models in the year 2014 on behalf of and supported by the chinese navy the corresponding seakeeping measurements were conducted in the autumn of 2014 and 2015 in a nearshore bay of huludao china jiao et al 2016b the self propelled large scale free running model can be powered by diesel engine or electric motor jiao et al 2016c the model s global motion measuring instrumentation similar to that adopted in full scale trials such as global position system inertial navigation system gps ins can be used for large scale model motion measurement the model s motion accelerations and loads are measured by accelerometers and strain gauges respectively pressure sensors can be arranged on hull in alternate wet and dry areas to measure the slamming load during the field experiment propulsion speed and sailing heading of the unmanned large scale model are controlled by radio signal submitted from an auxiliary yacht see fig 2 a meanwhile an in situ directional wave buoy is adopted to measure the short crested sea waves see fig 2 b hirakawa et al 2012 moreover it is recommended to adopt an onboard wave probe at the bow for measurement of incoming wave elevation in real time jiao et al 2017 the wind and current parameters should also be monitored during sea trial measurement since they have certain influence on hydrodynamic performance of ships two anemometers are adopted to measure the winds one is mounted on the top of model to measure the relative speed and direction of the wind field with respect to the advancing model the other is mounted on the in situ environment measuring boat to record the absolute wind speed and direction see fig 3 a for ships with small superstructure the wind effects on ship seakeeping and wave loads performance are usually not considered for ship resistance measurements the wind added resistance should be accurately evaluated by using the measured ship navigational information and the wind data moreover an in situ tachometer is immersed in water at a depth of about 5 10 m to record the speed and direction of ocean current see fig 3 b according to our experience the current speed is usually lower than 0 2 m s in sheltered coastal areas and this is negligible for high speed vessel seakeeping test for low speed vessel tests the model relative sailing speed with respect to a calm water field can also be obtained by using the ship true navigational speed and ocean current speed information the large scale model experimental scheme and testing procedure are displayed in fig 4 it is noted that the experimental sea area should be some distance away from the shore to prevent the effects of wave reflection and shoaling glejin et al 2016 during the seakeeping test three experimental strategies are controlled and monitored wave state model sailing speed and heading angle the model sailing route is designed as shown in the insert of fig 4 to ensure different heading conditions can be attained effectively nielsen and stredulinsky 2012 for the designed route direction 1 corresponds to head sea direction 2 to following sea direction 3 to port quarter direction 4 to starboard bow direction 5 to port beam and direction 6 corresponds to starboard beam as post voyage analysis the wave model motion acceleration and load spectra and their statistics are obtained in a similar way as at full scale processing method lloyd 1989 full scale motions and load responses are then extrapolated by using similitude law time domain processing methods are also applicable especially for strong nonlinear motion loads and slamming event analyses sun et al 2009 moreover playback of video recordings can be viewed and used to identify events such as slamming green water on deck and propeller cavitation 3 challenges in full scale wave reproduction the downscaled model hydrodynamic testing research is guided by the similitude law therefore providing an experimental sea state which well represents full scale waves is the very first and critical effort prior to experimental measurement in the laboratory tank tests expected waves of designated parameters can be conveniently generated by computerized wave makers when it comes to the natural environment the sea waves have a stochastic characteristic which largely depends on space and time therefore a fundamental technique issue is how to reproduce full scale sea state during large scale model test this problem is systematically discussed in this section 3 1 principle of experimental sea state determination according to the knowledge of stochastic theory random waves are described by wave spectrum and its statistical parameters thus four criteria are involved in the similarity analysis of waves between full scale and model scale i spectral shape ii significant wave height iii mean period and iv directional spreading a set of sea states at full scale which are of interest should be determined prior to model design and measurement the wave parameters at full scale are determined as follows the significant wave height h p is first determined according to the ship type dimensions and its operational sea area and then the associated characteristic period t p is usually chosen to be the most probable one for the selected wave height as per a specified wave scatter diagram e g table 1 as is known the similitude criteria involved in ship hydrodynamic experiments are reynolds number re froude number fr strouhal number st and euler number eu during the downscaled model seakeeping measurement the fr and st must be strictly similar to those of the prototype li 2003 thus the expected significant wave height h m and characteristic period t m at model scale are derived by using the froude similitude law which are expressed as follows 1 h m h p λ 2 t m t p λ 3 2 problem statement the similarity in spectral shape between nearshore waves and deep ocean waves has been preliminarily validated by comparing the dimensionless spectral curves in authors previous work jiao et al 2016b however the similarity in wave spectral parameters i e significant wave height mean period and directional spreading has not been investigated or reported so far thus the following discussion attempts to address this issue thoroughly assume that the occurrence probability of a specified full scale wave state described by wave height h p and period t p is p h p t p and the probability of the corresponding model scale sea state derived by eqs 1 2 is p h m t m it is expected that the p h m t m to be a large value of probability for the sake of minimizing waiting time for the expected experimental sea state as aforementioned the t p is usually selected as the most probable one whose probability is p h p t p for the given significant wave height h p in other words both p h p t p and p h m t m are expected to be the largest possibility for the respective wave height in order to investigate the h t joint distribution of open ocean waves the north atlantic sea states are selected as representative for full scale waves in this study the scatter diagram of significant wave height with characteristic period zero crossing period for the north atlantic sea states is shown in table 1 hogben et al 1986 dai et al 2007 the north atlantic sea area is of interest because a sizeable number of navy ships and approximately one third of worldwide merchant ships operate across the north atlantic ocean moreover the coastal areas adopted in section 4 belong to the north atlantic ocean in fig 5 the blue squares denote the weighted mean most probable characteristic periods at different significant wave heights on the basis of data in table 1 it is noted that the weighted mean periods were calculated by considering all the periods and corresponding possibility at each significant wave height a histogram is also displayed to explain the corresponding probability of each significant wave height then both linear function and cubic polynomial are used to fit the h t scatters in fig 5 as can be seen from the fitted results the significant wave height is almost linear with respect to the mean period over the range h 1 3 2 5 m whereas there is a slight declining tendency of the realistic mean period from the linear fitted line in the range of h 1 3 2 5 m when large scale model trials are conducted in the open ocean the model will thus be subjected to a sea state which has the same statistical distribution characteristics as full scale wave state as a matter of fact the extrapolated mean periods are generally much higher than the realistic ones in addition the difference increases dramatically with the increasing scaling factor moreover it is noted that the commonly observed wave height in the open ocean is higher than 2 m thus the extrapolated full scale sea states may be too high for prototype seakeeping investigation according to the above analysis it can be concluded that it is difficult to reproduce the full scale sea states in the open ocean for large scale model measurements therefore this may dictate selecting the testing zone near the shore since the wave heights and periods of coastal waves are generally lower than those in the open seas it is nevertheless worth mentioning that the extrapolated large wave period will lead to a wave encounter frequency that is closer to ship s natural frequency this allows for the scientific investigation on ship responses especially in dangerous conditions e g harmonics or springing responses 3 3 strategies involved in wave reproduction the scaling factor of testing models is also associated with the wave reproduction issue generally a scaling factor of the order of 10 is a typical choice as a compromise between the costs technique feasibility and the requirements for physical simulation too large scaling factor λ will cause difficulty in reproducing the full scale wave state in an ordinary coastal experimental field on the contrary the construction and test conduction costs will be highly increased with the increasing model dimensions i e small λ case besides cost reasons the scaling factor λ should not be too small so as to be able to reproduce high wave states in coastal zones for example for a typical vessel with length of the order of 200 m a model scaling factor λ 5 is a reasonable choice from the aspect of similarity in wave parameters however only low and middle sea states h p 5 m are reproducible since high seas h m 1 m may be difficult to find in coastal areas ship performance in high and extreme sea states are of particular interest especially for naval ships investigation to summarize large scale model testing scheme should be established and optimized by taking into consideration all the mission measurement requirements and technique feasibility during the model design stage the model dimensions and scaling factor which should be determined first are mainly evaluated by the project budget technique feasibility and possibility of full scale wave reproduction the factors involved in experimental wave selection include sea site climate season weather offshore distance and testing time etc the framework of large scale model experimental wave selection is summarized in fig 6 4 case investigation of coastal and offshore waves as concluded from the above analysis it is difficult to reproduce the full scale waves in open sea areas for large scale model measurement the following content is therefore aimed at investigating the feasibility of reproducing full scale sea state in coastal areas fortunately it is preferable to conduct large scale model measurements in coastal and offshore areas due to convenience and crew safety reasons 4 1 study areas and buoys the analysis of coastal wave characteristics needs large amounts of extended periods of wave data observation in this study the open access wave data from the caribbean integrated coastal ocean observing system caricoos and the university of maine ocean observing system umoos is used the caricoos and umoos provide past present and forecasted ocean data sets including wind waves tides ocean color and currents for coastal areas of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine respectively views of the buoy locations for the two cases are displayed in fig 7 a total of 12 wave buoys are adopted in this study three buoys i e pr1 pr2 and vi1 see fig 7 a are adopted in caricoos and nine buoys i e 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 see fig 7 b are adopted in umoos the details of the selected buoys are listed in table 2 the wave data was measured by in situ wave buoys which are anchored by mooring system the statistical datasets in the year 2016 are used as representative for investigation in this study the wave information such as significant wave height wave period spectrum and direction are calculated every 1 h by using the latest 20 min collected buoy data the coastal and offshore wave data are downloaded from website http gyre umeoce maine edu caricoos 4 2 wave data description there are approximately 8760 365 day by 24 h dataset records for each of the yearly buoy measurements the status regarding wave data availability is summarized in table 3 here symbol o denotes available symbol x denotes temporal partially available due to device maintenance reasons n a denotes not available wdir denotes wind direction swh denotes significant wave height dpd denotes dominant wave period peak period apd denotes average wave period zero crossing period mwd denotes mean wave direction mwds denotes mean wave directional spread and spec denotes wave spectra fig 8 illustrates some examples of recorded time domain hourly wave data at 44007 in the year 2016 in fig 8 c the unit of energy density is m2 s and the scale is logarithmic 4 3 wave periods transformation the coastal waves comprise both wind waves and swell waves and their spectral curves are sometimes characterized by multi peaks o reilly et al 2016 therefore the use of mean wave period zero crossing period in the representation of statistical sea states is more reasonable than peak period due to the fact that the caricoos provides only peak period for buoys pr1 pr2 and vi1 the following experiential formula is implemented to obtain the mean period of waves 3 t z t p 1 451 eq 3 was concluded by li 2007a b by comprehensively regressing large amounts of wave data on the basis of jonswap spectra wen s spectra field measurements and laboratory tests where the introduction to jonswap and wen spectra can be found in wen and yu 1984 the coefficient of 1 451 was also noted to be reliable in a wide range of conditions in order to validate eq 3 the average ratio coefficients of peak period to mean period at 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 are calculated by using the known year round 1 h statistical data and the results are listed in table 4 it can be confirmed that the calculated coefficients are on the overall in good agreement with the coefficient 1 451 and within an average error of 1 01 however the period coefficient for 44013 and 44007 are respectively 10 13 and 8 13 larger than the coefficient 1 451 which may be due to the relatively sheltered characteristics of the two area while for other coastal wave sites in relatively open areas the errors are acceptably within 5 thus the use of eq 3 for mean period acquisition is feasible and acceptable for pr1 pr2 and vi1 where the sea areas are relatively open 5 data statistical analyses for experimental wave selection in this section statistical analyses regarding the coastal and offshore wave data from caricoos and umoos are undertaken to explore how to find suitable coastal waves for large scale model seakeeping measurement the demonstration of wave similarity between model and full scales is systematically done by analyzing the influence of season climate scaling factor and sea area on the parameters of coastal waves the recurrence probability of expected coastal wave states is also taken into account to evaluate the experimental waiting time moreover the similarity in spectral characteristics and directional spreading angle between coastal and ocean waves are also discussed 5 1 monthly variation of coastal wave parameters to investigate the variation of wave parameters with respect to coastal location and season monthly averaged statistical significant wave height and mean period are calculated and displayed in fig 9 as seen from the statistical results for coastal waves of puerto rico us virgin islands the wave parameters for pr1 and vi1 fluctuate over the seasons gently due to the tropical rainforest climatic characteristics both significant wave height and mean period for pr2 are obviously higher from october to april and lower from may to september due to the strong cold wind blowing from the northeast see fig 7 a the coastal and offshore waves in the gulf of maine are affected by the temperate continental climatic conditions the significant wave height is generally lower in summer than in other seasons as seen from fig 9 a the highest mean significant wave height generally occurs in january or february while the lowest occurs in july or august in addition the annual variation of significant wave height is particularly more obvious in the relatively open sea sites e g 44008 44011 and 44018 whereas the height of waves in the nearshore sites e g 44013 and 44020 is not so sensitive to the season change on the other hand as seen in fig 9 b the mean period exhibited less variation with the various seasons compared with the significant wave height the mean period in summer is slightly lower than that in winter 5 2 the influence of model scaling factor the statistical significant wave height and mean period represented by h m and t m of coastal and offshore waves in fig 9 are used to extrapolate the full scale sea states the corresponding full scale sea state parameters h p t p with respect to different model scaling factors λ 1 15 are extrapolated by using eqs 1 2 the corresponding realistic mean period t r at full scale wave height h p was subsequently estimated by interpolating the fitted cubic curve for h p 16 5 m or straight line for h p 16 5 m in fig 5 then the difference between extrapolated period t p and realistic period t r is used to evaluate wave similarity which is estimated by the following equation 4 e r r t t p t r t r 100 the estimated errors err t for the different cases and the datum planes err t 0 which are used to aid observation and evaluation are summarized in fig 10 as seen from the results it seems that the pr1 and 44020 are the preferable candidate sites for large scale model seakeeping measurement the reasons can be attributed to the following aspects i relatively small size economic models with large scaling factor λ 6 8 can be used for seakeeping measurement in coastal waves of pr1 and 44020 ii experiments by such models can suitably be conducted in almost all the months regardless of season change iii since the significant wave height fluctuates within a certain range different levels of sea states can be experienced by a model with a specified scaling factor for the other sites i e pr2 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 and 44027 only quite large models with small scaling factor λ 2 4 are suitable to be tested considering the wave similarity aspect for site vi1 suitable wave states are easily found for models with large scaling factor λ 6 8 only in may june and july therefore pr1 and 44020 are the selected sites for experimental investigations as seen from fig 10 a and k the most appropriate model scaling factor in pr1 and 44020 lies in the range λ 6 8 moreover it is seen that the yearly average period errors for model with a scaling of λ 15 are 27 8 and 25 9 for pr1 and 44020 respectively in fact since the realistic period appears within a certain range the expected sea states may also be frequently observed for a 1 15 scaled economic model for instance for a 300 m ship prototype a 1 15 scaled model 20 m long is a sound choice considering economic cost technique feasibility and the wave reproducibility aspects to summarize the coastal areas with relatively lower wave period with an equivalent wave height are best suited for the reproduction of full scale waves using an economic small model moreover the preferable significant wave height for large scale model measurement should be less than 1 m for crew safety 5 3 joint distribution of wave height with period the statistical wave height or period fluctuates around its average value over a certain range this thus provides potential opportunities for the reproduction of ocean waves in a wide range since only monthly averaged wave parameters are considered in the above analysis further analysis regarding the distribution of wave parameters is made in this section fig 11 shows the scatter diagrams of significant wave height versus mean period of the year round 1 h wave data for pr1 pr2 and vi1 note that the mean periods are obtained from peak periods using eq 3 as seen from the scatter plots the periods have a discrete distribution this is because the peak period was extracted from the estimated wave spectrum which is represented by discrete values moreover the waves especially the low waves are associated with broad range of period due to the contribution of swell waves to the total spectra amrutha et al 2017 the occurrence of swell is more frequent at pr2 than at pr1 and vi1 the wave heights at pr1 and vi1 are relatively lower than at pr2 due to the fact that winds are blowing from the northeast all the year round at pr2 fig 12 shows the scatter diagrams of significant wave height versus mean period of the year round 1 h wave data for 44005 44007 44008 44011 44013 44017 44018 44020 and 44027 as seen from these scatter plots the high waves h 1 3 2 m are associated with a narrow range of mean period while low waves h 1 3 2 m are associated with a relatively wider range of mean period this means that the periods at low wave state domain can be reproduced in a wider range than those at high wave state domain the waves at 44020 are obviously lower than the others due to the fact that it is a sheltered area with limited depth and fetch length from figs 11 and 12 an interesting phenomenon was observed that the boundary between the scatters domain and the bottom blank domain can be described by straight line which means that the h t joint distributions have a strong relation the reason can be explained by the fact that the waves will break when exceeding certain steepness yu 2003 the boundary lines are useful information for experimental site selection for comparison the lower wave period boundaries red lines in each of the figures are summarized in fig 13 a as seen in the figure different sea areas have different boundary lines the difference is especially pronounced at significant wave height range h 1 3 2 m at which the model tests are usually conducted therefore the boundary lines can be referred as critical condition of wave state occurrence at each candidate site for example one could judge whether a specified wave condition can be observed or not at a specified site in other words a wave state may occur at some sites while it may never occur at some other sites in addition the boundary lines can generally be classified into three groups by their slopes the first group includes pr1 pr2 and vi1 the second group includes 44007 44013 and 44020 and the third group includes the remaining six buoys the classification also revealed trends in accordance with the buoy locations and their offshore distance and it is found that the slope of boundary lines decreases with the increasing buoy offshore distance for example the offshore distance of pr1 pr2 and vi1 are much shorter than others thus their slopes are relatively larger moreover the line slopes saw a decreasing trend by the following order of buoys 44007 offshore distance 22 km 44013 30 km 44020 30 km 44018 44 km 44017 43 km 44027 37 km 44008 100 km 44005 144 km and 44011 315 km in addition it is noted that there is a common interaction point for all of the boundary lines at about h 1 3 2 6 m and t z 5 4 s the average periods at different wave heights are also calculated and fitted by lines which are displayed using green lines in figs 11 and 12 note that these lines are not derived by fitting the scatters directly since the high density points at low wave height domain would dominate the trend of the line and cause distortion of the line they are however obtained by fitting the average periods in each of the wave height bands with a step of 0 2 m the average period lines are also important information for experimental site selection since they reveal the most probable wave mean period at different significant wave height for a specified site for example after the determination of a range of model testing sea states the testing site can be preselected as per the average period line information to minimize waiting time for the expected experimental sea states see fig 6 the blue box for comparison the average period lines in each of the figures are summarized in fig 13 b as is seen the slopes for pr1 and pr2 are relatively larger than the remaining ones while the slopes of the remaining ones are almost the same even though with different intercepts another interesting phenomenon observed in figs 11 and 12 is that the intersection points of boundary line and mean period line in each of the figures are located at the largest wave height domain except for the cases of pr1 and pr2 5 4 recurrence probability of expected coastal waves to improve experiment operational efficiency the return period of expected coastal waves should also be considered besides the wave parameter similarity issue a comparison of mean periods between waves at model scale λ 1 different scaling extrapolated scaling λ 5 15 and the expected north atlantic sea states are presented in fig 14 for cases pr1 and 44020 in addition bars are also illustrated on the curves to reflect the occurrence probability of corresponding wave height as seen in fig 14 when considering the aspect of wave parameter similarity the most suitable model scaling factor for measurement at pr1 and 44020 is about λ 5 7 however when considering also the recurrence probabilities of experimental waves the problem becomes complex it indicates that full scale waves seem to be reproducible only for a limited range of wave height at a specified scaling factor for example as seen in fig 14 a full scale wave states under 10 m may be well reproduced at scaling factor λ 5 7 full scale wave states over 10 m may be reproduced at λ 10 15 the extrapolated wave periods are generally larger than the expected ones similarly as seen in fig 14 b although both the period and probability coincide well between the expected values and those by λ 6 extrapolated only full scale wave states under 6 m may be reproducible since the sea states at 44020 are generally lower than 1 m full scale wave states over 6 m may be reproduced using λ 10 15 models the extrapolated wave periods are generally larger than the expected ones it should be mentioned that the simplified linear functions are used to match and compare with the targeted real condition cubic polynomial in this study in fact the real problem is more complex fig 15 shows the statistical probability of exceedance of significant wave height on the basis of the year round wave data which will be helpful for the general understanding of wave state information at different buoys as is seen the probability of exceedance for significant wave height 1 m is found to be only about 10 for 44020 the significant wave height is about 1 3 m for pr1 at a same probability of exceedance level of 10 on the other hand large waves h 1 3 2 m are frequently observed at farther offshore areas e g 44005 44008 44011 44017 44018 and 44027 the occurrence probability of large waves h 1 3 2 m is over 20 5 5 analysis of coastal wave spectra in this section the wave spectral characteristics at 44020 are analyzed and discussed for simplification coastal waves in january april july and october are selected as representative of winter spring summer and autumn respectively the contour plots of wave spectral energy density in frequency time domain for different seasons are presented in fig 16 where the unit of energy density is m2 s and the scale is logarithmic moreover the hourly mean periods are also marked in the contour plots using pink cross as observed the mean period is relatively stable and fluctuates gently around 0 3 hz whereas the significant wave height varies over a range of 0 2 m also see figs 9 and 12 h and changes continually for further analysis of the spectral shape the hourly wave frequency spectra on 5 january 2016 are presented in fig 17 as an example as is seen the spectral shape during 1 00 to 12 00 gmt shows good agreement with theoretical spectrum e g ittc issc or jonswap spectra the comparison of dimensionless spectra between the coastal waves during 1 00 to 12 00 and the issc target spectrum are shown in fig 18 in addition the variations of significant wave height and wave periods during the day are shown in fig 19 the spectra decayed from 13 00 to 24 00 as the wave height decreased from 1 5 m to 0 5 m gradually meanwhile double peak spectra are also observed due to the effect of wind direction change the dominant peak frequency was much more stable during 1 00 to 14 00 while it increased slowly from 0 22 hz to 0 28 hz during the following hours 5 6 analysis of directional spreading of coastal waves in this section the wave directional spreading characteristics at pr1 pr2 and vi1 are analyzed and discussed the hourly recording of data of mean wave directional spreading at the buoys in coast of puerto rico us virgin islands are shown in fig 20 in general the hourly mean wave directional spread shows a steady trend that fluctuates gently around the mean value all the year around the statistical parameters of the mean wave directional spread angle for the coastal waves at the different stations are listed in table 5 in addition a commonly used theoretical formula for directional spreading function is expressed as follows issc 1964 yu 2003 5 d ω θ γ n 2 1 π γ n 2 1 2 cos n θ π 2 θ π 2 where γ n denotes gama function the directional spreading functions corresponding to cases of n 1 8 are illustrated in fig 21 the mean wave directional spreading angles calculated for different spreading functions are summarized in table 6 the values are obtained by acquiring the abscissa position of centroid of area below the curve in addition a comparison of the mean wave directional spreading angles between the theoretical and measured values is shown in fig 22 according to the ittc recommendations li 2003 n 2 is widely used to describe the short crested ocean waves acting on ships and offshore structures therefore it turned out that the averaged mean directional spreading angle of coastal waves 31 073 is close to that of deep ocean waves 27 268 6 conclusions and perspectives this paper explores the possibility of ocean wave reproduction in coastal sea areas for large scale model seakeeping measurement the coastal and offshore wave data of puerto rico us virgin islands and gulf of maine are used as a case study to demonstrate the proposed methodology the influence of control strategies such as season climate model scaling sea site and offshore distance on the possibility of ocean wave reproduction was comprehensively investigated the proposed methodology for coastal wave and site selection will lay a firm foundation for large scale model seakeeping testing technique with appropriate coastal wave states being observed and experienced by large scale model the full scale ship responses can be extrapolated based on the testing results directly by using the similitude law the case study illustrated in this study leads to the following conclusions 1 relatively small dimension models with large scaling factor λ 5 15 can be used for seakeeping measurement in sheltered nearshore areas e g pr1 and 44020 only quite large models with small scaling factor λ 2 4 can be tested in farther and deeper sea areas e g pr2 44005 and 44007 so as to satisfy the similarity requirement of wave parameters 2 the climate and season change may have great influence on wave parameters therefore for coastal waves of puerto rico us virgin islands large scale model seakeeping measurement should be conducted in months from april to september when using relatively small models large λ case in contrast the most suitable season for model seakeeping measurement may be winter in gulf of maine 3 when considering the recurrence probabilities of experimental waves full scale waves seem to be reproducible only for a limited range of wave height at a specified model scaling factor therefore it is almost impossible to reproduce a comprehensive range wave heights by a specified model scaling in a given coastal sea area 4 the mean period is generally much more stable compared with the significant wave height thus the spectral peak or mean frequency is stable while the spectral power density changes frequently during a day moreover spectra which show good agreement with theoretical spectrum in spectral shape can be frequently observed in coastal areas the mean wave directional spreading of coastal waves is also close to that of deep ocean waves 5 generally the most promising testing sites are pr1 and 44020 among the 12 sites this is because it is easy to reproduce the open ocean waves with relatively large model scaling factor λ 5 15 moreover the extrapolated full scale wave states will lie in 0 15 m which are in accordance with the scientific research range although this paper provides the possibility of ocean wave reproduction for large scale model measurement there still exist waiting time and recurrence probability issues due to the uncertainty and uncontrollability of the natural ocean environment in order to overcome these limitations we are devoted to developing a numerical extrapolation technique which will allow the prediction of full scale ship responses on the basis of large scale model measured data under any given dissimilar wave state a system identification based algorithm is being developed the ship intrinsic time domain response function will be numerically identified by large scale model measured data in a given experimental wave condition and then be used to extrapolate ship responses under other expected wave conditions performing large scale model tests in natural environment is an increasing trend for the future development of ship hydrodynamics experimental investigation there is still a lot of work that need to be done to further develop this kind of testing technique and our research project is still in progress acknowledgements this work was developed within the scope of the national natural science foundation of china no 51679049 and the china postdoctoral science

23542,the paper investigates natural frequencies and mode shapes of liquid sloshing within two dimensional baffled tanks with arbitrary geometries without taking into account viscosity and compressibility the fluid is considered to be potential the vibration amplitude is presumed to be little and hence a linear free surface condition is used the governing equations are solved using boundary element method bem where baffles are treated as two immersed adjacent layers the resulted problem after discretization is transformed into a standard matrix eigenvalue issue where only freedoms related to free surface are involved the bem approach is verified against analytical theories and existing numerical results natural frequencies of sloshing in tanks with a variety of shapes are studied the effect of horizontal and vertical baffles is thoroughly investigated and empirical formulas are proposed to calculate natural frequencies of rectangular tanks with baffles keywords 2 d sloshing boundary element method natural frequencies baffles empirical formulas 1 introduction sloshing has been a hot discussed topic for a long time due to the complexity of its physical mechanics and the significance in practical industrial issues it can be found in a wide range of applications for instance ships trucks and aircrafts generally speaking the sloshing phenomenon can be induced in a partially filled container subject to outer excitation violent liquid sloshing may cause the overturn of ships and may lead to severe damage to support structures jung et al 2015 existing researches into sloshing dynamics can be divided into three aspects inherent physical mechanics interaction with supporting containers and the measures of suppressing sloshing to dig the physical mechanics of sloshing in an analytical manner one usually omits the viscosity and complexity of fluid and simply the issue into a potential flow early research assumed the sloshing motion to be small and linearized the free surface boundary condition under such simplification a variety of analytical solution has been obtained which can be found in ibrahim 2005 some research used equivalent models ebrahimian et al 2014 such as some kind of spring systems using special treatments such as perturbation expansion some weak nonlinear effects can be considered within analytical or semi analytical approximation faltinsen and timokha 2002 wu 2007 faltinsen et al 2003 since theoretical method meets challenges from complex geometry and strong nonlinearity many researchers turned to laboratory experiments and numerical simulation in numerical study one solves laminar ns equations akyildiz 2012 and turbulence models such as rans les and vles liu et al 2016 jung et al 2015 with the aid of free surface processing techniques for instance vof mac level set and meshless methods such as sph cao et al 2014 and mps jena and biswal 2017 interaction between liquid sloshing and supporters involves the coupling motion of sloshing and supporters zhao et al 2014 serván camas et al 2016 sloshing in elastic tanks strand and faltinsen 2017 hwang et al 2016 deng and yue 2017 sloshing induced hydrodynamic loads upon container structures li et al 2014 graczyk and moan 2008 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 etc under the assumption of potential theory and linearity certain analytical solutions can be obtained strand and faltinsen 2017 hu et al 2016 however since these issues are even more complicated than the physical mechanics of sloshing numerical and experimental methods are intensively adopted as most of the time sloshing brings hazards to support structures researchers are seeking effective methods of suppressing liquid sloshing under various circumstances one of the most convenient methods is to use baffles during years a number of studies have been conducted on the sloshing reduction effects of various types of baffles for instance xue and lin 2011 used the virtual boundary force vbf method to study viscous liquid sloshing in a tank with internal baffles of different shapes and arrangements wang et al 2016 numerically studied the effects of t shaped baffles on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks by means of experiments xue et al 2017 investigated the suppressing effects of vertical baffles cho et al 2017 studied the sloshing reduction effect of horizontal porous baffles in the context of linear potential theory and a bem approach with the assistance of modern computational and experimental techniques a wide range of achievements have been obtained in academia however the progress in industrial application is slow by contrast without the help of numerical and experimental tools it is still difficult to predict hydrodynamic load at resonant sloshing especially when coupled with violent transient action like slamming in general the sloshing induced load is strongly depended on the relationship between the frequency of the outer excitation and the natural frequency of sloshing usually special care should be paid in industrial issues when the frequency of outer excitation approaches natural sloshing frequencies therefore it is of great importance to obtain natural sloshing frequencies during design stages or safety assessment by far the understanding of natural sloshing is still not enough when baffles exist since realistic containers can have arbitrary shapes natural sloshing modes within realistic tanks are usually difficult to obtain using analytical methods faltinsen and timokha 2002 proposed an analytical method for determining natural sloshing modes and frequencies in two dimensional tanks and used the method to study natural sloshing in a prismatic tank associated with liquefied natural gas lng containers yet it is still difficult to predict natural sloshing modes and frequencies of a baffled tank this paper investigates 2 d natural sloshing frequencies and mode shapes of tanks in a variety of outlines with and without baffles the viscosity and compressibility of fluid is omitted and a bem approach is adopted to solve the resulted laplace system using the strategy of sygulski 2011 the baffles are treated as double layers immersed in liquid and no zoning method is employed the bem approach is validated against existing analytical and numerical results before being applied to the determination of natural sloshing features natural frequencies obtained with various tank outlines are compared with the ones of equivalent rectangular tanks on the foundation of a number of simulations two empirical formulas are proposed to calculate natural frequencies of rectangular tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles which can be referred to by industrial application 2 two dimensional sloshing problem with artificial damping fig 1 shows the sketch of a two dimensional sloshing problem in general the shape of the tank can be arbitrary without loss of generality a horizontal annular tank is depicted in fig 1 giving a discontinuous free surface boundary a cartesian coordinate system is originated at the center of the undisturbed free surface with an upright z direction no matter whether inner members baffles exist or not the boundary of fluid domain ω t is composed of the solid moving boundary ω s and the free surface boundary ω f as are depicted in fig 1 a horizontal displacement excitation x s a cos ω t is imposed on the solid tank to make sloshing stable and harmonic generally speaking the fluid domain ω t changes with time making the sloshing problem difficult to solve since this research is concerned about the natural frequencies of sloshing phenomena the surface displacement η is assumed to be little and therefore ω t ω further the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational so a velocity potential φ exists and satisfies the continuity equation 1 δ φ 0 in ω the solid boundary condition is written as 2 φ n u s n on ω s where n is the outward unit vector normal to the solid boundary the boundary velocity u s x s 0 a ω sin ω t 0 on free surface the linearized kinematic and dynamic conditions hold which are written as 3 φ z η t on ω f 4 φ t g η 0 on ω f taking time derivative to eq 4 and using the relationship of eq 3 a unified free surface condition is given by 5 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 on ω f it should be noted that the potential theory i e eqs 1 4 does not include any energy dissipation and will lead to a singular solution when the excitation frequency ω equals one of the natural frequencies of the sloshing flow i e ω n therefore to avoid the numerical divergence around frequency ω n an artificial damping term must be introduced cho et al 2005 utilized a time derivation term μ φ t to avoid the singular result at frequency ω n which is employed in this paper the dynamic pressure is given by the linearized bernoulli equation and is written as 6 p ρ φ t in ω where ρ denotes the fluid density the entire force resultant f r acting on the tank wall is given by 7 f r ω s p n ⅆ s 3 bem approach in frequency domain the boundary element method a widely used approach to the laplace equation is on the basis of the green formula which is given by 8 σ x 0 φ x 0 ω φ x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ x n ⅆ s x in ω here σ x 0 is related to the surface corner of domain ω for instance σ equals 1 for x 0 ω ω and 0 5 for x 0 on the smooth boundary of ω g x x 0 is the so called green function which satisfies 9 2 g x x 0 δ x x 0 in ω where δ x is the dirac delta function there are various green functions for different issues and the most widely used ones are g x x 0 1 2 π ln x x 0 and g x x 0 1 4 π x x 0 under two dimensional and three dimensional space respectively since this paper studies the two dimensional sloshing problem green function g x x 0 1 2 π ln x x 0 is adopted the thought underlying eq 8 is that the velocity potential of any position can be expressed as the superposition of the ones at the domain boundary using this fact only discretization upon ω which is illustrated in fig 2 is required it is worth noticing that the baffles in this approach are expressed as two adjacent layers and therefore no zoning method is required sygulski 2011 let r i j denote x i x j σ i φ i and δ s i represent σ x i φ x i and ⅆ s x i respectively the discretized form of eq 8 is written as 10 σ i φ i 1 2 π j 1 j i n φ j n ln r i j ln r i j φ j n δ s j for any x i x j ω it should be mentioned that eq 10 corresponds to a zero order approximation of the boundary integral high order approximation can be acquired by assuming φ to be a polynomial function of local coordinates and performing gauss legendre integrals after coordinate transform high order integral is more accurate yet it may require information of additional nodes and is more complex in program design by comparison zero order approach can be robust and easily realized which has been verified and widely adopted by commercial potential theory solvers such as sesam wadam one disadvantage of zero order approximation is low precision however this can be overcome by improving element number which will not cause a significant computational cost in 2 d space in addition under a dense meshing eq 10 becomes a standard gauss cauchy integral which agrees with the meaning of the green theorem and the green function induced integral singularity is prevented by letting j i in eq 10 using eqs 2 and 5 the second term of the right side of eq 10 is formulated as 11 j 1 j i n ln r i j φ j n δ s j j i x j ω s ln r i j a ω sin ω t n x j δ s j j i x j ω f ln r i j 1 g 2 φ j t 2 δ s j substituting eq 11 into eq 10 the green formula ends up with the matrix equation 12 m 2 φ t 2 kφ f where 13 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ n t 14 m i j 1 g ln r i j δ s j if i j and x j ω f 0 if i j or x j ω s 15 k i j n ln r i j δ s j if i j 2 π σ i if i j 16 f i a ω sin ω t j i x j ω s ln r i j n x j δ s j to avoid the singularity at ω ω n the damping matrix c c 1 m is adopted and eq 12 is rewritten as 17 m 2 φ t 2 c φ t kφ f from eq 14 one may notice that the element of matrix m is bound to be 0 unless its column position corresponds to a free surface node x j ω f realizing this fact the matrix size of eq 17 can be reduced through the following procedure first decompose eq 17 as 18 m f 0 2 φ f t 2 2 φ s t 2 c 1 m f 0 φ f t φ s t k φ f φ s f where m f contains the non zero components of m φ f and φ s are the velocity potential of nodes at the free surface boundary and solid boundary respectively second multiply both sides of eq 18 by k 1 which gives 19 k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 c 1 k 1 m f φ f t φ f φ s k 1 f finally by introducing the conversion matrix t e 0 0 0 where e is the unit matrix eq 19 is simplified as 20 t k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 c 1 t k 1 m f φ f t φ f t k 1 f 3 1 free oscillation problem the natural frequencies of sloshing can be obtained by studying the free oscillation problem let c 1 0 and f 0 the free oscillation system is governed by 21 t k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 φ f 0 let φ ϕ sin ω t and φ f ϕ f sin ω t and therefore eq 21 can be reformulated as 22 t k 1 m f ϕ f 1 ω 2 ϕ f by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix t k 1 m f one can obtain the natural frequencies ω n and the vibration shapes ϕ f n of the free surface using eq 19 the vibration shape of the entire system is given by 23 ϕ n ω n 2 k 1 m f ϕ f n 3 2 forced oscillation problem with damping differing from oscillation without energy dissipation the existence of damping term will induce a phase difference between the excitation and response let f f ω sin ω t where f i a j i x j ω s ln r i j n x j δ s j see eq 16 φ f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t and φ ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t and therefore eq 20 is rewritten as 24 ω 2 a f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t c 1 ω a f ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t ω f f sin ω t where a f t k 1 m f and f f t k 1 f eq 24 can be decomposed into two equations as 25 ω 2 a f ϕ f sin c 1 ω a f ϕ f cos ϕ f sin ω f f ω 2 a f ϕ f cos c 1 ω a f ϕ f sin ϕ f cos 0 generally ϕ f sin and ϕ f cos can be written as the superposition of ϕ f n as follows 26 ϕ f sin n α n ϕ f n ϕ f cos n β n ϕ f n by substituting eq 26 into eq 25 and multiplying both sides by ϕ f m t the matrix equation eq 25 is simplified as 27 ω 2 α m c 1 ω β m ω m 2 α m ω ω m 2 q m ω 2 β m c 1 ω α m ω m 2 β m 0 it should be noted that the orthogonality of ϕ f n and the relationship ϕ f m t a f ϕ f m 1 ω m 2 ϕ f m 2 see eq 22 are used in order to obtain eq 27 q m ϕ f m t f f ϕ f m 2 and denotes the euclidean norm eq 27 gives 28 α m ω m 2 ω 2 p m β m ω c 1 p m where 29 p m ω ω m 2 q m ω m 2 ω 2 2 ω 2 c 1 2 by now the velocity potential on free surface has been obtained and is written as 30 φ f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t m α m ϕ f m sin ω t n β m ϕ f m cos ω t the relationship between φ f and φ is revealed by eq 19 replacing φ f with ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t and φ with ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t eq 19 is written as 31 ω 2 k 1 m f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t c 1 ω k 1 m f ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t ω k 1 f sin ω t eq 31 gives 32 ϕ sin ω k 1 m f c 1 ϕ f cos ω ϕ f sin k 1 f ϕ cos ω k 1 m f c 1 ϕ f sin ω ϕ f cos using eq 32 the velocity potential of the entire system is written as 33 φ ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t the local dynamic pressure and free surface elevation are formulated as 34 p ρ ω ϕ sin cos ω t ϕ cos sin ω t 35 η ω g ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t hence the entire loads upon the tank including the sloshing induced force and moment are written as 36 f x ω

and contrasting the bem s results against the theoretical ones as well as ones obtained by other numerical methods 4 1 natural frequencies subsection 3 1 gives the bem approach to the free sloshing issue and the method of determining the natural frequencies ω s here the numerical dimensionless frequencies predicted by the bem approach denoted as ω n s are compared against the theoretical ones denoted as ω t s or ones that have already been obtained by other researchers five categories of tanks are selected a rectangular tank a tank bounded by two walls each inclined at 45 to the vertical axis an ellipse outlined tank a wedged shaped tank with converging sidewalls and a wedged shaped tank with diverging sidewalls see fig 3 the formulas of natural frequencies are listed in appendix a one may also refer to chapter 1 of ibrahim 2005 appendix b introduces the non dimensionalization of the natural frequency for the conciseness of the context they are not explained here the node numbers are 100 on the solid wall boundries and 500 on the free surface boundary tables 1 and 2 list the dimensionless frequencies of sloshing in a rectangular tank and in a 45 degree channel respectively for the purpose of validating the bem approach the relative deviation between the theoretical and numerical results up to the 6 th order is analyzed table 3 gives the dimensionless frequencies of sloshing in a circular tank i e a b r in fig 3c and verifies them against the results of mciver 1989 tables 4 and 5 list natural frequencies of sloshing in wedge shaped tanks with converging and diverging side walls calculated using bem and theoretical formulas one can only find small deviations under various dimensionless parameters in tables 1 5 this indicates that the bem approach is capable of reasonably predicting the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing 4 2 frequency response of the relative free surface elevation without baffles subsection 3 2 gives the way of determining the frequency response of various variables such as the surface elevation pressure and sloshing induced load upon the container with damping effects taken into account to validate subsection 3 2 relative free surface responses defined as η a obtained by the bem approach of this paper are compared against the numerical results of cho et al 2005 which studied the frequency response problem of sloshing in rectangular containers with and without baffles using the fem method this subsection deals with the conditions without baffles while the cases with baffles will be discussed in the next subsection the tank length l of the rectangular tank varied in cho s study and the filling depth h was 1 m to make the damping effect of this subsection identical to that of cho et al 2005 c 1 equals the parameter μ of cho et al 2005 the node numbers are 100 on the solid wall boundries and 500 on the free surface boundary fig 4 gives the frequency response of the relative surface elevation with different c 1 s where h l 1 2 and the concerned surface elevation is at the left end of free surface i e x l 2 it can be observed that the results of this paper agree well with those of cho et al 2005 and that an increase of the damping coefficient leads to the reduction of the response however the damping coefficient is found to have little impact on the value of natural frequency fig 5 illustrates the frequency response of the relative surface elevation nearby the fundamental natural frequency with various depth length ratios the damping coefficient c 1 equals 0 05 in fig 5 one can observe that the bem results of this paper show good accordance with those of cho et al 2005 and that the depth length ratio affects the sloshing dynamics in both natural frequencies and maximum response amplitudes figs 4 and 5 demonstrate that the bem approach is able to give reliable prediction of the frequency response 4 3 frequency response of the relative free surface elevation with baffles the content of this subsection is similar to subsection 4 2 except that the container here owns inner baffles the sketch of the baffled tank is shown in fig 3d the baffles are installed on both tank walls with the same amount on each side the corresponding baffles on the left and right side wall share the same installation height the installation spacing on each side wall is uniform with respect to the liquid filling height all the baffles have the same extension l 2 m h 1 m and l b 0 5 m the damping coefficient is c 1 0 05 fig 6 depicts the frequency response of the relative surface elevation nearby the fundamental natural frequency obtained with various baffle numbers it should be noted that the baffle number here stands for the amount of baffles on each side namely one baffle actually means one baffle on each side wall of the tank as can be seen in fig 6 the bem approach agrees very well with the numerical results of cho et al 2005 fig 7 selects the one baffle case and gives the response of the relative surface elevation in the vicinity of the leading natural frequency with various baffle heights by comparing fig 7 with the zero baffle case see fig 4a one can find that baffles nearby the tank bottom for instance fig 7c hardly affect the response by contrast baffles nearby the free surface for instance fig 7a notably reduce the leading natural frequency of sloshing and meanwhile lower the response amplitude from figs 6 and 7 it is proved that the bem approach of this paper can properly analyze the influence of baffles 5 simulation and discussion in fact realistic tanks own complex outlines and are often installed with inner members in this section the influence of the variable liquid depth and inner baffles on the fundamental natural frequency of sloshing is studied 5 1 influence of variable liquid depth sloshing with variable liquid depth can often be found in lng carrying tanks or some ballast water tanks located at the fore or aft part of ships the lng carrying tank see fig 3e is often installed with upper and lower inclined plates which should be taken into account while computing natural frequencies the inclined plate is characterized by its inclined angle with respect to the horizontal axis for instance α d and its extension along the vertical axis for instance h d the liquid filling within a lng tank can be divided into three categories h h d h d h h u and h h u fig 8 depicts the dimensionless fundamental natural frequencies with various α d s when h h d it should be noted that the dark solid line without any symbol denoted as rectangular tank in the figure represents the theoretical result of sloshing in an equivalent rectangular tank with tank length taken as l h and filling depth as h it can be observed in fig 8 that the existence of lower inclined plates reduces the fundamental natural frequencies moreover a small α d will enhance the reduction yet the reduction becomes inconspicuous with the enlargement of the tank length l h fig 9 shows the fundamental natural frequencies changing with different h d h s when h d h h u and α d 45 as the inclined angle is fixed h d directly reflects the size of the inclined plates in fig 9 one can observe that the size of the lower inclined plates seems to have little influence on the leading natural frequencies and the natural frequencies show little deviation from the ones obtained with corresponding equivalent rectangular tanks this result is not beyond expectation bearing in mind that sloshing is inherently motion of fluid particles nearby free surface in tanks finally when h u h the influence of the size h u and the inclined angle α u of the upper plates is studied in figs 10 and 11 respectively to preclude the impact of lower inclined plates α d is set to be 90 in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 reveals that the upper inclined plates increase the fundamental natural frequencies and the degree of increase becomes obvious with the decline of α u yet becomes negligible with the growth of l h despite certain deviation can be observed between sloshing with and without upper inclined plates the size h u of upper inclined plates hardly affects the first natural frequencies since the lines obtained with various h u h seem to be completely coincident the deviation is actually caused by the inclined angle which is fixed to be 45 throughout the simulation of fig 11 from figs 8 11 it is found that the inclined angle is the main reason that the fundamental frequency is changed whereas the size of the upper and lower inclined plates hardly influences the fundamental frequency for realistic lng tankers l h h is usually large when h h d and under such condition it is reasonable to treat the actual container as a h l h rectangular tank when computing the fundamental natural frequency the rectangular tank approximation also applies when h d h h u however the fundamental natural frequency predicted by the rectangular tank approximation should be multiplied by a factor of 1 05 1 1 when h h u fig 3f gives a schematic drawing of the tank located at the fore ship if one omits the round corner connecting the tank bottom and the inclined side wall the tank can be treated as a lng tank with h h d for this sort of tank the leading natural frequency obtained using the rectangular tank approximation should be corrected with a factor of 0 83 0 95 depending on the value of α d the sketch of an ellipse shaped container is illustrated in fig 3c natural frequencies of sloshing within this category of tank are determined by the outline parameter a and b and filling depth h fig 12 displays the fundamental natural frequencies of sloshing in ellipse shaped containers and makes comparison against those obtained within rectangular tanks whose filling depth and length are determined by h and the realistic surface extension at the filling level h one can observe in fig 12 that the leading natural frequencies of sloshing in an ellipse tank and in a rectangular tank are very close to each other 5 2 influence of horizontal baffles a tank with horizontal baffles is illustrated in fig 3d in this subsection we are only concerned about the condition of one baffle at one side wall single baffle and two baffles at both side walls double baffle first natural frequencies of tanks with horizontal baffles of various heights and lengths are studied the case parameters of this subsection are listed in table 6 fig 13 gives leading natural sloshing frequencies with various baffle lengths and heights as is shown in fig 13 the existence of horizontal baffle slows the sloshing rate this suppressing effect of horizontal baffle becomes significant with the growth of baffle length and height namely the vertical distance measured from bottom in addition it is found that for narrow tall tanks large h l ratio the height of horizontal baffle needs to be large enough to make notable influence upon the natural frequencies for instance the baffle height should be larger than 0 7h to obtain visible changing of natural frequencies in fig 13e by comparison a baffle height of 0 3h is enough in fig 13a fig 14 displays free surface sloshing mode shapes of various baffled tanks generally speaking a horizontal baffle tends to enhance the surface motion right above it and suppress the vibration of free surface elsewhere the enhancement is reflected by the mode shape values of the free surface above the baffle which are close to unity whereas for a baffle free rectangular tank 1 only happens at the intersection between free surface and side wall with the growth of baffle height and length the enhancement and suppression effect becomes clear and the mode shapes of baffled tanks see distinct deviation from the one of a baffle free rectangular tank which is similar to the hb 0 1h curve in fig 14a other interesting phenomena include 1 in fig 14a for single baffle condition the growth of baffle height makes the zero point of surface vibration get closer to the baffled wall 2 although mode shapes are asymmetry for single baffle condition and symmetry for double baffle condition the two groups of mode shapes resemble each other in certain regions for instance the curves within the dashed rectangles of fig 14a and b are similar to each other 3 when the baffle is nearby free surface e g hb 0 99h the mode shape curve can be divided into three parts as is depicted in fig 15 part i values closed to unity part ii a steep dropping down from 1 to about 0 and part iii values nearby 0 besides the extension of part i ii approximately equals the baffle length for slide rectangular tanks the dimensionless natural frequencies are determined by h l which should be corrected in baffled tanks to account for the influence of inner members eq 39 gives an empirical approach for the determination of the first dimensionless sloshing frequency in a rectangular tank with horizontal baffles 39 ω m g h ω m π h l e f f tanh π h l e f f where the determination of h l e f f is briefly introduced as follows first solving h l e f f s from ω m s using eq 39 taking fig 13 a for instance the resulted h l e f f h l s are shown in fig 16 second guessing how h l e f f h l changes with respect to relative baffle height i e h b h in fig 16 we select an exponential type function f 1 e a 1 h b h b e a to ensure f 1 when the baffle is at the bottom third determining how a and b change with h l and l b l using a typical polynomial fitting approach such as the least square method finally the fitness results can be expressed as 40 h l e f f h l 1 e a l b l h l 1 h b h b l b l h l e a l b l h l for single baffle condition 41 h l e f f h l 1 e c l b l h l 1 h b h d

squares due to error r square square of the correlation between the response values and the predicted response values adj r square degrees of freedom adjusted r square and rmse root mean squared error in table 7 sses and rmses are close to 0 yet r squares and adj r squares tend to 1 which indicates eq 39 45 give excellent approximation of the simulation data fig 17 validates eq 39 by directly making comparison against numerical results obtained by bem approach and good agreement can be observed 5 3 influence of vertical baffles in this subsection we are concerned about sloshing in a rectangular tank with a number of vertical baffles on bottom a series of tests are conducted using the bem method which are listed in table 8 fig 18 gives leading natural sloshing frequencies with various baffle lengths and numbers like horizontal baffles vertical baffles also lower sloshing frequencies the length of the baffle is the dominate measurement of its contribution to sloshing frequencies and the leading natural frequency declines fast with the growth of baffle length by comparison the leading natural frequency seems to be less sensitive to the number of vertical baffles especially for a narrow tall tank large h l ratio free surface sloshing mode shapes of rectangular tanks with vertical baffles are shown in fig 19 where l b denotes the baffle length with the increase of baffle length the mode shape displays obvious distinction against the one of a baffle free tank in addition mode shapes of tanks with different number of vertical baffles are also different generally a vertical baffle tends to make the mode shape curve steep right above it and flat elsewhere following this discipline one can easily identify the number of baffles from free surface sloshing mode shape curves eq 46 gives an empirical formula for the computing the leading sloshing frequency of a rectangular tank with vertical baffles 46 ω m g h ω m π h l e f f tanh π h l e f f where 47 h l e f f h l 1 e e n h l 1 l b h f n h l e e n h l 48 e x y 0 4138 0 4973 x 3 386 y 0 03317 x 2 0 5107 x y 0 1182 y 2 49 f x y 0 1848 0 1329 x 0 4365 y 0 01212 x 2 0 0002057 x y 0 1094 y 2 the goodness of curve fitting is listed in table 9 fig 20 contrasts natural frequencies predicted by eq 46 against those by the bem approach of section 3 from table 9 and fig 20 one can observe a good curve fitting performance 6 conclusions on the basis of above simulations and discussions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the bem approach is capable of predicting natural sloshing frequencies and mode shapes precisely 2 for prismatic tanks the inclined angle is the dominate factor during the determination of the fundamental frequencies whereas the size of the upper and lower inclined plates have little influence for most cases the leading natural frequencies of prismatic tanks can be approximated by those of corresponding equivalent rectangular tanks yet a correct factor of 1 05 1 1 is required when filling depth exceeds the lower edge of upper inclined plates 3 the first natural frequencies of ellipse shaped containers can be approximated by those of equivalent rectangular tanks 4 for a wedged tank like fig 3f the fundamental natural frequency can be approximated by the one of an equivalent rectangular tanks with a correct of 0 83 0 95 5 baffles reduce natural sloshing frequencies and change sloshing mode shapes of free surface in a variety of ways the degree of reduction and variation is enhanced with the growth of baffle lengths and heights 6 eq 39 and eq 46 can be employed as a quick method to estimate leading natural frequencies of sloshing in rectangular baffled tanks acknowledgement this work was financed by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609101 the natural science foundation of fujian province of china grant no 2017j01701 and 2017j05085 appendix a theoretical natural frequencies of sloshing the natural frequencies of sloshing in tanks of various outlines have been widely studied analytical solutions have been obtained under certain circumstances ibrahim 2005 for sloshing in a rectangular tank see fig 3a the natural frequencies are written as a1 ω m g k m tanh k m h m 1 2 where k m is 2 m 1 π l for asymmetric modes and 2 m π l for symmetric modes for sloshing in a 45 degree canal see fig 3b the natural frequencies are a2 ω m g k m tanh k m h for symmetric modes a3 ω m g k m coth k m h for asymmetric modes here for symmetric modes k m is the m th positive root of eq a4 yet for asymmetric modes k m is the m th positive root of eq a5 a4 tanh k m h tan k m h for symmetric modes a5 tanh k m h tan k m h for asymmetric modes for sloshing within a wedge shaped container with converging side walls see fig 3 g natural frequencies of axial coordinate free modes are formulated as ibrahim 2005 a6 ω m m g 2 α h λ 1 λ m α 1 λ m α where λ h 0 h similarly the natural frequencies of sloshing in a wedge shaped container with diverging side walls are written as a7 ω m m g 2 α h 1 λ m α 1 λ m α appendix b nondimensionalization of the natural frequency of free sloshing for the convenience of comparison the natural frequency ω m is transformed into the dimensionless form taking symmetric modes for instance the natural frequencies of sloshing in a rectangular container and in a 45 degree channel are written as b1 ω m g h 2 m π h l tanh 2 m π h l for a rectangular tank b2 ω m g h λ m tanh λ m for a 45 degree canal where λ m is the m th positive root of tanh λ tan λ which is independent of the tank size and can be pre determined therefore the dimensionless natural frequency is defined as b3 ω m ω m g h from eq b3 one may find that ω m is related to a single non dimensional parameter h l for sloshing within a rectangular container and is a constant for sloshing within a 45 degree canal for sloshing in a wedge shaped container with converging or diverging side walls ω m is related to non dimensional parameters λ and α 
23542,the paper investigates natural frequencies and mode shapes of liquid sloshing within two dimensional baffled tanks with arbitrary geometries without taking into account viscosity and compressibility the fluid is considered to be potential the vibration amplitude is presumed to be little and hence a linear free surface condition is used the governing equations are solved using boundary element method bem where baffles are treated as two immersed adjacent layers the resulted problem after discretization is transformed into a standard matrix eigenvalue issue where only freedoms related to free surface are involved the bem approach is verified against analytical theories and existing numerical results natural frequencies of sloshing in tanks with a variety of shapes are studied the effect of horizontal and vertical baffles is thoroughly investigated and empirical formulas are proposed to calculate natural frequencies of rectangular tanks with baffles keywords 2 d sloshing boundary element method natural frequencies baffles empirical formulas 1 introduction sloshing has been a hot discussed topic for a long time due to the complexity of its physical mechanics and the significance in practical industrial issues it can be found in a wide range of applications for instance ships trucks and aircrafts generally speaking the sloshing phenomenon can be induced in a partially filled container subject to outer excitation violent liquid sloshing may cause the overturn of ships and may lead to severe damage to support structures jung et al 2015 existing researches into sloshing dynamics can be divided into three aspects inherent physical mechanics interaction with supporting containers and the measures of suppressing sloshing to dig the physical mechanics of sloshing in an analytical manner one usually omits the viscosity and complexity of fluid and simply the issue into a potential flow early research assumed the sloshing motion to be small and linearized the free surface boundary condition under such simplification a variety of analytical solution has been obtained which can be found in ibrahim 2005 some research used equivalent models ebrahimian et al 2014 such as some kind of spring systems using special treatments such as perturbation expansion some weak nonlinear effects can be considered within analytical or semi analytical approximation faltinsen and timokha 2002 wu 2007 faltinsen et al 2003 since theoretical method meets challenges from complex geometry and strong nonlinearity many researchers turned to laboratory experiments and numerical simulation in numerical study one solves laminar ns equations akyildiz 2012 and turbulence models such as rans les and vles liu et al 2016 jung et al 2015 with the aid of free surface processing techniques for instance vof mac level set and meshless methods such as sph cao et al 2014 and mps jena and biswal 2017 interaction between liquid sloshing and supporters involves the coupling motion of sloshing and supporters zhao et al 2014 serván camas et al 2016 sloshing in elastic tanks strand and faltinsen 2017 hwang et al 2016 deng and yue 2017 sloshing induced hydrodynamic loads upon container structures li et al 2014 graczyk and moan 2008 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 etc under the assumption of potential theory and linearity certain analytical solutions can be obtained strand and faltinsen 2017 hu et al 2016 however since these issues are even more complicated than the physical mechanics of sloshing numerical and experimental methods are intensively adopted as most of the time sloshing brings hazards to support structures researchers are seeking effective methods of suppressing liquid sloshing under various circumstances one of the most convenient methods is to use baffles during years a number of studies have been conducted on the sloshing reduction effects of various types of baffles for instance xue and lin 2011 used the virtual boundary force vbf method to study viscous liquid sloshing in a tank with internal baffles of different shapes and arrangements wang et al 2016 numerically studied the effects of t shaped baffles on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks by means of experiments xue et al 2017 investigated the suppressing effects of vertical baffles cho et al 2017 studied the sloshing reduction effect of horizontal porous baffles in the context of linear potential theory and a bem approach with the assistance of modern computational and experimental techniques a wide range of achievements have been obtained in academia however the progress in industrial application is slow by contrast without the help of numerical and experimental tools it is still difficult to predict hydrodynamic load at resonant sloshing especially when coupled with violent transient action like slamming in general the sloshing induced load is strongly depended on the relationship between the frequency of the outer excitation and the natural frequency of sloshing usually special care should be paid in industrial issues when the frequency of outer excitation approaches natural sloshing frequencies therefore it is of great importance to obtain natural sloshing frequencies during design stages or safety assessment by far the understanding of natural sloshing is still not enough when baffles exist since realistic containers can have arbitrary shapes natural sloshing modes within realistic tanks are usually difficult to obtain using analytical methods faltinsen and timokha 2002 proposed an analytical method for determining natural sloshing modes and frequencies in two dimensional tanks and used the method to study natural sloshing in a prismatic tank associated with liquefied natural gas lng containers yet it is still difficult to predict natural sloshing modes and frequencies of a baffled tank this paper investigates 2 d natural sloshing frequencies and mode shapes of tanks in a variety of outlines with and without baffles the viscosity and compressibility of fluid is omitted and a bem approach is adopted to solve the resulted laplace system using the strategy of sygulski 2011 the baffles are treated as double layers immersed in liquid and no zoning method is employed the bem approach is validated against existing analytical and numerical results before being applied to the determination of natural sloshing features natural frequencies obtained with various tank outlines are compared with the ones of equivalent rectangular tanks on the foundation of a number of simulations two empirical formulas are proposed to calculate natural frequencies of rectangular tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles which can be referred to by industrial application 2 two dimensional sloshing problem with artificial damping fig 1 shows the sketch of a two dimensional sloshing problem in general the shape of the tank can be arbitrary without loss of generality a horizontal annular tank is depicted in fig 1 giving a discontinuous free surface boundary a cartesian coordinate system is originated at the center of the undisturbed free surface with an upright z direction no matter whether inner members baffles exist or not the boundary of fluid domain ω t is composed of the solid moving boundary ω s and the free surface boundary ω f as are depicted in fig 1 a horizontal displacement excitation x s a cos ω t is imposed on the solid tank to make sloshing stable and harmonic generally speaking the fluid domain ω t changes with time making the sloshing problem difficult to solve since this research is concerned about the natural frequencies of sloshing phenomena the surface displacement η is assumed to be little and therefore ω t ω further the fluid is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational so a velocity potential φ exists and satisfies the continuity equation 1 δ φ 0 in ω the solid boundary condition is written as 2 φ n u s n on ω s where n is the outward unit vector normal to the solid boundary the boundary velocity u s x s 0 a ω sin ω t 0 on free surface the linearized kinematic and dynamic conditions hold which are written as 3 φ z η t on ω f 4 φ t g η 0 on ω f taking time derivative to eq 4 and using the relationship of eq 3 a unified free surface condition is given by 5 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 on ω f it should be noted that the potential theory i e eqs 1 4 does not include any energy dissipation and will lead to a singular solution when the excitation frequency ω equals one of the natural frequencies of the sloshing flow i e ω n therefore to avoid the numerical divergence around frequency ω n an artificial damping term must be introduced cho et al 2005 utilized a time derivation term μ φ t to avoid the singular result at frequency ω n which is employed in this paper the dynamic pressure is given by the linearized bernoulli equation and is written as 6 p ρ φ t in ω where ρ denotes the fluid density the entire force resultant f r acting on the tank wall is given by 7 f r ω s p n ⅆ s 3 bem approach in frequency domain the boundary element method a widely used approach to the laplace equation is on the basis of the green formula which is given by 8 σ x 0 φ x 0 ω φ x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ x n ⅆ s x in ω here σ x 0 is related to the surface corner of domain ω for instance σ equals 1 for x 0 ω ω and 0 5 for x 0 on the smooth boundary of ω g x x 0 is the so called green function which satisfies 9 2 g x x 0 δ x x 0 in ω where δ x is the dirac delta function there are various green functions for different issues and the most widely used ones are g x x 0 1 2 π ln x x 0 and g x x 0 1 4 π x x 0 under two dimensional and three dimensional space respectively since this paper studies the two dimensional sloshing problem green function g x x 0 1 2 π ln x x 0 is adopted the thought underlying eq 8 is that the velocity potential of any position can be expressed as the superposition of the ones at the domain boundary using this fact only discretization upon ω which is illustrated in fig 2 is required it is worth noticing that the baffles in this approach are expressed as two adjacent layers and therefore no zoning method is required sygulski 2011 let r i j denote x i x j σ i φ i and δ s i represent σ x i φ x i and ⅆ s x i respectively the discretized form of eq 8 is written as 10 σ i φ i 1 2 π j 1 j i n φ j n ln r i j ln r i j φ j n δ s j for any x i x j ω it should be mentioned that eq 10 corresponds to a zero order approximation of the boundary integral high order approximation can be acquired by assuming φ to be a polynomial function of local coordinates and performing gauss legendre integrals after coordinate transform high order integral is more accurate yet it may require information of additional nodes and is more complex in program design by comparison zero order approach can be robust and easily realized which has been verified and widely adopted by commercial potential theory solvers such as sesam wadam one disadvantage of zero order approximation is low precision however this can be overcome by improving element number which will not cause a significant computational cost in 2 d space in addition under a dense meshing eq 10 becomes a standard gauss cauchy integral which agrees with the meaning of the green theorem and the green function induced integral singularity is prevented by letting j i in eq 10 using eqs 2 and 5 the second term of the right side of eq 10 is formulated as 11 j 1 j i n ln r i j φ j n δ s j j i x j ω s ln r i j a ω sin ω t n x j δ s j j i x j ω f ln r i j 1 g 2 φ j t 2 δ s j substituting eq 11 into eq 10 the green formula ends up with the matrix equation 12 m 2 φ t 2 kφ f where 13 φ φ 1 φ 2 φ n t 14 m i j 1 g ln r i j δ s j if i j and x j ω f 0 if i j or x j ω s 15 k i j n ln r i j δ s j if i j 2 π σ i if i j 16 f i a ω sin ω t j i x j ω s ln r i j n x j δ s j to avoid the singularity at ω ω n the damping matrix c c 1 m is adopted and eq 12 is rewritten as 17 m 2 φ t 2 c φ t kφ f from eq 14 one may notice that the element of matrix m is bound to be 0 unless its column position corresponds to a free surface node x j ω f realizing this fact the matrix size of eq 17 can be reduced through the following procedure first decompose eq 17 as 18 m f 0 2 φ f t 2 2 φ s t 2 c 1 m f 0 φ f t φ s t k φ f φ s f where m f contains the non zero components of m φ f and φ s are the velocity potential of nodes at the free surface boundary and solid boundary respectively second multiply both sides of eq 18 by k 1 which gives 19 k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 c 1 k 1 m f φ f t φ f φ s k 1 f finally by introducing the conversion matrix t e 0 0 0 where e is the unit matrix eq 19 is simplified as 20 t k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 c 1 t k 1 m f φ f t φ f t k 1 f 3 1 free oscillation problem the natural frequencies of sloshing can be obtained by studying the free oscillation problem let c 1 0 and f 0 the free oscillation system is governed by 21 t k 1 m f 2 φ f t 2 φ f 0 let φ ϕ sin ω t and φ f ϕ f sin ω t and therefore eq 21 can be reformulated as 22 t k 1 m f ϕ f 1 ω 2 ϕ f by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix t k 1 m f one can obtain the natural frequencies ω n and the vibration shapes ϕ f n of the free surface using eq 19 the vibration shape of the entire system is given by 23 ϕ n ω n 2 k 1 m f ϕ f n 3 2 forced oscillation problem with damping differing from oscillation without energy dissipation the existence of damping term will induce a phase difference between the excitation and response let f f ω sin ω t where f i a j i x j ω s ln r i j n x j δ s j see eq 16 φ f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t and φ ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t and therefore eq 20 is rewritten as 24 ω 2 a f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t c 1 ω a f ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t ω f f sin ω t where a f t k 1 m f and f f t k 1 f eq 24 can be decomposed into two equations as 25 ω 2 a f ϕ f sin c 1 ω a f ϕ f cos ϕ f sin ω f f ω 2 a f ϕ f cos c 1 ω a f ϕ f sin ϕ f cos 0 generally ϕ f sin and ϕ f cos can be written as the superposition of ϕ f n as follows 26 ϕ f sin n α n ϕ f n ϕ f cos n β n ϕ f n by substituting eq 26 into eq 25 and multiplying both sides by ϕ f m t the matrix equation eq 25 is simplified as 27 ω 2 α m c 1 ω β m ω m 2 α m ω ω m 2 q m ω 2 β m c 1 ω α m ω m 2 β m 0 it should be noted that the orthogonality of ϕ f n and the relationship ϕ f m t a f ϕ f m 1 ω m 2 ϕ f m 2 see eq 22 are used in order to obtain eq 27 q m ϕ f m t f f ϕ f m 2 and denotes the euclidean norm eq 27 gives 28 α m ω m 2 ω 2 p m β m ω c 1 p m where 29 p m ω ω m 2 q m ω m 2 ω 2 2 ω 2 c 1 2 by now the velocity potential on free surface has been obtained and is written as 30 φ f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t m α m ϕ f m sin ω t n β m ϕ f m cos ω t the relationship between φ f and φ is revealed by eq 19 replacing φ f with ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t and φ with ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t eq 19 is written as 31 ω 2 k 1 m f ϕ f sin sin ω t ϕ f cos cos ω t c 1 ω k 1 m f ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t ω k 1 f sin ω t eq 31 gives 32 ϕ sin ω k 1 m f c 1 ϕ f cos ω ϕ f sin k 1 f ϕ cos ω k 1 m f c 1 ϕ f sin ω ϕ f cos using eq 32 the velocity potential of the entire system is written as 33 φ ϕ sin sin ω t ϕ cos cos ω t the local dynamic pressure and free surface elevation are formulated as 34 p ρ ω ϕ sin cos ω t ϕ cos sin ω t 35 η ω g ϕ f sin cos ω t ϕ f cos sin ω t hence the entire loads upon the tank including the sloshing induced force and moment are written as 36 f x ω

and contrasting the bem s results against the theoretical ones as well as ones obtained by other numerical methods 4 1 natural frequencies subsection 3 1 gives the bem approach to the free sloshing issue and the method of determining the natural frequencies ω s here the numerical dimensionless frequencies predicted by the bem approach denoted as ω n s are compared against the theoretical ones denoted as ω t s or ones that have already been obtained by other researchers five categories of tanks are selected a rectangular tank a tank bounded by two walls each inclined at 45 to the vertical axis an ellipse outlined tank a wedged shaped tank with converging sidewalls and a wedged shaped tank with diverging sidewalls see fig 3 the formulas of natural frequencies are listed in appendix a one may also refer to chapter 1 of ibrahim 2005 appendix b introduces the non dimensionalization of the natural frequency for the conciseness of the context they are not explained here the node numbers are 100 on the solid wall boundries and 500 on the free surface boundary tables 1 and 2 list the dimensionless frequencies of sloshing in a rectangular tank and in a 45 degree channel respectively for the purpose of validating the bem approach the relative deviation between the theoretical and numerical results up to the 6 th order is analyzed table 3 gives the dimensionless frequencies of sloshing in a circular tank i e a b r in fig 3c and verifies them against the results of mciver 1989 tables 4 and 5 list natural frequencies of sloshing in wedge shaped tanks with converging and diverging side walls calculated using bem and theoretical formulas one can only find small deviations under various dimensionless parameters in tables 1 5 this indicates that the bem approach is capable of reasonably predicting the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing 4 2 frequency response of the relative free surface elevation without baffles subsection 3 2 gives the way of determining the frequency response of various variables such as the surface elevation pressure and sloshing induced load upon the container with damping effects taken into account to validate subsection 3 2 relative free surface responses defined as η a obtained by the bem approach of this paper are compared against the numerical results of cho et al 2005 which studied the frequency response problem of sloshing in rectangular containers with and without baffles using the fem method this subsection deals with the conditions without baffles while the cases with baffles will be discussed in the next subsection the tank length l of the rectangular tank varied in cho s study and the filling depth h was 1 m to make the damping effect of this subsection identical to that of cho et al 2005 c 1 equals the parameter μ of cho et al 2005 the node numbers are 100 on the solid wall boundries and 500 on the free surface boundary fig 4 gives the frequency response of the relative surface elevation with different c 1 s where h l 1 2 and the concerned surface elevation is at the left end of free surface i e x l 2 it can be observed that the results of this paper agree well with those of cho et al 2005 and that an increase of the damping coefficient leads to the reduction of the response however the damping coefficient is found to have little impact on the value of natural frequency fig 5 illustrates the frequency response of the relative surface elevation nearby the fundamental natural frequency with various depth length ratios the damping coefficient c 1 equals 0 05 in fig 5 one can observe that the bem results of this paper show good accordance with those of cho et al 2005 and that the depth length ratio affects the sloshing dynamics in both natural frequencies and maximum response amplitudes figs 4 and 5 demonstrate that the bem approach is able to give reliable prediction of the frequency response 4 3 frequency response of the relative free surface elevation with baffles the content of this subsection is similar to subsection 4 2 except that the container here owns inner baffles the sketch of the baffled tank is shown in fig 3d the baffles are installed on both tank walls with the same amount on each side the corresponding baffles on the left and right side wall share the same installation height the installation spacing on each side wall is uniform with respect to the liquid filling height all the baffles have the same extension l 2 m h 1 m and l b 0 5 m the damping coefficient is c 1 0 05 fig 6 depicts the frequency response of the relative surface elevation nearby the fundamental natural frequency obtained with various baffle numbers it should be noted that the baffle number here stands for the amount of baffles on each side namely one baffle actually means one baffle on each side wall of the tank as can be seen in fig 6 the bem approach agrees very well with the numerical results of cho et al 2005 fig 7 selects the one baffle case and gives the response of the relative surface elevation in the vicinity of the leading natural frequency with various baffle heights by comparing fig 7 with the zero baffle case see fig 4a one can find that baffles nearby the tank bottom for instance fig 7c hardly affect the response by contrast baffles nearby the free surface for instance fig 7a notably reduce the leading natural frequency of sloshing and meanwhile lower the response amplitude from figs 6 and 7 it is proved that the bem approach of this paper can properly analyze the influence of baffles 5 simulation and discussion in fact realistic tanks own complex outlines and are often installed with inner members in this section the influence of the variable liquid depth and inner baffles on the fundamental natural frequency of sloshing is studied 5 1 influence of variable liquid depth sloshing with variable liquid depth can often be found in lng carrying tanks or some ballast water tanks located at the fore or aft part of ships the lng carrying tank see fig 3e is often installed with upper and lower inclined plates which should be taken into account while computing natural frequencies the inclined plate is characterized by its inclined angle with respect to the horizontal axis for instance α d and its extension along the vertical axis for instance h d the liquid filling within a lng tank can be divided into three categories h h d h d h h u and h h u fig 8 depicts the dimensionless fundamental natural frequencies with various α d s when h h d it should be noted that the dark solid line without any symbol denoted as rectangular tank in the figure represents the theoretical result of sloshing in an equivalent rectangular tank with tank length taken as l h and filling depth as h it can be observed in fig 8 that the existence of lower inclined plates reduces the fundamental natural frequencies moreover a small α d will enhance the reduction yet the reduction becomes inconspicuous with the enlargement of the tank length l h fig 9 shows the fundamental natural frequencies changing with different h d h s when h d h h u and α d 45 as the inclined angle is fixed h d directly reflects the size of the inclined plates in fig 9 one can observe that the size of the lower inclined plates seems to have little influence on the leading natural frequencies and the natural frequencies show little deviation from the ones obtained with corresponding equivalent rectangular tanks this result is not beyond expectation bearing in mind that sloshing is inherently motion of fluid particles nearby free surface in tanks finally when h u h the influence of the size h u and the inclined angle α u of the upper plates is studied in figs 10 and 11 respectively to preclude the impact of lower inclined plates α d is set to be 90 in figs 10 and 11 fig 10 reveals that the upper inclined plates increase the fundamental natural frequencies and the degree of increase becomes obvious with the decline of α u yet becomes negligible with the growth of l h despite certain deviation can be observed between sloshing with and without upper inclined plates the size h u of upper inclined plates hardly affects the first natural frequencies since the lines obtained with various h u h seem to be completely coincident the deviation is actually caused by the inclined angle which is fixed to be 45 throughout the simulation of fig 11 from figs 8 11 it is found that the inclined angle is the main reason that the fundamental frequency is changed whereas the size of the upper and lower inclined plates hardly influences the fundamental frequency for realistic lng tankers l h h is usually large when h h d and under such condition it is reasonable to treat the actual container as a h l h rectangular tank when computing the fundamental natural frequency the rectangular tank approximation also applies when h d h h u however the fundamental natural frequency predicted by the rectangular tank approximation should be multiplied by a factor of 1 05 1 1 when h h u fig 3f gives a schematic drawing of the tank located at the fore ship if one omits the round corner connecting the tank bottom and the inclined side wall the tank can be treated as a lng tank with h h d for this sort of tank the leading natural frequency obtained using the rectangular tank approximation should be corrected with a factor of 0 83 0 95 depending on the value of α d the sketch of an ellipse shaped container is illustrated in fig 3c natural frequencies of sloshing within this category of tank are determined by the outline parameter a and b and filling depth h fig 12 displays the fundamental natural frequencies of sloshing in ellipse shaped containers and makes comparison against those obtained within rectangular tanks whose filling depth and length are determined by h and the realistic surface extension at the filling level h one can observe in fig 12 that the leading natural frequencies of sloshing in an ellipse tank and in a rectangular tank are very close to each other 5 2 influence of horizontal baffles a tank with horizontal baffles is illustrated in fig 3d in this subsection we are only concerned about the condition of one baffle at one side wall single baffle and two baffles at both side walls double baffle first natural frequencies of tanks with horizontal baffles of various heights and lengths are studied the case parameters of this subsection are listed in table 6 fig 13 gives leading natural sloshing frequencies with various baffle lengths and heights as is shown in fig 13 the existence of horizontal baffle slows the sloshing rate this suppressing effect of horizontal baffle becomes significant with the growth of baffle length and height namely the vertical distance measured from bottom in addition it is found that for narrow tall tanks large h l ratio the height of horizontal baffle needs to be large enough to make notable influence upon the natural frequencies for instance the baffle height should be larger than 0 7h to obtain visible changing of natural frequencies in fig 13e by comparison a baffle height of 0 3h is enough in fig 13a fig 14 displays free surface sloshing mode shapes of various baffled tanks generally speaking a horizontal baffle tends to enhance the surface motion right above it and suppress the vibration of free surface elsewhere the enhancement is reflected by the mode shape values of the free surface above the baffle which are close to unity whereas for a baffle free rectangular tank 1 only happens at the intersection between free surface and side wall with the growth of baffle height and length the enhancement and suppression effect becomes clear and the mode shapes of baffled tanks see distinct deviation from the one of a baffle free rectangular tank which is similar to the hb 0 1h curve in fig 14a other interesting phenomena include 1 in fig 14a for single baffle condition the growth of baffle height makes the zero point of surface vibration get closer to the baffled wall 2 although mode shapes are asymmetry for single baffle condition and symmetry for double baffle condition the two groups of mode shapes resemble each other in certain regions for instance the curves within the dashed rectangles of fig 14a and b are similar to each other 3 when the baffle is nearby free surface e g hb 0 99h the mode shape curve can be divided into three parts as is depicted in fig 15 part i values closed to unity part ii a steep dropping down from 1 to about 0 and part iii values nearby 0 besides the extension of part i ii approximately equals the baffle length for slide rectangular tanks the dimensionless natural frequencies are determined by h l which should be corrected in baffled tanks to account for the influence of inner members eq 39 gives an empirical approach for the determination of the first dimensionless sloshing frequency in a rectangular tank with horizontal baffles 39 ω m g h ω m π h l e f f tanh π h l e f f where the determination of h l e f f is briefly introduced as follows first solving h l e f f s from ω m s using eq 39 taking fig 13 a for instance the resulted h l e f f h l s are shown in fig 16 second guessing how h l e f f h l changes with respect to relative baffle height i e h b h in fig 16 we select an exponential type function f 1 e a 1 h b h b e a to ensure f 1 when the baffle is at the bottom third determining how a and b change with h l and l b l using a typical polynomial fitting approach such as the least square method finally the fitness results can be expressed as 40 h l e f f h l 1 e a l b l h l 1 h b h b l b l h l e a l b l h l for single baffle condition 41 h l e f f h l 1 e c l b l h l 1 h b h d

squares due to error r square square of the correlation between the response values and the predicted response values adj r square degrees of freedom adjusted r square and rmse root mean squared error in table 7 sses and rmses are close to 0 yet r squares and adj r squares tend to 1 which indicates eq 39 45 give excellent approximation of the simulation data fig 17 validates eq 39 by directly making comparison against numerical results obtained by bem approach and good agreement can be observed 5 3 influence of vertical baffles in this subsection we are concerned about sloshing in a rectangular tank with a number of vertical baffles on bottom a series of tests are conducted using the bem method which are listed in table 8 fig 18 gives leading natural sloshing frequencies with various baffle lengths and numbers like horizontal baffles vertical baffles also lower sloshing frequencies the length of the baffle is the dominate measurement of its contribution to sloshing frequencies and the leading natural frequency declines fast with the growth of baffle length by comparison the leading natural frequency seems to be less sensitive to the number of vertical baffles especially for a narrow tall tank large h l ratio free surface sloshing mode shapes of rectangular tanks with vertical baffles are shown in fig 19 where l b denotes the baffle length with the increase of baffle length the mode shape displays obvious distinction against the one of a baffle free tank in addition mode shapes of tanks with different number of vertical baffles are also different generally a vertical baffle tends to make the mode shape curve steep right above it and flat elsewhere following this discipline one can easily identify the number of baffles from free surface sloshing mode shape curves eq 46 gives an empirical formula for the computing the leading sloshing frequency of a rectangular tank with vertical baffles 46 ω m g h ω m π h l e f f tanh π h l e f f

the goodness of curve fitting is listed in table 9 fig 20 contrasts natural frequencies predicted by eq 46 against those by the bem approach of section 3 from table 9 and fig 20 one can observe a good curve fitting performance 6 conclusions on the basis of above simulations and discussions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the bem approach is capable of predicting natural sloshing frequencies and mode shapes precisely 2 for prismatic tanks the inclined angle is the dominate factor during the determination of the fundamental frequencies whereas the size of the upper and lower inclined plates have little influence for most cases the leading natural frequencies of prismatic tanks can be approximated by those of corresponding equivalent rectangular tanks yet a correct factor of 1 05 1 1 is required when filling depth exceeds the lower edge of upper inclined plates 3 the first natural frequencies of ellipse shaped containers can be approximated by those of equivalent rectangular tanks 4 for a wedged tank like fig 3f the fundamental natural frequency can be approximated by the one of an equivalent rectangular tanks with a correct of 0 83 0 95 5 baffles reduce natural sloshing frequencies and change sloshing mode shapes of free surface in a variety of ways the degree of reduction and variation is enhanced with the growth of baffle lengths and heights 6 eq 39 and eq 46 can be employed as a quick method to estimate leading natural frequencies of sloshing in rectangular baffled tanks acknowledgement this work was financed by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51609101 the natural science foundation of fujian province of china grant no 2017j01701 and 2017j05085 appendix a theoretical natural frequencies of sloshing the natural frequencies of sloshing in tanks of various outlines have been widely studied analytical solutions have been obtained under certain circumstances ibrahim 2005 for sloshing in a rectangular tank see fig 3a the natural frequencies are written as a1 ω m g k m tanh k m h m 1 2 where k m is 2 m 1 π l for asymmetric modes and 2 m π l for symmetric modes for sloshing in a 45 degree canal see fig 3b the natural frequencies are a2 ω m g k m tanh k m h for symmetric modes a3 ω m g k m coth k m h for asymmetric modes here for symmetric modes k m is the m th positive root of eq a4 yet for asymmetric modes k m is the m th positive root of eq a5 a4 tanh k m h tan k m h for symmetric modes a5 tanh k m h tan k m h for asymmetric modes for sloshing within a wedge shaped container with converging side walls see fig 3 g natural frequencies of axial coordinate free modes are formulated as ibrahim 2005 a6 ω m m g 2 α h λ 1 λ m α 1 λ m α where λ h 0 h similarly the natural frequencies of sloshing in a wedge shaped container with diverging side walls are written as a7 ω m m g 2 α h 1 λ m α 1 λ m α appendix b nondimensionalization of the natural frequency of free sloshing for the convenience of comparison the natural frequency ω m is transformed into the dimensionless form taking symmetric modes for instance the natural frequencies of sloshing in a rectangular container and in a 45 degree channel are written as b1 ω m g h 2 m π h l tanh 2 m π h l for a rectangular tank b2 ω m g h λ m tanh λ m for a 45 degree canal where λ m is the m th positive root of tanh λ tan λ which is independent of the tank size and can be pre determined therefore the dimensionless natural frequency is defined as b3 ω m ω m g h from eq b3 one may find that ω m is related to a single non dimensional parameter h l for sloshing within a rectangular container and is a constant for sloshing within a 45 degree canal for sloshing in a wedge shaped container with converging or diverging side walls ω m is related to non dimensional parameters λ and α 
23543,in recent years the increasing demand for a reduction of carbon emission has made hydrodynamic design and the optimization of hull design more important for appropriate hydrodynamic design the added resistance needs to be predicted however as existing methods including computer simulations or experiments require considerable amounts of time and money it is difficult to consider the prediction result at the initial design stage therefore in this paper we propose a prediction method that can be used in the initial design stage for predicting the added resistance in waves thereby contributing to the optimization of hull design and saving time and money the proposed method is a nonlinear mathematical function and is based on genetic programming for verification the predicted results are compared with the experimental results and the strip theory results keywords hydrodynamic design added resistance genetic programming 1 introduction in recent decades people have become increasingly aware of the need for environmental protection and one of the most important environmental issues considered today is global warming although there are several factors that cause global warming carbon emission is considered the most powerful trigger therefore many countries and industries are striving to reduce carbon emissions by using new methods materials and regulations from this perspective the international maritime organization suggested that all ships manufactured since 2013 meet the energy efficiency design index requirement to alleviate carbon emission further currently industry 4 0 is trending globally which implies that the industry is attempting to maximize the use of automation and connectivity maximized automation and connectivity are achieved by using the internet of things iot and artificial intelligence ai a prominent characteristic of ai is that it collects and analyzes data from various sources and then makes decisions on its own since the advent of industry 4 0 many researchers have attempted to apply iot and ai to their industries consequently the shipbuilding industry s interest in improving operational efficiency by using iot and ai has increased to increase operational efficiency the hull form needs to be optimized by considering the added resistance which is a part of a ship s total resistance caused by incident waves because a ship is likely to experience 10 30 more resistance in a seaway than in a calm sea because of such added resistance péres 2006 in traditional methods the optimization of ship geometry does not consider the effects of the wind and the waves although it considers speed trim and draft under calm weather therefore we need to take into account the effects of waves for optimizing ship geometry by predicting the added resistance furthermore traditional methods yield suboptimal performance because they optimize the ship hull by considering design conditions such as the specified speed trim and draft and calm weather i e without wind and waves however in real life most vessels operate during windy weather and are affected by waves therefore the potential suboptimal performance of these methods leads to economic losses and considering outdoor design specifications would be advantageous gonzalo 2011 however as the traditional methods of calculating the added resistance require considerable amounts of time money and manpower it is difficult to consider the added resistance in the initial design stage therefore in this paper to consider the added resistance in the initial design stage an alternative method of predicting the added resistance is proposed by using a genetic programming gp system developed with a commercial software program matlab methods using gp require less money and time than conventional methods because the use of gp merely exploits the certified data of similar ships which can be obtained from experiments or widely used equations to estimate the added resistance instead of using experiments or calculating functions that require considerable amounts of money and time the proposed method consists of an approximate nonlinear mathematical function and the gp results to the best of our knowledge few studies using gp as a key technique have focused on the prediction of the added resistance therefore in this study we investigate the applicability of gp to the added resistance prediction further to verify the accuracy of the predicted results these results are compared with the experimental data and the strip theory data the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the concept of added resistance the general methods used for predicting this resistance and the methods considered in this study are introduced as the focus of this study is gp gp s basic theory and its application in similar cases are explained in section 3 section 4 describes the proposed method the test ship s parameters the gp process and parameters and the validation of the proposed method finally section 5 presents the conclusion 2 added resistance in waves the ocean almost always has windy weather and waves and these inevitably trigger more resistance than that expected during calm weather which is usually assumed for the optimization of hull design this difference in resistance is called the added resistance therefore predicting the added resistance improves the accuracy of a ship s total resistance prediction thereby helping to optimize the ship hull design further the prediction of the added resistance is used for solving certain problems related to the weather margin weather routing and performance analysis alexandersson 2009 as the calculation of the weather margin and weather routing requires the total resistance of a ship and the added resistance prediction increases the accuracy of the total resistance prediction in particular it is important and profitable for ship owners to optimize travel routes because this results in lower operational costs on the other hand performance analysis deals with the prediction of the added resistance as a measurement of a ship s performance for example tsujimoto et al 2008 and ichinose et al 2012 studied the added resistance to estimate the decrease in ship speed in actual seas 2 1 methods to calculate added resistance in waves thus far some methods have been developed to predict the added resistance in waves these methods can be divided into two main categories far field and near field methods the far field method takes into account diffracted and radiated wave energy and momentum flux at infinity to predict the added resistance and then calculates the steady added resistive force using the change rate of momentum in contrast in the case of the near field method the added resistance is obtained as a steady second order force the near field method integrates the hydrodynamic force and the steady second order force acting on the wetted ship surface the far field and near field methods were first introduced in the 1950s by maruo 1957 and in the 1970s by boese 1970 respectively since then these methods have been considerably improved by several researchers some examples of these improved methods are gerritsma and beukelman s method gerritsma and beukelman 1972 boese s method and faltinsen s asymptotic method faltinsen et al 1980 gerritsma and beukelman s method which is called the radiated energy method calculates the added resistance by determining the radiated energy of the damping waves as it assumes a constant forward ship speed the surge motion is neglected but the heave and pitch motion is calculated using the strip theory boese s method which is called the pressure integration method integrates the total linear pressure over the ship hull under calm wave conditions to obtain the mean force in the heading direction of a ship these two methods are implemented to deal with radiation induced resistance whereas faltinsen s asymptotic method is used in cases of diffraction induced resistance and a lack of ship motion the added resistance is usually predicted by using these methods with computer programs or experimental methods however these processes which use computer programs such as computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and model experiments have certain disadvantages in particular both the simulations and the experiments require considerable amounts of time money and manpower further although these methods consider many alternative design cases the prediction results of the cfd simulations or the experiments always have a few errors in other words it is difficult to apply the prediction results to the initial design stage therefore a new method that consumes less time and money to predict the added resistance is required to consider a hydrodynamic design in the initial design stage 3 genetic programming gp as mentioned in section 1 ai has recently attracted considerable attention because of its ability to collect and or analyze data by itself from this aspect gp can be considered suitable for use in our study because of its ability to generate a new function on its own by using the stored data gp has a high level symbolic representation and an evolutionary algorithm process it is a modified form of the genetic algorithm ga therefore the basic concept of gp and ga is the same as that of darwin s theory survival of the fittest however note that gp uses more complex structures than ga while ga uses a string of numbers to represent a solution gp creates computer programs with a tree structure in other words ga s output is a quantity but gp s output is a program in the case of design optimization a program represents an empirical model to be used for the approximation of response functions in the original optimization problem the main purpose of gp is to provide highly fit computer programs to solve a problem these randomly generated programs are general and hierarchical varying in size and shape gp finds near global solutions by searching all possible solutions and then retaining several solutions that may have a high potential to be close to the minima local or global the main advantages of using gp for symbolic regression are that the size and shape of the approximation function do not need to be specified beforehand and that specific knowledge of a problem can be included in the search process with appropriate mathematical functions therefore gp has been applied to many systems kinnear 1994 symbolic regression in gp koza 1992 refers to the process of discovering both the form of the approximation function and its tuning parameters as the gp representation consists of tree nodes and genetic operators that only affect the tree structures it is difficult to find numerical constants using gp although gp can generate these constants e g by dividing one variable by itself the process becomes very inefficient evett and fernandez 1998 therefore in this study the tuning parameters are independent from the gp s evolutionary process but are determined by nonlinear least squares surface fitting using an optimization method the flowchart of gp is shown in fig 1 as gp is derived from ga gp and ga have similar evolutionary processes an initial population is randomly created from many available mathematical functions during the evolutionary process a fitness value is assigned to trees and is then evaluated and trees are evolved by genetic operators such as selection crossover and mutation as mentioned above this evolution process follows the darwinian principle of survival and reproduction of the fittest see fig 2 researchers have attempted to apply ga or gp to ship manufacturing processes for instance um et al 2015 estimated weight of upper structures of fpso through gp and gammon 2011 optimized a fishing vessel s hull form by using multi objective ga here the multiple objectives considered were resistance seakeeping and stability although gammon s study included resistance as one of the objectives the researcher did not consider to the added resistance in contrast the current study concentrates on the prediction of the added resistance encouraging ships designers to take into account the added resistance at an early design stage with less effort and resources 4 alternative prediction method for added resistance in this paper a new prediction method for added resistance in waves is proposed this new method is considerably different from the general prediction methods mentioned in section 2 as the proposed method is derived from gp as discussed in section 3 to verify the accuracy of the new prediction method experimental data strip theory results and the results of the proposed method are compared 4 1 ship geometry to compare the prediction results three case studies which consisted of three different bulbous bows were considered and the ship geometry was obtained from an investigation kracht 1984 the three different bulbous bows were attached to a parent model vws 2388 model the three variants were classified as follows a bulbless bow variant 2388 0 a small bulbous bow variant 2388 2 and a moderate bulbous bow 2388 3 the ship model mod 2388 was a fast cargo liner of the 1970s and the purpose of the design of this model and its variants was research and investigation further model 2388 0 bulbless was considered the parent model in kracht s investigation but as its variants were economically unviable for any operational profile it was used only for the purpose of comparison in this study instead model 2388 3 moderate bulb was considered the parent geometry for all of the comparisons and results in this work the main features and the bulbous bow parameters of the variants are presented in table 1 the parameters and the shapes of the bulbous bows are described in table 2 figs 3 5 show the lines of the considered variants for the ship 4 2 proposed alternative prediction method the process flow of the proposed prediction method for added resistance is described in fig 5 conventional processes estimate the added resistance by using equations with the far field or near field method which calculates the added resistance directly in contrast the proposed method exploits the data obtained from a conventional method or experiments to estimate the added resistance by using gp in this study experimental data kracht 1984 were used as the training data to generate an estimation equation for the added resistance then the added resistance from the equation was compared with the test data calculated using a conventional method experiments and strip theory the process mainly consisted of the following three steps preparing design variables and objective developing an equation from gp and verifying the performance of the equation as the added resistance is derived mainly from the reflection of short head waves the added resistance depends on the shape of the waterline in the bow resolution mepc 2013 msc mepc 2 circ 11 2012 therefore the length of the waterline the parameters of the bulbous bow and the ratio of the wave to the ship length were considered the design variables 4 2 1 prepared design variables and objectives the design variables and an objective are described in tables 3 and 4 froude number fn was considered for both the training data and the test data the training data consisted of 0 150 0 175 0 225 and 0 250 and the test data included 0 200 4 2 2 parameters for gp the gp parameters are shown in table 5 they were considered to be constant throughout the gp 4 2 3 learning process during the learning process a suitable tree structure for gp was determined using the training data then the fitness values root mean square rms errors and prediction values were evaluated the fitness values and rms errors are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively 4 2 4 test process the accuracy of the gp s tree structure was validated using the test data in this process the result of the gp was compared with the result of a model experiment test fn 0 200 the comparison is shown in fig 8 the trend of the prediction of the added resistance coefficient was similar in models 2388 0 2388 2 and 2388 3 4 2 5 determination of the approximation function after verifying the accuracy of the gp result the approximation function was determined the representation of this function used the same abbreviations as those listed in tables 3 and 4 the approximation function can be expressed as follows 1 y 5 467 e sin x 11 79 07 tanh x 11 79 07 tanh x 4 61 12 e x 4 x 3 12 79 cos x 11 x 6 tanh x 3 97 87 cos x 10 sin x 11 5 467 e x 10 sin x 6 0 03772 e x 11 x 1 x 2 x 11 42 86 4 3 validation of alternative prediction method in the verification process the gp result was compared with the result of the model experiment for evaluating the accuracy of the new function generated by gp further the results of the proposed prediction method experimental data and strip theory results were compared fn 0 250 fig 9 shows the differences in these three sets of data the proposed method and the experimental data exhibited similar values and trends but the strip theory yielded different values and trends therefore the performance of the proposed method was concluded to be better than that of the strip theory nevertheless there was a weak point in the proposed method according to fig 8 a model 2388 0 although a falling section wave to ship length ratio 0 75 appeared in the experiment result the falling section could not be covered by the proposed method because the proposed prediction method is one of the stochastic interpolation si however the entirety of trend of experimental data was eminently similar as shown figs 8 and 9 5 conclusions as current methods for added resistance prediction require a considerable amount of time and effort in this paper we proposed an alternative method for predicting the added resistance to save resources time money and or manpower in the proposed prediction method certified experimental data and gp were used as the training and test data and the tool to estimate the added resistance respectively however as it is unusual to estimate the added resistance with gp this paper focuses on the ability of gp to estimate the added resistance this method was applied to ship geometries with three bulbous bow types and the results of the prediction were compared with the experimental data and the strip theory results to verify the performance of the proposed method the nonlinear approximation function generated by gp yielded values similar to the experimental data moreover with respect to accuracy the approximation function was better than the strip theory in this study although four froude numbers and three types of ships total 12 cases were used as the training data to generate a new prediction function the function s accuracy was considerably high moreover the use of a significant quantity of data including either model ship data or real ship data contributed to improving the accuracy of the prediction function derived from gp thus it is possible to consider gp as an alternative prediction method of added resistance in the early design process because this method estimates the effect on the added resistance of hull changes sufficiently accurately in less time and at a low cost additional plans should be considered in future research first only one type of ship was considered in this study although there were slight differences in the bulbous bows therefore to determine whether the proposed method is applicable to various ship types we need to collect experimental data for various ships second the comparison of the gp results and the strip theory s results showed considerable differences as illustrated in fig 9 these differences may be attributed to the fact that strip theory is a two dimensional method thus results derived from a three dimensional panel method should be considered to improve the validity of the comparison finally it was found out that the drawback of the stochastic interpolation method gp we try to solve this point by using deep learning and machine learning the deep and machine learning is promising concept in ai technology and is considered as our next step to improve the proposed prediction method or framework acknowledgments this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit no nrf 2017r1c1b5015989 the ministry

less money and time than conventional methods because the use of gp merely exploits the certified data of similar ships which can be obtained from experiments or widely used equations to estimate the added resistance instead of using experiments or calculating functions that require considerable amounts of money and time the proposed method consists of an approximate nonlinear mathematical function and the gp results to the best of our knowledge few studies using gp as a key technique have focused on the prediction of the added resistance therefore in this study we investigate the applicability of gp to the added resistance prediction further to verify the accuracy of the predicted results these results are compared with the experimental data and the strip theory data the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the concept of added resistance the general methods used for predicting this resistance and the methods considered in this study are introduced as the focus of this study is gp gp s basic theory and its application in similar cases are explained in section 3 section 4 describes the proposed method the test ship s parameters the gp process and parameters and the validation of the proposed method finally section 5 presents the conclusion 2 added resistance in waves the ocean almost always has windy weather and waves and these inevitably trigger more resistance than that expected during calm weather which is usually assumed for the optimization of hull design this difference in resistance is called the added resistance therefore predicting the added resistance improves the accuracy of a ship s total resistance prediction thereby helping to optimize the ship hull design further the prediction of the added resistance is used for solving certain problems related to the weather margin weather routing and performance analysis alexandersson 2009 as the calculation of the weather margin and weather routing requires the total resistance of a ship and the added resistance prediction increases the accuracy of the total resistance prediction in particular it is important and profitable for ship owners to optimize travel routes because this results in lower operational costs on the other hand performance analysis deals with the prediction of the added resistance as a measurement of a ship s performance for example tsujimoto et al 2008 and ichinose et al 2012 studied the added resistance to estimate the decrease in ship speed in actual seas 2 1 methods to calculate added resistance in waves thus far some methods have been developed to predict the added resistance in waves these methods can be divided into two main categories far field and near field methods the far field method takes into account diffracted and radiated wave energy and momentum flux at infinity to predict the added resistance and then calculates the steady added resistive force using the change rate of momentum in contrast in the case of the near field method the added resistance is obtained as a steady second order force the near field method integrates the hydrodynamic force and the steady second order force acting on the wetted ship surface the far field and near field methods were first introduced in the 1950s by maruo 1957 and in the 1970s by boese 1970 respectively since then these methods have been considerably improved by several researchers some examples of these improved methods are gerritsma and beukelman s method gerritsma and beukelman 1972 boese s method and faltinsen s asymptotic method faltinsen et al 1980 gerritsma and beukelman s method which is called the radiated energy method calculates the added resistance by determining the radiated energy of the damping waves as it assumes a constant forward ship speed the surge motion is neglected but the heave and pitch motion is calculated using the strip theory boese s method which is called the pressure integration method integrates the total linear pressure over the ship hull under calm wave conditions to obtain the mean force in the heading direction of a ship these two methods are implemented to deal with radiation induced resistance whereas faltinsen s asymptotic method is used in cases of diffraction induced resistance and a lack of ship motion the added resistance is usually predicted by using these methods with computer programs or experimental methods however these processes which use computer programs such as computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and model experiments have certain disadvantages in particular both the simulations and the experiments require considerable amounts of time money and manpower further although these methods consider many alternative design cases the prediction results of the cfd simulations or the experiments always have a few errors in other words it is difficult to apply the prediction results to the initial design stage therefore a new method that consumes less time and money to predict the added resistance is required to consider a hydrodynamic design in the initial design stage 3 genetic programming gp as mentioned in section 1 ai has recently attracted considerable attention because of its ability to collect and or analyze data by itself from this aspect gp can be considered suitable for use in our study because of its ability to generate a new function on its own by using the stored data gp has a high level symbolic representation and an evolutionary algorithm process it is a modified form of the genetic algorithm ga therefore the basic concept of gp and ga is the same as that of darwin s theory survival of the fittest however note that gp uses more complex structures than ga while ga uses a string of numbers to represent a solution gp creates computer programs with a tree structure in other words ga s output is a quantity but gp s output is a program in the case of design optimization a program represents an empirical model to be used for the approximation of response functions in the original optimization problem the main purpose of gp is to provide highly fit computer programs to solve a problem these randomly generated programs are general and hierarchical varying in size and shape gp finds near global solutions by searching all possible solutions and then retaining several solutions that may have a high potential to be close to the minima local or global the main advantages of using gp for symbolic regression are that the size and shape of the approximation function do not need to be specified beforehand and that specific knowledge of a problem can be included in the search process with appropriate mathematical functions therefore gp has been applied to many systems kinnear 1994 symbolic regression in gp koza 1992 refers to the process of discovering both the form of the approximation function and its tuning parameters as the gp representation consists of tree nodes and genetic operators that only affect the tree structures it is difficult to find numerical constants using gp although gp can generate these constants e g by dividing one variable by itself the process becomes very inefficient evett and fernandez 1998 therefore in this study the tuning parameters are independent from the gp s evolutionary process but are determined by nonlinear least squares surface fitting using an optimization method the flowchart of gp is shown in fig 1 as gp is derived from ga gp and ga have similar evolutionary processes an initial population is randomly created from many available mathematical functions during the evolutionary process a fitness value is assigned to trees and is then evaluated and trees are evolved by genetic operators such as selection crossover and mutation as mentioned above this evolution process follows the darwinian principle of survival and reproduction of the fittest see fig 2 researchers have attempted to apply ga or gp to ship manufacturing processes for instance um et al 2015 estimated weight of upper structures of fpso through gp and gammon 2011 optimized a fishing vessel s hull form by using multi objective ga here the multiple objectives considered were resistance seakeeping and stability although gammon s study included resistance as one of the objectives the researcher did not consider to the added resistance in contrast the current study concentrates on the prediction of the added resistance encouraging ships designers to take into account the added resistance at an early design stage with less effort and resources 4 alternative prediction method for added resistance in this paper a new prediction method for added resistance in waves is proposed this new method is considerably different from the general prediction methods mentioned in section 2 as the proposed method is derived from gp as discussed in section 3 to verify the accuracy of the new prediction method experimental data strip theory results and the results of the proposed method are compared 4 1 ship geometry to compare the prediction results three case studies which consisted of three different bulbous bows were considered and the ship geometry was obtained from an investigation kracht 1984 the three different bulbous bows were attached to a parent model vws 2388 model the three variants were classified as follows a bulbless bow variant 2388 0 a small bulbous bow variant 2388 2 and a moderate bulbous bow 2388 3 the ship model mod 2388 was a fast cargo liner of the 1970s and the purpose of the design of this model and its variants was research and investigation further model 2388 0 bulbless was considered the parent model in kracht s investigation but as its variants were economically unviable for any operational profile it was used only for the purpose of comparison in this study instead model 2388 3 moderate bulb was considered the parent geometry for all of the comparisons and results in this work the main features and the bulbous bow parameters of the variants are presented in table 1 the parameters and the shapes of the bulbous bows are described in table 2 figs 3 5 show the lines of the considered variants for the ship 4 2 proposed alternative prediction method the process flow of the proposed prediction method for added resistance is described in fig 5 conventional processes estimate the added resistance by using equations with the far field or near field method which calculates the added resistance directly in contrast the proposed method exploits the data obtained from a conventional method or experiments to estimate the added resistance by using gp in this study experimental data kracht 1984 were used as the training data to generate an estimation equation for the added resistance then the added resistance from the equation was compared with the test data calculated using a conventional method experiments and strip theory the process mainly consisted of the following three steps preparing design variables and objective developing an equation from gp and verifying the performance of the equation as the added resistance is derived mainly from the reflection of short head waves the added resistance depends on the shape of the waterline in the bow resolution mepc 2013 msc mepc 2 circ 11 2012 therefore the length of the waterline the parameters of the bulbous bow and the ratio of the wave to the ship length were considered the design variables 4 2 1 prepared design variables and objectives the design variables and an objective are described in tables 3 and 4 froude number fn was considered for both the training data and the test data the training data consisted of 0 150 0 175 0 225 and 0 250 and the test data included 0 200 4 2 2 parameters for gp the gp parameters are shown in table 5 they were considered to be constant throughout the gp 4 2 3 learning process during the learning process a suitable tree structure for gp was determined using the training data then the fitness values root mean square rms errors and prediction values were evaluated the fitness values and rms errors are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively 4 2 4 test process the accuracy of the gp s tree structure was validated using the test data in this process the result of the gp was compared with the result of a model experiment test fn 0 200 the comparison is shown in fig 8 the trend of the prediction of the added resistance coefficient was similar in models 2388 0 2388 2 and 2388 3 4 2 5 determination of the approximation function after verifying the accuracy of the gp result the approximation function was determined the representation of this function used the same abbreviations as those listed in tables 3 and 4 the approximation function can be expressed as follows 1 y 5 467 e sin x 11 79 07 tanh x 11 79 07 tanh x 4 61 12 e x 4 x 3 12 79 cos x 11 x 6 tanh x 3 97 87 cos x 10 sin x 11 5 467 e x 10 sin x 6 0 03772 e x 11 x 1 x 2 x 11 42 86 4 3 validation of alternative prediction method in the verification process the gp result was compared with the result of the model experiment for evaluating the accuracy of the new function generated by gp further the results of the proposed prediction method experimental data and strip theory results were compared fn 0 250 fig 9 shows the differences in these three sets of data the proposed method and the experimental data exhibited similar values and trends but the strip theory yielded different values and trends therefore the performance of the proposed method was concluded to be better than that of the strip theory nevertheless there was a weak point in the proposed method according to fig 8 a model 2388 0 although a falling section wave to ship length ratio 0 75 appeared in the experiment result the falling section could not be covered by the proposed method because the proposed prediction method is one of the stochastic interpolation si however the entirety of trend of experimental data was eminently similar as shown figs 8 and 9 5 conclusions as current methods for added resistance prediction require a considerable amount of time and effort in this paper we proposed an alternative method for predicting the added resistance to save resources time money and or manpower in the proposed prediction method certified experimental data and gp were used as the training and test data and the tool to estimate the added resistance respectively however as it is unusual to estimate the added resistance with gp this paper focuses on the ability of gp to estimate the added resistance this method was applied to ship geometries with three bulbous bow types and the results of the prediction were compared with the experimental data and the strip theory results to verify the performance of the proposed method the nonlinear approximation function generated by gp yielded values similar to the experimental data moreover with respect to accuracy the approximation function was better than the strip theory in this study although four froude numbers and three types of ships total 12 cases were used as the training data to generate a new prediction function the function s accuracy was considerably high moreover the use of a significant quantity of data including either model ship data or real ship data contributed to improving the accuracy of the prediction function derived from gp thus it is possible to consider gp as an alternative prediction method of added resistance in the early design process because this method estimates the effect on the added resistance of hull changes sufficiently accurately in less time and at a low cost additional plans should be considered in future research first only one type of ship was considered in this study although there were slight differences in the bulbous bows therefore to determine whether the proposed method is applicable to various ship types we need to collect experimental data for various ships second the comparison of the gp results and the strip theory s results showed considerable differences as illustrated in fig 9 these differences may be attributed to the fact that strip theory is a two dimensional method thus results derived from a three dimensional panel method should be considered to improve the validity of the comparison finally it was found out that the drawback of the stochastic interpolation method gp we try to solve this point by using deep learning and machine learning the deep and machine learning is promising concept in ai technology and is considered as our next step to improve the proposed prediction method or framework acknowledgments this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit no nrf 2017r1c1b5015989 the ministry

23544,a removable ocean observation platform for horizontal plane dynamic positioning test under the disturbance of ocean currents was completed successfully in the deep water pool at harbin engineering university the control system for the surge sway and yaw is designed according to the characteristics of the observation platform sigmoid s plane control is used to resist ocean current disturbances by the improved adaptive term the target heading is chosen based on the theory of weather optimal positioning control wopc such that when the platform maintains the target heading the energy consumption of the propulsion system is minimal a fixed output time control approach is proposed for the platform heading control to avoid the effect of thruster dead zone then a grouping strategy based on the analysis of the main disturbance is introduced for thrust allocation the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and thrust allocation method is illustrated by pool trials several effective suggestions are proposed for the design of dynamic positioning systems and the positioning control of the removable ocean observation platform keywords dynamic positioning weather optimal heading improved s plane control fixed output time control grouping thrust allocation 1 introduction since the 1990s ocean observing systems oos have been established worldwide wallinga et al 2003 ocean observation has played an essential role in ocean exploration data collected by observation platforms help to answer a range of fundamental and applied research questions liu et al 2016 these include temperature salinity and density at different depths measured by conductivity temperature depth ctd instruments and the velocity of water currents throughout the acoustics doppler current profile adcp underwater observation devices are generally divided into two categories fixed and removable tzeng et al 2010 canada has deployed a fixed platform the venus instrument platform vip continuously from 2006 to 2016 in the saanich inlet to obtain data regarding the ocean state abeysirigunawardena et al 2016 the shenyang institute of automation chinese academy of sciences presented a removable platform for ocean observation which was designed as a jellyfish shape it is particularly suitable for fixed points or small area and underwater slit and gully areas of ocean observation meng et al 2016 the ocean observation platform of this paper is also a type of removable observation platform the observation platform is equipped with a heave device and propulsion systems so it can complete depth location and dynamic positioning the platform essentially works as follows it remains at a fixed point in the sea or on the bottom of the sea for ocean observation it also can transform from one fixed point to another some characteristics of the platform include low cost high environmental adaptability independent motive power long operational time low active noise and ability of covert observation therefore it can be applied to an autonomous wider range and long term underwater observation the platform collects ocean data at a fixed point and will suffer the disturbances of current to provide a safe work environment the dynamic positioning of the observation platform in the current must be studied currently the research of dynamic positioning focuses on deep sea work ships floating production systems and remotely operated vehicles rovs early dynamic positioning systems were built using pid controllers then notch filters in cascade with low pass filters were used with the controllers to reduce the thruster trembling caused by the wave induced motion components improved performance was achieved by exploiting more advanced control techniques based on optimal control and kalman filter theory balchen et al 1976 recently an artificial intelligence method was introduced into the dynamic positioning system considering unknown time varying disturbances du et al 2013 presented a robust adaptive neural controller for the dynamic positioning system where unknown ship model dynamics and time varying disturbances are compensated for by adaptive radial basis function rbf neural networks simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme this control method is not suitable for the ocean observation platform s dynamic positioning system because there is a difference between the working environment and working mode for the ocean observation platform and the dynamic positioning system mentioned the observation platform has the following features 1 as the actual observation platform is submerged in a homogeneous fluid 10 m from the surface only the current disturbances should be considered for the observation platform 2 the platform only needs to realize a fixed position and a certain heading angle because of the requirement of the operation mode accordingly some practical engineering problems are considered including the energy consumption dead zone of the thruster output and fast thrust allocation strategy the idea of weather optimal heading is introduced to the control system to minimize the energy consumption fossen and strand 2001 presented the concept of weather optimal positioning control for marine operation systems moreover he proposed a method to solve the optimal heading the controlled ship moves in a circle with a fixed radius by pointing the bow of the ship toward the origin of the circle the optimal heading of a dynamic positioning ship can be obtained when the yaw moment is zero however the implementation of this motion process is complex and time consuming the dead zone means that the thruster has no output at low speeds the observation platform is a revolving body with small inertia owing to the unknown dead zone of the thruster there is a long period of buffeting in the heading control however many control strategies ignore the dead zone xia et al 2015 presented a feed forward fuzzy compensator that is designed to eliminate the effects of the dead zones the simulation results prove its effectiveness however the engineering practicability is poor in this study the pool test system is designed for the observation platform the control system is designed according to the features of the observation platform which simultaneously considers the current disturbances weather optimal positioning control and thruster dead zone the improved adaptive term of s plane control is used to resist the current disturbances the weather optimal positioning control is achieved by setting the current direction as the target heading and the dead zone problem is solved by fixed output time control based on which the dynamic positioning control law is designed then the grouping strategy is introduced to thrust allocation which increases the system practicality 2 problem formulation 2 1 vehicle modeling establish an inertial reference coordinate system i with the origin defined on earth and a body fixed coordinate system b with the origin chosen to coincide with the observation platform s center of mass as shown in fig 1 the mathematical model of the observation platform in the horizontal plane can be described as follows fossen 2011 1 m v c v v d v v τ η r ϕ v 2 η x y ψ t v u v r t 3 τ τ u τ v τ r t where x and y are the position of the observation platform s center of mass in i ψ denotes the heading angle in i u v and r denote the surge sway and yaw velocities expressed in b the model matrices m c v and d v denote inertia coriolis and damping respectively r ψ denotes the rotation matrix between the two coordinate systems τ u τ v and τ r are the surge sway force and yaw moment respectively 2 2 problem formulation according to the characteristics of the observation platform the following problems should be considered during the dynamic positioning system design a what control method can perform well in resisting ocean current disturbances in real time b how can we choose the target heading angle so that the energy optimization can be achieved c how can we design the heading controller so that the influence of dead zone can be avoid the general control problem of dynamic positioning for the observation platform considered in this study can be formulated as follows considering an arbitrary state expressed in i with desired state η d x d y d ψ d define the dynamic positioning error η e x e y e ψ e x x d y y d ψ ψ d thus the control objective of the dynamic positioning of the observation platform is to design control law τ u τ v and τ r to ensure the positioning error η e converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero as t 3 dynamic positioning control system design referring to the definition of weather optimal heading the target heading can be determined according to the direction of the main disturbance direction of current disturbance in this study then the improved s plane control is designed in the positions x and y and a fixed output time control based on the idea of time optimal control is built in the heading ψ thus the structure of the control system for the observation platform is shown in fig 2 3 1 improved s plane control design liu and xu 2001 presented s plane control based on the idea of fuzzy control engineering practice shows that the s plane control has a strong practical aspect thus it is chosen to solve τ u and τ v the expression of s plane control is 4 f 2 1 0 e k 1 e k 2 e 1 0 δ f where e and e are the error and its deviation respectively and k 1 and k 2 denote the control parameters li et al 2015 presented a method for adaptive control parameters which is composed of a constant term k c and adjusted term k a as 5 k 1 2 k c k a k a c 1 sgn e e c 2 e c 3 e where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the weight parameters in eq 4 δ f denotes the adaptive term of s plane control in fact δ f is a conditional integral part the external disturbance is considered as a fixed interference force for a period of time and the fixed deviation can be eliminated by adjusting the offset of the s plane the algorithm calculating δ f is as follow 1 one array is built with preset size 2 the deviation is added to the array when the speed is less than the threshold 3 the weighted average of all array elements is used as δ f until the array is filled 4 it will switch to 2 after the array is emptied practical application proves that this strategy is not ideal because the environment of the robot interference is random and changeable accordingly it is difficult to meet the application conditions an improved adaptive term is presented where the expression of δ f can be rewritten as 6 δ f s δ e 0 δ e 1 λ e t 1 n λ β t i t n t e i where s denotes the function of s plane control e t is the error at time t δ e denotes the adaptively adjusted value of error β t is the fast weakening factor λ is the low pass filter parameter and n is the number of recorded historical data parameter adjustment 7 β t 0 3 β t 1 δ e e 0 1 others the weakening part can avoid the concussion due to the lag caused by the integral part the low pass filter and s plane control function can smooth the output of adaptive term 3 2 heading control strategy design the disturbance of the external environment acting on the ocean observation platform is only the current disturbance according to the definition of the optimal heading control the target heading of the observation platform can be denoted by the current direction measured by apcd acoustics doppler current profile 8 ψ d ψ r e f thus the heading control error can be expressed as 9 ψ e ψ d ψ ψ r e f ψ in this study the observation platform is a revolving body which can easily realize yawing under a small torque the output of the actuator propeller used for dynamic positioning has a dead zone the dead zone means that the output of the actuator varies with the input signal only if the input signal exceeds a certain threshold in other cases the output of the actuator is zero so the output of the thruster including dead zone can be expressed as 10 f 0 b l n b r f n others where n denotes the rotational speed of the thruster f denotes the output force of thruster b l b r denotes the bandwidth of dead zone and b l 0 b r 0 if the heading control uses an s controller the heading error will increase over time so the thruster output will yield a large output because of dead zero thus there will be a frequent and large buffeting based on these considerations a fixed output time controller is proposed to avoid the effect of the dead zone bang bang control is introduced to time control the bang bang control is also known as relay control or switch control the output of bang bang control is the boundary value of control domain so the output of controller continuously switches between one boundary value and another boundary value the output of bang bang control can be expressed as 11 u 0 e e m s i g n e e e m where e m denotes the threshold of deviation thus the controller can yield a fixed torque τ r for a period of time which can be expressed as 12 τ r 0 t t 0 α ψ e ψ e f max t t 0 t a c t ψ e ψ e where α ψ e ψ e is the gain coefficient and t a c t ψ e ψ e denotes the thruster action time these are both related to the heading error ψ e and its deviation ψ e f max is the maximum control output first f max can be expressed as an equation regarding the initial heading error ψ e 0 which can be built as 13 f max s ψ e 0 0 s ψ d ψ 0 0 where ψ d denotes the target heading and ψ 0 denotes the heading angle when the target heading is changed second thruster action time t a c t and gain coefficient α can be selected based on the heading error ψ e and its deviation ψ e thus the output of control τ r can be obtained as described in algorithm 1 1 when the heading error ψ e 30 the output of control τ r sgn ψ e f max 2 when the heading error ψ e 30 the adjustment process can be divided into two steps a observation within the observation time t o b s the output of control τ r 0 b action within the action time t a c t the output of control τ r α sgn ψ e f max when the action time ends the control of heading enters the observation period image 1 4 thrust allocation strategy the arrangement of the thrusters equipped on the ocean observation platform is cross shaped and the specific form is shown in fig 3 in this paper we propose a thrust allocation strategy based on the known current information when the current direction is obtained the main disturbance direction is determined the thrusters are divided into two groups the thrusters in the direction of the main disturbance are used for the adjustment of the position in this direction and the thrusters in the direction of the secondary disturbance are used to adjust the position in the corresponding direction and the heading of the observation platform the thrust allocation model can be built as 14 τ t α f where 1 τ is the output of the control 15 τ τ u τ v τ r 2 t α is the thruster arrangement matrix according to the arrangement of the thruster it can be expressed as 16 t α t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 17 t i cos α i sin α i k i l y i cos α i l x i sin α i where α i is the thruster azimuth of i l x i l y i denotes the thruster coordinate of i and k i denotes the direction identifier of the main and secondary disturbance 18 α 1 0 l x 1 0 l y 1 l 2 α 2 0 l x 2 0 l y 2 l 2 α 3 90 l x 3 l 2 l y 3 0 α 4 90 l x 4 l 2 l y 4 0 where l is the maximum diameter of the observation platform the direction of the main disturbance is longitudinal and k i can be expressed as 19 k i 1 i 1 2 0 i 3 4 the direction of the main disturbance is transverse and k i can be expressed as 20 k i 0 i 1 2 1 i 3 4 3 f is the force and moment produced by the thrusters which drive the platform to the target position and heading a the thrust f m a i in the main disturbance direction is expressed as 21 f mai τ mai 2 τ mai 2 where τ mai is the output of the control in the main disturbance direction b the thrust f sec in the secondary disturbance direction can be divided into two situations when the heading error ψ e is large the f sec is used completely to adjust the heading in others f sec is used to adjust the heading and position and f sec can conform to the output capability of the thruster by choosing suitable weight parameters as described in algorithm 2 image 3 5 dynamic positioning experiments in the pool 5 1 pool test system design the pool test system for dynamic positioning is composed of three subsystems namely the ocean observation platform indoor positioning system and monitoring and control pc the dynamic positioning test system is as shown in fig 4 the platform has a mass of 2 tons the external structure includes the upper platform and the bottom bracket and the internal structure includes the communication equipment and dynamic positioning control cabinet the main parameters of the observation platform as shown in table 1 the indoor positioning system using a qualisys 3d motion capture and analysis system which includes three optical spheres arranged in a triangle two image acquisition instruments and an optical positioning system server the system can calculate the position and the heading angle in real time the monitoring and control pc is responsible for issuing the start command and the target state and can display the state of the observation platform in real time the dynamic positioning experiment for the observation platform was conducted in the general deep water pool lab of harbin engineering university in 2016 the pool s dimension is 50 30 10 m the pool is equipped with a local flow generating device that can simulate the current disturbance by operating at a certain frequency the pool test equipment layout is as shown in fig 5 the indoor positioning system and the monitoring and control pc send the state information and target respectively to the observation platform control system through the router when the state and target are received the control system calculates the output of the controllers then the required thrust is produced by the thrusters the pool test spot shownis as shown in fig 6 5 2 flow field calibration by adcp the flow field has been calibrated by adcp before the dynamic positioning test the current velocity at different positions of the pool was measured when the local flow generating device operates at different frequencies the process of the flow field calibration is as follows 1 the adcp is fixed on the bracket and the transducer is submerged in the fluid 1 2 m from the surface 2 the flow generating device operates at the frequency 30 hz then the flow field will be stability after waiting for about 10 min 3 the current velocity is measured at 12 measure points one data is collected every second at each measure point and the average value of 10 data is taken as the current velocity the distribution of the measure points is shown in fig 7 4 the flow field is calibrated when the flow generating device operates at the frequency 35 hz and 40 hz the current velocity of each measure point and the frequency of flow generating device are shown in table 2 5 3 test results and analysis to verity and illustrate the performance of the control schemes proposed for dynamic positioning control of the observation platform two test cases case 1 to case 2 are investigated in this section as follows case1 the velocity of current v c is 0 m s the initial position and heading angle of the observation platform are x 0 0 3 m y 0 0 9 m and ψ 0 0 08 rad respectively the target position and heading angle are chosen as x d 2 m y d 0 m and ψ d 0 rad respectively and they are sent to the control system at 20 s the test results are shown in fig 8 case 2 the flow generating device operates at a frequency 35 hz and the initial position of platform is located at 8 m in front of the spout thus the velocity of current v c can reach 0 5 m s and the direction o c remains 180 the initial position and heading angle of observation platform are x 0 2 15 m y 0 1 05 m and ψ 0 0 85 rad the target position and heading angle are chosen as x d 0 m y d 0 m and ψ d 0 rad and they are sent to the control system at 10 s the test results are shown in fig 9 figs 8 9 show the state data and thrust data of the observation platform during dynamic positioning at two current velocities namely 0 and 0 5 m s the test results show that 1 the improved s plane controller and fixed output time controller designed in this study achieved dynamic positioning of the observation platform and the actual state rapidly converged to the desired state in all two tests in these tests all the longitudinal and traverse position errors were less than 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively the heading error is approximately zero 2 the output of the thrusters at current velocity 0 5 m s shows that when the platform heading is stable the thruster 1 and 2 have a stable output to resist the current disturbance and the output of thruster 3 and 4 switches between zero and a stable value if the flow field made by the local flow generating device is uniformly stable and the power supply cable tension can be eliminated the output of thruster 3 and 4 will stay at zero for a long time then the output of the thrusters is only thruster 1 and 2 and the energy is optimal 3 the grouping thrust allocation strategy proposed could achieve fast transition from the output of the controller to the thrust in the two tests the thrust rotation speed curves are smooth thus the allocation method is accurate and efficient 6 conclusion this paper presented the study of the removable observation platform horizontal plane dynamic positioning under ocean current disturbance according to the characteristics of the platform and its operational features a practicable control system was designed including the improved s plane control for the position and fixed output time control of the heading then the test system was built and the pool test

23544,a removable ocean observation platform for horizontal plane dynamic positioning test under the disturbance of ocean currents was completed successfully in the deep water pool at harbin engineering university the control system for the surge sway and yaw is designed according to the characteristics of the observation platform sigmoid s plane control is used to resist ocean current disturbances by the improved adaptive term the target heading is chosen based on the theory of weather optimal positioning control wopc such that when the platform maintains the target heading the energy consumption of the propulsion system is minimal a fixed output time control approach is proposed for the platform heading control to avoid the effect of thruster dead zone then a grouping strategy based on the analysis of the main disturbance is introduced for thrust allocation the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and thrust allocation method is illustrated by pool trials several effective suggestions are proposed for the design of dynamic positioning systems and the positioning control of the removable ocean observation platform keywords dynamic positioning weather optimal heading improved s plane control fixed output time control grouping thrust allocation 1 introduction since the 1990s ocean observing systems oos have been established worldwide wallinga et al 2003 ocean observation has played an essential role in ocean exploration data collected by observation platforms help to answer a range of fundamental and applied research questions liu et al 2016 these include temperature salinity and density at different depths measured by conductivity temperature depth ctd instruments and the velocity of water currents throughout the acoustics doppler current profile adcp underwater observation devices are generally divided into two categories fixed and removable tzeng et al 2010 canada has deployed a fixed platform the venus instrument platform vip continuously from 2006 to 2016 in the saanich inlet to obtain data regarding the ocean state abeysirigunawardena et al 2016 the shenyang institute of automation chinese academy of sciences presented a removable platform for ocean observation which was designed as a jellyfish shape it is particularly suitable for fixed points or small area and underwater slit and gully areas of ocean observation meng et al 2016 the ocean observation platform of this paper is also a type of removable observation platform the observation platform is equipped with a heave device and propulsion systems so it can complete depth location and dynamic positioning the platform essentially works as follows it remains at a fixed point in the sea or on the bottom of the sea for ocean observation it also can transform from one fixed point to another some characteristics of the platform include low cost high environmental adaptability independent motive power long operational time low active noise and ability of covert observation therefore it can be applied to an autonomous wider range and long term underwater observation the platform collects ocean data at a fixed point and will suffer the disturbances of current to provide a safe work environment the dynamic positioning of the observation platform in the current must be studied currently the research of dynamic positioning focuses on deep sea work ships floating production systems and remotely operated vehicles rovs early dynamic positioning systems were built using pid controllers then notch filters in cascade with low pass filters were used with the controllers to reduce the thruster trembling caused by the wave induced motion components improved performance was achieved by exploiting more advanced control techniques based on optimal control and kalman filter theory balchen et al 1976 recently an artificial intelligence method was introduced into the dynamic positioning system considering unknown time varying disturbances du et al 2013 presented a robust adaptive neural controller for the dynamic positioning system where unknown ship model dynamics and time varying disturbances are compensated for by adaptive radial basis function rbf neural networks simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme this control method is not suitable for the ocean observation platform s dynamic positioning system because there is a difference between the working environment and working mode for the ocean observation platform and the dynamic positioning system mentioned the observation platform has the following features 1 as the actual observation platform is submerged in a homogeneous fluid 10 m from the surface only the current disturbances should be considered for the observation platform 2 the platform only needs to realize a fixed position and a certain heading angle because of the requirement of the operation mode accordingly some practical engineering problems are considered including the energy consumption dead zone of the thruster output and fast thrust allocation strategy the idea of weather optimal heading is introduced to the control system to minimize the energy consumption fossen and strand 2001 presented the concept of weather optimal positioning control for marine operation systems moreover he proposed a method to solve the optimal heading the controlled ship moves in a circle with a fixed radius by pointing the bow of the ship toward the origin of the circle the optimal heading of a dynamic positioning ship can be obtained when the yaw moment is zero however the implementation of this motion process is complex and time consuming the dead zone means that the thruster has no output at low speeds the observation platform is a revolving body with small inertia owing to the unknown dead zone of the thruster there is a long period of buffeting in the heading control however many control strategies ignore the dead zone xia et al 2015 presented a feed forward fuzzy compensator that is designed to eliminate the effects of the dead zones the simulation results prove its effectiveness however the engineering practicability is poor in this study the pool test system is designed for the observation platform the control system is designed according to the features of the observation platform which simultaneously considers the current disturbances weather optimal positioning control and thruster dead zone the improved adaptive term of s plane control is used to resist the current disturbances the weather optimal positioning control is achieved by setting the current direction as the target heading and the dead zone problem is solved by fixed output time control based on which the dynamic positioning control law is designed then the grouping strategy is introduced to thrust allocation which increases the system practicality 2 problem formulation 2 1 vehicle modeling establish an inertial reference coordinate system i with the origin defined on earth and a body fixed coordinate system b with the origin chosen to coincide with the observation platform s center of mass as shown in fig 1 the mathematical model of the observation platform in the horizontal plane can be described as follows fossen 2011 1 m v c v v d v v τ η r ϕ v 2 η x y ψ t v u v r t 3 τ τ u τ v τ r t where x and y are the position of the observation platform s center of mass in i ψ denotes the heading angle in i u v and r denote the surge sway and yaw velocities expressed in b the model matrices m c v and d v denote inertia coriolis and damping respectively r ψ denotes the rotation matrix between the two coordinate systems τ u τ v and τ r are the surge sway force and yaw moment respectively 2 2 problem formulation according to the characteristics of the observation platform the following problems should be considered during the dynamic positioning system design a what control method can perform well in resisting ocean current disturbances in real time b how can we choose the target heading angle so that the energy optimization can be achieved c how can we design the heading controller so that the influence of dead zone can be avoid the general control problem of dynamic positioning for the observation platform considered in this study can be formulated as follows considering an arbitrary state expressed in i with desired state η d x d y d ψ d define the dynamic positioning error η e x e y e ψ e x x d y y d ψ ψ d thus the control objective of the dynamic positioning of the observation platform is to design control law τ u τ v and τ r to ensure the positioning error η e converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero as t 3 dynamic positioning control system design referring to the definition of weather optimal heading the target heading can be determined according to the direction of the main disturbance direction of current disturbance in this study then the improved s plane control is designed in the positions x and y and a fixed output time control based on the idea of time optimal control is built in the heading ψ thus the structure of the control system for the observation platform is shown in fig 2 3 1 improved s plane control design liu and xu 2001 presented s plane control based on the idea of fuzzy control engineering practice shows that the s plane control has a strong practical aspect thus it is chosen to solve τ u and τ v the expression of s plane control is 4 f 2 1 0 e k 1 e k 2 e 1 0 δ f where e and e are the error and its deviation respectively and k 1 and k 2 denote the control parameters li et al 2015 presented a method for adaptive control parameters which is composed of a constant term k c and adjusted term k a as 5 k 1 2 k c k a k a c 1 sgn e e c 2 e c 3 e where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the weight parameters in eq 4 δ f denotes the adaptive term of s plane control in fact δ f is a conditional integral part the external disturbance is considered as a fixed interference force for a period of time and the fixed deviation can be eliminated by adjusting the offset of the s plane the algorithm calculating δ f is as follow 1 one array is built with preset size 2 the deviation is added to the array when the speed is less than the threshold 3 the weighted average of all array elements is used as δ f until the array is filled 4 it will switch to 2 after the array is emptied practical application proves that this strategy is not ideal because the environment of the robot interference is random and changeable accordingly it is difficult to meet the application conditions an improved adaptive term is presented where the expression of δ f can be rewritten as 6 δ f s δ e 0 δ e 1 λ e t 1 n λ β t i t n t e i where s denotes the function of s plane control e t is the error at time t δ e denotes the adaptively adjusted value of error β t is the fast weakening factor λ is the low pass filter parameter and n is the number of recorded historical data parameter adjustment 7 β t 0 3 β t 1 δ e e 0 1 others the weakening part can avoid the concussion due to the lag caused by the integral part the low pass filter and s plane control function can smooth the output of adaptive term 3 2 heading control strategy design the disturbance of the external environment acting on the ocean observation platform is only the current disturbance according to the definition of the optimal heading control the target heading of the observation platform can be denoted by the current direction measured by apcd acoustics doppler current profile 8 ψ d ψ r e f thus the heading control error can be expressed as 9 ψ e ψ d ψ ψ r e f ψ in this study the observation platform is a revolving body which can easily realize yawing under a small torque the output of the actuator propeller used for dynamic positioning has a dead zone the dead zone means that the output of the actuator varies with the input signal only if the input signal exceeds a certain threshold in other cases the output of the actuator is zero so the output of the thruster including dead zone can be expressed as 10 f 0 b l n b r f n others where n denotes the rotational speed of the thruster f denotes the output force of thruster b l b r denotes the bandwidth of dead zone and b l 0 b r 0 if the heading control uses an s controller the heading error will increase over time so the thruster output will yield a large output because of dead zero thus there will be a frequent and large buffeting based on these considerations a fixed output time controller is proposed to avoid the effect of the dead zone bang bang control is introduced to time control the bang bang control is also known as relay control or switch control the output of bang bang control is the boundary value of control domain so the output of controller continuously switches between one boundary value and another boundary value the output of bang bang control can be expressed as 11 u 0 e e m s i g n e e e m where e m denotes the threshold of deviation thus the controller can yield a fixed torque τ r for a period of time which can be expressed as 12 τ r 0 t t 0 α ψ e ψ e f max t t 0 t a c t ψ e ψ e where α ψ e ψ e is the gain coefficient and t a c t ψ e ψ e denotes the thruster action time these are both related to the heading error ψ e and its deviation ψ e f max is the maximum control output first f max can be expressed as an equation regarding the initial heading error ψ e 0 which can be built as 13 f max s ψ e 0 0 s ψ d ψ 0 0 where ψ d denotes the target heading and ψ 0 denotes the heading angle when the target heading is changed second thruster action time t a c t and gain coefficient α can be selected based on the heading error ψ e and its deviation ψ e thus the output of control τ r can be obtained as described in algorithm 1 1 when the heading error ψ e 30 the output of control τ r sgn ψ e f max 2 when the heading error ψ e 30 the adjustment process can be divided into two steps a observation within the observation time t o b s the output of control τ r 0 b action within the action time t a c t the output of control τ r α sgn ψ e f max when the action time ends the control of heading enters the observation period image 1 4 thrust allocation strategy the arrangement of the thrusters equipped on the ocean observation platform is cross shaped and the specific form is shown in fig 3 in this paper we propose a thrust allocation strategy based on the known current information when the current direction is obtained the main disturbance direction is determined the thrusters are divided into two groups the thrusters in the direction of the main disturbance are used for the adjustment of the position in this direction and the thrusters in the direction of the secondary disturbance are used to adjust the position in the corresponding direction and the heading of the observation platform the thrust allocation model can be built as 14 τ t α f where 1 τ is the output of the control 15 τ τ u τ v τ r 2 t α is the thruster arrangement matrix according to the arrangement of the thruster it can be expressed as 16 t α t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 17 t i cos α i sin α i k i l y i cos α i l x i sin α i where α i is the thruster azimuth of i l x i l y i denotes the thruster coordinate of i and k i denotes the direction identifier of the main and secondary disturbance 18 α 1 0 l x 1 0 l y 1 l 2 α 2 0 l x 2 0 l y 2 l 2 α 3 90 l x 3 l 2 l y 3 0 α 4 90 l x 4 l 2 l y 4 0 where l is the maximum diameter of the observation platform the direction of the main disturbance is longitudinal and k i can be expressed as 19 k i 1 i 1 2 0 i 3 4 the direction of the main disturbance is transverse and k i can be expressed as 20 k i 0 i 1 2 1 i 3 4 3 f is the force and moment produced by the thrusters which drive the platform to the target position and heading a the thrust f m a i in the main disturbance direction is expressed as 21 f mai τ mai 2 τ mai 2 where τ mai is the output of the control in the main disturbance direction b the thrust f sec in the secondary disturbance direction can be divided into two situations when the heading error ψ e is large the f sec is used completely to adjust the heading in others f sec is used to adjust the heading and position and f sec can conform to the output capability of the thruster by choosing suitable weight parameters as described in algorithm 2 image 3 5 dynamic positioning experiments in the pool 5 1 pool test system design the pool test system for dynamic positioning is composed of three subsystems namely the ocean observation platform indoor positioning system and monitoring and control pc the dynamic positioning test system is as shown in fig 4 the platform has a mass of 2 tons the external structure includes the upper platform and the bottom bracket and the internal structure includes the communication equipment and dynamic positioning control cabinet the main parameters of the observation platform as shown in table 1 the indoor positioning system using a qualisys 3d motion capture and analysis system which includes three optical spheres arranged in a triangle two image acquisition instruments and an optical positioning system server the system can calculate the position and the heading angle in real time the monitoring and control pc is responsible for issuing the start command and the target state and can display the state of the observation platform in real time the dynamic positioning experiment for the observation platform was conducted in the general deep water pool lab of harbin engineering university in 2016 the pool s dimension is 50 30 10 m the pool is equipped with a local flow generating device that can simulate the current disturbance by operating at a certain frequency the pool test equipment layout is as shown in fig 5 the indoor positioning system and the monitoring and control pc send the state information and target respectively to the observation platform control system through the router when the state and target are received the control system calculates the output of the controllers then the required thrust is produced by the thrusters the pool test spot shownis as shown in fig 6 5 2 flow field calibration by adcp the flow field has been calibrated by adcp before the dynamic positioning test the current velocity at different positions of the pool was measured when the local flow generating device operates at different frequencies the process of the flow field calibration is as follows 1 the adcp is fixed on the bracket and the transducer is submerged in the fluid 1 2 m from the surface 2 the flow generating device operates at the frequency 30 hz then the flow field will be stability after waiting for about 10 min 3 the current velocity is measured at 12 measure points one data is collected every second at each measure point and the average value of 10 data is taken as the current velocity the distribution of the measure points is shown in fig 7 4 the flow field is calibrated when the flow generating device operates at the frequency 35 hz and 40 hz the current velocity of each measure point and the frequency of flow generating device are shown in table 2 5 3 test results and analysis to verity and illustrate the performance of the control schemes proposed for dynamic positioning control of the observation platform two test cases case 1 to case 2 are investigated in this section as follows case1 the velocity of current v c is 0 m s the initial position and heading angle of the observation platform are x 0 0 3 m y 0 0 9 m and ψ 0 0 08 rad respectively the target position and heading angle are chosen as x d 2 m y d 0 m and ψ d 0 rad respectively and they are sent to the control system at 20 s the test results are shown in fig 8 case 2 the flow generating device operates at a frequency 35 hz and the initial position of platform is located at 8 m in front of the spout thus the velocity of current v c can reach 0 5 m s and the direction o c remains 180 the initial position and heading angle of observation platform are x 0 2 15 m y 0 1 05 m and ψ 0 0 85 rad the target position and heading angle are chosen as x d 0 m y d 0 m and ψ d 0 rad and they are sent to the control system at 10 s the test results are shown in fig 9 figs 8 9 show the state data and thrust data of the observation platform during dynamic positioning at two current velocities namely 0 and 0 5 m s the test results show that 1 the improved s plane controller and fixed output time controller designed in this study achieved dynamic positioning of the observation platform and the actual state rapidly converged to the desired state in all two tests in these tests all the longitudinal and traverse position errors were less than 0 2 and 0 1 m respectively the heading error is approximately zero 2 the output of the thrusters at current velocity 0 5 m s shows that when the platform heading is stable the thruster 1 and 2 have a stable output to resist the current disturbance and the output of thruster 3 and 4 switches between zero and a stable value if the flow field made by the local flow generating device is uniformly stable and the power supply cable tension can be eliminated the output of thruster 3 and 4 will stay at zero for a long time then the output of the thrusters is only thruster 1 and 2 and the energy is optimal 3 the grouping thrust allocation strategy proposed could achieve fast transition from the output of the controller to the thrust in the two tests the thrust rotation speed curves are smooth thus the allocation method is accurate and efficient 6 conclusion this paper
