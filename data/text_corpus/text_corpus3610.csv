water research centre university of new south wales kensington campus sydney nsw 2052 australia sulfidated nano zerovalent iron s nzvi stabilized with carboxymethyl cellulose cmc was successfully synthesized on site and injected into the subsurface at a site contaminated with a broad range of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs transport of cmc s nzvi to the monitoring wells both downgradient and upgradient resulted in a significant decrease in concentrations of aqueous phase cvocs short term 0 17 days total boron and chloride measurements indicated dilution and displacement in these wells importantly however compound specific isotope analysis csia changes in concentrations of intermediates and increase in ethene concentrations confirmed dechlorination of cvocs dissolution from the dnapl pool into the aqueous phase at the deepest levels 4 0 4 5 m bgs was identifiable from the increased cvocs concentrations during long term monitoring however at the uppermost levels 1 5 m above the source zone a contrasting trend was observed indicating successful dechlorination changes in cvocs concentrations and csia data suggest both sequential hydrogenolysis as well as reductive Î² elimination as the possible transformation mechanisms during the short term abiotic and long term biotic dechlorination one of the most positive outcomes of this cmc s nzvi field treatment is the non accumulation of lower chlorinated vocs particularly vinyl chloride post treatment soil cores also revealed significant decreases in cvocs concentrations throughout the targeted treatment zones results from this field study show that sulfidation is a suitable amendment for developing more efficient nzvi based in situ remediation technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidation nano zerovalent iron dithionite groundwater chlorinated vocs in situ remediation 1 introduction sulfidation is a recent development related to the use of zerovalent iron zvi based materials for groundwater remediation fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 though most of the focus in recent years has been on engineered sulfidation of nano zvi nzvi biogenic sulfidation of zvi has been extensively investigated since the 1990s benner et al 2002 phillips et al 2000 puls et al 1999 wilkin et al 2003 earlier studies focused on the identification of authigenic mineral phases formed during the application of zvi permeable reactive barriers prbs formation of iron sulfides fess was attributed to the concurrent oxidation of zvi and generation of sulfides via biogeochemical processes e g microbial reduction of so4 2 these mineral phases were studied in the context of the hydraulic performance of prbs noting that the accumulation of fes precipitates on zvi surface could contribute to pore clogging decreased permeability and slower groundwater flow however parallel work on the dechlorination of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs by fess butler and hayes 1999 2000 led to the recognition of these mineral phases as an additional remediant during the operation of prbs he et al 2008 shen and wilson 2007 similar field studies utilized the in situ formation of fess to promote abiotic reduction of cvocs in the biogeochemical reductive dechlorination technology kennedy et al 2006a 2006b investigations on reactive fess for remediation purposes is now a thriving field as demonstrated by recent advances on their synthesis stabilization and applicability for the removal of contaminants gong et al 2016 in contrast to the biogenic processes described above abiotic sulfidation can be achieved by modifying the nzvi particles with sulfur compounds mainly sulfate cumbal et al 2015 dithionite cao et al 2017 fan et al 2016 li et al 2016 nunez garcia et al 2016 song et al 2017 lv et al 2019 thiosulfate han and yan 2016 and sulfide fan et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 zhao et al 2019 the resultant sulfidated nzvi s nzvi is more reactive than sulfur free nzvi for dechlorination of cvocs han and yan 2016 jin et al 2018 nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 adsorption of heavy metals cumbal et al 2015 lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 and transformation of organic contaminants cao et al 2017 li et al 2016 song et al 2017 increased longevity nunez garcia et al 2016 and higher colloidal stability in suspension cao et al 2017 song et al 2017 has also been reported for s nzvi to the best of our knowledge published studies on s nzvi have been performed solely at the laboratory scale as such the field performance of s nzvi for dechlorination of cvocs is yet to be evaluated multiple pilot and field scale studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nzvi for in situ treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater elsner et al 2010 he et al 2010 henn and waddill 2006 kocur et al 2014 qian et al 2020 sheu et al 2016 however application of nzvi has often faced limitations related to colloidal instability and side oxidation reactions with natural in situ oxidants causing rapid passivation fang et al 2018 stefaniuk et al 2016 while a significant amount of research has been directed to improve colloidal stability fewer studies have been dedicated to the minimization of undesirable oxidation reactions controlled abiotic sulfidation of nzvi has shown potential to minimize such reactions and improve selectivity towards targeted pollutants fan et al 2016 such functionality makes s nzvi more advantageous than nzvi for large scale applications as more electron equivalents would hypothetically be directed to the reduction of contaminants resulting in a more cost effective treatment in this study we have reported results from a field synthesis and injection of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized s nzvi to remediate groundwater and soil contaminated with cvocs to assess the effectiveness of cmc s nzvi for the in situ transformation of contaminants compound specific isotope analysis csia was used to differentiate between physical processes dilution and displacement and chemical transformations hunkeler et al 2009 the specific objectives of the current study were to 1 assess the short and long term spatial and temporal variability of cvocs concentrations in groundwater and soil after injection of cmc s nzvi 2 utilize csia as an advanced diagnostic tool to distinguish chemical transformation from physical processes and 3 to monitor changes in chloride and total boron concentrations to assess dilution and displacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 site history and description located in sarnia ontario the site was home to cvocs production facilities resulting in the accumulation of a multicomponent dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone a description of the site can be found in our previous publication nunez garcia et al 2020 in short the study area is composed of a porous non native sandy material emplaced along a utility corridor within the native clay a dnapl pool is located directly below the treatment zone due to the differences in permeability between the backfill and the surrounding clay dnapl primarily migrated and accumulated between 4 and 5 m below ground surface bgs this was consistent with the appearance of the grey clay as revealed by the borehole logs and visual observations of dnapl in the form of staining or sheening of soil cores dnapl was further confirmed by organic vapor monitoring measurements using a photoionization detector fig s1 the wide range of cvocs production processes on this site contributed to the formation of a complex source zone with major compounds previously reported as tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce and chloroform kocur et al 2015 the distribution and concentrations of the cvocs in the source zone could have been impacted by past remedial activities as well as natural attenuation the abundance of typical daughter products from pce i e dichloroethenes dces and ethene and carbon tetrachloride ccl4 i e chloroform and dichloromethane dcm present in background samples fig s2 supports the hypothesis that transformation of parent compounds has occurred over time the present study was conducted at the fringes of a previous field trial that took place four years prior to this study when a total of 620 l of 1 g l 1 cmc nzvi was introduced into four wells kocur et al 2014 2015 2016 a plan view of the study area with the sets of wells from both studies is presented in fig s3 evidence of natural attenuation at the site has been previously reported and attributed to the abundance of dehalococcoides spp dhc in the background samples prior to the cmc nzvi injection kocur et al 2015 2 2 monitoring network eight multilevel bundle piezometers were installed six downstream na1 nb1 nc1 na2 nb2 and na4 and two upstream na3 and nb3 of the injection well figs s3 s4 the injection well consisted of a conventional 5 cm well with 0 61 m screen advanced using hollow stem augers bundled piezometers were made up of seven color coded Â¼ teflon tubes mounted on a Â¼ steel threaded rod mcmaster carr usa for stability the stainless steel screen length of each teflon tube was 0 127 m 100 mesh mcmaster carr usa and placed 0 305 m vertically apart with fabric mesh pockets holding Â¼ coated bentonite pellets canpipe ca in between in order to target different sampling depths figs s4 s5 unless otherwise specified each color denotes the following depths m bgs for all wells black 2 90 m yellow 3 20 m green 3 51 m clear 3 81 m blue 4 12 m and white 4 42 m the red level 4 73 m bgs was emplaced within the dnapl pool and therefore not sampled for cvocs analysis information on bundle piezometers for multilevel sampling can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 cmc s nzvi synthesis and characterization details on the synthesis procedure and characterization of the cmc s nzvi particles were described previously nunez garcia et al 2020 briefly nzvi was synthesized on site by first mixing ferrous sulfate heptahydrate with cmc 90 k and then reducing the mixture using sodium borohydride aqueous solid sulfidation was then carried out by treating the freshly synthesized cmc nzvi with sodium dithionite to produce a suspension of 1 g l 1 cmc s nzvi stabilized in 0 77 weight volume cmc and doped with 22 mm dithionite a total of 620 l of the suspension was prepared in four distinct batches 155 l each and introduced under gravity feed conditions via the injection well for 16 h transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of cmc s nzvi from synthesis barrels confirmed the presence of two different types of particles after sulfidation nunez garcia et al 2020 and fig s6 the first type consisted of discrete spherical nzvi like particles with an average size of 90 13 nm and iron as their major constituent some particles also showed the presence of oxygen and sulfur indicating the formation of a thin iron oxide sulfide coating the second type of particles were larger flake like structures with an average particle size of 505 81 nm these were relatively fewer in number and were composed of iron and sulfur suggesting the formation of larger iron sulfide particles dynamic light scattering dls also showed a bimodal particle size distribution further confirming the presence of two types of particles nunez garcia et al 2020 the size of smaller particles in dls analysis ranged from 357 4 to 438 7 nm that was close to the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi particles the size of larger particles ranged between 881 and 1038 nm the fe0 content of cmc s nzvi suspension could not be quantified by acid digestion with hydrochloric acid possibly due to its reaction with the sulfur compounds e g thiosulfate present in the suspension nunez garcia et al 2020 2 4 sampling and analytical methods groundwater samples were collected using 40 ml voa volatile organic analysis glass vials leaving no headspace and preserved with 0 2 g of sodium bisulfate nahso4 background samples were collected 28 5 h before the injection and are referred as 0 day cvocs pce ccl4 tetrachloroethanes 1 1 1 2 teca 1 1 2 2 teca tce chloroform trichloroethanes 1 1 1 tca 1 1 2 tca and 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca were extracted by transferring 250 Î¼l aliquot to 1 ml hexane and analyzed with a modified epa 8021 method using an agilent 7890 gas chromatograph gc equipped with an electron capture detector ecd a db 624 capillary column and an autosampler for hydrocarbons ethane and ethene and lower chlorinated vocs dces 1 1 dca vinyl chloride vc chloroethane and dcm aliquots of 1 ml were transferred to 2 ml gc vials and allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 1 h before manually sampling 250 Î¼l of the headspace and injecting into the gc analysis was carried out using a flame ionization detector fid and a gs gaspro column external standards were used for preparing calibration curves for all the cvocs and hydrocarbons for cvocs in soil background samples were collected during the installation of the wells 25 28 days before cmc s nzvi injection followed by post injection sampling at 94 and 554 days the soil cores were logged and sub sampled at either pre determined depths or targeted locations considered to be highly impacted by cvocs post injection boreholes were located between the locations of the monitoring wells 0 3 0 6 m apart to sample along the cmc s nzvi flow path bulk soil samples were collected and stored in 60 ml jars filling the container to the brim and leaving no headspace to minimize losses in accordance with epa method 5035a jars were stored on ice transported to the laboratory and kept in a cold room at 4 c in the laboratory 10 g of soil sample was quickly transferred into pre weighted vials containing 10 ml methanol and the vials were kept on shaker for 30 min for the cvocs extraction the extractant solution was then diluted with water analysis of the cvocs was performed with a gc ecd and a gc fid as described above chloride was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a conductivity detector model 432 waters milford ma a 4 6 50 cm ic pak anion column wat007355 using a 12 water acetonitrile eluent as mobile phase for elemental analysis soil samples were digested using u s epa method 3051a digested samples as well as total iron and total boron in water were analyzed as reported previously nunez garcia et al 2020 sulfide in monitoring well samples was measured by iodometric titration apha 1999 2 5 compound specific isotope analysis background samples were collected from nb1 white and nb2 white 28 5 h before injection and preserved in 40 ml voa vials using nahso4 post injection samples were also collected from the same wells 17 days after cmc s nzvi injection preserved in 1 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid in 40 ml voa vials with 5 ml headspace following the method of elsner et al 2006 vials were then covered with aluminum foil and frozen upside down to allow for a gradual freezing process and minimize losses headspace sampling and analysis was carried out using gas chromatograph combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometer finnigan 252 irms stable carbon isotope values are reported in the Î´ notation relative to the international vienna pee dee belemnite standard as follows eq 1 1 Î´ 13 c c 13 c 12 s a m p l e c 13 c 12 s t a n d a r d 1 where c 13 c 12 s a m p l e and c 13 c 12 s t a n d a r d are the ratios of carbon 13 and carbon 12 in the sample and standard respectively all stable carbon isotope values are reported with a 0 5 error encompassing both accuracy and reproducibility sherwood lollar et al 2007 a minimum of a 1 2 difference between two Î´13c values is considered significant hunkeler et al 2009 background information on csia and details on the gc method can be found in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate and transport of cmc s nzvi detailed results for the fate and transport of cmc s nzvi suspension at this site were discussed previously nunez garcia et al 2020 briefly the suspension was quite mobile with significant transport to the downgradient wells nb1 white nc1 white and na4 blue at a distance of 0 86 m 0 91 m and 2 7 m respectively from the injection well fig 1 a b notable migration of the suspension was also found in na3 white 1 71 m upgradient from the injection well in these wells concentrations of sulfate sulfur and total boron often followed a similar trend as total iron cmc s nzvi also travelled vertically up to the black 2 90 m bgs level of nb1 and green level 3 51 m bgs of nb2 as was shown by significant increase in total iron and total boron concentrations predominantly during the injection period nunez garcia et al 2020 and fig 2 a b a noticeable increase in sulfide concentrations in the monitoring wells also indicated the lateral and vertical transport of the suspension fig s7 tem analysis of the monitoring well samples collected during injection and on day 3 confirmed the presence of both nzvi like particles and larger flaky structures possibly fesx similar to those observed in the synthesis barrels nunez garcia et al 2020 moreover the presence of cmc s nzvi suspension was clearly visible from the black color of the monitoring well samples significant amounts of total iron total boron and sulfide were found in most of these wells up to 17 days figs 1b 2a b and s7 but the concentrations decreased thereafter suspended black particles remained in the injection well for several months 196 days but visible particles were not found in the monitoring wells during the long term sampling events nunez garcia et al 2020 3 2 changes in cvocs concentrations due to physical versus chemical processes the distribution and concentrations of cvocs in groundwater samples could have changed due to both chemical transformations as well as physical processes such as dilution and displacement contaminant transformation can be assessed by csia elsner et al 2010 chloride ion generation and formation of intermediates and end products while dilution can be assessed by investigating changes in the concentrations of conservative species he et al 2010 3 2 1 compound specific isotope analysis stable carbon isotope values were measured for pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc for nb1 white and nb2 white groundwater samples before day 0 and after day 17 of cmc s nzvi injection table 1 these sampling locations were chosen because of their different cmc s nzvi breakthroughs though they were roughly on the same flow path 0 86 nb1 white and 1 78 m nb2 white downgradient from the injection well fig s3 cmc s nzvi breakthrough nunez garcia et al 2020 was greater at nb1 white with a maximum total iron concentration of 1309 Î¼m whereas the maximum total iron concentration detected at nb2 white was 219 Î¼m fig 1b before injection the Î´13c values for pce were very similar i e within 0 5 in nb1 white and nb2 white suggesting that 26 0 was a relatively homogenous initial isotope signature for pce at the site at the time of this study compared to nb1 white tce was enriched in 13c 1 2 whereas cis 1 2 dce and vc were depleted in 13c by 2 9 and 1 2 respectively in nb2 white these results indicate the occurrence of tce transformation and generation of cis 1 2 dce and vc prior to cmc s nzvi injection as previously reported for the adjoining area kocur et al 2015 2016 these isotopic changes prior to the cmc s nzvi injection however would not impact the results of the current study as the csia method involves determination of absolute changes in isotopic composition before and after injection after injection pce tce and cis 1 2 dce concentrations decreased at nb1 white on day 17 whereas vc remained constant table 1 and fig 1f i pce concentration declined from 392 to 73 6 Î¼m while its Î´13c value increased from 26 0 to 24 6 1 4 enrichment in 13c indicating in situ transformation of pce between days 0 and 17 for tce the Î´13c value became more depleted in 13c 22 9 to 25 0 even though its concentration decreased from 91 9 to 62 6 Î¼m this suggests that tce generation from pce transformation was likely more significant than the tce transformation in addition Î´13c for tce was more negative than that for pce on day 17 indicating incorporation of 12c in tce further pointing towards tce as a transformation product of pce past literature has reported that molecules containing exclusively light isotopes 12c are preferentially transformed leading to an accumulation of 12c in product molecules elsner et al 2008 2010 in both nb1 white and nb2 white cis 1 2 dce concentrations decreased by approximately 50 60 while getting enriched in 13c i e from 22 8 to 20 2 in nb1 white and from 25 7 to 24 1 in nb2 white such enrichment trends are consistent with the breaking of bonds during transformation lojkasek lima et al 2012 the Î´13c value for cis 1 2 dce in nb1 white was less negative than that for pce and tce on day 17 suggesting that cis 1 2 dce transformation exceeded its generation as a pce tce transformation product contrary to nb1 white the concentrations and Î´13c values for pce and tce were relatively constant at nb2 white between days 0 and 17 indicating limited transformation likely due to the very limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough at this location in both wells vc concentrations remained constant and vc stable carbon isotope signatures did not change significantly overall the csia results provided strong evidence for in situ transformation of pce tce and cis 1 2 dce in the well with significant cmc s nzvi breakthrough i e nb1 white but limited transformation in the well with limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough i e nb2 white 3 2 2 chloride analysis the extent of cvocs transformation is also explored through chloride analysis chloride ions are generated via reductive dechlorination of cvocs eq 2 2 f e 0 r c l h f e 2 r h c l where rcl represents a generic chlorinated aliphatic compound the background chloride concentrations in the monitoring wells were in the range of 6597 32120 Î¼m fig s8 that are much higher than the chloride concentrations 1290 7300 Î¼m to be generated from the complete dechlorination of all cvocs in the background samples of these wells thus the changes in chloride concentrations after cmc s nzvi injection would not be able to depict a clear picture of the cvocs dechlorination due to cmc s nzvi for example the chloride concentrations calculated based on the generation of daughter products from the dechlorination of parent compounds account for only 12 540 Î¼m and 15 1069 Î¼m of the total measured chloride in the black and yellow levels of nb1 on day 3 respectively table s1 the difference between the predicted and the measured chloride could be due to displacement dilution as well as generation of unmonitored unidentified dechlorination products however some interesting changes in chloride concentrations were observed at various nb1 levels that are worth mentioning for example higher chloride concentrations were observed at the lower levels of nb1 3 51 4 42 m bgs before cmc s nzvi injection fig 2c the trend reversed after the injection with greater chloride concentrations detected at shallower depths 2 9 3 2 m bgs specifically the concentrations at the black and yellow levels increased by 4550 Î¼m and 7000 Î¼m respectively on day 3 on the other hand concentrations decreased from 14621 to 9594 Î¼m at the white level chloride concentrations also decreased significantly for blue clear and green levels on day 3 during the injection cmc s nzvi suspension first reached the lower levels white and blue and at greater concentrations this might have pushed the pre existing well water vertically to the upper levels resulting in upward displacement of chloride at nb1 on day 17 chloride concentrations further decreased at white and blue levels of nb1 increased for green but remained constant at the uppermost levels along with displacement dilution by the cmc s nzvi suspension would also have contributed to these changes in chloride concentrations especially at the lower levels 3 2 3 depth profiles of cvocs and ethene similar to chloride data the depth profiles for cvocs show that the concentrations of all the cvocs decreased at nb1 white on day 3 fig 2d j however the trend was not the same for other levels for example the concentrations of parent compounds pce and ccl4 decreased noticeably whereas the concentrations of intermediates e g cis 1 2 dce vc chloroform and dcm increased significantly at nb1 black this clearly indicates the occurrence of dechlorination even if displacement dilution was happening similarly the increasing decreasing trend for the cvocs was not consistent for the various nb1 levels on day 17 though significant concentrations of ethene were present in the background samples considerable changes in the ethene concentrations were noticed after the cmc s nzvi injection on day 3 the trend for ethene was also similar to that of the intermediates with decreased concentrations at the lower levels and increased concentrations at the upper levels of nb1 fig 2k in contrast to chloride data ethene concentrations increased at all the levels except black from day 3 to day 17 further indicating dechlorination at nb1 3 2 4 boron analysis to evaluate the extent of dilution the inorganic conservative constituent boron was analyzed total boron at nb1 white where chloride concentrations decreased after injection increased approximately seven fold in comparison to total boron at the black level fig 2b to make this observation more quantitative the following relationship eq 3 is used he et al 2010 3 d 1 c t b c 0 b where d is dilution factor ct is the total boron concentration in the groundwater sample on t 3 or 17 days and c0 is the total boron concentration in the injected suspension 37 7 mm values approaching unity mean little to no dilution of the groundwater by the injected suspension on day 3 dilution is most noticeable at nb1 white d 0 87 fig s9a followed by nc1 white 0 92 and na4 blue d 0 93 fig s9b all other wells including upper levels of nb1 had d 0 95 indicating lesser dilution on day 17 d values increased or remained constant for all the wells except for nc1 white that decreased to 0 90 the presence of total boron above background concentrations indicates that the injected suspension was still present in the targeted area on day 3 and to a lesser extent on day 17 this suggests that dilution has also contributed to changes in cvocs concentrations 3 3 dechlorination of cvocs in groundwater a previous field study in the adjoining area showed significant cvocs transformation in a three week period after cmc nzvi injection indicating the occurrence of short term abiotic transformation that was then followed by long term enhanced biotic transformation kocur et al 2015 thus the changes in cvocs concentrations after cmc s nzvi injection are presented as short and long term changes in the current study 3 3 1 short term changes in aqueous cvocs significant cmc s nzvi transport was found at 0 86 m nb1 white 0 91 m nc1 white and 2 7 m na4 blue downgradient as well as 1 71 m na3 white upgradient of the injection well fig 1b nb2 white located at 1 78 m downgradient observed limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough of note is that some of these wells retained high total iron concentrations even 17 days after injection coincident with the transport of cmc s nzvi and associated geochemical changes nunez garcia et al 2020 considerable changes in concentrations of aqueous cvocs in these wells were observed figs 1 and s10 total iron concentrations did not change much at na2 blue and nb3 white and the results for these wells are not discussed here nb1 white showed a noticeable decrease in all the cvocs on day 3 figs 1 and s10 concurrent with the high concentration of total iron 763 Î¼m a simultaneous decrease in ethene concentration 244 72 8 Î¼m on day 3 suggests the occurrence of dilution displacement due to cmc s nzvi injection however even when total iron concentration decreased to 96 7 Î¼m on day 17 the decrease in cvocs except tce and vc concentrations continued indicating dechlorination furthermore increase in tce concentration from 28 7 Î¼m on day 3 to 62 6 Î¼m on day 17 had resulted from its generation as a dechlorination product of pce as indicated by csia results section 3 2 1 a significant increase in ethene concentration from 72 8 Î¼m on day 3 to 173 Î¼m on day 17 further confirms dechlorination cmc s nzvi migrated to na3 white during injection with total iron concentrations remaining relatively high for an extended period i e 220 Î¼m total iron on day 17 like nb1 white na3 white showed a noticeable decrease in almost all cvocs concentrations on day 3 that continued until day 17 figs 1 and s10 although this decrease can be partly attributed to dilution displacement increase in ethene concentration on day 17 indicates that dechlorination also took place there was also an increase in tce concentration from 47 7 Î¼m on day 3 to 57 5 Î¼m on day 17 that might have generated from pce dechlorination na4 blue was another well with good cmc s nzvi breakthrough during injection in this well concentrations of pce cis 1 2 dce and chlorinated ethanes did not change considerably on day 3 figs 1 and s10 however tce concentration decreased from 87 8 to 37 7 Î¼m 50 Î¼m concurrent with a proportional increase in vc 11 Î¼m and ethene 36 Î¼m concentrations on day 3 suggesting tce dechlorination a significant decrease in concentrations of chlorinated methanes was also observed on day 3 in contrast to nb1 white and na3 white the concentrations of all cvocs rebounded on day 17 at na4 blue interestingly the total iron concentration also increased simultaneously in this well transport data shows that na4 blue is connected to the injection well via preferential flow paths nunez garcia et al 2020 which might have contributed to cvocs and iron mobilization to na4 blue on day 17 like na4 blue cvocs and ethene concentrations at nc1 white also decreased on day 3 but the concentrations rebounded on day 17 with a concurrent increase in total iron concentration although limited cmc s nzvi migrated to nb2 white during injection a significant amount of total iron 219 Î¼m was retained in this well up to day 17 at this location limited change 10 in concentrations of parent compounds pce ccl4 and tce was observed but concentrations of lower chlorinated vocs continued to decrease noticeably up to day 17 the decrease in ethene concentration on day 3 suggests dilution displacement however its increase on day 17 indicates occurrence of dechlorination proximity of the blue and white levels 4 4 5 m bgs to the dnapl pool along with the dilution displacement effects by cmc s nzvi injection make it challenging to distinguish between the various processes that govern the changes in cvocs concentrations a clearer picture of potential dechlorination can be deduced from the changes in cvocs concentrations at the uppermost level of nb1 black level 2 90 m bgs positioned approximately 1 83 m above the source zone fig s11 vertical transport of the cmc s nzvi suspension to this location was observed by an increase in the total iron and total boron concentrations in the upper levels of nb1 on day 3 fig 2a b pce concentration decreased from 374 to 272 Î¼m on day 3 but did not change much on day 17 fig s11 concurrently cis 1 2 dce and ethene increased from 70 6 to 169 Î¼m and from 96 9 to 145 Î¼m respectively on day 3 but decreased to 110 and 101 Î¼m on day 17 it is important to note that there was no appreciable accumulation of vc with cis 1 2 dce and ethene observed as the main dechlorination products similarly the decrease in ccl4 concentration from 255 to 166 Î¼m was accompanied by an increase in chloroform and dcm on day 3 unlike pce ccl4 concentration decreased further to 124 Î¼m on day 17 decreases in concentrations were also observed for other parent compounds 1 1 1 2 teca and 1 1 2 2 teca matched by increases in daughter products i e trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dca as stated above the short term changes in cvoc concentrations were influenced simultaneously by dechlorination dilution and displacement thus due to the complexity of the system changes in cvoc concentrations would not yield a straightforward correlation with changes in total iron total boron or sulfate cmc s nzvi constituents concentrations for example the concentrations of intermediates e g cis 1 2 dce increased in some wells due to their generation from dechlorination of parent compounds e g pce but concurrently decreased in other wells due to their own dechlorination in contrast ethene would yield a more straightforward correlation since it is an end product of the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes present at the site from day 0 to day 3 changes in ethene concentration were negatively correlated with the changes in total iron concentration fig s12a the total iron concentrations increased as a result of cmc s nzvi transport to the monitoring wells ethene concentrations were also supposed to increase due to its generation as a dechlorination product however the simultaneous occurrence of dilution and displacement resulted in decreased ethene concentrations especially in the lower levels of the monitoring wells this trend was reversed at the later stage fig s12d changes in ethene concentrations from day 3 to day 17 were positively correlated to changes in total iron concentrations from 0 to 3 days these results show that increase in ethene concentration was relatively much higher in wells with higher total iron breakthrough presumably due to abiotic dechlorination of cvocs by the cmc s nzvi total boron figs s12b and e and sulfate figs s12c and f followed the same trend as the total iron 3 3 2 long term changes in aqueous cvocs nb1 white and nb1 black were selected for analysis of long term dechlorination nb1 white lies just above the dnapl pool whereas nb1 black the uppermost level located 1 5 m above is expected to be least affected by the source zone short term monitoring indicated a significant decrease in concentrations of parent compounds pce ccl4 and tecas at both white and black levels of nb1 fig 3 which was partly due to dechlorination as discussed in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 1 there was also a noticeable change in the concentrations of the daughter products on day 17 at both the levels overall the concentration of total cvocs decreased from 922 Î¼m to 692 Î¼m at nb1 black fig 3d and from 1620 Î¼m to 443 Î¼m at nb1 white on day 17 fig 3h however the long term trend was opposite at these locations for nb1 black the concentrations of pce ccl4 and tecas continued to decline e g 70 on day 157 showing further dechlorination of these cvocs fig 3a c concurrently the concentrations of daughter products e g dce isomers chloroform and 1 2 dca increased on day 157 but then decreased noticeably for the next sampling rounds production of ethene throughout this period confirms the occurrence of dechlorination fig 3d total cvocs concentration decreased to as low as 245 Î¼m at nb1 black on day 561 in contrast total cvocs concentration rebounded at nb1 white on day 157 and continuously increased to 2585 Î¼m on day 561 fig 3h there was a significant and continued increase in the concentrations of parent compounds as well as the daughter products at this level fig 3e g the constant generation of ethene indicates dechlorination fig 3h although continued dissolution of the dnapl pool below seems to be the dominant process similar trends were observed for long term cvocs data at nb2 where a continuous decrease in cvoc concentrations was observed at nb2 black but cvocs concentrations at nb2 white increased with time fig s13 lack of visible black particles and noticeable decrease in total iron and sulfide concentrations in the monitoring well samples during the long term sampling events indicated the absence of injected cmc s nzvi suspension this suggests that cmc s nzvi did not play a direct role in the long term dechlorination of cvocs previous field studies have also shown that abiotic dechlorination caused by the initial zvi corrosion diminishes during long term monitoring while biotic dechlorination becomes the primary degradation pathway he et al 2010 kocur et al 2015 2016 the injected cmc s nzvi might have created favorable conditions for the long term biotransformation of cvocs as reported earlier for a cmc nzvi injection study kocur et al 2016 moreover excess dithionite in the injected suspension would also have indirectly contributed to the long term dechlorination of cvocs dithionite employed in the in situ redox manipulation isrm technology successfully reduces native fe iii from aquifer sediments soils to reactive fe ii species resulting in the transformation of chlorinated organic compounds boparai et al 2006 szecsody et al 2004 it even maintains the subsurface conditions favorable for reductive degradation up to 3 years fruchter et al 2000 as the soil in the current study area is rich in iron fig s14 the excess dithionite in the suspension is expected to have enriched the subsurface zone with the reactive fe ii species resulting in the abiotic transformation of cvocs 3 4 possible reaction mechanisms it is challenging to determine if changes in cvocs concentrations were due to abiotic or biotic transformation while the csia results for nb1 white confirmed the chemical transformation of chlorinated ethenes distinguishing between biotic and abiotic i e via cmc s nzvi processes typically requires comparison of the isotope signatures of the dechlorination products cis 1 2 dce vc acetylene ethene and ethane elsner et al 2008 ethene and ethane were not analyzed by csia acetylene which may serve as an indicator for abiotic dechlorination butler and hayes 1999 elsner et al 2010 was not detected the rapid and efficient removal of cvocs within 17 days suggests that dechlorination was mainly abiotic during this short term period a past field study in the adjoining area also showed noticeable reduction of cvocs within three weeks after cmc nzvi injection indicating the occurrence of short term abiotic dechlorination kocur et al 2015 as the injected cmc s nzvi suspension contained excess dithionite it might have resulted in some short term abiotic dechlorination moreover the reactive fe ii species generated via isrm might also have contributed to both short as well as long term abiotic dechlorination however biotransformation is expected to be the major contributor for long term dechlorination as reported earlier for the cmc nzvi injection study kocur et al 2016 for short term dechlorination csia results confirm the generation of tce as a product of pce transformation in nb1 white table 1 other wells e g nb1 black also showed a temporary increase in the concentrations of intermediates cis 1 2 dce and vc with concurrent dechlorination of pce this indicates hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination mechanism for chlorinated ethenes however pce dechlorination generally exceeded the generation of intermediates and ethene similarly dechlorination of cis 1 2 dce e g nb1 white and nb2 white exceeded the formation of vc and ethene these results suggest that reductive Î² elimination was also happening simultaneously past research has reported both reductive Î² elimination and hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination mechanisms for tce treated by s nzvi where ethene or acetylene were found as the major dechlorination products han and yan 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 experimental conditions particularly the method of nzvi sulfidation determine which mechanism would dominate for example han and yan 2016 reported ethene as the major product with ethane and acetylene as the minor products while treating tce with s nzvi developed by post synthesis addition of dithionite method similar to the one used in this study in the current study no acetylene was detected and chloroacetylenes were not analyzed but this does not completely rule out their formation the quantification of acetylene and chloroacetylenes is challenging in the field as they can quickly volatilize in air this may be the reason that reductive Î² elimination products are rarely reported for the iron treated field studies for chlorinated methanes the formation of chloroform and dcm indicates the transformation of ct via sequential hydrogenolysis as also reported by jin et al 2018 for long term dechlorination the formation of intermediates e g dce isomers chloroform and dcm at nb1 black and nb2 black indicate hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination pathway significant decrease in cis 1 2 dce concentrations without equivalent production of vc suggest that reductive Î² elimination was also happening microbial transformation of higher chlorinated ethanes and ethenes often results in partial dechlorination leading to the accumulation of intermediates such as dce isomers and vc he et al 2010 kocur et al 2016 the accumulation of vc a highly toxic and confirmed human carcinogen atsdr 2006 is usually of particular concern due to its poor biodegradability past study in the adjacent area reported the generation and accumulation of vc during long term microbial transformation of pce and tce following a cmc nzvi injection kocur et al 2015 2016 however one of the most positive outcomes of this cmc s nzvi field treatment is the non accumulation of lower chlorinated vocs particularly vc cmc s nzvi dithionite sulfidated injection would result in decreased h2 evolution formation of fess and significant reduction of native fe iii to reactive fe ii species whereas cmc nzvi injection would generate higher amounts of h2 and may not significantly impact the latter two conditions thus there can be two possible reasons for the non accumulation of vc in this cmc s nzvi field study as opposed to the cmc nzvi field trial firstly differences in geochemical changes along with the direct interactions between nzvi s nzvi and microbes are expected to result in different inhibitory stimulatory effects on the microbial communities for the two treatments certain classes of bacteria have the ability to intrinsically biodegrade vc in anaerobic aquifers bradley et al 1998 lorah and voytek 2004 although not yet investigated the geochemical conditions in the subsurface created by cmc s nzvi injection might be favorable for the enrichment of these bacteria secondly reactive fe ii species from dithionite reduced sediments would dechlorinate chlorinated ethenes via reductive Î² elimination without noticeable production of vc as reported for tce szecsody et al 2004 3 5 changes in soil cvocs visual observations in the form of staining sheening of soil cores as well as ovm measurements fig s1 indicated an appreciable amount of cvocs present as dnapl and sorbed mass soil cvocs concentrations are considered as a better metric for determining contaminant mass reduction in comparison to aqueous phase concentrations henn and waddill 2006 thus changes in soil cvocs were quantified by analyzing the soil samples collected before and after cmc s nzvi injection locations for pre and post injection soil cores are shown in fig s15 in table s2 the summarized data shows a significant decrease in concentrations of most of the cvocs in soil samples collected on 94 and 554 days after cmc s nzvi injection with some of them not even detected at many locations fig s16 shows a continuous decline in the total cvocs concentrations where the background average of 1496 Î¼mol kg decreased to 653 and 125 Î¼mol kg respectively on day 94 and 554 after cmc s nzvi injection table s2 and fig s16 also show that soil cvocs concentrations were highly variable for example pce concentrations varied between 35 5 and 1759 Î¼mol kg for the three zones on day 94 thus the results are also presented as box and whisker plots by grouping the data for each sampling event fig 4 median concentrations of pce and ccl4 showed some increase on day 94 but noticeably decreased on day 554 for all the other cvocs except 1 1 2 tca there was a continuous downward trend with time for example dcm median concentrations decreased from 278 to 8 62 Î¼mol kg on day 94 and further decreased to 1 55 Î¼mol kg on day 554 median concentrations for 1 1 2 tca remained relatively constant throughout the monitoring period this shows that the trends among the ten cvocs analyzed were not always consistent quantification of the extent of remediation using soil cores is challenging in part due to spatial variations and highly stratified distribution of contaminants within aquifers this complexity is exacerbated by the varying sampling depths for different locations and sampling times not allowing for a systematic depth by depth comparison a correlation analysis depicted in table s3 was performed with the purpose of evaluating the overall effectiveness of the cmc s nzvi injection on altering the cvocs concentrations in soil the r values indicate that the cvocs concentrations correlate better with each other over time suggesting the treatment was effective in causing a change in the concentrations and distribution of contaminants in the soil this long term decrease in soil cvocs might have occurred partly due to enhanced biological activity after cmc s nzvi injection however more work needs to be done to investigate the effect of this cmc s nzvi formulation on the microbial communities in the treatment zone dithionite reduced structural fe ii in the aquifer sediments soil might also have played an important role in the long term transformation of soil cvocs paul et al 2003 these results suggest cmc s nzvi is an effective strategy for cvocs dechlorination in soil 4 conclusions results reported herein demonstrate the suitability of cmc s nzvi as an effective technology for soil and groundwater remediation at existing contaminated sites a rapid decrease in cvocs concentrations was observed in groundwater samples immediately after injection followed by sustained long term dechlorination although cmc s nzvi injection resulted in some dilution and displacement of cvocs the changes in intermediate concentrations and an increase in ethene concentrations clearly indicate dechlorination csia serves as another line of evidence confirming the direct impact of chemical transformation as shown by the changes in stable isotope values of key chlorinated compounds proximity to the dnapl pool resulted in mass transfer of non aqueous constituents into the aqueous phase at the deeper blue and white levels 4 4 5 m bgs although significant ethene generation indicated concurrent dechlorination in contrast the uppermost level black which is expected to be least affected by the source zone observed a continuous decline in cvocs concentrations accompanied with the generation of ethene confirming dechlorination transformation was not limited to the aqueous phase as concentrations of soil cvocs also decreased significantly at 94 and 554 days after injection presence of dithionite might additionally have resulted in reducing the native fe iii to the reactive fe ii species which can degrade cvocs long term success of in situ emplacement of nzvi often relies on the biotransformation that follows the short term abiotic dechlorination kocur et al 2016 and care must be taken not to inhibit the growth of healthy microbial communities in this study the sustained long term dechlorination points towards biotransformation suggesting that growth of microbial communities was not inhibited however the extent to which biotic processes contributed to the transformation of cvocs is unknown and further characterization of the microbial communities after emplacement of cmc s nzvi is required as fundamental work about synthesis characterization and overall mechanisms of cmc s nzvi reactivity is ongoing this study is the first pilot test to upscale the application of abiotically sulfidated cmc nzvi from laboratory to field with the growing interest from all sectors of the remediation community as evidenced by the introduction of new commercial products of sulfidated n zvi regenesis 2018 s nzvi is likely to become an important in situ chemical reduction technology declaration of competing interest the authors

synthesized on site and injected into the subsurface at a site contaminated with a broad range of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs transport of cmc s nzvi to the monitoring wells both downgradient and upgradient resulted in a significant decrease in concentrations of aqueous phase cvocs short term 0 17 days total boron and chloride measurements indicated dilution and displacement in these wells importantly however compound specific isotope analysis csia changes in concentrations of intermediates and increase in ethene concentrations confirmed dechlorination of cvocs dissolution from the dnapl pool into the aqueous phase at the deepest levels 4 0 4 5 m bgs was identifiable from the increased cvocs concentrations during long term monitoring however at the uppermost levels 1 5 m above the source zone a contrasting trend was observed indicating successful dechlorination changes in cvocs concentrations and csia data suggest both sequential hydrogenolysis as well as reductive Î² elimination as the possible transformation mechanisms during the short term abiotic and long term biotic dechlorination one of the most positive outcomes of this cmc s nzvi field treatment is the non accumulation of lower chlorinated vocs particularly vinyl chloride post treatment soil cores also revealed significant decreases in cvocs concentrations throughout the targeted treatment zones results from this field study show that sulfidation is a suitable amendment for developing more efficient nzvi based in situ remediation technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidation nano zerovalent iron dithionite groundwater chlorinated vocs in situ remediation 1 introduction sulfidation is a recent development related to the use of zerovalent iron zvi based materials for groundwater remediation fan et al 2017 li et al 2017 though most of the focus in recent years has been on engineered sulfidation of nano zvi nzvi biogenic sulfidation of zvi has been extensively investigated since the 1990s benner et al 2002 phillips et al 2000 puls et al 1999 wilkin et al 2003 earlier studies focused on the identification of authigenic mineral phases formed during the application of zvi permeable reactive barriers prbs formation of iron sulfides fess was attributed to the concurrent oxidation of zvi and generation of sulfides via biogeochemical processes e g microbial reduction of so4 2 these mineral phases were studied in the context of the hydraulic performance of prbs noting that the accumulation of fes precipitates on zvi surface could contribute to pore clogging decreased permeability and slower groundwater flow however parallel work on the dechlorination of chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs by fess butler and hayes 1999 2000 led to the recognition of these mineral phases as an additional remediant during the operation of prbs he et al 2008 shen and wilson 2007 similar field studies utilized the in situ formation of fess to promote abiotic reduction of cvocs in the biogeochemical reductive dechlorination technology kennedy et al 2006a 2006b investigations on reactive fess for remediation purposes is now a thriving field as demonstrated by recent advances on their synthesis stabilization and applicability for the removal of contaminants gong et al 2016 in contrast to the biogenic processes described above abiotic sulfidation can be achieved by modifying the nzvi particles with sulfur compounds mainly sulfate cumbal et al 2015 dithionite cao et al 2017 fan et al 2016 li et al 2016 nunez garcia et al 2016 song et al 2017 lv et al 2019 thiosulfate han and yan 2016 and sulfide fan et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 zhao et al 2019 the resultant sulfidated nzvi s nzvi is more reactive than sulfur free nzvi for dechlorination of cvocs han and yan 2016 jin et al 2018 nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 adsorption of heavy metals cumbal et al 2015 lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 and transformation of organic contaminants cao et al 2017 li et al 2016 song et al 2017 increased longevity nunez garcia et al 2016 and higher colloidal stability in suspension cao et al 2017 song et al 2017 has also been reported for s nzvi to the best of our knowledge published studies on s nzvi have been performed solely at the laboratory scale as such the field performance of s nzvi for dechlorination of cvocs is yet to be evaluated multiple pilot and field scale studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nzvi for in situ treatment of contaminated soil and groundwater elsner et al 2010 he et al 2010 henn and waddill 2006 kocur et al 2014 qian et al 2020 sheu et al 2016 however application of nzvi has often faced limitations related to colloidal instability and side oxidation reactions with natural in situ oxidants causing rapid passivation fang et al 2018 stefaniuk et al 2016 while a significant amount of research has been directed to improve colloidal stability fewer studies have been dedicated to the minimization of undesirable oxidation reactions controlled abiotic sulfidation of nzvi has shown potential to minimize such reactions and improve selectivity towards targeted pollutants fan et al 2016 such functionality makes s nzvi more advantageous than nzvi for large scale applications as more electron equivalents would hypothetically be directed to the reduction of contaminants resulting in a more cost effective treatment in this study we have reported results from a field synthesis and injection of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized s nzvi to remediate groundwater and soil contaminated with cvocs to assess the effectiveness of cmc s nzvi for the in situ transformation of contaminants compound specific isotope analysis csia was used to differentiate between physical processes dilution and displacement and chemical transformations hunkeler et al 2009 the specific objectives of the current study were to 1 assess the short and long term spatial and temporal variability of cvocs concentrations in groundwater and soil after injection of cmc s nzvi 2 utilize csia as an advanced diagnostic tool to distinguish chemical transformation from physical processes and 3 to monitor changes in chloride and total boron concentrations to assess dilution and displacement 2 materials and methods 2 1 site history and description located in sarnia ontario the site was home to cvocs production facilities resulting in the accumulation of a multicomponent dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl source zone a description of the site can be found in our previous publication nunez garcia et al 2020 in short the study area is composed of a porous non native sandy material emplaced along a utility corridor within the native clay a dnapl pool is located directly below the treatment zone due to the differences in permeability between the backfill and the surrounding clay dnapl primarily migrated and accumulated between 4 and 5 m below ground surface bgs this was consistent with the appearance of the grey clay as revealed by the borehole logs and visual observations of dnapl in the form of staining or sheening of soil cores dnapl was further confirmed by organic vapor monitoring measurements using a photoionization detector fig s1 the wide range of cvocs production processes on this site contributed to the formation of a complex source zone with major compounds previously reported as tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce and chloroform kocur et al 2015 the distribution and concentrations of the cvocs in the source zone could have been impacted by past remedial activities as well as natural attenuation the abundance of typical daughter products from pce i e dichloroethenes dces and ethene and carbon tetrachloride ccl4 i e chloroform and dichloromethane dcm present in background samples fig s2 supports the hypothesis that transformation of parent compounds has occurred over time the present study was conducted at the fringes of a previous field trial that took place four years prior to this study when a total of 620 l of 1 g l 1 cmc nzvi was introduced into four wells kocur et al 2014 2015 2016 a plan view of the study area with the sets of wells from both studies is presented in fig s3 evidence of natural attenuation at the site has been previously reported and attributed to the abundance of dehalococcoides spp dhc in the background samples prior to the cmc nzvi injection kocur et al 2015 2 2 monitoring network eight multilevel bundle piezometers were installed six downstream na1 nb1 nc1 na2 nb2 and na4 and two upstream na3 and nb3 of the injection well figs s3 s4 the injection well consisted of a conventional 5 cm well with 0 61 m screen advanced using hollow stem augers bundled piezometers were made up of seven color coded Â¼ teflon tubes mounted on a Â¼ steel threaded rod mcmaster carr usa for stability the stainless steel screen length of each teflon tube was 0 127 m 100 mesh mcmaster carr usa and placed 0 305 m vertically apart with fabric mesh pockets holding Â¼ coated bentonite pellets canpipe ca in between in order to target different sampling depths figs s4

emplaced within the dnapl pool and therefore not sampled for cvocs analysis information on bundle piezometers for multilevel sampling can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 cmc s nzvi synthesis and characterization details on the synthesis procedure and characterization of the cmc s nzvi particles were described previously nunez garcia et al 2020 briefly nzvi was synthesized on site by first mixing ferrous sulfate heptahydrate with cmc 90 k and then reducing the mixture using sodium borohydride aqueous solid sulfidation was then carried out by treating the freshly synthesized cmc nzvi with sodium dithionite to produce a suspension of 1 g l 1 cmc s nzvi stabilized in 0 77 weight volume cmc and doped with 22 mm dithionite a total of 620 l of the suspension was prepared in four distinct batches 155 l each and introduced under gravity feed conditions via the injection well for 16 h transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of cmc s nzvi from synthesis barrels confirmed the presence of two different types of particles after sulfidation nunez garcia et al 2020 and fig s6 the first type consisted of discrete spherical nzvi like particles with an average size of 90 13 nm and iron as their major constituent some particles also showed the presence of oxygen and sulfur indicating the formation of a thin iron oxide sulfide coating the second type of particles were larger flake like structures with an average particle size of 505 81 nm these were relatively fewer in number and were composed of iron and sulfur suggesting the formation of larger iron sulfide particles dynamic light scattering dls also showed a bimodal particle size distribution further confirming the presence of two types of particles nunez garcia et al 2020 the size of smaller particles in dls analysis ranged from 357 4 to 438 7 nm that was close to the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi particles the size of larger particles ranged between 881 and 1038 nm the fe0 content of cmc s nzvi suspension could not be quantified by acid digestion with hydrochloric acid possibly due to its reaction with the sulfur compounds e g thiosulfate present in the suspension nunez garcia et al 2020 2 4 sampling and analytical methods groundwater samples were collected using 40 ml voa volatile organic analysis glass vials

of the headspace and injecting into the gc analysis was carried out using a flame ionization detector fid and a gs gaspro column external standards were used for preparing calibration curves for all the cvocs and hydrocarbons for cvocs in soil background samples were collected during the installation of the wells 25 28 days before cmc s nzvi injection followed by post injection sampling at 94 and 554 days the soil cores were logged and sub sampled at either pre determined depths or targeted locations considered to be highly impacted by cvocs post injection boreholes were located between the locations of the monitoring wells 0 3 0 6 m apart to sample along the cmc s nzvi flow path bulk soil samples were collected and stored in 60 ml jars filling the container to the brim and leaving no headspace to minimize losses in accordance with epa method 5035a jars were stored on ice transported to the laboratory and kept in a cold room at 4 c in the laboratory 10 g of soil sample was quickly transferred into pre weighted vials containing 10 ml methanol and the vials were kept on shaker for 30 min for the cvocs extraction the extractant solution was then diluted with water analysis of the cvocs was performed with a gc ecd and a gc fid as described above chloride was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a conductivity detector model 432 waters milford ma

total iron and total boron in water were analyzed as reported previously nunez garcia et al 2020 sulfide in monitoring well samples was measured by iodometric titration apha 1999 2 5 compound specific isotope analysis background samples were collected from nb1 white and nb2 white 28 5 h before injection and preserved in 40 ml voa vials using nahso4 post injection samples were also collected from the same wells 17 days after cmc s nzvi injection preserved in 1 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid in 40 ml voa vials with 5 ml headspace following the method of elsner et al 2006 vials were then covered with aluminum foil and frozen upside down to allow for a gradual freezing process and minimize losses headspace sampling and analysis was carried out using gas chromatograph combustion isotope

isotope values are reported with a 0 5 error encompassing both accuracy and reproducibility sherwood lollar et al 2007 a minimum of a 1 2 difference between two Î´13c values is considered significant hunkeler et al 2009 background information on csia and details on the gc method can be found in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate and transport of cmc s nzvi detailed results for the fate and transport of cmc s nzvi suspension at this site were discussed previously nunez garcia et al 2020 briefly the suspension was quite mobile with significant transport to the downgradient wells nb1 white nc1 white and na4 blue at a distance of 0 86 m 0 91 m and 2 7 m respectively from the injection well fig 1 a b notable migration of the suspension was also found in na3 white 1 71 m upgradient from the injection well in these wells concentrations of sulfate sulfur and total boron often followed a similar trend as total iron cmc s nzvi also travelled vertically up to the black 2 90 m bgs level of nb1 and green level 3 51 m bgs of nb2 as was shown by significant increase in total iron and total boron concentrations predominantly during the injection period nunez garcia et al 2020 and fig 2 a b a noticeable increase in sulfide concentrations in the monitoring wells also indicated the lateral and vertical transport of the suspension fig s7 tem analysis of the monitoring well samples collected during injection and on day 3 confirmed the presence of both nzvi like particles and larger flaky structures possibly fesx similar to those observed in the synthesis barrels nunez garcia et al 2020 moreover the presence of cmc s nzvi suspension was clearly visible from the black color of the monitoring well samples significant amounts of total iron total boron and sulfide were found in most of these wells up to 17 days figs 1b 2a b and s7 but the concentrations decreased thereafter suspended black particles remained in the injection well for several months 196 days but visible particles were not found in the monitoring wells during the long term sampling events nunez garcia et al 2020 3 2 changes in cvocs concentrations due to physical versus chemical processes the distribution and concentrations of cvocs in groundwater samples could have changed due to both chemical transformations as well as physical processes such as dilution and displacement contaminant transformation can be assessed by csia elsner et al 2010 chloride ion generation and formation of intermediates and end products while dilution can be assessed by investigating changes in the concentrations of conservative species he et al 2010 3 2 1 compound specific isotope analysis stable carbon isotope values were measured for pce tce cis 1 2 dce and vc for nb1 white and nb2 white groundwater samples before day 0 and after day 17 of cmc s nzvi injection table 1 these sampling locations were chosen because of their different cmc s nzvi breakthroughs though they were roughly on the same flow path 0 86 nb1 white and 1 78 m nb2 white downgradient from the injection well fig s3 cmc s nzvi breakthrough nunez garcia et al 2020 was greater at nb1 white with a maximum total iron concentration of 1309 Î¼m whereas the maximum total iron concentration detected at nb2 white was 219 Î¼m fig 1b before injection the Î´13c values for pce were very similar i e within 0 5 in nb1 white and nb2 white suggesting that 26 0 was a relatively homogenous initial isotope signature for pce at the site at the time of this study compared to nb1 white tce was enriched in 13c 1 2 whereas cis 1 2 dce and vc were depleted in 13c by 2 9 and 1 2 respectively in nb2 white these results indicate the occurrence of tce transformation and generation of cis 1 2 dce and vc prior to cmc s nzvi injection as previously reported for the adjoining area kocur et al 2015 2016 these isotopic changes prior to the cmc s nzvi injection however would not impact the results of the current study as the csia method involves determination of absolute changes in isotopic composition before and after injection after injection pce tce and cis 1 2 dce concentrations decreased at nb1 white on day 17 whereas vc remained constant table 1 and fig 1f i pce concentration declined from 392 to 73 6 Î¼m while its Î´13c value increased from 26 0 to 24 6 1 4 enrichment in 13c indicating in situ transformation of pce between days 0 and 17 for tce the Î´13c value became more depleted in 13c 22 9 to 25 0 even though its concentration decreased from 91 9 to 62 6 Î¼m this suggests that tce generation from pce transformation was likely more significant than the tce transformation in addition Î´13c for tce was more negative than that for pce on day 17 indicating incorporation of 12c in tce further pointing towards tce as a transformation product of pce past literature has reported that molecules containing exclusively light isotopes 12c are preferentially transformed leading to an accumulation of 12c in product molecules elsner et al 2008 2010 in both nb1 white and nb2 white cis 1 2 dce concentrations decreased by approximately 50 60 while getting enriched in 13c i e from 22 8 to 20 2 in nb1 white and from 25 7 to 24 1 in nb2 white such enrichment trends are consistent with the breaking of bonds during transformation lojkasek lima et al 2012 the Î´13c value for cis 1 2 dce in nb1 white was less negative than that for pce and tce on day 17 suggesting that cis 1 2 dce transformation exceeded its generation as a pce tce transformation product contrary to nb1 white the concentrations and Î´13c values for pce and tce were relatively constant at nb2 white between days 0 and 17 indicating limited transformation likely due to the very limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough at this location in both wells vc concentrations remained constant and vc stable carbon isotope signatures did not change significantly overall the csia results provided strong evidence for in situ transformation of pce tce and cis 1 2 dce in the well with significant cmc s nzvi breakthrough i e nb1 white but limited transformation in the well with limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough i e nb2 white 3 2 2 chloride analysis the extent of cvocs transformation is also explored through chloride analysis chloride ions are generated via reductive dechlorination of cvocs eq 2 2 f e 0 r c l h f e 2 r h c l where rcl represents a generic chlorinated aliphatic compound the background chloride concentrations in the monitoring wells were in the range of 6597 32120 Î¼m fig s8 that are much higher than the chloride concentrations 1290 7300 Î¼m to be generated from the complete dechlorination of all cvocs in the background samples of these wells thus the changes in chloride concentrations after cmc s nzvi injection would not be able to depict a clear picture of the cvocs dechlorination due to cmc s nzvi for example the chloride concentrations calculated based on the generation of daughter products from the dechlorination of parent compounds account for only 12 540 Î¼m and 15 1069 Î¼m of the total measured chloride in the black and yellow levels of nb1 on day 3 respectively table s1 the difference between the predicted and the measured chloride could be due to displacement dilution as well as generation of unmonitored unidentified dechlorination products however some interesting changes in chloride concentrations were observed at various nb1 levels that are worth mentioning for example higher chloride concentrations were observed at the lower levels of nb1 3 51 4 42 m bgs before cmc s nzvi injection fig 2c the trend reversed after the injection with greater chloride concentrations detected at shallower depths 2 9 3 2 m bgs specifically the concentrations at the black and yellow levels increased by 4550 Î¼m and 7000 Î¼m respectively on day 3 on the other hand concentrations decreased from 14621 to 9594 Î¼m at the white level chloride concentrations also decreased significantly for blue clear and green levels on day 3 during the injection cmc s nzvi suspension first reached the lower levels white and blue and at greater concentrations this might have pushed the pre existing well water vertically to the upper levels resulting in upward displacement of chloride at nb1 on day 17 chloride concentrations further decreased at white and blue levels of nb1 increased for green but remained constant at the uppermost levels along with displacement dilution by the cmc s nzvi suspension would also have contributed to these changes in chloride concentrations especially at the lower levels 3 2 3 depth profiles of cvocs and ethene similar to chloride data the depth profiles for cvocs show that the concentrations of all the cvocs decreased at nb1 white on day 3 fig 2d j however the trend was not the same for other levels for example the concentrations of parent compounds pce and ccl4 decreased noticeably whereas the concentrations of intermediates e g cis 1 2 dce vc chloroform and dcm increased significantly at nb1 black this clearly indicates the occurrence of dechlorination even if displacement dilution was happening similarly the increasing decreasing trend for the cvocs was not consistent for the various nb1 levels on day 17 though significant concentrations of ethene were present in the background samples considerable changes in the ethene concentrations were noticed after the cmc s nzvi injection on day 3 the trend for ethene was also similar to that of the intermediates with decreased concentrations at the lower levels and increased concentrations at the upper levels of nb1 fig 2k in contrast to chloride data ethene concentrations increased at all the levels except black from day 3 to day 17 further indicating dechlorination at nb1 3 2 4 boron analysis to evaluate the extent of dilution the inorganic conservative constituent boron was analyzed total boron at nb1 white where chloride concentrations decreased after injection increased approximately seven fold in comparison to total boron at the black level fig 2b to make this observation more quantitative the following relationship eq 3 is used he et al 2010 3 d 1 c t b c 0 b where d is dilution factor ct is the total boron concentration in the groundwater sample on t 3 or 17 days and c0 is the total boron concentration in the injected suspension 37 7 mm values approaching unity mean little to no dilution of the groundwater by the injected suspension on day 3 dilution is most noticeable at nb1 white d 0 87 fig s9a followed by nc1 white 0 92 and na4 blue d 0 93 fig s9b all other wells including upper levels of nb1 had d 0 95 indicating lesser dilution on day 17 d values increased or remained constant for all the wells except for nc1 white that decreased to 0 90 the presence of total boron above background concentrations indicates that the injected suspension was still present in the targeted area on day 3 and to a lesser extent on day 17 this suggests that dilution has also contributed to changes in cvocs concentrations 3 3 dechlorination of cvocs in groundwater a previous field study in the adjoining area showed significant cvocs transformation in a three week period after cmc nzvi injection indicating the occurrence of short term abiotic transformation that was then followed by long term enhanced biotic transformation kocur et al 2015 thus the changes in cvocs concentrations after cmc s nzvi injection are presented as short and long term changes in the current study 3 3 1 short term changes in aqueous cvocs significant cmc s nzvi transport was found at 0 86 m nb1 white 0 91 m nc1 white and 2 7 m na4 blue downgradient as well as 1 71 m na3 white upgradient of the injection well fig 1b nb2 white located at 1 78 m downgradient observed limited cmc s nzvi breakthrough of note is that some of these wells retained high total iron concentrations even 17 days after injection coincident with the transport of cmc s nzvi and associated geochemical changes nunez garcia et al 2020 considerable changes in concentrations of aqueous cvocs in these wells were observed figs 1 and s10 total iron concentrations did not change much at na2 blue and nb3 white and the results for these wells are not discussed here nb1 white showed a noticeable decrease in all the cvocs on day 3 figs 1 and s10 concurrent with the high concentration of total iron 763 Î¼m a simultaneous decrease in ethene concentration 244 72 8 Î¼m on day 3 suggests the occurrence of dilution displacement due to cmc s nzvi injection however even when total iron concentration decreased to 96 7 Î¼m on day 17 the decrease in cvocs except tce and vc concentrations continued indicating dechlorination furthermore increase in tce concentration from 28 7 Î¼m on day 3 to 62 6 Î¼m on day 17 had resulted from its generation as a dechlorination product of pce as indicated by csia results section 3 2 1 a significant increase in ethene concentration from 72 8 Î¼m on day 3 to 173 Î¼m on day 17 further confirms dechlorination cmc s nzvi migrated to na3 white during injection with total iron concentrations remaining relatively high for an extended period i e 220 Î¼m total iron on day 17 like nb1 white na3 white showed a noticeable decrease in almost all cvocs concentrations on day 3 that continued until day 17 figs 1 and s10 although this decrease can be partly attributed to dilution displacement increase in ethene concentration on day 17 indicates that dechlorination also took place there was also an increase in tce concentration from 47 7 Î¼m on day 3 to 57 5 Î¼m on day 17 that might have generated from pce dechlorination na4 blue was another well with good cmc s nzvi breakthrough during injection in this well concentrations of pce cis 1 2 dce and chlorinated ethanes did not change considerably on day 3 figs 1 and s10 however tce concentration decreased from 87 8 to 37 7 Î¼m 50 Î¼m concurrent with a proportional increase in vc 11 Î¼m and ethene 36 Î¼m concentrations on day 3 suggesting tce dechlorination a significant decrease in concentrations of chlorinated methanes was also observed on day 3 in contrast to nb1 white and na3 white the concentrations of all cvocs rebounded on day 17 at na4 blue interestingly the total iron concentration also increased simultaneously in this well transport data shows that na4 blue is connected to the injection well via preferential flow paths nunez garcia et al 2020 which might have contributed to cvocs and iron mobilization to na4 blue on day 17 like na4 blue cvocs and ethene concentrations at nc1 white also decreased on day 3 but the concentrations rebounded on day 17 with a concurrent increase in total iron concentration although limited cmc s nzvi migrated to nb2 white during injection a significant amount of total iron 219 Î¼m was retained in this well up to day 17 at this location limited change 10 in concentrations of parent compounds pce ccl4 and tce was observed but concentrations of lower chlorinated vocs continued to decrease noticeably up to day 17 the decrease in ethene concentration on day 3 suggests dilution displacement however its increase on day 17 indicates occurrence of dechlorination proximity of the blue and white levels 4 4 5 m bgs to the dnapl pool along with the dilution displacement effects by cmc s nzvi injection make it challenging to distinguish between the various processes that govern the changes in cvocs concentrations a clearer picture of potential dechlorination can be deduced from the changes in cvocs concentrations at the uppermost level of nb1 black level 2 90 m bgs positioned approximately 1 83 m above the source zone fig s11 vertical transport of the cmc s nzvi suspension to this location was observed by an increase in the total iron and total boron concentrations in the upper levels of nb1 on day 3 fig 2a b pce concentration decreased from 374 to 272 Î¼m on day 3 but did not change much on day 17 fig s11 concurrently cis 1 2 dce and ethene increased from 70 6 to 169 Î¼m and from 96 9 to 145 Î¼m respectively on day 3 but decreased to 110 and 101 Î¼m on day 17 it is important to note that there was no appreciable accumulation of vc with cis 1 2 dce and ethene observed as the main dechlorination products similarly the decrease in ccl4 concentration from 255 to 166 Î¼m was accompanied by an increase in chloroform and dcm on day 3 unlike pce ccl4 concentration decreased further to 124 Î¼m on day 17 decreases in concentrations were also observed for other parent compounds 1 1 1 2 teca and 1 1 2 2 teca matched by increases in daughter products i e trans 1 2 dce and 1 1 dca as stated above the short term changes in cvoc concentrations were influenced simultaneously by dechlorination dilution and displacement thus due to the complexity of the system changes in cvoc concentrations would not yield a straightforward correlation with changes in total iron total boron or sulfate cmc s nzvi constituents concentrations for example the concentrations of intermediates e g cis 1 2 dce increased in some wells due to their generation from dechlorination of parent compounds e g pce but concurrently decreased in other wells due to their own dechlorination in contrast ethene would yield a more straightforward correlation since it is an end product of the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes present at the site from day 0 to day 3 changes in ethene concentration were negatively correlated with the changes in total iron concentration fig s12a the total iron concentrations increased as a result of cmc s nzvi transport to the monitoring wells ethene concentrations were also supposed to increase due to its generation as a dechlorination product however the simultaneous occurrence of dilution and displacement resulted in decreased ethene concentrations especially in the lower levels of the monitoring wells this trend was reversed at the later stage fig s12d changes in ethene concentrations from day 3 to day 17 were positively correlated to changes in total iron concentrations from 0 to 3 days these results show that increase in ethene concentration was relatively much higher in wells with higher total iron breakthrough presumably due to abiotic dechlorination of cvocs by the cmc s nzvi total boron figs s12b and e and sulfate figs s12c and f followed the same trend as the total iron 3 3 2 long term changes in aqueous cvocs nb1 white and nb1 black were selected for analysis of long term dechlorination nb1 white lies just above the dnapl pool whereas nb1 black the uppermost level located 1 5 m above is expected to be least affected by the source zone short term monitoring indicated a significant decrease in concentrations of parent compounds pce ccl4 and tecas at both white and black levels of nb1 fig 3 which was partly due to dechlorination as discussed in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 1 there was also a noticeable change in the concentrations of the daughter products on day 17 at both the levels overall the concentration of total cvocs decreased from 922 Î¼m to 692 Î¼m at nb1 black fig 3d and from 1620 Î¼m to 443 Î¼m at nb1 white on day 17 fig 3h however the long term trend was opposite at these locations for nb1 black the concentrations of pce ccl4 and tecas continued to decline e g 70 on day 157 showing further dechlorination of these cvocs fig 3a c concurrently the concentrations of daughter products e g dce isomers chloroform and 1 2 dca increased on day 157 but then decreased noticeably for the next sampling rounds production of ethene throughout this period confirms the occurrence of dechlorination fig 3d total cvocs concentration decreased to as low as 245 Î¼m at nb1 black on day 561 in contrast total cvocs concentration rebounded at nb1 white on day 157 and continuously increased to 2585 Î¼m on day 561 fig 3h there was a significant and continued increase in the concentrations of parent compounds as well as the daughter products at this level fig 3e g the constant generation of ethene indicates dechlorination fig 3h although continued dissolution of the dnapl pool below seems to be the dominant process similar trends were observed for long term cvocs data at nb2 where a continuous decrease in cvoc concentrations was observed at nb2 black but cvocs concentrations at nb2 white increased with time fig s13 lack of visible black particles and noticeable decrease in total iron and sulfide concentrations in the monitoring well samples during the long term sampling events indicated the absence of injected cmc s nzvi suspension this suggests that cmc s nzvi did not play a direct role in the long term dechlorination of cvocs previous field studies have also shown that abiotic dechlorination caused by the initial zvi corrosion diminishes during long term monitoring while biotic dechlorination becomes the primary degradation pathway he et al 2010 kocur et al 2015 2016 the injected cmc s nzvi might have created favorable conditions for the long term biotransformation of cvocs as reported earlier for a cmc nzvi injection study kocur et al 2016 moreover excess dithionite in the injected suspension would also have indirectly contributed to the long term dechlorination of cvocs dithionite employed in the in situ redox manipulation isrm technology successfully reduces native fe iii from aquifer sediments soils to reactive fe ii species resulting in the transformation of chlorinated organic compounds boparai et al 2006 szecsody et al 2004 it even maintains the subsurface conditions favorable for reductive degradation up to 3 years fruchter et al 2000 as the soil in the current study area is rich in iron fig s14 the excess dithionite in the suspension is expected to have enriched the subsurface zone with the reactive fe ii species resulting in the abiotic transformation of cvocs 3 4 possible reaction mechanisms it is challenging to determine if changes in cvocs concentrations were due to abiotic or biotic transformation while the csia results for nb1 white confirmed the chemical transformation of chlorinated ethenes distinguishing between biotic and abiotic i e via cmc s nzvi processes typically requires comparison of the isotope signatures of the dechlorination products cis 1 2 dce vc acetylene ethene and ethane elsner et al 2008 ethene and ethane were not analyzed by csia acetylene which may serve as an indicator for abiotic dechlorination butler and hayes 1999 elsner et al 2010 was not detected the rapid and efficient removal of cvocs within 17 days suggests that dechlorination was mainly abiotic during this short term period a past field study in the adjoining area also showed noticeable reduction of cvocs within three weeks after cmc nzvi injection indicating the occurrence of short term abiotic dechlorination kocur et al 2015 as the injected cmc s nzvi suspension contained excess dithionite it might have resulted in some short term abiotic dechlorination moreover the reactive fe ii species generated via isrm might also have contributed to both short as well as long term abiotic dechlorination however biotransformation is expected to be the major contributor for long term dechlorination as reported earlier for the cmc nzvi injection study kocur et al 2016 for short term dechlorination csia results confirm the generation of tce as a product of pce transformation in nb1 white table 1 other wells e g nb1 black also showed a temporary increase in the concentrations of intermediates cis 1 2 dce and vc with concurrent dechlorination of pce this indicates hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination mechanism for chlorinated ethenes however pce dechlorination generally exceeded the generation of intermediates and ethene similarly dechlorination of cis 1 2 dce e g nb1 white and nb2 white exceeded the formation of vc and ethene these results suggest that reductive Î² elimination was also happening simultaneously past research has reported both reductive Î² elimination and hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination mechanisms for tce treated by s nzvi where ethene or acetylene were found as the major dechlorination products han and yan 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 experimental conditions particularly the method of nzvi sulfidation determine which mechanism would dominate for example han and yan 2016 reported ethene as the major product with ethane and acetylene as the minor products while treating tce with s nzvi developed by post synthesis addition of dithionite method similar to the one used in this study in the current study no acetylene was detected and chloroacetylenes were not analyzed but this does not completely rule out their formation the quantification of acetylene and chloroacetylenes is challenging in the field as they can quickly volatilize in air this may be the reason that reductive Î² elimination products are rarely reported for the iron treated field studies for chlorinated methanes the formation of chloroform and dcm indicates the transformation of ct via sequential hydrogenolysis as also reported by jin et al 2018 for long term dechlorination the formation of intermediates e g dce isomers chloroform and dcm at nb1 black and nb2 black indicate hydrogenolysis as the dechlorination pathway significant decrease in cis 1 2 dce concentrations without equivalent production of vc suggest that reductive Î² elimination was also happening microbial transformation of higher chlorinated ethanes and ethenes often results in partial dechlorination leading to the accumulation of intermediates such as dce isomers and vc he et al 2010 kocur et al 2016 the accumulation of vc a highly toxic and confirmed human carcinogen atsdr 2006 is usually of particular concern due to its poor biodegradability past study in the adjacent area reported the generation and accumulation of vc during long term microbial transformation of pce and tce following a cmc nzvi injection kocur et al 2015 2016 however one of the most positive outcomes of this cmc s nzvi field treatment is the non accumulation of lower chlorinated vocs particularly vc cmc s nzvi dithionite sulfidated injection would result in decreased h2 evolution formation of fess and significant reduction of native fe iii to reactive fe ii species whereas cmc nzvi injection would generate higher amounts of h2 and may not significantly impact the latter two conditions thus there can be two possible reasons for the non accumulation of vc in this cmc s nzvi field study as opposed to the cmc nzvi field trial firstly differences in geochemical changes along with the direct interactions between nzvi s nzvi and microbes are expected to result in different inhibitory stimulatory effects on the microbial communities for the two treatments certain classes of bacteria have the ability to intrinsically biodegrade vc in anaerobic aquifers bradley et al 1998 lorah and voytek 2004 although not yet investigated the geochemical conditions in the subsurface created by cmc s nzvi injection might be favorable for the enrichment of these bacteria secondly reactive fe ii species from dithionite reduced sediments would dechlorinate chlorinated ethenes via reductive Î² elimination without noticeable production of vc as reported for tce szecsody et al 2004 3 5 changes in soil cvocs visual observations in the form of staining sheening of soil cores as well as ovm measurements fig s1 indicated an appreciable amount of cvocs present as dnapl and sorbed mass soil cvocs concentrations are considered as a better metric for determining contaminant mass reduction in comparison to aqueous phase concentrations henn and waddill 2006 thus changes in soil cvocs were quantified by analyzing the soil samples collected before and after cmc s nzvi injection locations for pre and post injection soil cores are shown in fig s15 in table s2 the summarized data shows a significant decrease in concentrations of most of the cvocs in soil samples collected on 94 and 554 days after cmc s nzvi injection with some of them not even detected at many locations fig s16 shows a continuous decline in the total cvocs concentrations where the background average of 1496 Î¼mol kg decreased to 653 and 125 Î¼mol kg respectively on day 94 and 554 after cmc s nzvi injection table s2 and fig s16 also show that soil cvocs concentrations were highly variable for example pce concentrations varied between 35 5 and 1759 Î¼mol kg for the three zones on day 94 thus the results are also presented as box and whisker plots by grouping the data for each sampling event fig 4 median concentrations of pce and ccl4 showed some increase on day 94 but noticeably decreased on day 554 for all the other cvocs except 1 1 2 tca there was a continuous downward trend with time for example dcm median concentrations decreased from 278 to 8 62 Î¼mol kg on day 94 and further decreased to 1 55 Î¼mol kg on day 554 median concentrations for 1 1 2 tca remained relatively constant throughout the monitoring period this shows that the trends among the ten cvocs analyzed were not always consistent quantification of the extent of remediation using soil cores is challenging in part due to spatial variations and highly stratified distribution of contaminants within aquifers this complexity is exacerbated by the varying sampling depths for different locations and sampling times not allowing for a systematic depth by depth comparison a correlation analysis depicted in table s3 was performed with the purpose of evaluating the overall effectiveness of the cmc s nzvi injection on altering the cvocs concentrations in soil the r values indicate that the cvocs concentrations correlate better with each other over time suggesting the treatment was effective in causing a change in the concentrations and distribution of contaminants in the soil this long term decrease in soil cvocs might have occurred partly due to enhanced biological activity after cmc s nzvi injection however more work needs to be done to investigate the effect of this cmc s nzvi formulation on the microbial communities in the treatment zone dithionite reduced structural fe ii in the aquifer sediments soil might also have played an important role in the long term transformation of soil cvocs paul et al 2003 these results suggest cmc s nzvi is an effective strategy for cvocs dechlorination in soil 4 conclusions results reported herein demonstrate the suitability of cmc s nzvi as an effective technology for soil and groundwater remediation at existing contaminated sites a rapid decrease in cvocs concentrations was observed in groundwater samples immediately after injection followed by sustained long term dechlorination although cmc s nzvi injection resulted in some dilution and displacement of cvocs the changes in intermediate concentrations and an increase in ethene concentrations clearly indicate dechlorination csia serves as another line of evidence confirming the direct impact of chemical transformation as shown by the changes in stable isotope values of key chlorinated compounds proximity to the dnapl pool resulted in mass transfer of non aqueous constituents into the aqueous phase at the deeper blue and white levels 4 4 5 m bgs although significant ethene generation indicated concurrent dechlorination in contrast the uppermost level black which is expected to be least affected by the source zone observed a continuous decline in cvocs concentrations accompanied with the generation of ethene confirming dechlorination transformation was not limited to the aqueous phase as concentrations of soil cvocs also decreased significantly at 94 and 554 days after injection presence of dithionite might additionally have resulted in reducing the native fe iii to the reactive fe ii species which can degrade cvocs long term success of in situ emplacement of nzvi often relies on the biotransformation that follows the short term abiotic dechlorination kocur et al 2016 and care must be taken not to inhibit the growth of healthy microbial communities in this study the sustained long term dechlorination points towards biotransformation suggesting that growth of microbial communities was not inhibited however the extent to which biotic processes contributed to the transformation of cvocs is unknown and further characterization of the microbial communities after emplacement of cmc s nzvi is required as fundamental work about synthesis characterization and overall mechanisms of cmc s nzvi reactivity is ongoing this study is the first pilot test to upscale the application of abiotically sulfidated cmc nzvi from laboratory to field with the growing interest from all sectors of the remediation community as evidenced by the

18051,advanced oxidation using uv and hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 has been widely applied to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs in wastewater for water reuse this study investigated the degradation kinetics of mixed cecs by uv h2o2 under variable h2o2 doses including bisphenol a estrone diclofenac ibuprofen and triclosan reverse osmosis ro treated water samples from orange county water district s groundwater replenishment system gwrs potable reuse project were collected on different dates and utilized as reaction matrices with spiked additions of chemicals cecs and h2o2 to assess the application of uv h2o2 possible degradation pathways of selected cecs were proposed based on high resolution mass spectrometry identification of transformation products tps toxicity assessments included cytotoxicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding activity and estrogen receptor binding activity in order to evaluate potential environmental impacts resulting from cec degradation by uv h2o2 cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity were significantly reduced during the degradation of mixed cecs in milli q water by uv h2o2 with high uv fluence 3200 mj cm 2 however in gwrs ro treated water samples collected in april 2017 the cytotoxicity and estrogen activity of spiked cec mixture after uv h2o2 treatment were not significantly eliminated this might be due to the high concentration of target cec and their tps which was possibly affected by the varied quality of the secondary treatment influent at this facility such as sewer shed and wastewater discharges this study aimed to provide insight on the impacts of post uv h2o2 cecs and tps on human and ecological health at cellular level graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv h2o2 aop water reuse transformation products cytotoxicity contaminants of emerging concern 1 introduction wastewater reuse has been increasingly utilized globally to alleviate water shortages especially in regions with heightened water scarcity binz et al 2016 in typical wastewater treatment trains for potable reuse microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf are used to remove microorganisms and colloidal particles and reverse osmosis ro is utilized to reject viruses salts and small molecules and is often followed by a uv hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation process uv h2o2 aop for disinfection and destruction of remaining contaminants of emerging concern cecs chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2018 a serious limitation for water reuse is the incomplete removal of certain organic contaminants by conventional wastewater treatment resulting in the presence of many contaminants in the source water to the aop including pharmaceuticals antibacterial compounds hormones and plasticizers wols et al 2013 a list of cecs was recommended by a state of california expert panel for monitoring indirect potable and non potable water reuse anderson 2010 as well as aquatic ecosystems maruya et al 2014 according to the list the targeted cecs

gligorovski et al 2015 huang et al 2018c patton et al 2018 wols et al 2013 however there is less information on the degradation kinetics of priority cecs in real world mixtures and in the presence of other contaminants shu et al 2016 wols et al 2013 moreover organic transformation products tps formed during uv aop treatment of wastewater are potentially more toxic than the parent compounds de luna

information of the effects on human and ecological health at the cellular level thus cytotoxicity analysis using human cell lines and measurement of the molecular initiating events are important to provide highly relevant information regarding the toxic effects of post aop chemicals on humans and wildlife huang et al 2018b li et al 2018 moussavi et al 2018 tp determinations from selected cecs via uv h2o2 is also useful for degradation mechanism elucidation alongside supporting toxicity analysis the goal of this research is to comprehensively assess the application of uv h2o2 to remove multiple cecs for water reuse including bisphenol a bpa diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibp triclosan tcs and estrone e1 the first objective of this study was to explore the degradation kinetics of cec mixtures by uv h2o2 spiked in milli q water or ro permeate from the gwrs project second tps formed during single cec degradation by uv h2o2 were measured and degradation pathways formulated third resulting toxicity during cec degradation by uv h2o2 was evaluated spiked in milli q water or ro permeate from gwrs to provide insights on the impacts of post uv h2o2 cecs and tps on human and ecological health at the cellular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical standards of cecs at the highest available purity were purchased from sigma aldrich their structures and properties are listed in table s1 the ro treated water samples were collected by gwrs staff and the general water quality parameters are summarized in table s2 ro permeate collected on april 25 august

experiments other chemicals and reagents used are shown in text s1 2 2 analysis methods concentrations of cecs were measured by an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with detailed methods in text s2 monochloramine nh2cl concentration was determined using a hach meter following the indophenol method hach company 2014 the concentrations of cl were measured using a dionex ion chromatograph tps were detected and analyzed using an ultra high performancelc with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer lc ms through the collaboration between university of cincinnati agilent 6540 and university of south carolina agilent 6545 detailed lc ms and lc ms ms conditions are shown in text s3 mass spectra were analyzed using agilent mass hunter b 04 00 software 2 3 photochemical experiments two 15 w low pressure lp mercury uv lamps cole parmer or one uv light emitting diode led lamp aquisense technologies were used to provide uv photolysis at 254 nm in the experiments the average uv254nm fluence rate through the reaction solutions was measured by ferrioxalate actinometry and monitored by an ilt1700 calibrated radiometer with an xrd xrl 140t254 probe international light co following the methods reported by bolton et al 2015 the average uv254nm fluence rate of lp uv and led uv was measured as 0 1 mw cm 2 and 0 03 mw cm 2 respectively the initial concentration of each cec in the reaction solutions was 1 Î¼m for studying the degradation kinetics and toxicity while it was 20 Î¼m for analyzing the tps 10 mm of phosphate buffer was used to control the ph in the absence of phosphate buffer ph of the reaction solutions at the initial timepoint was about 7 7 and ph at endpoints was nearly 7 3 due to the addition of naoh from the e1 stock solution ro treated water samples from gwrs were used as reaction matrices in some experiments with spiked chemicals cecs and h2o2 it should be noted that the concentrations of spiked cecs in the laboratory scale experiments were significantly higher than typically observed cec concentrations in ro permeate when detectable in order to observe the formed tps and changes in toxicity in this study 700 1000 mj cm 2 uv fluence is usually used in full and pilot scale aop systems for potable reuse while much higher uv fluence and h2o2 dose are needed in laboratory scale treatments to minimize the cecs at high concentrations typically cecs h2o2 and milli q water 10 ml of total volume were spiked into a petri dish 60 15 mm with a quartz cover quartz scientific inc oh and placed under uv irradiation to initiate reactions samples were withdrawn 200 Î¼l after each uv fluence interval immediately quenched with 200 Î¼l pure methanol and analyzed by hplc all kinetic experiments were conducted in triplicate at ambient temperature 21 1 c 2 4 cytotoxicity ahr binding activity and er binding activity analysis in this study cytotoxicity of the samples treated by uv h2o2 was analyzed using the 3 4

response high precision and high throughput for determination of cell viability and proliferation and cyp1a1 bla ls 180 cells provide highly relevant information regarding the cytotoxic effects of chemicals on humans for the cec mixture in milli q water cytotoxicity measurements were also performed with the estrogen receptor er cell line the methanol in the control wells was identical to the

tukey s post hoc Î± 0 05 detailed information about toxicity analysis can be found in text s4 2 5 calculating the contributions from h2o2 oxidation uv and ros the contributions from h2o2 oxidation uv and reactive oxygen species ros to the degradation of cecs were calculated following methods previously developed by wu et al 2016 using rate constants table s1 and measured cec concentration fig s3 detailed information can be found in text s5 and fig s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 cec degradation kinetics during uv h2o2 treatment in milli q water fig 1 a depicts the uv fluence based observed first order rate constants k obs of the degradation of five mixed cecs by uv photolysis lp uv h2o2 led uv h2o2 h2o2 alone could not efficiently remove the selected cecs and the k obs was in the range of 1 25 10 6 7 50 10 6 s 1 fig s3 in the absence of h2o2 only dcf and tcs could be degraded by uv irradiation at a relatively high rate 5 3 10 3 cm2 mj 1 with a fractional removal of 58 and 56 at 160 mj cm 2 uv fluence fig s3 with the addition of h2o2 the k obs of the five cecs were dramatically enhanced under uv irradiation which might be attributed to the high yield of oh and the subsequent generation of other ros e g o ho2 and o2 and their great contributions to cec degradation fig 1b in addition lp uv h2o2 and led uv h2o2 achieved similar removal efficiency of the selected cecs except for dcf indicating lower intensity illumination systems with larger timescales would not lead to significant differences in degradation kinetics of these cecs as h2o2 dosage increased from 0 1 to 2 mm fig 1c k obs of mixed cecs also dramatically increased during uv h2o2 treatment at ph 7 4 in the presence of phosphate buffer for dcf and tcs the k obs only increased by a factor of 2 1 but for bpa e1 and ibp the k obs notably increased by factors of 7 5 3 and 6 9 respectively the experimental results of dcf bpa and ibp positively correlated with the prediction by kwon el al kwon et al 2019 suggesting dcf and tcs are primarily degraded by uv photolysis while bpa e1 and ibp are more strongly degraded by ros changes in reaction ph 5 3 8 5 resulted in different impacts on the degradation of selected cecs by uv h2o2 as shown in fig 1d the k obs of tcs decreased by 28 at ph 5 3 6 6 but increased by 46 at the ph range 6 6 8 5 while the k obs of the other four cecs bpa e1 dcf and ibp decreased by 18 46 in the mixture as reported in our previous work he et al 2012 huang et al 2018c at high ph hydroxide scavenges quenches hydroxyl radicals leading to theoretically lower reactivity degradation of the cec but with tcs it s shown that the base form above pka 7 9 is degrading faster despite the quenched hydroxyl radicals lack of radicals huang et al 2018c therefore influence of ph on the cec degradation should be considered based on the chemical properties of target contaminants during the uv h2o2 process and the change of the oh demand 3 2 cec degradation kinetics by uv h2o2 in gwrs ro treated water as shown in fig 2 the water samples collected on different dates resulted in various effects on the k obs of spiked cecs in the uv h2o2 process despite similar monitored water parameters table s2 when reactions in ro i were compared to those in milli q water there were two different trends within the five spiked cecs 1 for dcf and tcs the k obs was moderately decreased in ro i by 32 7 and 36 8 respectively which can be attributed to the primary cec degradation by uv photolysis and lesser influence of ros oxidation by the ro i matrix 2 for bpa e1 and ibp the k obs was significantly decreased 86 8 95 2 given that ros oxidation mainly contributed to the cec degradation on the contrary ro ii and ro iii showed much less influence on the degradation of spiked cecs fig s5 this result suggests some compounds in ro i that were competing for the ros compared to ro ii and ro iii to investigate the reason for the higher ros demand of ro i the effects of monitored water parameters on the uv h2o2 processes in milli q water were evaluated separately the concentrations of these water parameters were chosen based on the maximum values of all real gwrs ro treated water samples table s2 as seen from figs s6 2 mm hco3 1 mm no3 1 mm cl and 14 1 Î¼m nh2cl did not exhibit significant effects on the cec degradation in mixture by uv h2o2 the impact of total organic carbon toc in the ro permeate was not evaluated due to the low concentration 0 1 mg l 1 and unknown constituents of the toc based on the results above it is hypothesized that the difference in ro permeate collected on different date cannot be captured by the general parameters in table s2 as reported by kwon et al the oh demand in the han river was notably elevated with the generation of more low molecular weight dissolved organic matter lw dom during the rainy alga season seoul korea although dom concentrations were relatively stable 1 4 2 0 mg l 1 throughout the year kwon et al 2019 lw dom would react with oh at higher rate appiani et al 2014 which could pass through the mf and ro pretreatment chuang et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 patton et al 2018 additionally due to the reactions of chlorine added before mf with the residual bio generated ammonia in the wastewater uv h2o2 in the gwrs ro permeate is actually a de facto uv h2o2 chloramines aop which are less effective in removing organic contaminants and more susceptible to the dom zhang et al 2019 therefore the higher ros demand of ro i might be due to the varied quality of sewage and wastewater discharges as secondary treatment influent i e more lw dom but the specific reason for the quality changes is unknown and not interpreted by the generally monitored parameters which deserves further investigation in the future to further investigate these gwrs water samples april 25 2017 the cytotoxicity and er activity of them were assessed without spiked chemicals as shown in fig s7a the fraction survival of all original water samples was a little bit lower than the control either 2 5 or 5 meoh indicated possible cytotoxicity of these water samples for er binding activity analysis estrogen equivalents eeq ng l 1 were calculated for the non spiked water samples the mean eeqs of water samples from secondary treatment and microfiltration effluent were below the lod 1 6 ng l 1 while the mean eeqs of water samples from ro permeate and santa ana river were little above the lod fig s7b one way anova was carried out to statistically analyze pure se mf ro santa ana river samples and their spiked 1 mm h2o2 counterparts anova results f 7 16 7 41 p 0 0005 indicate significant differences exist between eight samples turkey s honest significant difference post hoc revealed highly significant differences p 0 01 between ro spiked with 1 mm h2o2 and the blanks as well as mf and se fig s7b even though the residual h2o2 was quenched by 4 Âµl catalase 1 28 106units ml before er binding activity analysis significant differences between samples are denoted by letters Î± 0 05 relatively high variability in the ro permeate and santa ana river estrogenic activity relative to the blank sample should be noted see error bars in fig s7 however the large uncertainty in the ro permeate and santa ana river estrogenic activity relative to the blank sample should be noted see error bars in fig s7 these results indicate that unknown constituents of these water samples possibly pose little cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity further research is needed to fully characterize the ro permeate at this facility during different seasons 3 3 degradation mechanisms of cecs during uv h2o2 treatment tps detected for bpa dcf ibp tcs and e1 during individual degradation in the uv h2o2 process are summarized in tables s3 s7 supported by the uv fluence dependent evolution of tps and the ms ms spectra with mass measurement accuracy in ppm as shown in figs s8 12 isomeric structures for certain degradation products were observed at different retention times which are annotated with lowercase letters i e a and b there are new tentatively identified tps with detailed ms ms spectra such as b245 for bpa and d244 ionized via negative esi for dcf the proposed degradation pathways for bpa dcf ibp tcs and e1 are shown in figs 3 7 as presented in fig 3 hydroxylation was the main route for bpa degradation by ros producing hydroxylated bpa b243a b and subsequently forming byproducts b259a b the proposed structure of b243a b m h m z 243 1021 c15h16o3 2 5 ppm is supported by the fragment ion m z 149 0592 showing cleavage between the two aromatic rings and corresponding to loss of phenol fig s8 the initial step in hydroxylation is the generation of a carbon centered radical due to oh addition followed by oxygen addition and the subsequent removal of the perhydroxyl radicals hoo kang et al 2018 wu et al 2016 quinone derivatives were observed during bpa degradation such as b257a b b273 b271 and b181 which were formed after further oh oxidation of hydroxylation products dhara et al 2016 gligorovski et al 2015 bond breakage occurred adjacent to the methyl bridge of bpa due to oh oxidation li et al 2017 yielding b149 b151 was not observed most likely due to its rapid oxidation by oh to generate b167 and b183 the proposed structure of b167 m h m z 167 0704 c9h12o3 6 ppm is supported by the fragment ion m z 149 0608 which is due to the loss of water a common fragmentation pattern in phenolic compounds fig s8 b245 is a newly identified product produced by the loss of a central methyl group and hydroxylated on both sides of the parent molecule the proposed structure of b245 m h m z 245 0817 c14h14o4 1 ppm is supported by the fragmentation ions m z 227 0712 and m z 109 0317 fig s8 the fragment ion m z 227 0712 is due to loss of water from a phenolic moiety and the fragment ion m z 109 0317 is due to cleavage between the two aromatic rings and corresponding observed dihydroxybenzene the elimination of the ch3 group should be attributed to the oh oxidation of the central c atom on the methyl bridge of bpa which was also observed during formation of other bpa byproducts such as 4 hydroxyacetophenone through oh induced oxidation reactions abdelraheem et al 2019 due to the complex structure of dcf and the non selective property of oh several degradation routes were observed during dcf degradation in uv h2o2 direct hydroxylation dechlorination hydroxylation cyclization and decarboxylation may all occur simultaneously during formation of these tps fig 4 direct hydroxylation contributed to the generation of d312 due to the attack on the benzene ring by oh as well as in the formation of d212 d244 and d256 interestingly cyclization products were observed during dcf degradation in uv h2o2 namely d214 d214 d244 d242 d196 d256 and d212 dcf was in the deprotonated form at the reaction ph which could spontaneously dechlorinate from its triplet state under uv irradiation leading to ring closure and forming a five membered cyclic product d260 musa and eriksson 2009 d260 was reported as the primary tp during uv254nm photolysis of dcf alharbi et al 2017 however it was not observed using uv h2o2 under the current reaction conditions its absence may be due to its further oxidation by oh through dechlorination hydroxylation and decarboxylation routes decarboxylation was initiated with oh involved electron transfer on the carboxylic acid of d260 d242 forming a carboxylic radical which transferred to d214 d212 followed by the removal of co2 and an electron pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 the proposed structure of d212 m h m z 212 0712 c13h11no2 3 ppm is supported by fragment ion m z 194 0576 corresponding to loss of water which is common in compounds with hydroxyl functional groups fig s9 the observed fragmentation as well as the m h isotopic pattern where the 37cl isotope can be seen support the proposed structure of d214 m h m z 214 0427 c13h10cln 1 ppm fragment ion m z 178 0654 corresponds to loss of hcl and consequently the 37cl isotopic pattern is no longer observed in this fragment fig s9 d214 was susceptible to subsequent oh oxidation with the production of a quinone like product d214 pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 sein et al 2008 and d212 could be further oxidized by oh to form d244 through hydroxylation the proposed structure of d244 m h m z 244 0613 c13h11no4 1 ppm is supported by two fragment ions at m z 226 0491 and 158 0612 corresponding to loss of water and cleavage of the ring with three hydroxy groups respectively fig s9 dechlorination hydroxylation was also observed during formation of d196 and d242 in which a carbon centered radical was formed through the ipso attack by oh at the carbon atom of c cl group and a subsequent heterolytic cleavage of the c cl bond huang et al 2018a wu et al 2016 direct hydroxylation on d242 led to the formation of d256 which could be subsequently oxidized by oh to yield a quinone derivative d210 the product d144 might be produced from the c nh bridge cleavage on dcf which was initiated by the oh attack on dcf s c5 pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 vogna et al 2004 and followed by dechlorination hydroxylation during the degradation of ibp decarboxylation occurred on the carboxylic acid of ibp undergoing a similar route to that of dcf i162 was generated this way before being rapidly oxidized to i177 the most abundant tp fig s10 via hydroxylation on the benzene ring hydroxylation was the main mechanism for the oh induced oxidation on ibp as shown in fig 5 contributing to the formation of the majority of ibp tps such as i221 i269 i177 and i209 with the addition of oh on the para position to the existing hydroxyl group on the benzene ring of ibp quinone derivatives i191 and i207 could be generated from the corresponding hydroxylation products i177 and i209 detected tps of tcs are shown in fig 6 supported by high resolution ms and ms ms spectra presented in fig s11 through a dechlorination hydrogenation route t253b was formed as the dominant most abundant tp at 160 mj cm 2 uv fluence as shown in fig s11 which was mainly due to the uv photolysis at 254 nm kliegman et al 2013 this route also contributed to the formation of t127a b t201 and t249a b dechlorination hydroxylation due to oh induced ipso attack was observed with the formation of t235 t269 and t267 2 the proposed structure of t235 m h m z 235 0160 c12h9clo3 3 ppm is supported by the fragmentation and the m h isotopic pattern as shown in fig s11 the 37cl isotope can be seen in the spectrum and the two fragments m z 217 0050 and 181 0275 correspond to loss of water and subsequent loss of hcl the fragment ion showing loss of water and hcl does not display the chlorine isotope pattern confirming its loss through fragmentation oh addition readily occurred on the para position of the phenolic group of t269 gao et al 2014 resulting in t285 which was followed by the rapid oh oxidation to form the quinone product t283 of note t267 1 is a hydroxylated product of 2 8 dichlorodibenzodioxin 2 8 dcdd which is a well known highly toxic compound with ahr activity 2 8 dcdd resulted from the cyclization of tcs under uv irradiation initiated by transferring an electron from the phenolic group to oh followed by the removal of a chlorine atom on c2 and the subsequent recombination of c2 and c8 kliegman et al 2013 latch et al 2003 mezcua et al 2004 the continuous attack of oh could lead to the breakdown of the ether bond munoz et al 2012 generating t161 and t143 the proposed structure of t143 m h m z 142 9904 c6h5clo2 1 ppm is supported by the fragmentation and the m h isotopic pattern as shown in fig s11 with the 37cl isotope visible in the mass spectrum the primary fragment ion m z 107 0142 corresponds to loss of hcl consistent with the lack of a chlorine isotope pattern in the fragment ion the molecular ion also has a negative mass defect further supporting the presence of chlorine in the molecule and the positive mass defect on the fragment peak supports the loss of chlorine through fragmentation during e1 degradation only hydroxylation products were observed e285a b and e301 which could be ascribed to the continuous attack of oh on the phenolic ring fig 7 the proposed structure of e285 m h m z 285 1492 c18h22o3 2 ppm is supported by several fragment ions in the ms ms spectrum fig s12 loss of water m z 267 1388 is consistent with a phenolic moiety the other three fragments m z s 245 1148 153 0558 and 123 0437 are likely formed by charge driven rearrangements commonly the c and d rings of steroids are opened through collision induced fragmentation wooding et al 2013 the proposed structure of e285a b has several possible isomers arising from placement of the additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring which are indistinguishable in the ms ms spectra in fig s12 3 4 cytotoxicity ahr binding activity and er binding activity analysis certain tps formed in uv aops may pose higher toxicity than the parent compounds de luna et al 2014 li et al 2018 mariani et al 2015 consequently it is important and necessary to assess the toxicity of the treated solution even though cecs may be effectively removed in the uv h2o2 treatment it should be noted that the concentrations of spiked cecs in the laboratory scale experiments were significantly higher than typically observed cec concentrations in ro permeate when detectable this study aimed to assess whether the tps resulted in a relative increase or decrease in toxicity as determined by corresponding cell based assays the relative responses of ahr binding activity in all tested samples were lower than the lod 1 7 ng l 1 fig s1 suggesting no ahr binding activity of the treated solution figs s13 s14 results of cytotoxicity and er binding activity are summarized in tables 1 2 and detailed results are shown in figs s15 s22 3 4 1 cytotoxicity and er binding activity of resulting solutions during the degradation of individual cecs in milli q water by uv h2o2 the cytotoxicity of treated bpa slightly increased p 0 741 with bpa degradation at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence fig s15 however the er binding activity significantly increased p 0 037 compared to the parent compound after the complete removal of bpa most of the tps were still observed fig s8 suggesting little cytotoxic but potential estrogenic character of these tps compared to the parent compound dcf the cytotoxicity significantly decreased p 0 0001 during the dcf degradation within 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence the er binding activity is significantly different p 0 001 following uv irradiation as shown in fig s16 er binding activity increased from 21 4 rme2 of non irradiated sample to 63 6 rme2 at 40 mj cm 2 uv fluence subsequently and gradually decreased to 14 8 rme2 at 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence and increased again to 43 6 rme2 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence in particular 1 Î¼m dcf was completely decomposed after 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence suggesting possible declined cytotoxicity but enhanced estrogenic character of the tps such as d144 and cyclization derivatives that could still be detected after the total removal of dcf fig s9 as ibp decomposed at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence the cytotoxicity slightly increased p 0 998 and a non significant decrease p 0 151 in er binding activity compared to the parent compound was observed indicating the formed tps did not contribute to higher cytotoxicity or estrogenic activity fig s17 the cytotoxicity of treated tcs slightly increased p 0 813 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence compared to the parent compound as seen from fig s18 the estrogenic activity at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence decreased in a non significant manner relative to parent compound p 0 136 with a negative linear trend between uv fluence and binding activity p 0 034 the results forecasted the decreasing trend of the estrogenic property of the resulting solution with uv irradiation in uv h2o2 treatment and the tps especially t267 1 generated at low levels fig s11 would not enhance the cytotoxicity or estrogenic activity compared to the parent compound e1 fig s19 the cytotoxicity decreased p 0 625 during the degradation of e1 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence and the er binding activity increased in a non significant manner p 0 542 with a positive linear trend p 0 262 this result suggested the little cytotoxic but possible estrogenic character of the tps formed e285 and e301 following e1 degradation in uv h2o2 treatment 3 4 2 cytotoxicity and er binding activity of resulting solutions during the degradation of mixed cecs in uv h2o2 treatment even though the mixed cecs in milli q were completely removed by uv h2o2 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence as shown in fig s20a considering the possible toxicity of excessive h2o2 and formed tps the uv irradiation time was extended to 3200 mj cm 2 a decrease p 0 001 of cytotoxicity in ahr cell line was observed in fig s20b as shown in fig s20c the cytotoxicity in er cell line is significantly different following uv irradiation p 0 044 as the fraction survival decreased from 110 3 of non irradiated sample to 65 9 of sample at 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence but subsequently and gradually increased to 111 6 of sample at 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence meanwhile the er binding activity significantly decreased p 0 0001 fig s21 compared to the solution containing the mixed parent compounds indicating that higher uv fluence is necessary for uv h2o2 treatment to reduce the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of the solution containing mixed cecs spiked at high concentrations ro permeate water samples were used with spiked chemicals cecs and h2o2 to assess the resulting toxicity after the uv h2o2 process the cytotoxicity decreased p 0 997 compared to the parent compounds when the spiked cecs were decomposed by uv h2o2 in ro i with 4800 mj cm 2 uv fluence the estrogenic properties of the spiked cec mixture in the ro permeate during the uv h2o2 process increased p 0 286 with a positive linear trend p 0 130 fig s22 compared to the parent compounds in future work cecs at lower environmentally relevant levels 100 200 ng l 1 should be treated by uv h2o2 700 1000 mj cm 2 uv fluence and the toxicity should be assessed in order to determine whether there is any detectable toxicity and whether the trends observed in the present study are maintained in general little toxicity of mf ro uv aop product waters non spiked cecs in potable reuse facilities was detected in other studies by measuring disinfection byproducts associated toxicity chuang et al 2019 nevertheless improvements in uv h2o2 treatment may be beneficial to further reduce any measurable response from bioanalytical tools which are highly sensitive indicators of cytotoxicity during cec degradation as the formed tps during uv h2o2 are more toxic relative to their parent compounds 4 conclusion this study evaluated uv h2o2 aop for treatment of mixed cecs bpa e1 dcf ibp and tcs including degradation kinetics pathways and resulting toxicity first the degradation rates of mixed cecs by lp uv h2o2 and led uv h2o2 in milli q water were similar which were faster than that by uv only ros oxidation primarily contributed to the destruction of bpa e1 and ibp while dcf and tcs were mainly decomposed by uv photolysis at 254 nm ros oxidation of cecs was significantly inhibited in the ro i which posed little cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity compared to the blank this inhibition phenomenon might be ascribed to the presence of certain lw dom at this facility or differences in the sewer shed and wastewater discharges day to day which deserves further investigation in the future second tps were tentatively identified to better understand the toxicity of selected cecs during individual degradation by uv h2o2 at 640 mj cm 2 for bpa degradation by uv h2o2 hydroxylation and quinone products were detected these showed little cytotoxicity but had higher estrogenic activity than bpa which need to be isolated and assessed in the future for dcf degradation the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of resulting solutions were elevated which might be ascribed to the generated hydroxylation and cyclization products even though many hydroxylation and decarboxylation ibp products were detected at relatively high levels during ibp degradation the cytotoxicity did not change significantly and the estrogenic activity decreased slightly compared to the parent compound during tcs degradation dechlorination product t253b was detected at a relatively high level and many other tps were tentatively identified including cyclization and dechlorination hydroxylation products however the resulting cytotoxicity did not change significantly and the estrogenic activity declined slightly with a significant linear trend compared to tcs as for e1 degradation only three tps were detected at relatively low levels with unchanged cytotoxicity however the estrogenic property increased suggesting either e285a b or e301 may be more estrogenic than e1 third the toxicity of resulting solutions during the degradation of cec mixtures by uv h2o2 was considered whether spiked in milli q water or ro i in milli q water both cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity significantly decreased during the degradation of the spiked cec mixture by uv h2o2 with high uv fluence 3200 mj cm 2 when cecs were spiked into ro permeate the cytotoxicity and estrogenic properties were not entirely eliminated during degradation of mixed cecs by uv h2o2 under current reaction conditions though the measurable toxicity is attributable to the relatively high spiked concentrations of the cecs used in the bioassay 15 150 Î¼g l 1 compared to the background concentrations detected in the ro permeate influent into uv aop treatment 1 Î¼g l 1 the results still provide insights into the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of the selected cecs and their tps

18051,advanced oxidation using uv and hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 has been widely applied to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs in wastewater for water reuse this study investigated the degradation kinetics of mixed cecs by uv h2o2 under variable h2o2 doses including bisphenol a estrone diclofenac ibuprofen and triclosan reverse osmosis ro treated water samples from orange county water district s groundwater replenishment system gwrs potable reuse project were collected on different dates and utilized as reaction matrices with spiked additions of chemicals cecs and h2o2 to assess the application of uv h2o2 possible degradation pathways of selected cecs were proposed based on high resolution mass spectrometry identification of transformation products tps toxicity assessments included cytotoxicity aryl hydrocarbon receptor binding activity and estrogen receptor binding activity in order to evaluate potential environmental impacts resulting from cec degradation by uv h2o2 cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity were significantly reduced during the degradation of mixed cecs in milli q water by uv h2o2 with high uv fluence 3200 mj cm 2 however in gwrs ro treated water samples collected in april 2017 the cytotoxicity and estrogen activity of spiked cec mixture after uv h2o2 treatment were not significantly eliminated this might be due to the high concentration of target cec and their tps which was possibly affected by the varied quality of the secondary treatment influent at this facility such as sewer shed and wastewater discharges this study aimed to provide insight on the impacts of post uv h2o2 cecs and tps on human and ecological health at cellular level graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv h2o2 aop water reuse transformation products

gligorovski et al 2015 huang et al 2018c patton et al 2018 wols et al 2013 however there is less information on the degradation kinetics of priority cecs in real world mixtures and in the presence of other contaminants shu et al 2016 wols et al 2013 moreover organic transformation products tps formed during uv aop treatment of wastewater are potentially more toxic than the parent compounds de luna

information of the effects on human and ecological health at the cellular level thus cytotoxicity analysis using human cell lines and measurement of the molecular initiating events are important to provide highly relevant information regarding the toxic effects of post aop chemicals on humans and wildlife huang et al 2018b li et al 2018 moussavi et al 2018 tp determinations from selected cecs via uv h2o2 is also useful for degradation mechanism elucidation alongside supporting toxicity analysis the goal of this research is to comprehensively assess the application of uv h2o2 to remove multiple cecs for water reuse including bisphenol a bpa diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibp triclosan tcs and estrone e1 the first objective of this study was to explore the degradation kinetics of cec mixtures by uv h2o2 spiked in milli q water or ro permeate from the gwrs project second tps formed during single cec degradation by uv h2o2 were measured and degradation pathways formulated third resulting toxicity during cec degradation by uv h2o2 was evaluated spiked in milli q water or ro permeate from gwrs to provide insights on the impacts of post uv h2o2 cecs and tps on human and ecological health at the cellular level 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical standards of cecs at the highest available purity were purchased from sigma aldrich their structures and properties are listed in table s1 the ro treated water samples were collected by gwrs staff and the general water quality parameters are summarized in table s2 ro permeate collected on april 25 august

experiments other chemicals and reagents used are shown in text s1 2 2 analysis methods concentrations of cecs were measured by an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc with detailed methods in text s2 monochloramine nh2cl concentration was determined using a hach meter following the indophenol method hach company 2014 the concentrations of cl were measured using a dionex ion chromatograph tps were detected and analyzed using an ultra high performancelc with a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer lc ms through the collaboration between university of cincinnati agilent 6540 and university of south carolina agilent 6545 detailed lc ms and lc ms ms conditions are shown in text s3 mass spectra were analyzed using agilent mass hunter b 04 00 software 2 3 photochemical experiments two 15 w low pressure lp mercury uv lamps cole parmer or one uv light emitting diode led lamp aquisense technologies were used to provide uv photolysis at 254 nm in the experiments the average uv254nm fluence rate through the reaction solutions was measured by ferrioxalate actinometry and monitored by an ilt1700 calibrated radiometer with an xrd xrl 140t254 probe international light co following the methods reported by bolton et al 2015 the average uv254nm fluence rate of lp uv and led uv was measured as 0 1 mw cm 2 and 0 03 mw cm 2 respectively the initial concentration of each cec in the reaction solutions was 1 Î¼m for studying the degradation kinetics and toxicity while it was 20 Î¼m for analyzing the tps 10 mm of phosphate buffer was used to control the ph in the absence of phosphate buffer ph of the reaction solutions at the initial timepoint was about 7 7 and ph at endpoints was nearly 7 3 due to the addition of naoh from the e1 stock solution ro treated water samples from gwrs were used as reaction matrices in some experiments with spiked chemicals cecs and h2o2 it should be noted that the concentrations of spiked cecs in the laboratory scale experiments were significantly higher than typically observed cec concentrations in ro permeate when detectable in order to observe the formed tps and changes in toxicity in this study 700 1000 mj cm 2 uv fluence is usually used in full and pilot scale aop systems for potable reuse while much higher uv fluence and h2o2 dose are needed in laboratory scale treatments to minimize the cecs at high concentrations typically cecs h2o2 and milli q water 10 ml of total volume were spiked into a petri dish 60 15 mm with a quartz cover quartz scientific inc oh and placed under uv irradiation to initiate reactions samples were withdrawn 200 Î¼l after each uv fluence interval immediately quenched with 200 Î¼l pure methanol and analyzed by hplc all kinetic experiments were conducted in triplicate at ambient temperature 21 1 c 2 4 cytotoxicity ahr binding activity and er binding activity analysis in this study cytotoxicity of the samples treated by uv h2o2 was analyzed using the 3 4

response high precision and high throughput for determination of cell viability and proliferation and cyp1a1 bla ls 180 cells provide highly relevant information regarding the cytotoxic effects of chemicals on humans for the cec mixture in milli q water cytotoxicity measurements were also performed with the estrogen receptor er cell line the methanol in the control wells was identical to the

tukey s post hoc Î± 0 05 detailed information about toxicity analysis can be found in text s4 2 5 calculating the contributions from h2o2 oxidation uv and ros the contributions from h2o2 oxidation uv and reactive oxygen species ros to the degradation of cecs were calculated following methods previously developed by wu et al 2016 using rate constants table s1 and measured cec concentration fig s3 detailed information can be found in text s5 and fig s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 cec degradation kinetics during uv h2o2 treatment in milli q water fig 1 a depicts the uv fluence based observed first order rate constants k obs of the degradation of five mixed cecs by uv photolysis lp uv h2o2 led uv h2o2 h2o2 alone could not efficiently remove the selected cecs and the k obs was in the range of 1 25 10 6 7 50 10 6 s 1 fig s3 in the absence of h2o2 only dcf and tcs could be degraded by uv irradiation at a relatively high rate 5 3 10 3 cm2 mj 1 with a fractional removal of 58 and 56 at 160 mj cm 2 uv fluence fig s3 with the addition of h2o2 the k obs of the five cecs were dramatically enhanced under uv irradiation which might be attributed to the high yield of oh and the subsequent generation of other ros e g o ho2 and o2 and their great contributions to cec degradation fig 1b in addition lp uv h2o2 and led uv h2o2 achieved similar removal efficiency of the selected cecs except for dcf indicating lower intensity illumination systems with larger timescales would not lead to significant differences in degradation kinetics of these cecs as h2o2 dosage increased from 0 1 to 2 mm fig 1c k obs of mixed cecs also dramatically increased during uv h2o2 treatment at ph 7 4 in the presence of phosphate buffer for dcf and tcs the k obs only increased by a factor of 2 1 but for bpa e1 and ibp the k obs notably increased by factors of 7 5 3 and 6 9 respectively the experimental results of dcf bpa and ibp positively correlated with the prediction by kwon el al kwon et al 2019 suggesting dcf and tcs are primarily degraded by uv photolysis while bpa e1 and ibp are more strongly degraded by ros changes in reaction ph 5 3 8 5 resulted in different impacts on the degradation of selected cecs by uv h2o2 as shown in fig 1d the k obs of tcs decreased by 28 at ph 5 3 6 6 but increased by 46 at the ph range 6 6 8 5 while the k obs of the other four cecs bpa e1 dcf and ibp decreased by 18 46 in the mixture as reported in our previous work he et al 2012 huang et al 2018c at high ph hydroxide scavenges quenches hydroxyl radicals leading to theoretically lower reactivity degradation of the cec but with tcs it s shown that the base form above pka 7 9 is degrading faster despite the quenched hydroxyl radicals lack of radicals huang et al 2018c therefore influence of ph on the cec degradation should be considered based on the chemical properties of target contaminants during the uv h2o2 process and the change of the oh demand 3 2 cec degradation kinetics by uv h2o2 in gwrs ro treated water as shown in fig 2 the water samples collected on different dates resulted in various effects on the k obs of spiked cecs in the uv h2o2 process despite similar monitored water parameters table s2 when reactions in ro i were compared to those in milli q water there were two different trends within the five spiked cecs 1 for dcf and tcs the k obs was moderately decreased in ro i by 32 7 and 36 8 respectively which can be attributed to the primary cec degradation by uv photolysis and lesser influence of ros oxidation by the ro i matrix 2 for bpa e1 and ibp the k obs was significantly decreased 86 8 95 2 given that ros oxidation mainly contributed to the cec degradation on the contrary ro ii and ro iii showed much less influence on the degradation of spiked cecs fig s5 this result suggests some compounds in ro i that were competing for the ros compared to ro ii and ro iii to investigate the reason for the higher ros demand of ro i the effects of monitored water parameters on the uv h2o2 processes in milli q water were evaluated separately the concentrations of these water parameters were chosen based on the maximum values of all real gwrs ro treated water samples table s2 as seen from figs s6 2 mm hco3 1 mm no3 1 mm cl and 14 1 Î¼m nh2cl did not exhibit significant effects on the cec degradation in mixture by uv h2o2 the impact of total organic carbon toc in the ro permeate was not evaluated due to the low concentration 0 1 mg l 1 and unknown constituents of the toc based on the results above it is hypothesized that the difference in ro permeate collected on different date cannot be captured by the general parameters in table s2 as reported by kwon et al the oh demand in the han river was notably elevated with the generation of more low molecular weight dissolved organic matter lw dom during the rainy alga season seoul korea although dom concentrations were relatively stable 1 4 2 0 mg l 1 throughout the year kwon et al 2019 lw dom would react with oh at higher rate appiani et al 2014 which could pass through the mf and ro pretreatment chuang et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 patton et al 2018 additionally due to the reactions of chlorine added before mf with the residual bio generated ammonia in the wastewater uv h2o2 in the gwrs ro permeate is actually a de facto uv h2o2 chloramines aop which are less effective in removing organic contaminants and more susceptible to the dom zhang et al 2019 therefore the higher ros demand of ro i might be due to the varied quality of sewage and wastewater discharges as secondary treatment influent i e more lw dom but the specific reason for the quality changes is unknown and not interpreted by the generally monitored parameters which deserves further investigation in the future to further investigate these gwrs water samples april 25 2017 the cytotoxicity and er activity of them were assessed without spiked chemicals as shown in fig s7a the fraction survival of all original water samples was a little bit lower than the control either 2 5 or 5 meoh indicated possible cytotoxicity of these water samples for er binding activity analysis estrogen equivalents eeq ng l 1 were calculated for the non spiked water samples the mean eeqs of water samples from secondary treatment and microfiltration effluent were below the lod 1 6 ng l 1 while the mean eeqs of water samples from ro permeate and santa ana river were little above the lod fig s7b one way anova was carried out to statistically analyze pure se mf ro santa ana river samples and their spiked 1 mm h2o2 counterparts anova results f 7 16 7 41 p 0 0005 indicate significant differences exist between eight samples turkey s honest significant difference post hoc revealed highly significant differences p 0 01 between ro spiked with 1 mm h2o2 and the blanks as well as mf and se fig s7b even though the residual h2o2 was quenched by 4 Âµl catalase 1 28 106units ml before er binding activity analysis significant differences between samples are denoted by letters Î± 0 05 relatively high variability in the ro permeate and santa ana river estrogenic activity relative to the blank sample should be noted see error bars in fig s7 however the large uncertainty in the ro permeate and santa ana river estrogenic activity relative to the blank sample should be noted see error bars in fig s7 these results indicate that unknown constituents of these water samples possibly pose little cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity further research is needed to fully characterize the ro permeate at this facility during different seasons 3 3 degradation mechanisms of cecs during uv h2o2 treatment tps detected for bpa dcf ibp tcs and e1 during individual degradation in the uv h2o2 process are summarized in tables s3 s7 supported by the uv fluence dependent evolution of tps and the ms ms spectra with mass measurement accuracy in ppm as shown in figs s8 12 isomeric structures for certain degradation products were observed at different retention times which are annotated with lowercase letters i e a and b there are new tentatively identified tps with detailed ms ms spectra such as b245 for bpa and d244 ionized via negative esi for dcf the proposed degradation pathways for bpa dcf ibp tcs and e1 are shown in figs 3 7 as presented in fig 3 hydroxylation was the main route for bpa degradation by ros producing hydroxylated bpa b243a b and subsequently forming byproducts b259a b the proposed structure of b243a b m h m z 243 1021 c15h16o3 2 5 ppm is supported by the fragment ion m z 149 0592 showing cleavage between the two aromatic rings and corresponding to loss of phenol fig s8 the initial step in hydroxylation is the generation of a carbon centered radical due to oh addition followed by oxygen addition and the subsequent removal of the perhydroxyl radicals hoo kang et al 2018 wu et al 2016 quinone derivatives were observed during bpa degradation such as b257a b b273 b271 and b181 which were formed after further oh oxidation of hydroxylation products dhara et al 2016 gligorovski et al 2015 bond breakage occurred adjacent to the methyl bridge of bpa due to oh oxidation li et al 2017 yielding b149 b151 was not observed most likely due to its rapid oxidation by oh to generate b167 and b183 the proposed structure of b167 m h m z 167 0704 c9h12o3 6 ppm is supported by the fragment ion m z 149 0608 which is due to the loss of water a common fragmentation pattern in phenolic compounds fig s8 b245 is a newly identified product produced by the loss of a central methyl group and hydroxylated on both sides of the parent molecule the proposed structure of b245 m h m z 245 0817 c14h14o4 1 ppm is supported by the fragmentation ions m z 227 0712 and m z 109 0317 fig s8 the fragment ion m z 227 0712 is due to loss of water from a phenolic moiety and the fragment ion m z 109 0317 is due to cleavage between the two aromatic rings and corresponding observed dihydroxybenzene the elimination of the ch3 group should be attributed to the oh oxidation of the central c atom on the methyl bridge of bpa which was also observed during formation of other bpa byproducts such as 4 hydroxyacetophenone through oh induced oxidation reactions abdelraheem et al 2019 due to the complex structure of dcf and the non selective property of oh several degradation routes were observed during dcf degradation in uv h2o2 direct hydroxylation dechlorination hydroxylation cyclization and decarboxylation may all occur simultaneously during formation of these tps fig 4 direct hydroxylation contributed to the generation of d312 due to the attack on the benzene ring by oh as well as in the formation of d212 d244 and d256 interestingly cyclization products were observed during dcf degradation in uv h2o2 namely d214 d214 d244 d242 d196 d256 and d212 dcf was in the deprotonated form at the reaction ph which could spontaneously dechlorinate from its triplet state under uv irradiation leading to ring closure and forming a five membered cyclic product d260 musa and eriksson 2009 d260 was reported as the primary tp during uv254nm photolysis of dcf alharbi et al 2017 however it was not observed using uv h2o2 under the current reaction conditions its absence may be due to its further oxidation by oh through dechlorination hydroxylation and decarboxylation routes decarboxylation was initiated with oh involved electron transfer on the carboxylic acid of d260 d242 forming a carboxylic radical which transferred to d214 d212 followed by the removal of co2 and an electron pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 the proposed structure of d212 m h m z 212 0712 c13h11no2 3 ppm is supported by fragment ion m z 194 0576 corresponding to loss of water which is common in compounds with hydroxyl functional groups fig s9 the observed fragmentation as well as the m h isotopic pattern where the 37cl isotope can be seen support the proposed structure of d214 m h m z 214 0427 c13h10cln 1 ppm fragment ion m z 178 0654 corresponds to loss of hcl and consequently the 37cl isotopic pattern is no longer observed in this fragment fig s9 d214 was susceptible to subsequent oh oxidation with the production of a quinone like product d214 pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 sein et al 2008 and d212 could be further oxidized by oh to form d244 through hydroxylation the proposed structure of d244 m h m z 244 0613 c13h11no4 1 ppm is supported by two fragment ions at m z 226 0491 and 158 0612 corresponding to loss of water and cleavage of the ring with three hydroxy groups respectively fig s9 dechlorination hydroxylation was also observed during formation of d196 and d242 in which a carbon centered radical was formed through the ipso attack by oh at the carbon atom of c cl group and a subsequent heterolytic cleavage of the c cl bond huang et al 2018a wu et al 2016 direct hydroxylation on d242 led to the formation of d256 which could be subsequently oxidized by oh to yield a quinone derivative d210 the product d144 might be produced from the c nh bridge cleavage on dcf which was initiated by the oh attack on dcf s c5 pÃ©rez estrada et al 2005 vogna et al 2004 and followed by dechlorination hydroxylation during the degradation of ibp decarboxylation occurred on the carboxylic acid of ibp undergoing a similar route to that of dcf i162 was generated this way before being rapidly oxidized to i177 the most abundant tp fig s10 via hydroxylation on the benzene ring hydroxylation was the main mechanism for the oh induced oxidation on ibp as shown in fig 5 contributing to the formation of the majority of ibp tps such as i221 i269 i177 and i209 with the addition of oh on the para position to the existing hydroxyl group on the benzene ring of ibp quinone derivatives i191 and i207 could be generated from the corresponding hydroxylation products i177 and i209 detected tps of tcs are shown in fig 6 supported by high resolution ms and ms ms spectra presented in fig s11 through a dechlorination hydrogenation route t253b was formed as the dominant most abundant tp at 160 mj cm 2 uv fluence as shown in fig s11 which was mainly due to the uv photolysis at 254 nm kliegman et al 2013 this route also contributed to the formation of t127a b t201 and t249a b dechlorination hydroxylation due to oh induced ipso attack was observed with the formation of t235 t269 and t267 2 the proposed structure of t235 m h m z 235 0160 c12h9clo3 3 ppm is supported by the fragmentation and the m h isotopic pattern as shown in fig s11 the 37cl isotope can be seen in the spectrum and the two fragments m z 217 0050 and 181 0275 correspond to loss of water and subsequent loss of hcl the fragment ion showing loss of water and hcl does not display the chlorine isotope pattern confirming its loss through fragmentation oh addition readily occurred on the para position of the phenolic group of t269 gao et al 2014 resulting in t285 which was followed by the rapid oh oxidation to form the quinone product t283 of note t267 1 is a hydroxylated product of 2 8 dichlorodibenzodioxin 2 8 dcdd which is a well known highly toxic compound with ahr activity 2 8 dcdd resulted from the cyclization of tcs under uv irradiation initiated by transferring an electron from the phenolic group to oh followed by the removal of a chlorine atom on c2 and the subsequent recombination of c2 and c8 kliegman et al 2013 latch et al 2003 mezcua et al 2004 the continuous attack of oh could lead to the breakdown of the ether bond munoz et al 2012 generating t161 and t143 the proposed structure of t143 m h m z 142 9904 c6h5clo2 1 ppm is supported by the fragmentation and the m h isotopic pattern as shown in fig s11 with the 37cl isotope visible in the mass spectrum the primary fragment ion m z 107 0142 corresponds to loss of hcl consistent with the lack of a chlorine isotope pattern in the fragment ion the molecular ion also has a negative mass defect further supporting the presence of chlorine in the molecule and the positive mass defect on the fragment peak supports the loss of chlorine through fragmentation during e1 degradation only hydroxylation products were observed e285a b and e301 which could be ascribed to the continuous attack of oh on the phenolic ring fig 7 the proposed structure of e285 m h m z 285 1492 c18h22o3 2 ppm is supported by several fragment ions in the ms ms spectrum fig s12 loss of water m z 267 1388 is consistent with a phenolic moiety the other three fragments m z s 245 1148 153 0558 and 123 0437 are likely formed by charge driven rearrangements commonly the c and d rings of steroids are opened through collision induced fragmentation wooding et al 2013 the proposed structure of e285a b has several possible isomers arising from placement of the additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring which are indistinguishable in the ms ms spectra in fig s12 3 4 cytotoxicity ahr binding activity and er binding activity analysis certain tps formed in uv aops may pose higher toxicity than the parent compounds de luna et al 2014 li et al 2018 mariani et al 2015 consequently it is important and necessary to assess the toxicity of the treated solution even though cecs may be effectively removed in the uv h2o2 treatment it should be noted that the concentrations of spiked cecs in the laboratory scale experiments were significantly higher than typically observed cec concentrations in ro permeate when detectable this study aimed to assess whether the tps resulted in a relative increase or decrease in toxicity as determined by corresponding cell based assays the relative responses of ahr binding activity in all tested samples were lower than the lod 1 7 ng l 1 fig s1 suggesting no ahr binding activity of the treated solution figs s13 s14 results of cytotoxicity and er binding activity are summarized in tables 1 2 and detailed results are shown in figs s15 s22 3 4 1 cytotoxicity and er binding activity of resulting solutions during the degradation of individual cecs in milli q water by uv h2o2 the cytotoxicity of treated bpa slightly increased p 0 741 with bpa degradation at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence fig s15 however the er binding activity significantly increased p 0 037 compared to the parent compound after the complete removal of bpa most of the tps were still observed fig s8 suggesting little cytotoxic but potential estrogenic character of these tps compared to the parent compound dcf the cytotoxicity significantly decreased p 0 0001 during the dcf degradation within 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence the er binding activity is significantly different p 0 001 following uv irradiation as shown in fig s16 er binding activity increased from 21 4 rme2 of non irradiated sample to 63 6 rme2 at 40 mj cm 2 uv fluence subsequently and gradually decreased to 14 8 rme2 at 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence and increased again to 43 6 rme2 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence in particular 1 Î¼m dcf was completely decomposed after 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence suggesting possible declined cytotoxicity but enhanced estrogenic character of the tps such as d144 and cyclization derivatives that could still be detected after the total removal of dcf fig s9 as ibp decomposed at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence the cytotoxicity slightly increased p 0 998 and a non significant decrease p 0 151 in er binding activity compared to the parent compound was observed indicating the formed tps did not contribute to higher cytotoxicity or estrogenic activity fig s17 the cytotoxicity of treated tcs slightly increased p 0 813 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence compared to the parent compound as seen from fig s18 the estrogenic activity at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence decreased in a non significant manner relative to parent compound p 0 136 with a negative linear trend between uv fluence and binding activity p 0 034 the results forecasted the decreasing trend of the estrogenic property of the resulting solution with uv irradiation in uv h2o2 treatment and the tps especially t267 1 generated at low levels fig s11 would not enhance the cytotoxicity or estrogenic activity compared to the parent compound e1 fig s19 the cytotoxicity decreased p 0 625 during the degradation of e1 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence and the er binding activity increased in a non significant manner p 0 542 with a positive linear trend p 0 262 this result suggested the little cytotoxic but possible estrogenic character of the tps formed e285 and e301 following e1 degradation in uv h2o2 treatment 3 4 2 cytotoxicity and er binding activity of resulting solutions during the degradation of mixed cecs in uv h2o2 treatment even though the mixed cecs in milli q were completely removed by uv h2o2 at 640 mj cm 2 uv fluence as shown in fig s20a considering the possible toxicity of excessive h2o2 and formed tps the uv irradiation time was extended to 3200 mj cm 2 a decrease p 0 001 of cytotoxicity in ahr cell line was observed in fig s20b as shown in fig s20c the cytotoxicity in er cell line is significantly different following uv irradiation p 0 044 as the fraction survival decreased from 110 3 of non irradiated sample to 65 9 of sample at 320 mj cm 2 uv fluence but subsequently and gradually increased to 111 6 of sample at 3200 mj cm 2 uv fluence meanwhile the er binding activity significantly decreased p 0 0001 fig s21 compared to the solution containing the mixed parent compounds indicating that higher uv fluence is necessary for uv h2o2 treatment to reduce the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of the solution containing mixed cecs spiked at high concentrations ro permeate water samples were used with spiked chemicals cecs and h2o2 to assess the resulting toxicity after the uv h2o2 process the cytotoxicity decreased p 0 997 compared to the parent compounds when the spiked cecs were decomposed by uv h2o2 in ro i with 4800 mj cm 2 uv fluence the estrogenic properties of the spiked cec mixture in the ro permeate during the uv h2o2 process increased p 0 286 with a positive linear trend p 0 130 fig s22 compared to the parent compounds in future work cecs at lower environmentally relevant levels 100 200 ng l 1 should be treated by uv h2o2 700 1000 mj cm 2 uv fluence and the toxicity should be assessed in order to determine whether there is any detectable toxicity and whether the trends observed in the present study are maintained in general little toxicity of mf ro uv aop product waters non spiked cecs in potable reuse facilities was detected in other studies by measuring disinfection byproducts associated toxicity chuang et al 2019 nevertheless improvements in uv h2o2 treatment may be beneficial to further reduce any measurable response from bioanalytical tools which are highly sensitive indicators of cytotoxicity during cec degradation as the formed tps during uv h2o2 are more toxic relative to their parent compounds 4 conclusion this study evaluated uv h2o2 aop for treatment of mixed cecs bpa e1 dcf ibp and tcs including degradation kinetics pathways and resulting toxicity first the degradation rates of mixed cecs by lp uv h2o2 and led uv h2o2 in milli q water were similar which were faster than that by uv only ros oxidation primarily contributed to the destruction of bpa e1 and ibp while dcf and tcs were mainly decomposed by uv photolysis at 254 nm ros oxidation of cecs was significantly inhibited in the ro i which posed little cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity compared to the blank this inhibition phenomenon might be ascribed to the presence of certain lw dom at this facility or differences in the sewer shed and wastewater discharges day to day which deserves further investigation in the future second tps were tentatively identified to better understand the toxicity of selected cecs during individual degradation by uv h2o2 at 640 mj cm 2 for bpa degradation by uv h2o2 hydroxylation and quinone products were detected these showed little cytotoxicity but had higher estrogenic activity than bpa which need to be isolated and assessed in the future for dcf degradation the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of resulting solutions were elevated which might be ascribed to the generated hydroxylation and cyclization products even though many hydroxylation and decarboxylation ibp products were detected at relatively high levels during ibp degradation the cytotoxicity did not change significantly and the estrogenic activity decreased slightly compared to the parent compound during tcs degradation dechlorination product t253b was detected at a relatively high level and many other tps were tentatively identified including cyclization and dechlorination hydroxylation products however the resulting cytotoxicity did not change significantly and the estrogenic activity declined slightly with a significant linear trend compared to tcs as for e1 degradation only three tps were detected at relatively low levels with unchanged cytotoxicity however the estrogenic property increased suggesting either e285a b or e301 may be more estrogenic than e1 third the toxicity of resulting solutions during the degradation of cec mixtures by uv h2o2 was considered whether spiked in milli q water or ro i in milli q water both cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity significantly decreased during the degradation of the spiked cec mixture by uv h2o2 with high uv fluence 3200 mj cm 2 when cecs were spiked into ro permeate the cytotoxicity and estrogenic properties were not entirely eliminated during degradation of mixed cecs by uv h2o2 under current reaction conditions though the measurable toxicity is attributable to the relatively high spiked concentrations of the cecs used in the bioassay 15 150 Î¼g l 1 compared to the background concentrations detected in the ro permeate influent into uv aop treatment 1 Î¼g l 1 the results still provide insights into the cytotoxicity and estrogenic activity of the selected cecs and their tps

18052,the efsa guidance on tiered risk assessment for edge of field surface waters underscores the importance of in silico models to support the pesticide risk assessment the aim of this work was to use in silico models starting from an available structured and harmonized pesticide dataset that was developed for different purposes in order to stimulate the use of qsar models for risk assessment the present work focuses on the development of a set of in silico models developed to predict the aquatic toxicity of heterogeneous pesticides with incomplete unknown toxic behavior in the water compartment the generated models have good fitting performances r2 0 75 0 99 they are internally robust q2loo 0 66 0 98 and can handle up to 30 of perturbation of the training set q2 lmo 0 64 0 98 the absence of chance correlation was guaranteed by low values of r2 calculated on scrambled responses r2 yscr 0 11 0 38 different statistical parameters were used to quantify the external predictivity of the models cccext 0 73 0 91 q2 ext fn 0 53 0 96 the results indicate that all the best models are predictive when applied to chemicals not involved in the models development in addition all models have similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction and this represents a good degree of generalization these models may be useful to support the risk assessment procedure when experimental data for key species are missing or to create prioritization lists for the general a priori assessment of the potential toxicity of existing and new pesticides which fall in the applicability domain graphical abstract image 1 keywords pesticide qsar ecotoxicology endpoint 1 introduction agriculture occupies a very important place in the european union eu as an economic activity and as a source of food for population in the last 50 years it has gone from a national and intensive agriculture to a common and sustainable agriculture villaverde et al 2019 pesticides have a massive role in the agricultural framework due to the fact that they have always been widely used in agriculture to prevent or control pests diseases weeds and other plant pathogens to reduce or eliminate yield losses and maintain high quality of agricultural products they are intentionally used to cause adverse effects on target organisms but adverse effects in non target organisms may arise as well as a consequence of the exposure to these products currently the integrated management of pest diseases and weeds seeks to maximize crops production and at the same time to reduce the impact of pesticides on living beings and on the environment by making better use of them at socially acceptable and economically viable levels villaverde et al 2019 for this reason pesticides are developed through very strict complex and time consuming regulation processes reg ec 1107 2009 to function with reasonable certainty reduce the uncertainty and minimal impact on human health and the environment in addition directive 2009 128 ec european commission promotes the sustainable use of pesticides through the integrated pest management pesticide registration is a scientifically based legal and also administrative process where the potential to cause adverse effects on human health and the environment associated with the use of pesticide products is assessed by conducting several tests reg eu 283 2013 effects in any non target species may translate into ecosystem unbalance and food chain disruption that ultimately may affect human health and edible species damalas et al 2011 as mentioned regulatory bodies rely on extensive in vivo and in vitro testing to support regulatory decisions on human health and environmental risks it is a known fact that in vivo tests often require a large number of laboratory animal studies which can consume significant amounts of resources in terms of budget and time for testing and evaluation alternatives to animal testing reg eu 283 2013 were proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks associated with animal experiments and avoid the unethical procedures in silico methods based on quantitative structure activity relationships qsar are worldwide recognized alternatives to animal testing as well as cells and tissue cultures alternative organisms lower vertebrates invertebrates and microorganisms ranganatha et al doke et al scholz et al villaverde et al 2017 qsar can potentially result in significant cost savings during the pesticide safety assessment process having a great economic impact for the agrochemical sector the reduction in the necessary laboratory or field evaluations will decrease time and cost leading to faster commercialization of formulations and thus promoting the productivity and competitiveness of european agriculture in silico tools are especially important when experimental studies are not adequate because of ethical reasons or because experimental studies are either too complex or not viable villaverde et al 2017 zhu et al qsar models are based on a variety of mathematical approaches to predict activities and properties of untested chemicals on the basis of their molecular structure qsar methods have a long history of use both for the design pre synthesis and the regulatory assessment of pharmaceuticals pesticides and other chemicals twg on pesticide 2012 therefore considering the limitations of current testing approaches the growing public attention for ethical issues related to in vivo tests and breedings and the rapid development and the advantages of computational predictive methods companies and regulatory agencies have started in the last decade to support the use of qsars to enhance the efficiency of hazard and risk assessment processes echa 76 768 eec in particular in 2007 the european reach regulation regulation evaluation authorization of chemicals reg ec 1907 2006 promoted the regulatory use of in silico i e models grouping and read across procedures and in vitro alternatives to animal testing since then specific guidance documents and other tools were made available by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the european chemical agency echa echa oecd 2015 and the eu commission jrc triebe et al to increase the transparent use of these methods in line with the current regulatory approaches mentioned above the aim of the present work was to use data collected within a project commissioned by the european food safety authority efsa galimberti et al to estimate pesticide ecotoxicity values on the basis of their chemical structure in particular data measured for aquatic organisms representative of different levels of biological complexity were used for the creation of ad hoc qsar models these approaches which are proposed as alternative methods in the guidance on tiered risk assessment for edge of field surface waters efsa j 2013 should serve as quantitative tools to predict the effect concentrations ecx of other substances of interest having no experimental toxicity data available ecotoxicological studies are designed to identify the adverse effects produced by a substance to selected species and to characterize the dose response relationship for the adverse effects the aim of the present work is to maximize the toxicological information available to describe the whole set of 70 pesticides within different taxonomic groups by using chemometric approaches 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset and data control within the project comparison of noec values to ec10 ec20 values including confidence intervals in aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological risk assessment a collection of data from the ecotoxicological section of 70 pesticide approval dossiers was performed galimberti et al ecotoxicological data of studies from the pesticide approval dossiers have to strictly follow internationally agreed test guidelines such as oecd or us oppts these guidelines allow a high standardization of the study performance and consequently the results moreover in the aforementioned collection of data galimberti et al ecotoxicological studies have been peer reviewed from national experts in the pesticide assessment procedure and these data have been processed through a statistical modelling analysis performed in 2015 by the wageningen university the pesticides were mainly distributed through the herbicide fungicide and insecticide pesticide functional classes respectively 32 44 and 19 and 5 of combinations of functional classes only studies concerning chronic toxicity were taken into account and in particular on the following taxa algae aquatic invertebrates aquatic plants birds earthworms fish mammals non target plants soil arthropods and terrestrial arthropods different effects were investigated with numerous biologic parameters among all the effects development growth and reproduction of the different tested organisms were the most frequent in the pool of selected studies all the data were managed and stored into an ms access database the database consisted of 952 single entries collected for different pesticide active substances tested in different taxa species effects and biologic parameters like cell count length weight young produced in addition to information related to time of exposure as well as the number of tested doses and the dose max each substance was characterized by the cas registry number the molecular formula and the molecular weight the single entries were ec10 ec20 and ec50 values with their upper and lower confidential limits and the noec value calculated and reported from the pesticide study tests a subset of the dataset only studied aquatic organisms is reported in supplementary material to create a strong dataset in order to build robust qsar models data as reported in the supplementary materials were curated according to the following steps presence of mixtures and stereoisomeric compounds in the studied samples pesticides in general mixtures cannot be run through qsar models nor can synergistic or antagonistic effects of chemicals in mixtures be accounted for because models typically use single discrete chemical structures as input regarding stereoisomeric pesticides the user should be aware that qsar predictions generated by using representative 2d structure do not accurately reflect the true 3d conformation of the active ingredients i e they miss information on stereochemistry twg on pesticide 2012 grouping data for data consistency according to the guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms efsa ppr 2013 and on the basics of statistical homogeneity data on substances were aggregated by the same taxa species effects and biologic parameters on a first attempt of analysis outliers an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations it may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error which might be sometimes excluded from the data set in qsar compounds that have unexpected biological activity and are unable to fit in a qsar model are known as outliers these are valuable in defining the limitations under which compounds act by a common molecular mechanism modelled by one or more descriptors and also in defining the experimental limitations of the biological test data thus particular attention should be payed to the outliers and the reason for their peculiarity be sought rajeshwar et al 2 2 molecular descriptors the smile strings available for the 70 active substances were imported into the padel descriptor software yap for the calculation of the molecular descriptors the smile notation an acronym which stands for simplified molecular input line entry system i e a string notation used to describe the nature and topology of molecular structures were derived according to the pubchem project pubchem and where available these notations were compared with the ones reported in the approval dossiers of the active substances to cross validate the information acquired the smile notation was retrieved because is the starting point to calculate the molecular descriptors for the selected active substances molecular descriptors todeschini et al are the final result of a logic and mathematical procedure which transforms chemical information encoded within a symbolic representation of a molecule into a useful number version 2 21 of padel was used all the 1d 2d descriptors were calculated and also the pubchem fingerprints the number of calculated descriptors 1875 with padel software yap was large and included molecular descriptors and fingerprints in order to have the possibility to represent different features of the chemical structure in different ways however a lot of them resulted to be inter correlated and redundant giving very similar structural information for this reason a pre filtering procedure was applied to the dataset to exclude semi constant descriptors no information brought by the variable itself and to exclude descriptors too inter correlated same information brought by many variables constant variables were excluded if greater than 80 and inter correlated variables were excluded if correlated for a percentage greater than 90 after this procedure the number of remaining variables was 525 this data curation procedure was performed with qsarins software qsarins gramatica et al 2013 gramatica et al 2014 2 3 qsar modelling the dataset was prepared to be used as the input for the qsar model generation i e all the responses were converted into Î¼mol l and transformed into log ecx multiple linear regression mlr qsar models by ols ordinary least squares method and genetic algorithm for variable selection were generated and validated in the software qsarins principal component analysis pca wold s et al 1987 was then performed on the curated molecular descriptors in order to explore the distribution of the data in the chemical and experimental space and to highlight possible outliers and or particular clusters patterns the next step was the development of the qsar models according to the oecd principles for the development of qsars for regulatory use oecd 2004 oecd 2007 as mentioned above the software qsarins was used to generate mlr ols models in a first step exhaustive selection was performed by exploring the fitting of all the possible combinations of up to 2 variables included in the models in a second step a selection procedure based on a genetic algorithm ga was used to select the best population of models the statistical quality of the models was determined by quantification of the coefficient of determination r2 which represents the fitting ability of the models and of the q2leave one out and q2leave more out q2loo and q2lmo respectively which represent the internal robustness of the models wehrens et al in particular the ga evolution performed in qsarins optimizes the q2leave one out parameter in addition the quik rule set to 0 03 0 05 value in this study was applied to control the risk of chance correlation and ensure that the total correlation among the descriptors selected in each model is not higher than their correlation with the modelled response furthermore the scrambling of the responses i e y scramble was performed to identify and exclude models possibly obtained by chance rÃ¼cker et al gramatica et al 2004 low r2 and q2loo values recalculated for each model applied on scrambled responses are expected in the absence of chance correlation the best models according to fitting and robustness were then checked for their ability to predict the endpoint of interest for external molecules i e not considered during the development calibration of the models to perform the external validations the data available for each response were divided split into training and prediction sets before to run the ga these sets were used to fit the models and to check their external predictivity respectively the splitting was performed by ranking the available data in ascending order of the response and putting one every five chemicals in the prediction set i e 20 was set as prediction while the remaining 80 was kept in the training set the external predictivity was quantified using multiple external validation parameters which are calculated by qsarins such as q2 ext f1 shi et al q2 ext f2 schÃ¼Ã¼rmann et al q2 ext f3 consonni et al cccext chirico et al chirico et al 2012 lin as well as the root mean squared of errors rmse this last parameter summarizes the overall error of the model in training cross validation and external sets i e rmsetr rmsecv and rmseext respectively qsarins also provides the mean absolute error mae which is a measure of difference between two continuous variables predicted and measured variables a common measure to forecast errors therefore summarizing the best models were selected as the most externally predictive out of ga based populations at different levels of complexity and ranked according to decreasing robustness q2loo q2lmo and fitting r2 cherkasov et al finally the analysis of the applicability domain ad of the models allowed for the identification of influential and or problematic compounds response and structural outliers the leverage approach was used to quantify the structural space of the models which depends on the modelling descriptors and helps in the identification of chemicals which are influent in the selection of the modelling descriptors or are structurally dissimilar from the training set compounds the williams plot hat values vs standardized residuals for each chemical was used to assess the presence of both response outliers i e compounds with cross validated standardized residuals greater than 2 5 standard deviation units and structural outliers i e compounds with leverage value h higher than h 3 p 1 n where p is the number of variables of the model and n is the number of compounds in the training set sangion et al the williams plot is indeed a graph representing the standard residuals vs hat i i the hat value of leverage is used for domain applicability assessment hat values represent the distance of the molecules to the model structural space 3 results and discussion 3 1 data setup the combination of data available to describe pesticide active substance of pesticide taxa species effects and biologic parameters resulted in a dataset of 952 single entries for aquatic and terrestrial organisms in the first screening of the data two substances were excluded from the dataset dodine and pyrethrins these pesticides are mixtures of different chemical components and as such they can t be modelled by the here proposed qsar approach and were excluded from the dataset echa 2008 the number of the single combinations with the deletion of dodine and pyrethrins records was reduced to 929 duplicate values were excluded as well as aquatic organisms were kept and only valid combinations of taxa effect parameter species were kept for a total number of 125 useful combinations for the calculation of the models the following step taken in the data setup was to explore the dataset of descriptors in order to find outliers that might bring to uncertainties of results of the qsar models a principal component analysis pca was performed on the set 525 selected variables fig 1 shows the distribution of the 70 active ingredients in the new pc1 vs pc2 space about 25 of the total data variance this graph is useful to analyze the behavior of the samples pesticides in the different components and their similarity on the basis of the structural information used as input for the analysis in fig 2 the scree plot shows the number of principal components versus the corresponding eigenvalue eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each pc in decreasing order with largest value associated to pc1 the scree plot is useful to determine how many principal components are necessary to cover a percentage of variance of about 80 usually the ideal pattern is a steep curve followed by a bend and then a straight line behavior which is highlighted with the circle in the figure it means that in the first ten principal components most of the information content is kept fig 3 is a matrix plot i e a multiple plot generated from different combinations of the first 10 pcs in particular the outliers are highlighted in light blue in fig 3 these pesticides amitrole chlorothalonil dazomet emamectin and lufenuron appear structurally different from the other chemicals in the matrix plot and need to be carefully monitored in the further analysis and model generation 3 2 qsar modelling in a first step models were developed on the basis of split datasets in order to provide external validations for the best combinations of variables selected for each endpoints from the respective ga populations all the possible combinations of the selected descriptors were firstly explored up to two the selected fitness function was the q2loo function the quik rule was set to 0 030 i e the model variables x to response y correlation must be at least 3 higher than within the x block then the genetic algorithm was run up to four descriptors haupt et al using the following settings 2000 iterations gen per size mutation rate of 65 and a population size of 500 models the selection of the best model within the final ga based population took into account the principle of the occam s razor i e law of parsimony which states that among competing hypothesis the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected this law is usually applicable to qsar because large number of descriptors can make the interpretation and explanation of the models more difficult and often a small number of molecular descriptors outperforms significantly more complex combinations which may lead to overfitting cherkasov et al table 1 shows the statistical parameters calculated for the training and the prediction sets of the split models all the best split models reported in table 1 have good fitting performances r2 0 75 0 99 and therefore they are able to estimate with good approximation the experimental data used for the model development these models are internally robust since they can handle up to 30 of perturbation with little no change in q2 loo and q2 lmo values q2loo 0 66 0 98 q2 lmo 0 64 0 98 the low values of r2 yscr 0 11 0 38 indicates that the models are not affected by chance correlation the statistical parameters calculated to quantify the external predictivity of the models were all satisfying according to thresholds reported in the literature tropsha the range of q2 ext fn 0 53 0 96 suggests that the models are reasonably predictive when applied to chemicals that were not involved in the development of the models in addition the rmseext values of each model on external chemicals were very close to the rsmetr on training chemicals this confirms that the models had similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction and thus a good degree of generalization table 2 reports the molecular descriptors combination selected by the ga for each dataset and their relative importance based on the standardized coefficients and their definition in addition table 2 lists the descriptors selected in the models and provides a general description of these variables most of them are calculated from 2d structural information encoded into smiles supplementary materials section on the basis of connectivities within the molecules and atomic properties such as electronegativities and polarizabilities we want to highlight that these descriptors do not encode for specific fragments but they capture global properties of the molecular structure such as spatial autocorrelations 2d autocorrelation molecular heterogeneity bcuts and electronic accessibility e state which may be quantified by complex calculations differently pubchem fragments listed in table 2 encode for specific patterns in the structures therefore the presence absence of these specific chemical features e g functional groups or molecular portions in a model can be easily directly associated to variations in the studied effect a more in depth comment of these descriptors is provided in the following sections however regarding the interpretation of these molecular descriptors it is necessary to bear in mind that the here proposed models consist of multivariate combinations of descriptors selected through a statistically driven procedure i e ga based selection therefore none of the descriptors can independently explain the behavior of the modelled endpoint i e only the combination of descriptors allows the accurate modelling of the studied responses the plot of experimental versus predicted toxicity values for both the full and the split models are reported as well as an example of williams plot i e representative for the split model which describes the model s ad therefore having verified the predictive ability of the best variables selected by the ga for each modelled endpoint and considering the limited amount of chemicals included in each training set the best equations were newly calibrated using all the available experimental information full model 3 3 qsar model for algae 3 3 1 selenastrum capricornutum toxicity test al1 endpoint based on growth cell count the full model for ec50 in selenastrum capricornutum was calibrated on 28 pesticides the endpoint expressed as log ec50 ranged from 2 47 to 2 45 Î¼mol l i e from 1 19 to 71 600 Î¼g l the equation of the full qsar model and relative plots fig 4 for al1 are given below 1 l o g e c 50 a l 1 0 45 1 55 m a t s 8 e 1 28 p u b c h e m f p 645 4 78 m a t s 4 e 1 33 p u b c h e m f p 346 n 28 r 2 0 82 q loo 2 0 73 q lmo 2 0 70 r yscr 2 0 15 rmse tr 0 55 rmse cv 0 66 mae tr 0 42 mae cv 0 52 the most important variables selected in this model are two moran autocorrelation coefficients todeschini et al todeschini et al 2000 mats4e std coefficient 0 51 and mats8e std coefficient 0 42 these variables encode for structural information related to the degree of autocorrelation between numerical values of a property i e electronegativity at a specific topological distance i e distance 4 and 8 respectively the other variables selected in the model are pubchem fingerprints these descriptors as specified above are boolean values reflecting the presence or not of a chemical characteristic in a chemical structure in particular pubchemfp645 and 346 smarts theory std coefficient 0 45 and 0 52 refer to oc n c c and c c h o fragments respectively in this dataset the presence of both fragments in the molecular structure in addition to negative values or values close to zero of the autocorrelation descriptors increases the toxic potency of the chemicals more negative log ec50 3 4 qsar model for aquatic invertebrates 3 4 1 daphnia magna toxicity test ai4 endpoint based on reproduction young produced the log ec50 for the 29 pesticides with available data in daphnia magna ranged from 4 37 to 3 93 Î¼mol l the equation of the full qsar model and related plots fig 5 for ai4 are given below 2 l o g e c 50 a i 4 11 09 1 42 b c u t p 1 h 2 61

al 1997 kang et al std coefficient 0 92 is the most important descriptor in the model this variable takes into account both connectivity and atomic properties relevant to intermolecular interactions b cut descriptors are calculated from a matrix representation of the molecular graph where diagonal elements encode for atomic properties such as in this case polarizability in the proposed equation bcutp 1h is positively correlated with the response therefore the most toxic compounds in the present dataset are characterized by small values of the b cut descriptor the pubchemfp12 fragment pubchem fingerprints std coefficient 0 80 comes from the hierarchic element counts and brings information related to molecular dimension and atom diversity i e number of c atoms equal to or greater than 16 since this descriptor is inversely related to the endpoint the absence of the aforementioned pattern i e pubchemfp12 0 is associated with low toxicity values i e large log ec50 finally the mic0 descriptor todeschini et al 2000 std coefficient 0 66 is an index of neighborhood symmetry modified information content index neighborhood symmetry of 0 order 3 5 qsar model for aquatic plants 3 5 1 lemna gibba toxicity test ap5 endpoint based on growth frond number this dataset is very limited and composed only of 13 pesticides with log ec50 values ranging from 2 86 to 2 78 Î¼mol l the equation of the full qsar model and related plots fig 6 for ap5 are given below 3 l o g e c 50 a p 5 6 14 0 84 b c u t c 1 l 2 26 m a x w h b a n 13 r 2 0 94 q loo 2 0 90 q lmo 2 0 89 r yscr 2 0 17 rmse tr 0

descriptors encode for the distribution of a property partial charge in this case in the molecule todeschini et al 2000 in this dataset the value of this descriptor bcutc 1l increases i e becomes more negative with chemical dimension and is directly correlated with the response i e more toxic chemicals have large negative bcutc 1 values in addition the descriptor maxwhba maximum e states for weak hydrogen bond acceptors std coefficient 0 56 is directly correlated to the studied endpoint 3 6 qsar models for fish 3 6 1 pimephales promelas test fs6 endpoint based on growth length the dataset available to model ec50 in pimephales promelas was also very small with toxicity values expressed as log ec50 between 2 91 and 2 34 Î¼mol l the equation of the full qsar model and related plots fig 7 for fs6 are given below 4 l o g e c 50 f s 6 7 49 2 43 p u b c h e m f p 613 0 69 m i n a a c h 2 67 s p m a x 5 b h i n 12 r 2 0 96 q loo 2 0 94 q lmo 2 0 93 r yscr 2 0 27 rmse tr 0 29 rmse cv 0 37 mae tr 0 21 mae cv 0 29 as for the qsar model developed for lemna gibba it should be noted that this model is based on a very limited number of data the limited external predictivity of the model reported in table 1 is due to the exclusion of essential structural information from the training set this information is important to help the calibration of the coefficients of the model for an accurate prediction of compounds epoxiconazole and carbosulfan which behave as strong outliers in the split model however the full model is robust when checked for cross validation the most important descriptors in the model are the fingerprint pubchemfp613 and the descriptor minaach from the electrotopological state indices pubchemfp613 checks for the presence of the c n c c c smarts pattern the most toxic among the chemicals investigated for toxicity to pimephales i e pyridaben and lambda cyalothrin miss this fragment in their molecular structure the descriptor minaach i e minimum atom type e state aromatic ch aromatic encodes information related to the connectivity of a specific atom topological environment and the electronic interactions due to all other atoms in the molecule the topological relationship is based on the graph distance to each other atom atom type e state indices are calculated by summing the e state values e g electronic information of all atoms of the same atom type in the molecule todeschini et al 2009 these descriptors help to capture information associated to electronic accessibility of an atom therefore the probability of interaction with another molecule in this model the selected e state descriptor is inversely correlated to the studied endpoint finally the spmax5 bhi belongs from the eigenvalue based descriptor family todeschini et al 2009 and takes into account molecular heterogeneity based on atoms electronegativities weighted by ionization potential in the studied dataset large chemicals have large values of this descriptor which is inversely related with the studied endpoint i e large spmax5bhi values corresponds to small log ec50 values 3 6 2 oncorhynchus mykiss toxicity test fs7 endpoint based on growth weight the log ec50 expressed in Î¼mol l measured for the 12 pesticides for oncorhynchus mykiss ranged from 2 25 to 2 73 the best results were obtained using three variables shown in equation 5 the full qsar model and relative plots fig 8 for fs7 are given below 5 l o g e c 50 f s 7 0 56 1 68 g a t s 6 e 0 464 s r w 5 2 54 p u b c h e m f p 179 n 12 r 2 0 96 q loo 2 0 92 q lmo 2 0 91 r yscr 2 0 27 rmse tr 0 25 rmse cv 0 35 mae tr 0 22 mae cv 0 33 the gats6e descriptor geary autocorrelation lag 6 weighted by sanderson electro negativities is part of the autocorrelation descriptors the geary coefficient is a distance type function varying from zero to infinity brings information related to chemical complexity heterogeneity and is positively related to the studied endpoint todeschini et al 2009 the pubchemfp179 fragment is part of a class of descriptors which tests the presence of a specific chemical ring system in the studied dataset this descriptor helps to identify chemicals that present at least one or more saturated or aromatic carbon only ring of size 6 which tend to be more toxic i e lower toxicity values than chemicals characterized by the presence of other ring systems e g heterocycles or heteroaromatic the srw5 is part of the walk count descriptors and it is defined as the self returning walk count of order 5 ln 1 x this is a simple molecular descriptor based on counting defined elements of a compound todeschini et al 2009 and it brings information related to molecular dimension and the presence of rings it should be noted that the complexity of eq 5 i e number of variables is rather high considering the dimension of the training set therefore in order to be in agreement with the parsimony principle best solution would be in a future refinement to find a combination of lower complexity and comparable accuracy as equation 5 or as an alternative to increase the number of samples for the training prediction sets 3 7 evaluation of the applicability domain of the proposed qsars after assessing the robustness and predictivity of all models it is interesting to analyze for each taxa the percentage of predicted data which fall inside the applicability domain ad of the respective qsar results of this analysis are shown in table 3 all the ads of the developed models showed a good coverage of the dataset demonstrating that the predictions generated by these qsars are reliable for several pesticides this is interesting considering the limited amount of data originally available for some of the endpoints i e 12 13 data points the number of pesticides falling inside the ads of all the models is 51 75 of all selected pesticides i e considering only the interpolated reliable predictions the distribution of molecular weight were investigated too without any noticeable meaning 3 8 investigation of the multi specie toxicity profile of the studied pesticides principal component analysis pca was used to investigate the toxicity profile of the studied pesticides according to their experimental or estimated toxicity in different taxa the pca was firstly performed on the 51 pesticides which had all interpolated predictions using only predicted values the biplot i e plots of the loadings and of the scores is presented in fig 9 whereas fig 10 shows the loading plots for the aforementioned pca in all the loading plots each loading aims at the direction of maximum log ec50 i e high distance from the center of the axis corresponds to low toxicity for the displayed taxa on the left side of fig 9 i e pc1 vs pc2 biplot there are the active ingredients which tend to be toxic to all the species these compounds should be prioritized as the most hazardous for the aquatic environment represented in this study and are listed table 4 pc2 discriminates between autotrophic negative and heterotrophic positive organisms algae and aquatic plants stand completely separated from the rest of the loadings in pcs where pc2 is present so this distinction is quite clear and this pc can be used as descriptor for toxicity of aquatic algae al1 and aquatic plants ap5 vs invertebrates ai4 and fish fs6 and fs7 for example in the pc1vspc2 graph herbicides in green which are the most notable pesticides for aquatic plants and algae are displayed on the opposite of al1 and ap5 loadings these patterns were identified also in the pca based on the integration of experimental and predicted toxicity values which supports the reliability of the here proposed qsars in addition we attempted to categorize the 51 studied substances on the basis of toxicity thresholds for hazard characterization as proposed by us epa aquatic risk assessment epa in particular three levels of aquatic toxicity concern for acute and chronic toxicity are used in this approach which are shown in table 5 the pca biplot with scores labelled according to the proposed categorization is shown in fig 11 even if noec or ec10 values would be more suitable for the aforementioned categorization we performed our analysis on the basis of ec50 data experimental and predicted available in the present work which were categorized according to the pattern proposed by the us epa reported in table 5 high concern pesticides were identified as those which counted 4 or more than 4 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds on the basis of 5 species medium concern pesticides were identified as those which counted 2 or 3 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds low concern pesticides were identified as those which counted less than 2 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds table 6 while only three of the potentially most hazardous pesticides belongs to the insecticides and nematocides classes more than 15 belong to the fungicide and herbicides classes the use of these molecules should be monitored as well as their fate in the environment because of the potential hazard they may pose to non target aquatic organisms 3 9 further considerations regulation ec no 1107 2009 encourages the use and development of non experimental tests to anticipate the possible health and environmental risks of pesticides villaverde et al 2017 but the current regulatory pesticide toxicity testing and assessment approaches in the framework of environmental risk assessment remain to a large extent based on a checklist of in vivo tests conducted in accordance with standardized test guidelines or protocols such as oecd test guidelines while this approach has evolved over the past half century it is unlikely to efficiently meet legislative mandates that require increased numbers of chemical assessments to be undertaken without a concomitant increase in the use of animals and resources new approaches are necessary to close the gap between the number of chemicals in use and the number assessed to date modern computational methodologies for toxicological testing and chemical risk assessment are currently a topic of great interest amongst researchers and the regulatory community because of their potential for predicting chemical toxicity and reducing animal testing benfenati et al 2017 as mentioned above the eu regulation on pesticides still provides as mandatory data requirements that ecotoxicological studies have to be performed to test aquatic toxicity of substances the efsa guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms in edge of field surface water opens a window on in silico tests but it also aims the attention at a major concern i e the danger of underestimating the real toxicity or hazard of the given substances as a consequence it is currently difficult that non testing methods replace in vivo studies in the risk assessment as they are not legally accepted as data requirements what lacks is a global repository of harmonized structured and certified data in order to reduce uncertainty which is actually the big problem of in silico strategies villaverde et al 2019 even if for example efsa has recently launched calls for tenders for the creation of datasets that may be used for the development of pesticide oriented computational tools in the us the regulation on pesticides relies on the integrated approaches to testing and assessment iata iata have the potential to integrate existing data on pesticides with the results of alternative methods e g biochemical cellular assays qsar leading to the refinement reduction and or replacement of conventional test requirements twg on pesticide 2012 nowadays the european union science hub is going to integrate the iata approach to the eu context and this might open a window to new perspectives and innovative scenarios kolesnyk jaworska villaverde et al 2019 4 conclusions ecotoxicological data of aquatic organisms gathered from 70 active substances approval dossiers were collected into a storage ms access database in particular pesticide effect concentrations for selenastrum capricornutum green alga daphnia magna aquatic invertebrates lemna gibba aquatic plant pimephales promelas and oncorhynchus mykiss fresh water fish were collected the ec50 were derived for specific combinations of pesticides species toxicological effects and biological parameters selected to measure the different effects the present study extends the completeness of the set of ec50 data for all the above cited monitored species and for all the 70 selected pesticides the here proposed qsar models which were adequately built and tested by internal and external validations had good statistical performances as well as satisfactory applicability domains in particular the good coverage of the dataset demonstrated that the predictions could be used reliably to predict log ec50 data for several categories and different families of pesticides whose toxicity for aquatic organisms is completely unknown the principal component analysis of the interpolated predictions was performed to assess the toxicological profile of the studied pesticides in a simplified aquatic scenario described by experimental and predicted toxicity data for 5 species some interesting information were derived from this multivariate analysis such as the separation of the toxicity of the studied compounds for autotrophic and heterotrophic aquatic organisms finally a priority list of the potentially most hazardous compounds on the basis of combined measures of toxicity for the aquatic environment was compiled on the basis of the combination of qsars predictions and multivariate analysis 4 1 recommendations due to the importance of the ecotoxicological endpoints in the pesticide environmental risk assessment process the present work does not have any conceit to substitute the risk assessment itself but it sets some predictions and a priority list which may be of use in the general a priori assessment of the potential hazard of the pesticides declaration of competing interest

18052,the efsa guidance on tiered risk assessment for edge of field surface waters underscores the importance of in silico models to support the pesticide risk assessment the aim of this work was to use in silico models starting from an available structured and harmonized pesticide dataset that was developed for different purposes in order to stimulate the use of qsar models for risk assessment the present work focuses on the development of a set of in silico models developed to predict the aquatic toxicity of heterogeneous pesticides with incomplete unknown toxic behavior in the water compartment the generated models have good fitting performances r2 0 75 0 99 they are internally robust q2loo 0 66 0 98 and can handle up to 30 of perturbation of the training set q2 lmo 0 64 0 98 the absence of chance correlation was guaranteed by low values of r2 calculated on scrambled responses r2 yscr 0 11 0 38 different statistical parameters were used to quantify the external predictivity of the models cccext 0 73 0 91 q2 ext fn 0 53 0 96 the results indicate that all the best models are predictive when applied to chemicals not involved in the models development in addition all models have similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction and this represents a good degree of generalization these models may be useful to support the risk assessment procedure when experimental data for key species are missing or to create prioritization lists for the general a priori assessment of the potential toxicity of existing and new pesticides which fall in the applicability domain graphical abstract image 1 keywords pesticide qsar ecotoxicology endpoint 1 introduction agriculture occupies a very important place in the european union eu as an economic activity and as a source of food for population in the last 50 years it has gone from a national and intensive agriculture to a common and sustainable agriculture villaverde et al 2019 pesticides have a massive role in the agricultural framework due to the fact that they have always been widely used in agriculture to prevent or control pests diseases weeds and other plant pathogens to reduce or eliminate yield losses and maintain high quality of agricultural products they are intentionally used to cause adverse effects on target organisms but adverse effects in non target organisms may arise as well as a consequence of the exposure to these products currently the integrated management of pest diseases and weeds seeks to maximize crops production and at the same time to reduce the impact of pesticides on living beings and on the environment by making better use of them at socially acceptable and economically viable levels villaverde et al 2019 for this reason pesticides are developed through very strict complex and time consuming regulation processes reg ec 1107 2009 to function with reasonable certainty reduce the uncertainty and minimal impact on human health and the environment in addition directive 2009 128 ec european commission promotes the sustainable use of pesticides through the integrated pest management pesticide registration is a scientifically based legal and also administrative process where the potential to cause adverse effects on human health and the environment associated with the use of pesticide products is assessed by conducting several tests reg eu 283 2013 effects in any non target species may translate into ecosystem unbalance and food chain disruption that ultimately may affect human health and edible species damalas et al 2011 as mentioned regulatory bodies rely on extensive in vivo and in vitro testing to support regulatory decisions on human health and environmental risks it is a known fact that in vivo tests often require a large number of laboratory animal studies which can consume significant amounts of resources in terms of budget and time for testing and evaluation alternatives to animal testing reg eu 283 2013 were proposed to overcome some of the drawbacks associated with animal experiments and avoid the unethical procedures in silico methods based on quantitative structure activity relationships qsar are worldwide recognized alternatives to animal testing as well as cells and tissue cultures alternative organisms lower vertebrates invertebrates and microorganisms ranganatha et al doke et al scholz et al villaverde et al 2017 qsar can potentially result in significant cost savings during the pesticide safety assessment process having a great economic impact for the agrochemical sector the reduction in the necessary laboratory or field evaluations will decrease time and cost leading to faster commercialization of formulations and thus promoting the productivity and competitiveness of european agriculture in silico tools are especially important when experimental studies are not adequate because of ethical reasons or because experimental studies are either too complex or not viable villaverde et al 2017 zhu et al qsar models are based on a variety of mathematical approaches to predict activities and properties of untested chemicals on the basis of their molecular structure qsar methods have a long history of use both for the design pre synthesis and the regulatory assessment of pharmaceuticals pesticides and other chemicals twg on pesticide 2012 therefore considering the limitations of current testing approaches the growing public attention for ethical issues related to in vivo tests and breedings and the rapid development and the advantages of computational predictive methods companies and regulatory agencies have started in the last decade to support the use of qsars to enhance the efficiency of hazard and risk assessment processes echa 76 768 eec in particular in 2007 the european reach regulation regulation evaluation authorization of chemicals reg ec 1907 2006 promoted the regulatory use of in silico i e models grouping and read across procedures and in vitro alternatives to animal testing since then specific guidance documents and other tools were made available by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the european chemical agency echa echa oecd 2015 and the eu commission jrc triebe et al to increase the transparent use of these methods in line with the current regulatory approaches mentioned above the aim of the present work was to use data collected within a project commissioned by the european food safety authority efsa galimberti et al to estimate pesticide ecotoxicity values on the basis of their chemical structure in particular data measured for aquatic organisms representative of different levels of biological complexity were used for the creation of ad hoc qsar models these approaches which are proposed as alternative methods in the guidance on tiered risk assessment for edge of field surface waters efsa j 2013 should serve as quantitative tools to predict the effect concentrations ecx of other substances of interest having no experimental toxicity data available ecotoxicological studies are designed to identify the adverse effects produced by a substance to selected species and to characterize the dose response relationship for the adverse effects the aim of the present work is to maximize the toxicological information available to describe the whole set of 70 pesticides within different taxonomic groups by using chemometric approaches 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset and data control within the project comparison of noec values to ec10 ec20 values including confidence intervals in aquatic and terrestrial ecotoxicological risk assessment a collection of data from the ecotoxicological section of 70 pesticide approval dossiers was performed galimberti et al ecotoxicological data of studies from the pesticide approval dossiers have to strictly follow internationally agreed test guidelines such as oecd or us oppts these guidelines allow a high standardization of the study performance and consequently the results moreover in the aforementioned collection of data galimberti et al ecotoxicological studies have been peer reviewed from national experts in the pesticide assessment procedure and these data have been processed through a statistical modelling analysis performed in 2015 by the wageningen university the pesticides were mainly distributed through the herbicide fungicide and insecticide pesticide functional classes respectively 32 44 and 19 and 5 of combinations of functional classes only studies concerning chronic toxicity were taken into account and in particular on the following taxa algae aquatic invertebrates aquatic plants birds earthworms fish mammals non target plants soil arthropods and terrestrial arthropods different effects were investigated with numerous biologic parameters among all the effects development growth and reproduction of the different tested organisms were the most frequent in the pool of selected studies all the data were managed and stored into an ms access database the database consisted of 952 single entries collected for different pesticide active substances tested in different taxa species effects and biologic parameters like cell count length weight young produced in addition to information related to time of exposure as well as the number of tested doses and the dose max each substance was characterized by the cas registry number the molecular formula and the molecular weight the single entries were ec10 ec20 and ec50 values with their upper and lower confidential limits and the noec value calculated and reported from the pesticide study tests a subset of the dataset only studied aquatic organisms is reported in supplementary material to create a strong dataset in order to build robust qsar models data as reported in the supplementary materials were curated according to the following steps presence of mixtures and stereoisomeric compounds in the studied samples pesticides in general mixtures cannot be run through qsar models nor can synergistic or antagonistic effects of chemicals in mixtures be accounted for because models typically use single discrete chemical structures as input regarding stereoisomeric pesticides the user should be aware that qsar predictions generated by using representative 2d structure do not accurately reflect the true 3d conformation of the active ingredients i e they miss information on stereochemistry twg on pesticide 2012 grouping data for data consistency according to the guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms efsa ppr 2013 and on the basics of statistical homogeneity data on substances were aggregated by the same taxa species effects and biologic parameters on a first attempt of analysis outliers an outlier is an observation point that is distant from other observations it may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error which might be sometimes excluded from the data set in qsar compounds that have unexpected biological activity and are unable to fit in a qsar model are known as outliers these are valuable in defining the limitations under which compounds act by a common molecular mechanism modelled by one or more descriptors and also in defining the experimental limitations of the biological test data thus particular attention should be payed to the outliers and the reason for their peculiarity be sought rajeshwar et al 2 2 molecular descriptors the smile strings available for the 70 active substances were imported into the padel descriptor software yap for the calculation of the molecular descriptors the smile notation an acronym which stands for simplified molecular input line entry system i e a string notation used to describe the nature and topology of molecular structures were derived according to the pubchem project pubchem and where available these notations were compared with the ones reported in the approval dossiers of the active substances to cross validate the information acquired the smile notation was retrieved because is the starting point to calculate the molecular descriptors for the selected active substances molecular descriptors todeschini et al are the final result of a logic and mathematical procedure which transforms chemical information encoded within a symbolic representation of a molecule into a useful number version 2 21 of padel was used all the 1d 2d descriptors were calculated and also the pubchem fingerprints the number of calculated descriptors 1875 with padel software yap was large and included molecular descriptors and fingerprints in order to have the possibility to represent different features of the chemical structure in different ways however a lot of them resulted to be inter correlated and redundant giving very similar structural information for this reason a pre filtering procedure was applied to the dataset to exclude semi constant descriptors no information brought by the variable itself and to exclude descriptors too inter correlated same information brought by many variables constant variables were excluded if greater than 80 and inter correlated variables were excluded if correlated for a percentage greater than 90 after this procedure the number of remaining variables was 525 this data curation procedure was performed with qsarins software qsarins gramatica et al 2013 gramatica et al 2014 2 3 qsar modelling the dataset was prepared to be used as the input for the qsar model generation i e all the responses were converted into Î¼mol l and transformed into log ecx multiple linear regression mlr qsar models by ols ordinary least squares method and genetic algorithm for variable selection were generated and validated in the software qsarins principal component analysis pca wold s et al 1987 was then performed on the curated molecular descriptors in order to explore the distribution of the data in the chemical and experimental space and to highlight possible outliers and or particular clusters patterns the next step was the development of the qsar models according to the oecd principles for the development of qsars for regulatory use oecd 2004 oecd 2007 as mentioned above the software qsarins was used to generate mlr ols models in a first step exhaustive selection was performed by exploring the fitting of all the possible combinations of up to 2 variables included in the models in a second step a selection procedure based on a genetic algorithm ga was used to select the best population of models the statistical quality of the models was determined by quantification of the coefficient of determination r2 which represents the fitting ability of the models and of the q2leave one out and q2leave more out q2loo and q2lmo respectively which represent the internal robustness of the models wehrens et al in particular the ga evolution performed in qsarins optimizes the q2leave one out parameter in addition the quik rule set to 0 03 0 05 value in this study was applied to control the risk of chance correlation and ensure that the total correlation among the descriptors selected in each model is not higher than their correlation with the modelled response furthermore the scrambling of the responses i e y scramble was performed to identify and exclude models possibly obtained by chance rÃ¼cker et al gramatica et al 2004 low r2 and q2loo values recalculated for each model applied on scrambled responses are expected in the absence of chance correlation the best models according to fitting and robustness were then checked for their ability to predict the endpoint of interest for external molecules i e not considered during the development calibration of the models to perform the external validations the data available for each response were divided split into training and prediction sets before to run the ga these sets were used to fit the models and to check their external predictivity respectively the splitting was performed by ranking the available data in ascending order of the response and putting one every five chemicals in the prediction set i e 20 was set as prediction while the remaining 80 was kept in the training set the external predictivity was quantified using multiple external validation parameters which are calculated by qsarins such as q2 ext f1 shi et al q2 ext f2 schÃ¼Ã¼rmann et al q2 ext f3 consonni et al cccext chirico et al chirico et al 2012 lin as well as the root mean squared of errors rmse this last parameter summarizes the overall error of the model in training cross validation and external sets i e rmsetr rmsecv and rmseext respectively qsarins also provides the mean absolute error mae which is a measure of difference between two continuous variables predicted and measured variables a common measure to forecast errors therefore summarizing the best models were selected as the most externally predictive out of ga based populations at different levels of complexity and ranked according to decreasing robustness q2loo q2lmo and fitting r2 cherkasov et al finally the analysis of the applicability domain ad of the models allowed for the identification of influential and or problematic compounds response and structural outliers the leverage approach was used to quantify the structural space of the models which depends on the modelling descriptors and helps in the identification of chemicals which are influent in the selection of the modelling descriptors or are structurally dissimilar from the training set compounds the williams plot hat values vs standardized residuals for each chemical was used to assess the presence of both response outliers i e compounds with cross validated standardized residuals greater than 2 5 standard deviation units and structural outliers i e compounds with leverage value h higher than h 3 p 1 n where p is the number of variables of the model and n is the number of compounds in the training set sangion et al the williams plot is indeed a graph representing the standard residuals vs hat i i the hat value of leverage is used for domain applicability assessment hat values represent the distance of the molecules to the model structural space 3 results and discussion 3 1 data setup the combination of data available to describe pesticide active substance of pesticide taxa species effects and biologic parameters resulted in a dataset of 952 single entries for aquatic and terrestrial organisms in the first screening of the data two substances were excluded from the dataset dodine and pyrethrins these pesticides are mixtures of different chemical components and as such they can t be modelled by the here proposed qsar approach and were excluded from the dataset echa 2008 the number of the single combinations with the deletion of dodine and pyrethrins records was reduced to 929 duplicate values were excluded as well as aquatic organisms were kept and only valid combinations of taxa effect parameter species were kept for a total number of 125 useful combinations for the calculation of the models the following step taken in the data setup was to explore the dataset of descriptors in order to find outliers that might bring to uncertainties of results of the qsar models a principal component analysis pca was performed on the set 525 selected variables fig 1 shows the distribution of the 70 active ingredients in the new pc1 vs pc2 space about 25 of the total data variance this graph is useful to analyze the behavior of the samples pesticides in the different components and their similarity on the basis of the structural information used as input for the analysis in fig 2 the scree plot shows the number of principal components versus the corresponding eigenvalue eigenvalues represent the variance explained by each pc in decreasing order with largest value associated to pc1 the scree plot is useful to determine how many principal components are necessary to cover a percentage of variance of about 80 usually the ideal pattern is a steep curve followed by a bend and then a straight line behavior which is highlighted with the circle in the figure it means that in the first ten principal components most of the information content is kept fig 3 is a matrix plot i e a multiple plot generated from different combinations of the first 10 pcs in particular the outliers are highlighted in light blue in fig 3 these pesticides amitrole chlorothalonil dazomet emamectin and lufenuron appear structurally different from the other chemicals in the matrix plot and need to be carefully monitored in the further analysis and model generation 3 2 qsar modelling in a first step models were developed on the basis of split datasets in order to provide external validations for the best combinations of variables selected for each endpoints from the respective ga populations all the possible combinations of the selected descriptors were firstly explored up to two the selected fitness function was the q2loo function the quik rule was set to 0 030 i e the model variables x to response y correlation must be at least 3 higher than within the x block then the genetic algorithm was run up to four descriptors haupt et al using the following settings 2000 iterations gen per size mutation rate of 65 and a population size of 500 models the selection of the best model within the final ga based population took into account the principle of the occam s razor i e law of parsimony which states that among competing hypothesis the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected this law is usually applicable to qsar because large number of descriptors can make the interpretation and explanation of the models more difficult and often a small number of molecular descriptors outperforms significantly more complex combinations which may lead to overfitting cherkasov et al table 1 shows the statistical parameters calculated for the training and the prediction sets of the split models all the best split models reported in table 1 have good fitting performances r2 0 75 0 99 and therefore they are able to estimate with good approximation the experimental data used for the model development these models are internally robust since they can handle up to 30 of perturbation with little no change in q2 loo and q2 lmo values q2loo 0 66 0 98 q2 lmo 0 64 0 98 the low values of r2 yscr 0 11 0 38 indicates that the models are not affected by chance correlation the statistical parameters calculated to quantify the external predictivity of the models were all satisfying according to thresholds reported in the literature tropsha the range of q2 ext fn 0 53 0 96 suggests that the models are reasonably predictive when applied to chemicals that were not involved in the development of the models in addition the rmseext values of each model on external chemicals were very close to the rsmetr on training chemicals this confirms that the models had similar accuracy both in fitting and in prediction and thus a good degree of generalization table 2 reports the molecular descriptors combination selected by the ga for each dataset and their relative importance based on the standardized coefficients and their definition in addition table 2 lists the descriptors selected in the models and provides a general description of these variables most of them are calculated from 2d structural information encoded into smiles supplementary materials section on the basis of connectivities within the molecules and atomic properties such as electronegativities and polarizabilities we want to highlight that these descriptors do not encode for specific fragments but they capture global properties of the molecular structure such as spatial autocorrelations 2d autocorrelation molecular heterogeneity bcuts and electronic accessibility e state which may be quantified by complex calculations differently pubchem fragments listed in table 2 encode for specific patterns in the structures therefore the presence absence of these specific chemical features e g functional groups or molecular portions in a model can be easily directly associated to variations in the studied effect a more in depth comment of these descriptors is provided in the following sections however regarding the interpretation of these molecular descriptors it is necessary to bear in mind that the here proposed models consist of multivariate combinations of descriptors selected through a statistically driven procedure i e ga based selection therefore none of the descriptors can independently explain the behavior of the modelled endpoint i e only the combination of descriptors allows the accurate modelling of the studied responses the plot of experimental versus predicted toxicity values for both the full and the split models are reported as well as an example of williams plot i e representative for the split model which describes the model s ad therefore having verified the predictive ability of the best variables selected by the ga for each modelled endpoint and considering the limited amount of chemicals included in each training set the best equations were newly calibrated using all the available experimental information full model 3 3 qsar model for algae 3 3 1 selenastrum capricornutum toxicity test al1 endpoint based on growth cell count the full model for ec50 in selenastrum capricornutum was calibrated on 28 pesticides the endpoint expressed as log ec50 ranged from 2 47 to 2 45 Î¼mol l i e from 1 19 to 71 600 Î¼g l the equation of the full qsar model and relative plots fig 4 for al1

rmse cv 0 66 mae tr 0 42 mae cv 0 52 the most important variables selected in this model are two moran autocorrelation coefficients todeschini et al todeschini et al 2000 mats4e std coefficient 0 51 and mats8e std coefficient 0 42 these variables encode for structural information related to the degree of autocorrelation between numerical values of a property i e electronegativity at a specific topological distance i e distance 4 and 8 respectively the other variables selected in the model are pubchem fingerprints these descriptors as specified above are boolean values reflecting the presence or not of a chemical characteristic in a chemical structure in particular pubchemfp645 and 346 smarts theory std coefficient 0 45 and 0 52 refer to oc n c c and c c h o fragments respectively in this dataset the presence of both fragments in the molecular structure in addition to negative values or values close to zero of the autocorrelation descriptors increases the toxic potency of the chemicals more negative log ec50 3 4 qsar model for aquatic invertebrates 3 4 1 daphnia magna toxicity test ai4 endpoint based on reproduction young produced the log ec50 for the 29 pesticides with available data in daphnia magna ranged from 4 37 to 3 93 Î¼mol l the equation of the full qsar model and related plots fig 5 for ai4 are given below 2 l o g e c 50 a i 4 11 09 1 42 b c u t p 1 h 2 61

al 1997 kang et al std coefficient 0 92 is the most important descriptor in the model this variable takes into account both connectivity and atomic properties relevant to intermolecular interactions b cut descriptors are calculated from a matrix representation of the molecular graph where diagonal elements encode for atomic properties such as in this case polarizability in the proposed equation bcutp 1h is positively correlated with the response therefore the most toxic compounds in the present dataset are characterized by small values of the b cut descriptor the pubchemfp12 fragment pubchem fingerprints std coefficient 0 80 comes from the hierarchic element counts and brings information related to molecular dimension and atom diversity i e number of c atoms equal to or greater than 16 since this descriptor is inversely related to the endpoint the absence of the aforementioned pattern i e pubchemfp12 0 is associated with low toxicity values i e large log ec50 finally the mic0

lemna gibba toxicity test ap5 endpoint based on growth frond number this dataset is very limited and composed only of 13 pesticides with log ec50 values ranging from 2 86 to 2 78 Î¼mol l the equation

descriptors encode for the distribution of a property partial charge in this case in the molecule todeschini et al 2000 in this dataset the value of this descriptor bcutc 1l increases i e becomes more negative with chemical dimension and is directly correlated with the response i e more toxic chemicals have large negative bcutc 1 values in addition the descriptor maxwhba maximum e states for weak hydrogen bond acceptors std coefficient 0 56 is directly correlated to the studied endpoint 3 6 qsar models for fish 3 6 1 pimephales promelas test fs6 endpoint based on growth length the dataset available to model ec50 in pimephales promelas was also very small with toxicity values expressed as log ec50 between 2 91 and 2 34 Î¼mol l the equation of the full qsar model and related plots fig 7

mae tr 0 21 mae cv 0 29 as for the qsar model developed for lemna gibba it should be noted that this model is based on a very limited number of data the limited external predictivity of the model reported in table 1 is due to the exclusion of essential structural information from the training set this information is important to help the calibration of the coefficients of the model for an accurate prediction of compounds epoxiconazole and carbosulfan which behave as strong outliers in the split model however the full model is robust when checked for cross validation the most important descriptors in the model are the fingerprint pubchemfp613 and the descriptor minaach from the electrotopological state indices pubchemfp613 checks for the presence of the c n c c c smarts pattern the most toxic among the chemicals investigated for toxicity to pimephales i e pyridaben and lambda cyalothrin miss this fragment in their molecular structure the descriptor minaach i e minimum atom type

topological relationship is based on the graph distance to each other atom atom type e state indices are calculated by summing the e state values e g electronic information of all atoms of the same atom type in the molecule todeschini et al 2009 these descriptors help to capture information associated to electronic accessibility of an atom therefore the probability of interaction with another molecule in this model the selected e state descriptor is inversely correlated to the studied endpoint finally the spmax5 bhi belongs from the eigenvalue based descriptor family todeschini et al 2009 and takes into account molecular heterogeneity based on atoms electronegativities weighted by ionization potential in the studied dataset large chemicals have large values of this descriptor which is inversely related with the studied endpoint i e large spmax5bhi values corresponds to small log ec50 values 3 6 2 oncorhynchus mykiss toxicity test fs7 endpoint based on growth weight the log ec50 expressed in Î¼mol l measured for the 12 pesticides for oncorhynchus mykiss ranged from 2 25 to 2 73 the best results were obtained using three variables shown in equation 5 the full qsar model and relative plots fig 8 for fs7 are given below 5 l o g e c 50 f s 7 0 56 1 68 g a t s 6 e 0 464 s r w 5 2 54 p u b c h e m f p 179 n 12 r 2 0 96 q loo 2 0 92 q lmo 2 0 91 r yscr 2 0 27 rmse tr 0 25 rmse cv 0 35 mae tr 0 22 mae cv 0 33 the gats6e descriptor geary autocorrelation lag 6 weighted by sanderson electro negativities is part of the autocorrelation descriptors the geary coefficient is a distance type function varying from zero to infinity brings information related to chemical complexity heterogeneity and is positively related to the studied endpoint todeschini et al 2009 the pubchemfp179 fragment is part of a class of descriptors which tests the presence of a specific chemical ring system in the studied dataset this descriptor helps to identify chemicals that present at least one or more saturated or aromatic carbon only ring of size 6 which tend to be more toxic i e lower toxicity values than chemicals characterized by the presence of other ring systems e g heterocycles or heteroaromatic the srw5 is part of the walk count descriptors and it is defined as the self returning walk count of order 5 ln 1 x this is a simple molecular descriptor based on counting defined elements of a compound todeschini et al 2009 and it brings information related to molecular dimension and the presence of rings it should be noted that the complexity of eq 5 i e number of variables is rather high considering the dimension of the training set therefore in order to be in agreement with the parsimony principle best solution would be in a future refinement to find a combination of lower complexity and comparable accuracy as equation 5 or as an alternative to increase the number of samples for the training prediction sets 3 7 evaluation of the applicability domain of the proposed qsars after assessing the robustness and predictivity of all models it is interesting to analyze for each taxa the percentage of predicted data which fall inside the applicability domain ad of the respective qsar results of this analysis are shown in table 3 all the ads of the developed models showed a good coverage of the dataset demonstrating that the predictions generated by these qsars are reliable for several pesticides this is interesting considering the limited amount of data originally available for some of the endpoints i e 12 13 data points the number of pesticides falling inside the ads of all the models is 51 75 of all selected pesticides i e considering only the interpolated reliable predictions the distribution of molecular weight were investigated too without any noticeable meaning 3 8 investigation of the multi specie toxicity profile of the studied pesticides principal component analysis pca was used to investigate the toxicity profile of the studied pesticides according to their experimental or estimated toxicity in different taxa the pca was firstly performed on the 51 pesticides which had all interpolated predictions using only predicted values the biplot i e plots of the loadings and of the scores is presented in fig 9 whereas fig 10 shows the loading plots for the aforementioned pca in all the loading plots each loading aims at the direction of maximum log ec50 i e high distance from the center of the axis corresponds to low toxicity for the displayed taxa on the left side of fig 9 i e pc1 vs pc2 biplot there are the active ingredients which tend to be toxic to all the species these compounds should be prioritized as the most hazardous for the aquatic environment represented in this study and are listed table 4 pc2 discriminates between autotrophic negative and heterotrophic positive organisms algae and aquatic plants stand completely separated from the rest of the loadings in pcs where pc2 is present so this distinction is quite clear and this pc can be used as descriptor for toxicity of aquatic algae al1 and aquatic plants ap5 vs invertebrates ai4 and fish fs6 and fs7 for example in the pc1vspc2 graph herbicides in green which are the most notable pesticides for aquatic plants and algae are displayed on the opposite of al1 and ap5 loadings these patterns were identified also in the pca based on the integration of experimental and predicted toxicity values which supports the reliability of the here proposed qsars in addition we attempted to categorize the 51 studied substances on the basis of toxicity thresholds for hazard characterization as proposed by us epa aquatic risk assessment epa in particular three levels of aquatic toxicity concern for acute and chronic toxicity are used in this approach which are shown in table 5 the pca biplot with scores labelled according to the proposed categorization is shown in fig 11 even if noec or ec10 values would be more suitable for the aforementioned categorization we performed our analysis on the basis of ec50 data experimental and predicted available in the present work which were categorized according to the pattern proposed by the us epa reported in table 5 high concern pesticides were identified as those which counted 4 or more than 4 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds on the basis of 5 species medium concern pesticides were identified as those which counted 2 or 3 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds low concern pesticides were identified as those which counted less than 2 ec50 values exceeding the epa thresholds table 6 while only three of the potentially most hazardous pesticides belongs to the insecticides and nematocides classes more than 15 belong to the fungicide and herbicides classes the use of these molecules should be monitored as well as their fate in the environment because of the potential hazard they may pose to non target aquatic organisms 3 9 further considerations regulation ec no 1107 2009 encourages the use and development of non experimental tests to anticipate the possible health and environmental risks of pesticides villaverde et al 2017 but the current regulatory pesticide toxicity testing and assessment approaches in the framework of environmental risk assessment remain to a large extent based on a checklist of in vivo tests conducted in accordance with standardized test guidelines or protocols such as oecd test guidelines while this approach has evolved over the past half century it is unlikely to efficiently meet legislative mandates that require increased numbers of chemical assessments to be undertaken without a concomitant increase in the use of animals and resources new approaches are necessary to close the gap between the number of chemicals in use and the number assessed to date modern computational methodologies for toxicological testing and chemical risk assessment are currently a topic of great interest amongst researchers and the regulatory community because of their potential for predicting chemical toxicity and reducing animal testing benfenati et al 2017 as mentioned above the eu regulation on pesticides still provides as mandatory data requirements that ecotoxicological studies have to be performed to test aquatic toxicity of substances the efsa guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms in edge of field surface water opens a window on in silico tests but it also aims the attention at a major concern i e the danger of underestimating the real toxicity or hazard of the given substances as a consequence it is currently difficult that non testing methods replace in vivo studies in the risk assessment as they are not legally accepted as data requirements what lacks is a global repository of harmonized structured and certified data in order to reduce uncertainty which is actually the big problem of in silico strategies villaverde et al 2019 even if for example efsa has recently launched calls for tenders for the creation of datasets that may be used for the development of pesticide oriented computational tools in the us the regulation on pesticides relies on the integrated approaches to testing and assessment iata iata have the potential to integrate existing data on pesticides with the results of alternative methods e g biochemical cellular assays qsar leading to the refinement reduction and or replacement of conventional test requirements twg on pesticide 2012 nowadays the european union science hub is going to integrate the iata approach to the eu context and this might open a window to new perspectives and innovative scenarios kolesnyk jaworska villaverde et al 2019 4 conclusions ecotoxicological data of aquatic organisms gathered from 70 active substances approval dossiers were collected into a storage ms access database in particular pesticide effect concentrations for selenastrum capricornutum green alga daphnia magna aquatic invertebrates lemna gibba aquatic plant pimephales promelas and oncorhynchus mykiss fresh water fish were collected the ec50 were derived for specific combinations of pesticides species toxicological effects and biological parameters selected to measure the different effects the present study extends the completeness of the set of ec50 data for all the above cited monitored species and for all the 70 selected pesticides the here proposed qsar models which were adequately built and tested by internal and external validations had good statistical performances as well as satisfactory applicability domains in particular the good coverage of the dataset demonstrated that the predictions could be used reliably to predict log ec50 data for several categories and different families of pesticides whose toxicity for aquatic organisms is completely unknown the principal component analysis of the interpolated predictions was performed to assess the toxicological profile of the studied pesticides in a simplified aquatic scenario described by experimental and predicted toxicity data for 5 species some interesting information were derived from this multivariate analysis such as the separation of the toxicity of the studied compounds for autotrophic and heterotrophic aquatic organisms finally a priority list of the potentially most hazardous compounds on the basis of combined measures of toxicity for the aquatic environment was compiled on the basis of the combination of qsars predictions and multivariate analysis 4 1 recommendations due to the importance of the ecotoxicological endpoints in the pesticide environmental risk assessment process the present work does not have any conceit to substitute the risk assessment itself but it sets some predictions and a priority list which may be of use in the general a priori assessment of the potential hazard of the pesticides declaration of competing interest

18053,water distribution system contamination events caused by intentional negligent or accidental intrusion of biological chemical or radioactive contaminants have significant impacts on the health of the populations that it services therefore it is important to have an effective plan that can be readily implemented to minimize the impact of these contamination events however limited research has been focused on strategic planning of the decontamination process of the contaminated infrastructure this paper proposed a framework for assembling a disinfection plan in real time by 1 partitioning a wds into a number of district metered areas dmas 2 generating a solution region for each of the dmas and 3 assemble an effective decontamination plan using solution region generated this framework has been applied to three contamination events the results show that when planning for the decontamination stage of a contamination event the use of the proposed framework can 1 significantly reduce the response time 2 improve the quality of the decontamination plan and 3 provide a model for optimizing the resource allocation graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution system water quality contamination decontamination framework decontamination resource allocation 1 introduction water distribution systems wdss are critical municipal infrastructures that deliver potable water from water sources to end users the quality of water that transported within a wds underpins the health and well being of its service population the health of hundreds of thousands of residents can be affected by intentional negligent or accidental network contamination as shown in table 1 this situation will only be aggravated due to the ever increasing rate of urbanization it has been set out by the united state environmental protection agency 2018 and the israeli minister of health regulation 2013 that in the case of network contamination there are three stages for restoring a contaminated wds to its normal state contamination detection and investigation stage operational response stage and remediation and recovery stage the focus of the contamination detection and investigation stage is the timely detection of the presence of the contaminants within a wds this is normally achieved through the development of a contamination warning system cws by strategically placing water quality sensors the number of water quality sensors that can be deployed throughout a wds determines the lower bound for the minimum detection time although it is always the best solution to install a water quality sensor at each node of a wds it is well above the budget of water utility companies thereby a tremendous amount of research efforts have been given to the topic of finding the optimal water quality sensor placement using a limited number of water quality sensors there are a number of objectives for the water quality sensor placement optimization 1 time of detection kessler et al 1998 2 demand coverage lee and deininger 1992 3 population exposed berry et al 2005 4 total length of contaminated pipes watson et al 2004 5 detection likelihood ostfeld and salomons 2006 6 contamination risk weickgenannt et al 2010 7 volume consumed kessler et al 1998 and 8 contamination probability variations he et al 2018 there are a number of attempts made to solve the problem by using different optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms eas ostfeld and salomons 2004 heuristic james r chastain 2005 and integer programming berry et al 2007 these optimization processes are always time intensive due to the size of a real life wds network skeletonization perelman et al 2008 and clustering perelman and ostfeld 2013 have been used to simplify the size of a network to speed up the optimization process both of which significantly reduces the solution space while providing a very close estimation of the true solution the next step after the cws of a wds has been triggered is to identify the time and source of the contamination and prevent additional contamination islam et al 1997 presented an inverse solution method for calculating the chlorine concentration at the source s in a wds which is also applicable to other chemical and biological solutions it has been pointed out by preis and ostfeld 2006 that it is only useable for an event based situation where the number of unknowns equals the number of equations later laird et al 2005 reformulated the inverse problem as a least square minimization with differential and algebraic constraints and used nonlinear programming to solve for the time and location of the contamination sources this reformulation of the problem has been improved by preis and ostfeld 2006 in which a model tree is trained to replace the hydraulic model and the linear rules classification structures of this trained model tree are used by a linear programming solver to identify the time and location of the contamination sources the solutions of source identification problem are often not unique due to the under determined nature of the problem liu et al 2011 proposed a new approach called adaptive dynamic optimization technique adopt that iteratively evaluates and identifies solutions that minimize the predication error that is associated with the non uniqueness of the source identification problem it is reported by liu et al 2011 that adopt is limited to wds contamination events with 1 single injection location 2 non reactive contaminant 3 perfectly defined hydraulic model the uncertainty in the hydraulic data of the contamination source identification problem one of the above limitations has been explored by preis and ostfeld 2011 the contamination area and the approximated time of injections were found for three example case studies in which demands at each node are assumed to be uniformly distributed between its maximum and minimum anticipated demands however it is suggested by preis and ostfeld 2011 that a more complex randomization may be used to reveal additional information on another note the bayesian probability based method starts gaining attractions since its first application to the contamination source identification problem by dawsey et al 2006 some of the recent developments include incorporation of the hierarchical tree structure to model the observation probability distribution wang and zhou 2017 and use continuous probability that is represented by beta binomial conjugate pairs yang and boccelli 2014 however it is summarized by seth et al 2016 that the bayesian probability based method 1 performs poorly when there are multiple contaminant injections 2 exhibits accuracy problems when given a large amount of false negative measurements and 3 does not explicitly consider the connections between sensors and candidate nodes operational response stage will start once sufficient information on the contamination has been gathered through the investigation process the main step that is involved in this stage is the operation responses that water utility companies must take to limit the spread of the contaminants and minimize the impact on the customers and wds the time and source of the contamination that are identified in the last stage are used here to estimate the spread of the contaminants and isolating the contaminated section of the network this can be done by using the hydraulic result from either the steady state analysis of the contaminated wds clark et al 1988 1993 or the real time flow direction data from supervisory control and data acquisition scada system davidson et al 2005 the public and customers within this isolated contaminated area must be notified in addition drinking water use restriction may be applied base on the severity of the contamination finally remediation and recovery stage will be initialized to restore the wds to normal operations for chemical related event preis and ostfeld 2008 and physical related event zhang et al 2020 this stage includes 1 removal of the contaminated water from the system for disposal or treatment and 2 decontamination of contaminated infrastructure preis and ostfeld 2008 proposed a model that minimizes both the number of field operations and contaminated water consumed by the public due to the competing nature of the two proposed objectives they employed the non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to identify the trade off between the two aforementioned objectives which can be used to guide the network operators to make informed decisions during network contamination events a similar attempt has also been made by alfonso et al 2010 in which the two competing objectives 1 damage to public health associated with the network contamination and 2 the costs associated with the network operations required to restore the wds to service are treated as separate objectives in a multi objective optimization and combined into one objective in a single objective optimization normally flushing is used as the first response action that water utilities implement to address water quality concerns after network flushing network disinfection is required except for low risk contamination event current regulations set forth by new zealand ministry of health 2014 national environmental engineering research institute 2009 united state environmental protection agency 2018 water services association of australia 2011 and israeli minister of health regulation 2013 define c t value as the decision variable based on the characteristics of the contaminated section of the network where c is the concentration of the disinfectant solution and t is contact time of the said disinfectant solution despite the importance of strategically planning the decontamination stage of a wds limited research has studied this particular area this is because both the hydraulic of the wds the location of the drainage points and the amount of water drained through each drainage point and the water quality of the system location of the disinfectant injection points and the amount of disinfectant used are decision variables during the wds network decontamination stage water utility companies are incentivized to minimize all of the four decision variables above while maintaining an acceptable time for network decontamination in addition different district metered areas dmas of a wds can have different restoration priorities which add an extra layer of complexity to the problem to address the problem mentioned above this study proposes a comprehensive framework for efficiently disinfecting a contaminated network which can be used to guide the actions that can be undertaken by water utility companies during a contamination event the proposed framework is based on partitioning the wds graph into a number of subgraphs using bridge block partitioning algorithm bbpa qiu et al 2019 it has been shown in qiu et al 2019 that the steady state demand driven hydraulic solution of a block can be solved independently from that of the other blocks after the partitioning the main focus of this paper is to generate an optimized disinfection plan for each of the disinfection scenarios for each of the dmas created using the bbpa for the dmas that are identified as contaminated in the contamination detection and investigation stage water authorities can readily assemble a master disinfection plan by choosing a plan for a disinfection scenario for each of the contaminated dmas subject to the resource availability number of disinfectant injection teams the number of drainage teams the disinfectant available the amount of drainage allowed and maximum time to disinfect and constraints it is important to point out that the decontamination process can be carried out serially one dma at a time in parallel all contaminated dmas at the same time or hybridly a number of contaminated dmas at the same time it is worth noting that an earlier version of this paper was presented at the 16th conference on water distribution system analysis wdsa 2014 ostfeld and salomons 2014 unlike the framework proposed in the current study the paper presented in the wdsa 2014 did not taken 1 chemical decay 2 different source chemical concentration 3 decontamination plan assembly at real time or 4 multiple water sources into consideration this paper is organized as followed a description of the general wds hydraulic and disinfection problem is given in the next section this is followed by the methodology that is proposed in this paper section 4 describes the case study networks the results are discussed in section 5 the last section offers some conclusions 2 general wds hydraulic and disinfection problem this section describes the general wds disinfection problem the solution process of the disinfection problem of wdss consists of two steps 1 finding the steady state hydraulic solution of a wds network and 2 finding the water quality solution of the wds network using the hydraulic solution found in the previous step 2 1 definitions and notation consider a water distribution system that contains n p pipes n j junctions and n r fixed head nodes the j t h pipe of the network can be characterized by its diameter d j length l j and resistance factor r j the i t h node of the network has two properties its nodal demand d i and its elevation head z i let q q 1 q 2 q n p t denote the vector of unknown flows of the wds h h 1 h 2 h n j t denote the vector of unknown heads of the wds r r 1 r 2 r n p t denote the vector of resistance factors d d 1 d 2 d n j t denote the vector of nodal demands e l e l 1 e l 2 e l n r t denote the vector of fixed head elevations c c 1 c 2 c n p t denote the vector of unknown pipe concentrations of the dissolved substance where c i is the concentrations of the dissolved substance at location x and time t and u u 1 u 2 u n p t denote the vector of unknown pipe flow velocities denote by g q r n p n p a diagonal square matrix with elements g j j r j q j n 1 for j 1 2 n p denote by f q r n p n p a diagonal square matrix where the j th element on its diagonal f j j d d q j g j j q j the matrix a 1 is the full rank unknown head node arc incidence matrix the matrix a 2 is the fixed head node arc incidence matrix 2 2 hydraulic solution and water quality solution of the problem the steady state flows and heads in a wds are modeled by 1 g q a 1 a 1 t o q h a 2 e l d 0 this non linear system is often solved by the newton method in which q m 1 and h m 1 are repeatedly computed from q m and h m by 2 f m q m a 1 a 1 t o q m 1 q m h m 1 h m g m q m a 1 h m a 2 e l a 1 t q m d until the relative differences q m 1 q m q m 1 and h m 1 h m h m 1 are sufficiently small a water quality model for a wds estimates the time profile of the concentration of the dissolved substance for all points of the network given the location and initial concentration of the dosage points and the hydraulic information of the system there are two steps involved in a water quality model the transport and the decay of the dissolved substance 2 2 1 chemical transportation the transport of the dissolved substance in a wds is modeled by 1 the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow that traverses in a pipe is conserved and this mass conservation is modeled by 1 d advection equation 3 d c i d t u i d c i d x 0 and 2 the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow enters a node equals the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow exits a node and this mass conservation is modeled by 4 i e i n q i c i x l i q k c k j e o u t q j c j x 0 where e i n is the set of edges that carry the flow into node k e o u t is the set of edges that carry the flow out of node k c i x l i is the concentration of the dissolved substance at the point that is x from the start of pipe i q k is the flow that is injected from external source into node k and c k is the concentration of the dissolved substance from the external source into node k 2 2 2 chemical decay the first order chemical decay equation 5 d c i d t k c i is used in this study to model the decay of the dissolved substance where k is the first order decay constant this overall decay constant is 6 k k w k b where k b is the bulk first order decay constant and k w is the wall first order decay constant both the bulk and wall decay constants can be estimated by performing experiments bottle test for the bulk decay constant and in situ test for the wall decay constant 3 methodology the steps that are involved in the proposed methodology are shown in fig 1 the proposed method is a multi variants drainage locations the amount of water drained at each drainage location the concentration of the disinfectant at dosage point time series water quality simulation with multiple objectives minimum filling time minimum amount of water drained and minimum disinfectant used subject to the hydraulic and quality constraints minimum pressure at each node and minimum disinfectant concentration in the network the steps of the proposed methodology can be categorized into the following stages network partitioning use network partitioning algorithm to partition a wds network into a number of hydraulic and water quality independent district metered areas dmas disinfection scenario generation generate a number of scenarios number of drainage locations and the concentration of the disinfectant at source node for each dma of the network disinfection scenario optimization optimize each of the scenarios generated for each dma of the network to identify the optimal locations of the drainage locations and the drainage rate at each drainage location disinfection plan creation a master disinfection plan can be created by selecting a plan for each of the dmas from the disinfection scenario optimization stage and assemble the selected plans the following sub sections describe each stage of the methodology 3 1 network partitioning network partitioning is a necessary step for the planning of disinfection after a network contamination event this is because network contamination events are often associated with uncertainties for example the location and mass of contaminant injected and the spread of the contaminant this uncertain nature of contamination events causes different contamination event to become a different scenario each of which requires a different action to decontaminate 3 1 1 block cut tree the graph component that is associated with a wds can be described as g v e where v is the set of all nodes of the graph g and e is the set of all pipes of the graph g a cut vertex is a node in the wds graph the removal of which increases the number of connected components a block is a maximal connected sub graph any connected graph can be decomposed into a tree of biconnected components called the block cut bc tree of the graph g diestel 2005 due to the weighted and directed nature of a wds graph the bc tree of a wds is rooted and all water sources must be a part of the root block and every other block has a single cut vertex that behaves as a pseudo source qiu et al 2019 the level of a block b i in a rooted bc tree is the length of the unique path composed of blocks from the root block to the current block b i the parent of block b i is the block connected to block b i on the path to the root block block b j is an end block of graph g if it does not have a child block all water must flow from the root block to the end blocks an example of the block cut tree for a looped water distribution system is given in fig 2 the wds network in fig 2a has 11 unknown head nodes 1 11 17 pipes 1 17 and two fixed head nodes s1 and s2 it is possible to identify the cut vertices nodes 3 4 and 6 for this simple network by visual inspection the wds network in fig 2a can be partitioned into four blocks after the identification of the cut vertices it is worth noting that the function of cut vertices in its parent block is different from that in its child block a cut vertex is considered to be a demand node in its parent block and to be a pseudo source in its child block the four blocks of this simple network are shown in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 and fig 2b the root block of the system b 1 which has block level l 0 consists of seven pipes 1 6 17 four nodes 1 4 two sources s1 and s2 two child blocks b 2 and b 3 and no parent block two blocks have block level l 1 blocks b 2 and b 3 b 2 consists of three pipes 7 9 two nodes 5 6 one pseudo source 4 one child block b 4 and one parent block b 1 b 3 which is one of the end blocks of the system consists of four pipes 13 16 three nodes 9 11 one pseudo source 3 one parent block b 1 and no child block finally there is one block that has block level l 2 b 4 b 4 which is the other end blocks of the system consists of three pipes 10 12 two nodes 7 8 one pseudo source 6 one parent block b 2 and no child block it has been shown in qiu et al 2019 that the demand driven steady state hydraulic solution for each block of a wds system can be solved independently after obtaining the hydraulic solution of a block it is possible to perform the water quality simulation for that block this is because both the chemical transportation equations eq 3 and 4 and the chemical decay equation eq 5 are functions of pipe flows and time for both the contaminant and the disinfectant a block is contaminated once the contaminant reaches the articulation point of this block therefore the contaminated section that is isolated from the wds is from each of the source block s where the contaminant is placed to the parent block of the first descendant block of the source block where no contaminant is detected at its articulation point for the same example shown in fig 2 if a source of contamination is placed at node 5 the source block b 2 is contaminated the child block of the source block b 3 may be contaminated depends on the time of detection and blocks b 1 and b 4 are not contaminated thus the disinfection of the network can be planned during the wds design stage for each block of the wds a disinfection strategy can be easily assembled using the plan for each of the blocks in the contaminated section of the network assuming blocks b 2 and b 3 in fig 2 are both contaminated a disinfection strategy that is tailored for this particular contamination event can be assembled in real time using the disinfection plans for blocks b 2 and b 3 3 2 disinfection scenarios generation a number of disinfection scenarios are generated for each block of a wds it is assumed that the disinfection solution is continuously injected at the source node s and water is drained at some of the drainage locations that are pre selected by the water utility companies it has been mentioned in the last subsection that all physical water source s of a wds are in the root block of the bc tree and all other blocks have a pseudo source that is the cut vertex which connects the current block to its parent block as a result the blocks of a wds can be grouped into a block with multiple water sources and blocks with a single water source a number of scenarios are created for each block of the system each of which has a different number of drainage locations and or different disinfectant concentration at source s take block b 4 shown in fig 2 as an example there are 2 demand nodes 7 and 8 in this block both of which can be used as drainage locations in addition the water utility company can dispatch two drainage teams to this block thus there are three drainage scenarios two drainage teams for both drainage points or one drainage team for each of the two drainage points moreover the dosing team dispatched to pseudo source 6 can inject the disinfection solution which raises the concentration of the disinfectant to between 55 mg l to 65 mg l with an increment of 1 mg l thus there are ten dosage scenarios couple both dosage scenarios and drainage scenarios there are a total of 30 disinfection scenarios for this block 3 3 disinfection scenarios optimization 3 3 1 objective functions there are three main objectives in this optimization problem for each disinfection scenario for each of the dmas objective o 1 is the total time required to fill the wds network with the desired disinfectant concentration the minimization of which reduces the impact of network closure on the public objective o 1 can be expressed as 7 min t c r where c r is the minimum disinfectant concentration required for network decontamination and t i is the time required for c m i n t i i objective o 2 is the total amount of water drained from the network the minimization of which reduces the amount of water that needs to be disposed of or treated objective o 2 can be expressed as 8 min t c r i v d n d i where v d n is the set of all drainage nodes in the wds objective o 3 is the total amount of disinfectant used in this stage the minimization of which reduces the cost associated with the amount of disinfectant used objective o 3 can be expressed as 9 min i v s n q i t c r c i 0 where v s n is the set of all disinfectant dosing points q i is the outflow from node i and c i 0 is the initial disinfectant concentration at node i 3 3 2 constraints objectives o 1 o 3 are achieved through selecting drainage locations from a pool of possible drainage locations based on the number of available drainage teams after which a drainage amount is assigned to each of the drainage locations the resulting steady state flows hydraulic simulation distribute the disinfectant solution throughout the wds water quality simulation eq 2 is used to perform steady state demand driven hydraulic simulation subject to pressure constraint 10 p i p i 0 i v where p i is the pressure at node i and p i 0 is the minimum pressure at node i eqs 3 5 are used to perform the water quality simulation using the steady state demand driven hydraulic result subject to water quality constraint 11 c m i n t c r c r where c m i n t is the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration in the network at the time t 3 4 real time network decontamination plan assembly after each of the disinfection scenarios defined in 3 2 are optimized using the objective functions defined in 3 3 for each of the blocks identified in 3 1 the water utility companies can readily create an efficient master disinfection plan by selecting a plan for each of the contaminated blocks and assembling the selected plans there are three ways to assemble the decontamination plan for a wds in parallel serially or hybridly in the parallel approach each of the contaminated blocks is disinfected simultaneously to achieve maximum efficiency it is important to note that the disinfectant concentration at all nodes in all contaminated blocks must satisfy eq 11 at the same time this is because all water sources are located in the top block of a wds sealing a block of wds after the minimum concentration of the disinfectant has been reached will isolate the water supply from all its descendant blocks as a result a block can only be sealed after the minimum disinfectant concentration for all of its descendant blocks have been reached in the serial approach each block is disinfected separately from end blocks to the root blocks this approach is particularly useful when the number of drainage teams and the number of dosage teams are limited in addition it is also possible to assign a different priority to each of the contaminated blocks which allows blocks with different priorities to be disinfected at a different rate alternatively it is also possible to construct a hybrid plan to maximally utilize the resources that are available to the water utilities in this case the contaminated blocks are grouped into a number of treatment phases where the decontamination in different phases will be carried out serially and the contaminated blocks in the same phase will be carried out in parallel this framework for establishing a network decontamination protocol is developed based on two assumptions 1 the wds network is operating under the demand dependent model that is the pressure for all nodes in the contaminated area are above the service pressure and 2 the wds network is operating under a static system hydraulics the above assumptions are easy to maintain because in a contamination event a no water use warning is often issued to limit the health impact of the contaminated water on the local resident in addition the drainage teams will be operated at the designated location each of which operates at a constant rate of drainage 4 applications the proposed methodology described in section 3 has been applied to a real world water distribution system a number of dmas has been created using the bbpa for the purpose of simplicity while maintaining generality two dmas one root block and one non root block are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology the chlorine in all pipes is assumed to undergo a first order decay the decay constants can be measured by the local water company periodically in this study values for wall decay constant 0 13 day 1 and bulk decay constant 0 06 day 1 are chosen from the test undertook by hallam et al 2002 and west et al 2002 respectively all case studies were performed on an intel core i7 7700 running at 3 6 ghz with four cores in c under ieee standard double precision floating arithmetic ieee 2019 with machine epsilon Îµ m a c h 2 204 10 16 epanet 2 0 rossman 2000 was used as the hydraulic and water quality simulator the details of the two dmas are described in the following subsections it is important to note that the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios can be calculated using 12 searchspace n d o s c n p d n a d n a d n d s where c k n is the number of k combinations from a given set of n elements n d o s is the number of dosage scenarios n a d is the number of available drainage teams n p d is the number of potential drainage locations and n d s is the number of drainage scenarios in addition one limitation of epanet is that it requires the water quality time step and the hydraulic time step to be the same in practice hydraulic time step typically hours is often much greater than the water quality time step typically minutes or seconds moreover a wds without any tanks and pumps only requires one hydraulic simulation this is particularly valid for this study because 1 tanks inside the affected area are normally closed during a contamination event and 2 pumps are operating at a fixed head because the wds is operating at a constant rate of drainage therefore epanet was modified to allow simulations using different hydraulic time step and water quality time step 4 1 non root block dmas the layout of a dma that is not the root block of the wds dma1 is given in fig 3 this dma has 63 pipes and 51 junctions fed by one fixed head reservoir pseudo source there are three forest branches leaf nodes and pipes where fixed drainage locations must be set to the leaf nodes to ensure the disinfection solution can reach these leaf pipes there are 11 possible drainage locations located at the upper and lower parts of the system the minimum nodal pressure requirement for the unknown head nodes is 0 m the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration at all nodes is 50 mg l a number of scenarios are created for this block the number of additional drainage sites range from 3 to 11 with an increment of 1 additional drainage site and the concentration of the disinfectant that is maintained by a qualified disinfection team ranges from 54 mg l to 70 mg l with an increment of 1 mg l there are nine scenarios of different number of additional drainage sites and 17 scenarios of different source disinfectant concentration which in total are 153 scenarios for each of the 153 decontamination scenarios the source disinfectant concentration will be assigned to the pseudo source for the current dma and the drainage rate for each of the selected drainage nodes is the decision variables of the genetic algorithm from 0 to 38 4 m 3 h with a step of 0 075 m 3 h as a result the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios with different number of available dosage teams is shown in table 3 the total simulation time is 12 h with 12 h hydraulic time step and 30 s water quality time step 4 2 root block dma the layout of the dma dma2 that is the root block of the wds is given in fig 4 this dma has 404 pipes and 306 junctions fed by three fixed head reservoirs the placement of the possible drainage locations is determined based on the potential water supply area for each of the three sources this is because the dissolved substances in a wds are predominantly transported by the advection whereas the dispersion is negligible hence the areas that can be potentially impacted by the chemical that is dosed at a particular location can often be analyzed using the breadth first search using the flow direction starting from the source node as the root node a minimum cut set was created for each of the three fixed head reservoirs there are 18 possible drainage locations on the cut set boundaries therefore there are eight possible drainage locations for the left cut set and nine possible drainage locations for the middle cut set and nine possible drainage locations for the right cut set it is worth noting that there are four drainage locations that are shared between the left cut set and the middle cut set and four drainage locations that are shared between the middle cut set and the right cut set the minimum nodal pressure requirement for the unknown head nodes is 0 m the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration at all nodes is 50 mg l a number of scenarios are created for this block the number of additional drainage sites range from 8 to 17 with an increment of 1 additional drainage site and the concentration of the disinfectant that is maintained by a qualified disinfection team ranges from 75 mg l to 125 mg l with an increment of 5 mg l there are ten scenarios of different number of additional drainage sites and 11 scenarios of different source disinfectant concentration which in total are 110 scenarios for each of the 110 decontamination scenarios the drainage rate for each of the selected drainage nodes is ranging from 10 to 48 4 m 3 h with a step of 0 075 m 3 h it is important to note that a different disinfectant concentration can be assigned to each of the water sources which will increase the dimension of the solution space from three disinfectant concentration at all three sources number of drainage points and one of the objectives to five disinfectant concentration at each of the three sources number of drainage points and one of the objectives for the purpose of illustration the authors have used the same disinfectant concentration at all three sources the use of which allows the presentation of the results as a 3 d surface as a result the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios with different number of available dosage teams is shown in table 3 the total simulation time is 12 h with 12 h hydraulic time step and 1 min water quality time step a genetic algorithm was used to find o 1 the minimum time to fill the network with the minimum disinfectant concentration and o 2 and o 3 the minimum amount of water drained and minimum amount of disinfectant used for both case studies the ga parameters used for this dma1 and dma2 are shown in table 4 4 3 real life network in addition to the detailed examples of the two dmas wolf cordera network from colorado springs lippai 2005 is used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology it is important to note that the forest pipes in the wolf cordera network are removed to reduce the number of fixed drainage locations the layout of the modified wolf cordera network is given in fig 5 this network has 947 pipes 1153 junctions fed by four fixed head reservoirs which has been partitioned into 17 dmas each of which is highlighted in a different color as shown in fig 5 the detail results for each of the 17 dmas can be found in the supplemental data 5 results and discussion figs 6 7 show the trade off between the choices of the number of additional drainage sites and the disinfectant concentration at the source and one of the three objectives o 1 in fig 6a o 2 in fig 7b and o 3 in fig 7a for the dma 1 figs 6b and c show the corresponding o 2 and o 3 values when optimizing o 1 and fig 7c shows the corresponding o 1 values when optimizing o 2 and o 3 it is worth noting that o 2 and o 3 collapse into a single objective for the continuous feed method used in this study figs 8 9 show the trade off between the choices of the number of additional drainage sites and the disinfectant concentration at the source and one of the three objectives o 1 in fig 8a o 2 in fig 9b and o 3 in fig 9a for dma2 figs 8b and c show the corresponding o 2 and o 3 values when optimizing o 1 and fig 9c shows the corresponding o 1 values when optimizing o 2 and o 3 it is evident from figs 6a and 8a that the time that is required to fill the network with the minimum disinfectant concentration decreases as 1 the disinfectant concentration at the source increases because the disinfectant concentration at any point of a network is a linear superposition of the disinfectant transported from all sources the time to fill a network with the required disinfectant concentration will always be decreasing as the source concentration increases this effect is not always reflected in the simulation because the time reduction might be smaller than the water quality time step 2 the number of drainage locations increases this is because the higher number of drainage locations the higher average flow rate in the system hence the number of drainage location is directly associated with the advection rate note that this effect is bounded above by the source elevation for a gravity fed wds and the source elevation and the pump head for a wds with pumps it can be seen from figs 6b and 8b that the volume of water that is drained from the system decreases as the source disinfectant concentration increases this can also be explained by 1 above however the volume of water that is drained from the system decreases as the number of additional drainage sites decreases for the dma dma1 that is not the root block of the system whereas increases as the number of additional drainage sites decreases for the dma dma2 that is the root block of the system this is because the possible drainage locations for dma dma1 shown in fig 3 are clustered in two areas upper and lower parts of the dma and the possible drainage locations for dma dma2 shown in fig 4 are scattered around the potential supply areas for the three reservoirs as a result increasing the number of drainage locations for the dma dma2 shown in fig 4 allows the easy transportation of the water to some area which removes the bottleneck of the problem thereby significantly reduce the total drainage rate of the system meanwhile increasing the number of drainage locations for the dma dma1 shown in fig 3 will inevitably increase the advection rate as explained in 2 above however this was achieved by increasing the amount of total drainage of the system it is observed in figs 6c and 8c that the relationship between the amount of disinfectant used and the number of additional drainage sites is the same as the relationship between the amount of water drained and the number of additional drainage sites fig 6c shows there is a reverse relationship between the disinfectant used and the water drained when the number of additional drainage sites is high whereas this relationship is not observed when the number of additional drainage sites is small this is because the disinfectant concentration at the source has less effect on the amount of water drained when the number of additional drainage in system is high hence the disinfectant concentration at the source dominates the o 3 as shown in eq 9 as the number of additional drainage decreases the amount of water that is required to be drained from the system decreases significantly as the disinfectant concentration at source increases couple the decrease drainage with the increase disinfectant concentration at source the above mentioned reverse relationship disappears for the case when the number of additional drainage sites is small from figs 7a and b it is evident that for the dma1 the number of additional drainage sites has insignificant impact on both the amount of disinfectant used and the amount of water drained whereas both of which decrease significantly as the disinfectant concentration at the source increases from fig 7c a clear relationship is not observed this is because for the dma1 the drainage rate dominates the objective o 2 eq 9 the relationship that is observed in fig 7b can also be seen in fig 9b whereas a reversed relationship is observed in fig 9c this is because for the dma2 the disinfectant concentration at the source dominates the objective o 2 at the same time the disinfection time decreases as the disinfectant concentration at the source decreases and as the number of additional drainage sites decreases as shown in fig 9a finally it is shown that by using the pre optimized scenarios for each of the dmas for a wds a network decontamination plan can be readily assembled in real time three contamination cases shown in table 5 were investigated to demonstrate how to assemble a decontamination plan in real time cases i and ii investigate single dma decontamination event and case iii explores a multiple dma decontamination event for a single dma decontamination figs 10a and b show the feasible region of all the decisions that can be made by a water authority to produce a feasible decontamination plan that satisfies the constraints specified for case i and case ii respectively for a multiple dma decontamination there are four shared variables the disinfection time the disinfectant used the number of drainage teams and the amount of water drained for serialdecontamination the disinfection time the disinfectant used and the amount of water drained will be dynamically allocated to each of the dmas and the number of available drainage teams can be maximally utilized for each of the dmas for parallel decontamination the number of available drainage teams the disinfectant used and the amount of water drained will be dynamically allocated to each of the dmas and the disinfection time is bounded above by the worst dma typically the root dma in case iii there are 13 drainage teams that can be utilized by the water authority which are shared by the two dmas as a result there are six ways to allocate the available drainage teams to one of the two dmas the feasible region for all the decisions that can be made by a water authority to produce a feasible decontamination plan for each of the six drainage team allocation methods subject to the constraints that are defined for case iii is shown in fig 10c 6 conclusion this paper presents a framework for planning the decontamination stage of a water distribution system there are four steps that are involved in the proposed methodology 1 the network is partitioned into a number of hydraulically independent dmas using bridge block partitioning algorithm 2 a number of disinfection scenarios are generated 3 a ga is then used to optimize for different objectives for each of the scenarios generated and 4 a decontamination plan can be readily assembled in real time for both single dma contamination and multiple dma contamination two one dma a root block and a child block of the root block contamination events and one two dma contamination event were used as case studies to demonstrate the use of the proposed framework the results show that given a list of resource constraints the proposed methodology was able to find the feasible region by using the solution regions for each disinfection scenario it is noted that cost functions for the drainage teams deployment the dosage team deployment the disinfectant used the water drained either treatment cost or water usage cost and the impact metrics for water outage are not yet considered in the proposed framework in addition a more generalized case with multiple dma contamination event that requires a complex resources sharing between different dma should also be considered in the future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18053,water distribution system contamination events caused by intentional negligent or accidental intrusion of biological chemical or radioactive contaminants have significant impacts on the health of the populations that it services therefore it is important to have an effective plan that can be readily implemented to minimize the impact of these contamination events however limited research has been focused on strategic planning of the decontamination process of the contaminated infrastructure this paper proposed a framework for assembling a disinfection plan in real time by 1 partitioning a wds into a number of district metered areas dmas 2 generating a solution region for each of the dmas and 3 assemble an effective decontamination plan using solution region generated this framework has been applied to three contamination events the results show that when planning for the decontamination stage of a contamination event the use of the proposed framework can 1 significantly reduce the response time 2 improve the quality of the decontamination plan and 3 provide a model for optimizing the resource allocation graphical abstract image 1 keywords water distribution system water quality contamination decontamination framework decontamination resource allocation 1 introduction water distribution systems wdss are critical municipal infrastructures that deliver potable water from water sources to end users the quality of water that transported within a wds underpins the health and well being of its service population the health of hundreds of thousands of residents can be affected by intentional negligent or accidental network contamination as shown in table 1 this situation will only be aggravated due to the ever increasing rate of urbanization it has been set out by the united state environmental protection agency 2018 and the israeli minister of health regulation 2013 that in the case of network contamination there are three stages for restoring a contaminated wds to its normal state contamination detection and investigation stage operational response stage and remediation and recovery stage the focus of the contamination detection and investigation stage is the timely detection of the presence of the contaminants within a wds this is normally achieved through the development of a contamination warning system cws by strategically placing water quality sensors the number of water quality sensors that can be deployed throughout a wds determines the lower bound for the minimum detection time although it is always the best solution to install a water quality sensor at each node of a wds it is well above the budget of water utility companies thereby a tremendous amount of research efforts have been given to the topic of finding the optimal water quality sensor placement using a limited number of water quality sensors there are a number of objectives for the water quality sensor placement optimization 1 time of detection kessler et al 1998 2 demand coverage lee and deininger 1992 3 population exposed berry et al 2005 4 total length of contaminated pipes watson et al 2004 5 detection likelihood ostfeld and salomons 2006 6 contamination risk weickgenannt et al 2010 7 volume consumed kessler et al 1998 and 8 contamination probability variations he et al 2018 there are a number of attempts made to solve the problem by using different optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms eas ostfeld and salomons 2004 heuristic james r chastain 2005 and integer programming berry et al 2007 these optimization processes are always time intensive due to the size of a real life wds network skeletonization perelman et al 2008 and clustering perelman and ostfeld 2013 have been used to simplify the size of a network to speed up the optimization process both of which significantly reduces the solution space while providing a very close estimation of the true solution the next step after the cws of a wds has been triggered is to identify the time and source of the contamination and prevent additional contamination islam et al 1997 presented an inverse solution method for calculating the chlorine concentration at the source s in a wds which is also applicable to other chemical and biological solutions it has been pointed out by preis and ostfeld 2006 that it is only useable for an event based situation where the number of unknowns equals the number of equations later laird et al 2005 reformulated the inverse problem as a least square minimization with differential and algebraic constraints and used nonlinear programming to solve for the time and location of the contamination sources this reformulation of the problem has been improved by preis and ostfeld 2006 in which a model tree is trained to replace the hydraulic model and the linear rules classification structures of this trained model tree are used by a linear programming solver to identify the time and location of the contamination sources the solutions of source identification problem are often not unique due to the under determined nature of the problem liu et al 2011 proposed a new approach called adaptive dynamic optimization technique adopt that iteratively evaluates and identifies solutions that minimize the predication error that is associated with the non uniqueness of the source identification problem it is reported by liu et al 2011 that adopt is limited to wds contamination events with 1 single injection location 2 non reactive contaminant 3 perfectly defined hydraulic model the uncertainty in the hydraulic data of the contamination source identification problem one of the above limitations has been explored by preis and ostfeld 2011 the contamination area and the approximated time of injections were found for three example case studies in which demands at each node are assumed to be uniformly distributed between its maximum and minimum anticipated demands however it is suggested by preis and ostfeld 2011 that a more complex randomization may be used to reveal additional information on another note the bayesian probability based method starts gaining attractions since its first application to the contamination source identification problem by dawsey et al 2006 some of the recent developments include incorporation of the hierarchical tree structure to model the observation probability distribution wang and zhou 2017 and use continuous probability that is represented by beta binomial conjugate pairs yang and boccelli 2014 however it is summarized by seth et al 2016 that the bayesian probability based method 1 performs poorly when there are multiple contaminant injections 2 exhibits accuracy problems when given a large amount of false negative measurements and 3 does not explicitly consider the connections between sensors and candidate nodes operational response stage will start once sufficient information on the contamination has been gathered through the investigation process the main step that is involved in this stage is the operation responses that water utility companies must take to limit the spread of the contaminants and minimize the impact on the customers and wds the time and source of the contamination that are identified in the last stage are used here to estimate the spread of the contaminants and isolating the contaminated section of the network this can be done by using the hydraulic result from either the steady state analysis of the contaminated wds clark et al 1988 1993 or the real time flow direction data from supervisory control and data acquisition scada system davidson et al 2005 the public and customers within this isolated contaminated area must be notified in addition drinking water use restriction may be applied base on the severity of the contamination finally remediation and recovery stage will be initialized to restore the wds to normal operations for chemical related event preis and ostfeld 2008 and physical related event zhang et al 2020 this stage includes 1 removal of the contaminated water from the system for disposal or treatment and 2 decontamination of contaminated infrastructure preis and ostfeld 2008 proposed a model that minimizes both the number of field operations and contaminated water consumed by the public due to the competing nature of the two proposed objectives they employed the non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to identify the trade off between the two aforementioned objectives which can be used to guide the network operators to make informed decisions during network contamination events a similar attempt has also been made by alfonso et al 2010 in which the two competing objectives 1 damage to public health associated with the network contamination and 2 the costs associated with the network operations required to restore the wds to service are treated as separate objectives in a multi objective optimization and combined into one objective in a single objective optimization normally flushing is used as the first response action that water utilities implement to address water quality concerns after network flushing network disinfection is required except for low risk contamination event current regulations set forth by new zealand ministry of health 2014 national environmental engineering research institute 2009 united state environmental protection agency 2018 water services association of australia 2011 and israeli minister of health regulation 2013 define c t value as the decision variable based on the characteristics of the contaminated section of the network where c is the concentration of the disinfectant solution and t is contact time of the said disinfectant solution despite the importance of strategically planning the decontamination stage of a wds limited research has studied this particular area this is because both the hydraulic of the wds the location of the drainage points and the amount of water drained through each drainage point and the water quality of the system location of the disinfectant injection points and the amount of disinfectant used are decision variables during the wds network decontamination stage water utility companies are incentivized to minimize all of the four decision variables above while maintaining an acceptable time for network decontamination in addition different district metered areas dmas of a wds can have different restoration priorities which add an extra layer of complexity to the problem to address the problem mentioned above this study proposes a comprehensive framework for efficiently disinfecting a contaminated network which can be used to guide the actions that can be undertaken by water utility companies during a contamination event the proposed framework is based on partitioning the wds graph into a number of subgraphs using bridge block partitioning algorithm bbpa qiu et al 2019 it has been shown in qiu et al 2019 that the steady state demand driven hydraulic solution of a block can be solved independently from that of the other blocks after the partitioning the main focus of this paper is to generate an optimized disinfection plan for each of the disinfection scenarios for each of the dmas created using the bbpa for the dmas that are identified as contaminated in the contamination detection and investigation stage water authorities can readily assemble a master disinfection plan by choosing a plan for a disinfection scenario for each of the contaminated dmas subject to the resource availability number of disinfectant injection teams the number of drainage teams the disinfectant available the amount of drainage allowed and maximum time to disinfect and constraints it is important to point out that the decontamination process can be carried out serially one dma at a time in parallel all contaminated dmas at the same time or hybridly a number of contaminated dmas at the same time it is worth noting that an earlier version of this paper was presented at the 16th conference on water distribution system analysis wdsa 2014 ostfeld and salomons 2014 unlike the framework proposed in the current study the paper presented in the wdsa 2014 did not taken 1 chemical decay 2 different source chemical concentration 3 decontamination plan assembly at real time or 4 multiple water sources into consideration this paper is organized as followed a description of the general wds hydraulic and disinfection problem is given in the next section this is followed by the methodology that is proposed in this paper section 4 describes the case study networks the results are discussed in section 5 the last section offers some conclusions 2 general wds hydraulic and disinfection problem this section describes the general wds disinfection problem the solution process of the disinfection problem of wdss consists of two steps 1 finding the steady state hydraulic solution of a wds network and 2 finding the water quality solution of the wds network using the hydraulic solution found in the previous step 2 1 definitions and notation consider a water distribution system that contains n p pipes n j junctions and n r fixed head nodes the j t h pipe of the network can be characterized by its diameter d j length l j and resistance factor r j the i t h node of the network has two properties its nodal demand d i and its elevation head z i let q q 1 q 2 q n p t denote the vector of unknown flows of the wds h h 1 h 2 h n j t denote the vector of unknown heads of the wds r r 1 r 2 r n p t denote the vector of resistance factors d d 1 d 2 d n j t denote the vector of nodal demands e l e l 1 e l 2 e l n r t denote the vector of fixed head elevations c c 1 c 2 c n p t denote the vector of unknown pipe concentrations of the dissolved substance where c i is the concentrations of the dissolved substance at location x and time t and u u 1 u 2 u n p t denote the vector of unknown pipe flow velocities denote by g q r n p n p a diagonal square matrix with elements g j j r j q j n 1 for j 1 2 n p denote by f q r n p n p a diagonal square matrix where the j th element on its diagonal f j j d d q j g j j q j the matrix a 1 is the full rank unknown head node arc incidence matrix the matrix a 2 is the fixed head node arc incidence matrix 2 2 hydraulic solution and water quality solution of the problem the steady state flows and heads in a wds are modeled by 1 g q a 1 a 1 t o q h a 2 e l d 0 this non linear system is often solved by the newton method in which q m 1 and h m 1 are repeatedly computed from q m and h m by 2 f m q m a 1 a 1 t o q m 1 q m h m 1 h m g m q m a 1 h m a 2 e l a 1 t q m d until the relative differences q m 1 q m q m 1 and h m 1 h m h m 1 are sufficiently small a water quality model for a wds estimates the time profile of the concentration of the dissolved substance for all points of the network given the location and initial concentration of the dosage points and the hydraulic information of the system there are two steps involved in a water quality model the transport and the decay of the dissolved substance 2 2 1 chemical transportation the transport of the dissolved substance in a wds is modeled by 1 the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow that traverses in a pipe is conserved and this mass conservation is modeled by 1 d advection equation 3 d c i d t u i d c i d x 0 and 2 the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow enters a node equals the mass of the dissolved substance in the flow exits a node and this mass conservation is modeled by 4 i e i n q i c i x l i q k c k j e o u t q j c j x 0 where e i n is the set of edges that carry the flow into node k e o u t is the set of edges that carry the flow out of node k c i x l i is the concentration of the dissolved substance at the point that is x from the start of pipe i q k is the flow that is injected from external source into node k and c k is the concentration of the dissolved substance from the external source into node k 2 2 2 chemical decay the first order chemical decay equation 5 d c i d t k c i is used in this study to model the decay of the dissolved substance where k is the first order decay constant this overall decay constant is 6 k k w k b where k b is the bulk first order decay constant and k w is the wall first order decay constant both the bulk and wall decay constants can be estimated by performing experiments bottle test for the bulk decay constant and in situ test for the wall decay constant 3 methodology the steps that are involved in the proposed methodology are shown in fig 1 the proposed method is a multi variants drainage locations the amount of water drained at each drainage location the concentration of the disinfectant at dosage point time series water quality simulation with multiple objectives minimum filling time minimum amount of water drained and minimum disinfectant used subject to the hydraulic and quality constraints minimum pressure at each node and minimum disinfectant concentration in the network the steps of the proposed methodology can be categorized into the following stages network partitioning use network partitioning algorithm to partition a wds network into a number of hydraulic and water quality independent district metered areas dmas disinfection scenario generation generate a number of scenarios number of drainage locations and the concentration of the disinfectant at source node for each dma of the network disinfection scenario optimization optimize each of the scenarios generated for each dma of the network to identify the optimal locations of the drainage locations and the drainage rate at each drainage location disinfection plan creation a master disinfection plan can be created by selecting a plan for each of the dmas from the disinfection scenario optimization stage and assemble the selected plans the following sub sections describe each stage of the methodology 3 1 network partitioning network partitioning is a necessary step for the planning of disinfection after a network contamination event this is because network contamination events are often associated with uncertainties for example the location and mass of contaminant injected and the spread of the contaminant this uncertain nature of contamination events causes different contamination event to become a different scenario each of which requires a different action to decontaminate 3 1 1 block cut tree the graph component that is associated with a wds can be described as g v e where v is the set of all nodes of the graph g and e is the set of all pipes of the graph g a cut vertex is a node in the wds graph the removal of which increases the number of connected components a block is a maximal connected sub graph any connected graph can be decomposed into a tree of biconnected components called the block cut bc tree of the graph g diestel 2005 due to the weighted and directed nature of a wds graph the bc tree of a wds is rooted and all water sources must be a part of the root block and every other block has a single cut vertex that behaves as a pseudo source qiu et al 2019 the level of a block b i in a rooted bc tree is the length of the unique path composed of blocks from the root block to the current block b i the parent of block b i is the block connected to block b i on the path to the root block block b j is an end block of graph g if it does not have a child block all water must flow from the root block to the end blocks an example of the block cut tree for a looped water distribution system is given in fig 2 the wds network in fig 2a has 11 unknown head nodes 1 11 17 pipes 1 17 and two fixed head nodes s1 and s2 it is possible to identify the cut vertices nodes 3 4 and 6 for this simple network by visual inspection the wds network in fig 2a can be partitioned into four blocks after the identification of the cut vertices it is worth noting that the function of cut vertices in its parent block is different from that in its child block a cut vertex is considered to be a demand node in its parent block and to be a pseudo source in its child block the four blocks of this simple network are shown in table 2 as can be seen from table 2 and fig 2b the root block of the system b 1 which has block level l 0 consists of seven pipes 1 6 17 four nodes 1 4 two sources s1 and s2 two child blocks b 2 and b 3 and no parent block two blocks have block level l 1 blocks b 2 and b 3 b 2 consists of three pipes 7 9 two nodes 5 6 one pseudo source 4 one child block b 4 and one parent block b 1 b 3 which is one of the end blocks of the system consists of four pipes 13 16 three nodes 9 11 one pseudo source 3 one parent block b 1 and no child block finally there is one block that has block level l 2 b 4 b 4 which is the other end blocks of the system consists of three pipes 10 12 two nodes 7 8 one pseudo source 6 one parent block b 2 and no child block it has been shown in qiu et al 2019 that the demand driven steady state hydraulic solution for each block of a wds system can be solved independently after obtaining the hydraulic solution of a block it is possible to perform the water quality simulation for that block this is because both the chemical transportation equations eq 3 and 4 and the chemical decay equation eq 5 are functions of pipe flows and time for both the contaminant and the disinfectant a block is contaminated once the contaminant reaches the articulation point of this block therefore the contaminated section that is isolated from the wds is from each of the source block s where the contaminant is placed to the parent block of the first descendant block of the source block where no contaminant is detected at its articulation point for the same example shown in fig 2 if a source of contamination is placed at node 5 the source block b 2 is contaminated the child block of the source block b 3 may be contaminated depends on the time of detection and blocks b 1 and b 4 are not contaminated thus the disinfection of the network can be planned during the wds design stage for each block of the wds a disinfection strategy can be easily assembled using the plan for each of the blocks in the contaminated section of the network assuming blocks b 2 and b 3 in fig 2 are both contaminated a disinfection strategy that is tailored for this particular contamination event can be assembled in real time using the disinfection plans for blocks b 2 and b 3 3 2 disinfection scenarios generation a number of disinfection scenarios are generated for each block of a wds it is assumed that the disinfection solution is continuously injected at the source node s and water is drained at some of the drainage locations that are pre selected by the water utility companies it has been mentioned in the last subsection that all physical water source s of a wds are in the root block of the bc tree and all other blocks have a pseudo source that is the cut vertex which connects the current block to its parent block as a result the blocks of a wds can be grouped into a block with multiple water sources and blocks with a single water source a number of scenarios are created for each block of the system each of which has a different number of drainage locations and or different disinfectant concentration at source s take block b 4 shown in fig 2 as an example there are 2 demand nodes 7 and 8 in this block both of which can be used as drainage locations in addition the water utility company can dispatch two drainage teams to this block thus there are three drainage scenarios two drainage teams for both drainage points or one drainage team for each of the two drainage points moreover the dosing team dispatched to pseudo source 6 can inject the disinfection solution which raises the concentration of the disinfectant to between 55 mg l to 65 mg l with an increment of 1 mg l thus there are ten dosage scenarios couple both dosage scenarios and drainage scenarios there are a total of 30 disinfection scenarios for this block 3 3 disinfection scenarios optimization 3 3 1 objective functions there are three main objectives in this optimization problem for each disinfection scenario for each of the dmas objective o 1 is the total time required to fill the wds network with the desired disinfectant concentration the minimization of which reduces the impact of network closure on the public objective o 1 can be expressed as 7 min t c r where c r is the minimum disinfectant concentration required for network decontamination and t i is the time required for c m i n t i i objective o 2 is the total amount of water drained from the network the minimization of which reduces the amount of water that needs to be disposed of or treated objective o 2 can be expressed as 8 min t c r i v d n d i where v d n is the set of all drainage nodes in the wds objective o 3 is the total amount of disinfectant used in this stage the minimization of which reduces the cost associated with the amount of disinfectant used objective o 3 can be expressed as 9 min i v s n q i t c r c i 0 where v s n is the set of all disinfectant dosing points q i is the outflow from node i and c i 0 is the initial disinfectant concentration at node i 3 3 2 constraints objectives o 1 o 3 are achieved through selecting drainage locations from a pool of possible drainage locations based on the number of available drainage teams after which a drainage amount is assigned to each of the drainage locations the resulting steady state flows hydraulic simulation distribute the disinfectant solution throughout the wds water quality simulation eq 2 is used to perform steady state demand driven hydraulic simulation subject to pressure constraint 10 p i p i 0 i v where p i is the pressure at node i and p i 0 is the minimum pressure at node i eqs 3 5 are used to perform the water quality simulation using the steady state demand driven hydraulic result subject to water quality constraint 11 c m i n t c r c r where c m i n t is the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration in the network at the time t 3 4 real time network decontamination plan assembly after each of the disinfection scenarios defined in 3 2 are optimized using the objective functions defined in 3 3 for each of the blocks identified in 3 1 the water utility companies can readily create an efficient master disinfection plan by selecting a plan for each of the contaminated blocks and assembling the selected plans there are three ways to assemble the decontamination plan for a wds in parallel serially or hybridly in the parallel approach each of the contaminated blocks is disinfected simultaneously to achieve maximum efficiency it is important to note that the disinfectant concentration at all nodes in all contaminated blocks must satisfy eq 11 at the same time this is because all water sources are located in the top block of a wds sealing a block of wds after the minimum concentration of the disinfectant has been reached will isolate the water supply from all its descendant blocks as a result a block can only be sealed after the minimum disinfectant concentration for all of its descendant blocks have been reached in the serial approach each block is disinfected separately from end blocks to the root blocks this approach is particularly useful when the number of drainage teams and the number of dosage teams are limited in addition it is also possible to assign a different priority to each of the contaminated blocks which allows blocks with different priorities to be disinfected at a different rate alternatively it is also possible to construct a hybrid plan to maximally utilize the resources that are available to the water utilities in this case the contaminated blocks are grouped into a number of treatment phases where the decontamination in different phases will be carried out serially and the contaminated blocks in the same phase will be carried out in parallel this framework for establishing a network decontamination protocol is developed based on two assumptions 1 the wds network is operating under the demand dependent model that is the pressure for all nodes in the contaminated area are above the service pressure and 2 the wds network is operating under a static system hydraulics the above assumptions are easy to maintain because in a contamination event a no water use warning is often issued to limit the health impact of the contaminated water on the local resident in addition the drainage teams will be operated at the designated location each of which operates at a constant rate of drainage 4 applications the proposed methodology described in section 3 has been applied to a real world water distribution system a number of dmas has been created using the bbpa for the purpose of simplicity while maintaining generality two dmas one root block and one non root block are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology the chlorine in all pipes is assumed to undergo a first order decay the decay constants can be measured by the local water company periodically in this study values for wall decay constant 0 13 day 1 and bulk decay constant 0 06 day 1 are chosen from the test undertook by hallam et al 2002 and west et al 2002 respectively all case studies were performed on an intel core i7 7700 running at 3 6 ghz with four cores in c under ieee standard double precision floating arithmetic ieee 2019 with machine epsilon Îµ m a c h 2 204 10 16 epanet 2 0 rossman 2000 was used as the hydraulic and water quality simulator the details of the two dmas are described in the following subsections it is important to note that the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios can be calculated using 12 searchspace n d o s c n p d n a d n a d n d s where c k n is the number of k combinations from a given set of n elements n d o s is the number of dosage scenarios n a d is the number of available drainage teams n p d is the number of potential drainage locations and n d s is the number of drainage scenarios in addition one limitation of epanet is that it requires the water quality time step and the hydraulic time step to be the same in practice hydraulic time step typically hours is often much greater than the water quality time step typically minutes or seconds moreover a wds without any tanks and pumps only requires one hydraulic simulation this is particularly valid for this study because 1 tanks inside the affected area are normally closed during a contamination event and 2 pumps are operating at a fixed head because the wds is operating at a constant rate of drainage therefore epanet was modified to allow simulations using different hydraulic time step and water quality time step 4 1 non root block dmas the layout of a dma that is not the root block of the wds dma1 is given in fig 3 this dma has 63 pipes and 51 junctions fed by one fixed head reservoir pseudo source there are three forest branches leaf nodes and pipes where fixed drainage locations must be set to the leaf nodes to ensure the disinfection solution can reach these leaf pipes there are 11 possible drainage locations located at the upper and lower parts of the system the minimum nodal pressure requirement for the unknown head nodes is 0 m the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration at all nodes is 50 mg l a number of scenarios are created for this block the number of additional drainage sites range from 3 to 11 with an increment of 1 additional drainage site and the concentration of the disinfectant that is maintained by a qualified disinfection team ranges from 54 mg l to 70 mg l with an increment of 1 mg l there are nine scenarios of different number of additional drainage sites and 17 scenarios of different source disinfectant concentration which in total are 153 scenarios for each of the 153 decontamination scenarios the source disinfectant concentration will be assigned to the pseudo source for the current dma and the drainage rate for each of the selected drainage nodes is the decision variables of the genetic algorithm from 0 to 38 4 m 3 h with a step of 0 075 m 3 h as a result the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios with different number of available dosage teams is shown in table 3 the total simulation time is 12 h with 12 h hydraulic time step and 30 s water quality time step 4 2 root block dma the layout of the dma dma2 that is the root block of the wds is given in fig 4 this dma has 404 pipes and 306 junctions fed by three fixed head reservoirs the placement of the possible drainage locations is determined based on the potential water supply area for each of the three sources this is because the dissolved substances in a wds are predominantly transported by the advection whereas the dispersion is negligible hence the areas that can be potentially impacted by the chemical that is dosed at a particular location can often be analyzed using the breadth first search using the flow direction starting from the source node as the root node a minimum cut set was created for each of the three fixed head reservoirs there are 18 possible drainage locations on the cut set boundaries therefore there are eight possible drainage locations for the left cut set and nine possible drainage locations for the middle cut set and nine possible drainage locations for the right cut set it is worth noting that there are four drainage locations that are shared between the left cut set and the middle cut set and four drainage locations that are shared between the middle cut set and the right cut set the minimum nodal pressure requirement for the unknown head nodes is 0 m the minimum nodal disinfectant concentration at all nodes is 50 mg l a number of scenarios are created for this block the number of additional drainage sites range from 8 to 17 with an increment of 1 additional drainage site and the concentration of the disinfectant that is maintained by a qualified disinfection team ranges from 75 mg l to 125 mg l with an increment of 5 mg l there are ten scenarios of different number of additional drainage sites and 11 scenarios of different source disinfectant concentration which in total are 110 scenarios for each of the 110 decontamination scenarios the drainage rate for each of the selected drainage nodes is ranging from 10 to 48 4 m 3 h with a step of 0 075 m 3 h it is important to note that a different disinfectant concentration can be assigned to each of the water sources which will increase the dimension of the solution space from three disinfectant concentration at all three sources number of drainage points and one of the objectives to five disinfectant concentration at each of the three sources number of drainage points and one of the objectives for the purpose of illustration the authors have used the same disinfectant concentration at all three sources the use of which allows the presentation of the results as a 3 d surface as a result the total search space for each of the decontamination scenarios with different number of available dosage teams is shown in table 3 the total simulation time is 12 h with 12 h hydraulic time step and 1 min water quality time step a genetic algorithm was used to find o 1 the minimum time to fill the network with the minimum disinfectant concentration and o 2 and o 3 the minimum amount of water drained and minimum amount of disinfectant used for both case studies the ga parameters used for this dma1 and dma2 are shown in table 4 4 3 real life network in addition to the detailed examples of the two dmas wolf cordera network from colorado springs lippai 2005 is used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology it is important to note that the forest pipes in the wolf cordera network are removed to reduce the number of fixed drainage locations the layout of the modified wolf cordera network is given in fig 5 this network has 947 pipes 1153 junctions fed by four fixed head reservoirs which has been partitioned into 17 dmas each of which is highlighted in a different color as shown in fig 5 the detail results for each of the 17 dmas can be found in the supplemental data 5 results and discussion figs 6 7 show the trade off between the choices of the number of additional drainage sites and the disinfectant concentration at the source and one of the three objectives o 1 in fig 6a o 2 in fig 7b and o 3 in fig 7a for the dma 1 figs 6b and c show the corresponding o 2 and o 3 values when optimizing o 1 and fig 7c shows the corresponding o 1 values when optimizing o 2 and o 3 it is worth noting that o 2 and o 3 collapse into a single objective for the continuous feed method used in this study figs 8 9 show the trade off between the choices of the number of additional drainage sites and the disinfectant concentration at the source and one of the three objectives o 1 in fig 8a o 2 in fig 9b and o 3 in fig 9a for dma2 figs 8b and c show the corresponding o 2 and o 3 values when optimizing o 1 and fig 9c shows the corresponding o 1 values when optimizing o 2 and o 3 it is evident from figs 6a and 8a that the time that is required to fill the network with the minimum disinfectant concentration decreases as 1 the disinfectant concentration at the source increases because the disinfectant concentration at any point of a network is a linear superposition of the disinfectant transported from all sources the time to fill a network with the required disinfectant concentration will always be decreasing as the source concentration increases this effect is not always reflected in the simulation because the time reduction might be smaller than the water quality time step 2 the number of drainage locations increases this is because the higher number of drainage locations the higher average flow rate in the system hence the number of drainage location is directly associated with the advection rate note that this effect is bounded above by the source elevation for a gravity fed wds and the source elevation and the pump head for a wds with pumps it can be seen from figs 6b and 8b that the volume of water that is drained from the system decreases as the source disinfectant concentration increases this can also be explained by 1 above however the volume of water that is drained from the system decreases as the number of additional drainage sites decreases for the dma dma1 that is not the root block of the system whereas increases as the number of additional drainage sites decreases for the dma dma2 that is the root block of the system this is because the possible drainage locations for dma dma1 shown in fig 3 are clustered in two areas upper and lower parts of the dma and the possible drainage locations for dma dma2 shown in fig 4 are scattered around the potential supply areas for the three reservoirs as a result increasing the number of drainage locations for the dma dma2 shown in fig 4 allows the easy transportation of the water to some area which removes the bottleneck of the problem thereby significantly reduce the total drainage rate of the system meanwhile increasing the number of drainage locations for the dma dma1 shown in fig 3 will inevitably increase the advection rate as explained in 2 above however this was achieved by increasing the amount of total drainage of the system it is observed in figs 6c and 8c that the relationship between the amount of disinfectant used and the number of additional drainage sites is the same as the relationship between the amount of water drained and the number of additional drainage sites fig 6c shows there is a reverse relationship between the disinfectant used and the water drained when the number of additional drainage sites is high whereas this relationship is not observed when the number of additional drainage sites is small this is because the disinfectant concentration at the source has less effect on the amount of water drained when the number of additional drainage in system is high hence the disinfectant concentration at the source dominates the o 3 as shown in eq 9 as the number of additional drainage decreases the amount of water that is required to be drained from the system decreases significantly as the disinfectant concentration at source increases couple the decrease drainage with the increase disinfectant concentration at source the above mentioned reverse relationship disappears for the case when the number of additional drainage sites is small from figs 7a and b it is evident that for the dma1 the number of additional drainage sites has insignificant impact on both the amount of disinfectant used and the amount of water drained whereas both of which decrease significantly as the disinfectant concentration at the source increases from fig 7c a clear relationship is not observed this is because for the dma1 the drainage rate dominates the objective o 2 eq 9 the relationship that is observed in fig 7b can also be seen in fig 9b whereas a reversed relationship is observed in fig 9c this is because for the dma2 the disinfectant concentration at the source dominates the objective o 2 at the same time the disinfection time decreases as the disinfectant concentration at the source decreases and as the number of additional drainage sites decreases as shown in fig 9a finally it is shown that by using the pre optimized scenarios for each of the dmas for a wds a network decontamination plan can be readily assembled in real time three contamination cases shown in table 5 were investigated to demonstrate how to assemble a decontamination plan in real time cases i and ii investigate single dma decontamination event and case iii explores a multiple dma decontamination event for a single dma decontamination figs 10a and b show the feasible region of all the decisions that can be made by a water authority to produce a feasible decontamination plan that satisfies the constraints specified for case i and case ii respectively for a multiple dma decontamination there are four shared variables the disinfection time the disinfectant used the number of drainage teams and the amount of water drained for serialdecontamination the disinfection time the disinfectant used and the amount of water drained will be dynamically allocated to each of the dmas and the number of available drainage teams can be maximally utilized for each of the dmas for parallel decontamination the number of available drainage teams the disinfectant used and the amount of water drained will be dynamically allocated to each of the dmas and the disinfection time is bounded above by the worst dma typically the root dma in case iii there are 13 drainage teams that can be utilized by the water authority which are shared by the two dmas as a result there are six ways to allocate the available drainage teams to one of the two dmas the feasible region for all the decisions that can be made by a water authority to produce a feasible decontamination plan for each of the six drainage team allocation methods subject to the constraints that are defined for case iii is shown in fig 10c 6 conclusion this paper presents a framework for planning the decontamination stage of a water distribution system there are four steps that are involved in the proposed methodology 1 the network is partitioned into a number of hydraulically independent dmas using bridge block partitioning algorithm 2 a number of disinfection scenarios are generated 3 a ga is then used to optimize for different objectives for each of the scenarios generated and 4 a decontamination plan can be readily assembled in real time for both single dma contamination and multiple dma contamination two one dma a root block and a child block of the root block contamination events and one two dma contamination event were used as case studies to demonstrate the use of the proposed framework the results show that given a list of resource constraints the proposed methodology was able to find the feasible region by using the solution regions for each disinfection scenario it is noted that cost functions for the drainage teams deployment the dosage team deployment the disinfectant used the water drained either treatment cost or water usage cost and the impact metrics for water outage are not yet considered in the proposed framework in addition a more generalized case with multiple dma contamination event that requires a complex resources sharing between different dma should also be considered in the future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18054,nitrate removal efficiency of aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d process was elevated by enhancing the methanol linked synergy in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio after 140 days enrichment the nitrate removal rate increased significantly from 3 to 4 mg n l 1 d 1 to 22 09 1 21 mg n l 1 d 1 and the indicator mol ch4 consumed mol reduced no3 n c n ratio decreased to 1 79 which was very close to the theoretical minimum value 1 27 1 39 the increased nitrate removal efficiency was largely related to the enhanced relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers type i methanotrophs and some denitrifiers especially those potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers from methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were abundant in the mbfr sludge aerobic methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were closely associated in many globular aggregates 5 10 Î¼m diameter in the mbfr sludge which may have promoted the denitrifiers to capture methanol released by methanotrophs efficiently if we assume methanol is the only cross feeding intermediate in the mbfr about 38 60 of the ch4 supplied would be converted to methanol and secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized at least 63 of this secreted methanol should be utilized for denitrification instead of being oxidized by oxygen in the mbfr these findings suggest that the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process could be significantly improved graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification nitrate removal efficiency membrane biofilm reactor o2 ch4 ratio methanol linked synergy 1 introduction as the last step of wastewater treatment denitrification usually requires the addition of external carbon c sources methanol ethanol sugars etc to achieve good nitrogen removal capability due to the almost complete removal of chemical oxygen demand cod waki et al 2005 however these external additions give rise to a significant cost thus an inexpensive but efficient alternative electron donor is urgently needed park and yoo 2009 methane ch4 as a non toxic relatively inexpensive and widely available organic substrate can be a potentially attractive c source to take the place of the traditional ones thalasso et al 1997 using ch4 as a c source for denitrification is very suitable in wastewater treatment plants and landfills where ch4 can be largely generated onsite through methanogenesis modin et al 2007 depending on the involvement or not of oxygen the process of denitrification using ch4 as c source can be classified into two types anaerobic ch4 oxidation coupled to denitrification and aerobic ch4 oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d this study focused on the ame d process because of the easier acquisition of enrichment and faster rate of ch4 oxidation modin et al 2007 generally the ame d process is carried by the collaboration of aerobic methanotrophs and coexisting denitrifiers aerobic methanotrophs are mainly responsible for ch4 oxidation and secretion of some soluble organic compounds such as methanol meschner and hamer 1985 formaldehyde liu et al 2014 and acetate costa et al 2000 these secreted organic compounds can be used by denitrifiers for denitrification in the ame d process oxygen is needed for methane oxidation but it inhibits denitrification thus how to enhance the synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers and improve the nitrate removal efficiency is one of the major challenges of the ame d modin et al 2007 nitrate removal efficiency is usually defined as mol consumed ch4 mol reduced no3 n c n ratio i e the requirement of ch4 when per mol no3 n was reduced the lower the c n ratio is the higher nitrate removal efficiency will be from the literature c n in the ame d for the suspended cultures ranged from 4 0 to 16 1 houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 thalasso et al 1997 and for the membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs ranged from 2 7 to 5 56 modin et al 2008b 2010 sun et al 2013 much higher than the theoretical value 1 27 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 to improve the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d it is advantageous to let methanol act as cross feeding intermediates from aerobic methanotrophs to denitrifiers compared with other secreted organic compounds methanol can release the most amount of energy and reduce the most amount of nitrate when per mol of ch4 c is oxidized zhu et al 2016 however it is still a challenge to increase the yield of secreted methanol the methanol produced will be easily captured and oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase in aerobic methanotrophs myronova et al 2006 although the yield of methanol can be improved by adding some inhibitors such as sodium chloride nacl ammonium chloride nh4cl or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta to inhibit methanol dehydrogenase of aerobic methanotrophs the conditions are harsh and difficult to scale up strong et al 2015 it is common in many natural habitats that nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs coexist with obligate methanotrophs he et al 2012 hutchens et al 2004 kalyuhznaya et al 2009 the cohabiting nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs have been proposed to feed on methanol leaked by the aerobic methanotrophs oshkin et al 2015 under hypoxic condition these nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs capable of denitrification appear to be most successful in consuming methanol secreted by methanotrophs beck et al 2013 krause et al 2017 found that under a low o2 ch4 ratio in the coculture of a methanotroph and a methylotrophic denitrifier a high level of methanol could be detected in the bulk liquid the coexisting nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs induced a change in expression of methanotroph methanol dehydrogenases and then more methanol could be released for its growth to increase the flux of secreted methanol in the ame d running an ame d reactor under a low o2 ch4 ratio may be an efficient way the mbfr has proven to be a promising bioreactor configuration for the ame d ch4 can be supplied from the interior of a membrane to a biofilm growing on the membrane surface to achieve high transfer rate of ch4 modin et al 2008a 2010 sun et al 2013 microorganisms attached to the membrane surface lived very close to each other which may have enhanced c transfer from aerobic methanotrophs to denitrifiers especially methanol utilizing denitrifiers we speculated that operating the mbfr under low o2 ch4 ratio can further enhance the relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers which would ultimately help to improve the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d in this study we tested the hypothesis that methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the ame d could be enhanced to improve the nitrate removal efficiency under a low o2 ch4 ratio in an mbfr ch4 and oxygen were provided through hollow fibres and the ratio of o2 ch4 was 0 06 the seed sludge was collected from a suspended growth reactor which had been enriched for more than one year under the same o2 ch4 ratio we monitored the performance of the mbfr regularly and evaluated nitrate removal efficiency by batch tests in order to study the methanol linked synergy of the ame d we also analyzed the abundance microbial community structure and spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers through quantitative pcr metagenomics and fluorescence in situ

in the c n mol consumed ch4 mol consumed no3 n ratio for the sludges collected from the suspended growth reactor control sludge and the mbfr mbfr sludge at the end of stage ii in order to compare nitrate removal efficiency with previous studies a similar gaseous condition with an o2 ch4 ratio of 1 3 was selected in this batch experiment collected sludge was pre incubated in the mineral salts

results 3 1 increased nitrate removal rate of the mbfr compared with the suspended growth reactor after 140 days of enrichment a layer of biofilm was observed on the membrane surface fig s1 the sludge in the mbfr was mainly attached to the membrane surface rather than suspended in the liquid the concentrations of no3 n and no2 n at the beginning and the end of each batch cycle during the entire operation process under a low ratio of o2 ch4 0 06 in the mbfr are shown in fig 2 from fig 2 it was clear that the mbfr removed more nitrate compared to the suspended growth reactor at the start phase the nitrate removal rate increased slightly from 3 to 4 mg n l 1 d 1 in the suspended growth reactor to 6 59 1 27 mg n l 1 d 1 in the mbfr then the consumption rate for no3 n in the mbfr increased markedly to 13 17 1 61 mg n l 1 d 1 during stage i when the pressure of the mixed gas ch4 and air in the inlet was increased to 70 kpa stage ii the nitrate removal rate increased to 22 09 1 21 mg n l

was sampled and evaluated for nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process through batch tests the consumption or production of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and ch4 in each test were measured and are presented in table 1 after 66 h incubation changes in concentrations of substrates in the liquid and in the headspace of the blank control test 5 were negligible significant reductions of no3 n were measured in tests 1 and 3 with ch4 oxidation while no or less consumption was detected in tests 2 and 4 without ch4 supplementation specifically 33 12 1 75 Î¼mol of no3 n was removed with a very small amount of no2 n accumulation 2 23 0 37 Î¼mol and without any production of nh4 n after incubation in test 1 for the control sludge in test 2 as a control without ch4 addition no significant no3 n reduction was measured while only a low level of accumulation of no2 n was detected for the mbfr sludge neither no2 n nor nh4 n accumulation was detected in test 3 with the reduction of 93 4 1 52 Î¼mol of no3 n overall the ch4 oxidation rate of the mbfr sludge was 511 64 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 which was higher than that of the activated sludge from the suspended growth reactor 430 56 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 but these were not significantly different p 0 072 however the ch4 derived nitrate removal rate of the mbfr sludge 286 5 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 was almost three times higher than that of the activated sludge from the suspended growth reactor 67 1 3 5 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 consequently the c n ratio of the mbfr sludge 1 79 was significantly lower than that of the control sludge 6 39 p 0 003 table 1 3 3 microbial properties of the mbfr sludge compared with the control sludge 3 3 1 quantification of functional genes the abundance of the pmoa gene catalyzing the aerobic ch4 oxidation process and the abundance of genes involved in denitrification narg nirk nirs and nosz were determined in the control and mbfr sludges results suggested that the amount of both aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge was elevated compared with the control sludge fig s2 for the pmoa gene the abundance increased significantly from 2 92 1010 in the control sludge to 1 15 1011 copies g 1 dry biomass in the mbfr sludge p 0 05 for the denitrifying genes statistically significant increases in copy numbers were also observed in the mbfr sludge except for the narg gene fig s2 3 3 2 microbial community structure in the control and mbfr sludges shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis showed that microorganisms in both the control and mbfr sludges were primarily comprised of bacteria 65 and unclassified microorganisms 35 along with very few archaea and eukarya at the family level differences in the relative abundance of relevant bacterial taxa between the control and mbfr sludges are shown in fig 3 for aerobic methanotrophs type i aerobic methanotrophs in the methylococcaceae were the predominant methanotrophs the percentage of methylococcaceae increased from 6 47 to 9 78 after culturing in the mbfr methylocystaceae belonging to the type ii aerobic methanotrophs was also slightly enriched from 0 09 to 0 82 for non methanotrophs methylophilaceae 11 65 rhodocyclaceae 9 68 and xanthomonadaceae 5 48 were the three main families enriched in the mbfr sludge while the relative abundance of these three families were only 1 28 1 28 and 2 16 respectively in the control sludge although the percentage of ignavibacteriaceae 3 62 was highest among non methanotrophs in the control sludge it was reduced by 35 in the mbfr sludge the relative abundance of chitinophagaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were almost the same 2 60 2 78 in the control and mbfr sludges consequently the enriched non methanotrophic microbes methylophilaceae rhodocyclaceae and xanthomonadaceae may be contributing the most to nitrate removal in order to get more detailed information we further investigated the main aerobic methanotrophs and potential denitrifiers at the genus level after enriching the ame d sludge in the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio the main aerobic methanotrophs changed from methylocaldum 5 05 in the control sludge to methylomonas 8 56 in the mbfr sludge table 2 for potential denitrifiers methanol utilizing denitrifiers might be playing an important role as the relative abundance was highly increased in the mbfr sludge table 2 however not all of the potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched only the abundance of potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the families of methylophilaceae and rhodocyclaceae including methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were increased significantly table 2 although hyphomicrobium in the family hyphomicrobiaceae has been reported to be able to use methanol as a c source to conduct the denitrification process martineau et al 2015 it was not enriched in the mbfr sludge and its abundance was even slightly decreased 3 3 3 spatial distribution of methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers the spatial distribution of the main methanotrophs type â° methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the control and mbfr sludges was observed by confocal laser microscopy in combination with fish fig 4 image analysis revealed two completely different distribution patterns in the control sludge methanotrophic cells and methanol utilizing denitrifying cells were largely dispersed throughout the sludge fig 4b in contrast potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge formed many globular aggregates with methanotrophs 5 10 Î¼m in diameter fig 4a moreover for the control sludge the signal of potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers was so weak that barely any image was captured however a strong signal was easily observed in the mbfr sludge fig 4a the spatial distribution relationship between type ii methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge is illustrated in fig s3 with a result similar to that shown in fig 4 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated that under a low o2 ch4 ratio operating the mbfr could achieve much a higher nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process compared with operating a suspended growth reactor the nitrate removal rate in the mbfr was much higher than that in the suspended growth reactor fig 2 at stage ii the nitrate removal rate had reached 22 09 1 21 mg n l 1 d 1 almost five times that in the suspended growth reactor in addition we observed a significant decrease in the c n value compared with that in the suspended growth reactor in the batch tests table 1 the indicator mol consumed ch4 mol reduced no3 n c n in the mbfr was quite low 1 79 0 197 and very close to the theoretical minimum value 1 27 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 the high nitrate removal rate and low c n value in the mbfr indicated that the nitrogen removal efficiency of the ame d was successfully elevated and a higher proportion of electrons generated by ch4 oxidation could flow to denitrifiers however it should be noted that the calculated apparent c n value might exaggerate the role of denitrification as nitrate assimilation could be another important pathway for nitrate removal therefore the percentage of denitrification in the total amount of nitrate removal should be adjusted according to the results of the batch test the value mol reduced no3 n mol consumed ch4 in the control sludge was 0 156 while for the mbfr sludge it was 0 562 table 1 when 1 mol of ch4 is consumed by aerobic methanotrophs 0 062 0 11 mol of no3 n will be removed through assimilation modin et al 2010 after deducting the amount of nitrate removal likely due to assimilation the reduced nitrate in the control sludge would be 0 046 0 094 mol mol 1 of ch4 consumed and in the mbfr sludge it would be 0 452 0 5 mol mol 1 ch4 consumed considering that there was no obvious accumulation of ammonia or nitrite in the batch test tests 1 and 3 and all of the nitrogen removal activity was ch4 dependent table 1 the corrected nitrate consumption was mainly attributed to denitrification the proportion of denitrification derived nitrogen removal of the total nitrogen lost can be estimated according to eq 1 1 pdenitrification n t o t a l n a s s i m i l a t i o n n t o t a l 100 where nassimilation represents the nitrogen removed through assimilation by aerobic methanotrophs which ranged from 0 062 to 0 11 mol mol 1 ch4 consumed for the control sludge denitrification contributed to about 29 5 60 3 of the nitrogen removed while for the mbfr sludge it was 80 4 88 9 the corrected c n value in the mbfr could also be calculated 2 1 79 88 9 corrected c n 1 79 80 4 2 0 corrected c n 2 2 the corrected c n value was still close to the theoretical minimum value after considering nitrate assimilation the synergistic relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr was indeed strengthened the ability to promote the cooperation between aerobic methanotrophs and co existing denitrifiers and then lower the value of c n has always been a concern with the ame d process however due to the different oxygen preferences between the two microorganisms it has been a challenge modin et al 2007 c n in the ame d for the suspended cultures was 4 0 16 1 and for the mbfrs was 2 7 5 56 thalasso et al 1997 houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 modin et al 2008b 2010 sun et al 2013 much higher than the theoretical value 1 27 1 39 in this study we found that operating the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio could decrease the c n and achieve the lowest level 1 79 0 197 table 1 the need for external electron donors of the denitrification could be significantly reduced when using ch4 generated in situ especially in these ame d systems with high nitrate removal efficiency for a typical wastewater treatment plant the production of ch4 is about 2 11 mol ch4 m 3 modin et al 2008a the nitrate removal capacity in the ame d system with c n of 1 79 at a typical wastewater treatment plant would be 16 5 g n m 3 which is close to the concentration of nitrate in medium strength nitrified wastewater 20 g n m 3 although there are still some problems need to be resolved such as low methane oxidation rate and optimization of operating parameters operating mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio provides a feasible way to increase the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process to investigate the mechanism of nitrate removal efficiency improvement we first quantified the copy number of pmoa genes and denitrification functional genes compared with the control sludge the abundance of pmoa nirk nirs and nosz were significantly increased fig s2 the functional microorganisms involved in the ame d were highly enriched in the mbfr which likely increased the nitrate removal efficiency to better understand how the functional microorganisms enriched in the mbfr cooperated with each other a simplified model for the ame d was established fig 5 if 1 mol of ch4 is utilized by aerobic methanotrophs for energy production synthesis of cellular matter etc and input to the ame d system a portion of the ch4 will be converted into some soluble organic products cnhaob and then be secreted to the liquid phase by aerobic methanotrophs the average yield of these organic molecules will be y mol cnhaob mol 1 ch4 of course not all secreted organic molecules will be utilized by denitrifying bacteria and the proportion for denitrification will be w then the ame d process can be described by the following reaction reaction 1 produce cnhaob ch 4 2 x 4 1 ny o 2 y c n h a o b 1 ny co 2 2 0 5 ay h 2 o reaction 2 cnhaob is used for denitrification y w c n h a o b 4 x n y w 5 no 3 4 x n y w 5 h y w n co 2 4 x n y w 10 n 2 y w a 2 4 x n y w 10 h 2 o where x is the valence of c in cnhaob and equals 2 b a n y is the average yield of cnhaob mol cnhaob mol 1 ch4 and w is the proportion of cnhaob that is used by denitrifiers for denitrification from reaction 2 c n can be easily calculated 3 c n 5 n y w 4 x for the mbfr sludge in our study c n was 2 0 2 2 after deducting the amount of nitrate removal due to assimilation eq 2 if we take the value of c n as 2 2 4 5 n y w 4 x 2 2 fig s4 describes the relationship among ny w x in detail based on eq 4 here we were interested in the valence of c in the organic molecules utilized by denitrifiers and transform eq 4 5 x 4 5 2 2 n y w according to the conservation of c ny 1 and 0 w 1 so from eq 5 6 x 4 5 2 2 n y w 4 5 2 2 n 1 1 1 7 x 1 7 it should be noted that both ny and w would be less than 1 in the actual situation so x will be even smaller than 1 7 fig s4 therefore some low valence organic compounds were involved in the cross feeding of these enriched methanotrophs and denitrifiers when operating the ame d process under low o2 ch4 ratio in the mbfr the next question was what were these low valence organic molecules utilized by denitrifiers for denitrification in the mbfr let us reconsider the oxidation process of ch4 ch4 is first oxidized to methanol 2 then to formaldehyde 0 formate 2 and finally carbon dioxide 4 beyond that formaldehyde the intermediate in the oxidation of ch4 can be converted to acetyl coa by methanotrophs and used to synthesize multiple organic intermediary compounds kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 considering that formaldehyde is not only harmful for aerobic methanotrophs but also for denitrifiers it is not likely to be the major cross feeding intermediate so from the perspective of valence state of c in organic molecules we speculate that methanol x 2 might be one of intermediates for the cross feeding of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers to verify this we explored the diversity and abundance of methylotrophic microorganisms in the reactor as we expected some methanol oxidizing bacteria were markedly enriched in the mbfr fig 3 table 2 in particular the abundance of major methylotrophic microorganisms in the methylophilaceae was enriched comparably to that of the aerobic methanotrophs in the mbfr thus methanol seemed to be one of the cross feeding intermediates between these enriched aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr to further understand the potential role of methanol linked synergy in the mbfr we simplified the analysis and assumed that methanol was the only cross feeding intermediate under this assumption cnhaob in the model was ch3oh and x 2 1 4 2 substitute x 2 into eq 5 7 2 4 5 2 2 y w to calculate the amount of secreted methanol 8 y 0 38 w since w 1 we get 9 y 0 38 w 0 38 1 0 38 in previous work we calculated the maximum value of y as 0 6 by use of thermodynamic method zhu et al 2016 10 0 38 y 0 6 although eq 10 was based on the ideal assumption that methanol was the only cross feeding intermediate organic molecule in the ame d process the large y value implied that a certain percentage of ch4 would be converted to methanol and then secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized in the mbfr therefore methanol seemed to be the major cross feeding intermediate between these enriched aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr since secreted methanol could be utilized by denitrifiers but also by other aerobic heterotrophic bacteria we transformed eq 8 to determine the range of the percentage of methanol used for denitrification 11 w 0 38 y considering 0 38 y 0 6 12 0 38 0 6 w 0 38 0 38 0 63 w 1 eq 12 suggested that in the mbfr the released methanol would be mainly captured by methanol utilizing denitrifiers this may be the reason why several potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched table 2 in the mbfr methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis which had been reported to have denitrification capacity ginige et al 2004 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 lu et al 2014 became an important part of the potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers and their abundance was significantly increased in the mbfr sludge table 2 in addition there were some other abundant bacteria that could be responsible for methanol utilizing denitrification such as hyphomicrobium although their abundance was not increased compared with that in the control sludge table 2 interestingly not all potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched paraccocus which has been identified in various methanol feeding denitrification systems lu et al 2014 was not enriched and the abundance remained very low 0 02 in the mbfr oshkin et al 2015 also reported that cultures with methane as a sole carbon source contained accompanying types belonging to a limited number of bacterial taxa methylotrophs and non methylotrophs so it is likely that the secreted methanol was not public food and that the enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were likely to have a competitive advantage in capturing the secreted methanol to capture methanol more efficiently these enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers should be spatially closely associate with the aerobic methanotrophs in the mbfr sludge we used fish to observe the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the control and mbfr sludges the results supported our hypothesis as these two types of microorganisms were closely coincide spatially in the mbfr sludge while in the control sludge they were dispersed fig 4 fig s3 we noticed that there were also some non methanol utilizing denitrifiers belonging to rhodocyclaceae 9 68 and xanthomonadaceae 5 48 enriched in the mbfr fig 3 aerobic methanotrophs could also secrete some other organic intermediates besides methanol to denitrifiers so we modified the model and considered the case of mixed cross feeding intermediates for more detail please see supporting material figs s5 and s6 according to the modified model methanol still seemed to play an important role in the ame d there are several studies in natural microbial populations crevecoeur et al 2015 karwautz et al 2018 kumaresan et al 2018 and manipulated laboratory microcosms beck et al 2013 hernandez et al 2015 oshkin et al 2015 support the hypothesis and species of methylophilaceae are most commonly co occurring with type i aerobic methanotrophs methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers may be a strategy for aerobic methanotrophs to survive under oxygen limiting condition the strategy seems to be win win for aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers for aerobic methanotrophs linking methane oxidation to denitrification decrease the demand for oxygen for methanol utilizing denitrifiers they can gain energy when oxidizing the organic compounds secreted by aerobic methanotroph strengthen the methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers is of great significance for the application of the ame d 5 conclusions we demonstrated that nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process could be improved by operating the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio it is thus far the highest nitrate removal efficiency obtained in an mbfr system for the ame d process in the mbfr some potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers i e methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were highly enriched moreover those enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers formed many small aggregates co located with aerobic methanotrophs 5 10 Î¼m diameter based on these findings we speculated that the enhanced methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers resulted in the increased nitrogen removal efficiency in the mbfr if we assume methanol is the only cross feeding intermediate in the mbfr about 38 60 of ch4 will be converted to methanol and secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized at least 63 of this secreted methanol is apparently utilized for denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors

18054,nitrate removal efficiency of aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d process was elevated by enhancing the methanol linked synergy in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio after 140 days enrichment the nitrate removal rate increased significantly from 3 to 4 mg n l 1 d 1 to 22 09 1 21 mg n l 1 d 1 and the indicator mol ch4 consumed mol reduced no3 n c n ratio decreased to 1 79 which was very close to the theoretical minimum value 1 27 1 39 the increased nitrate removal efficiency was largely related to the enhanced relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers type i methanotrophs and some denitrifiers especially those potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers from methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were abundant in the mbfr sludge aerobic methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were closely associated in many globular aggregates 5 10 Î¼m diameter in the mbfr sludge which may have promoted the denitrifiers to capture methanol released by methanotrophs efficiently if we assume methanol is the only cross feeding intermediate in the mbfr about 38 60 of the ch4 supplied would be converted to methanol and secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized at least 63 of this secreted methanol should be utilized for denitrification instead of being oxidized by oxygen in the mbfr these findings suggest that the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process could be significantly improved graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification nitrate removal efficiency membrane biofilm reactor o2 ch4 ratio methanol linked synergy 1 introduction as the last step of wastewater treatment denitrification usually requires the addition of external carbon c sources methanol ethanol sugars etc to achieve good nitrogen removal capability due to the almost complete removal of chemical oxygen demand cod waki et al 2005 however these external additions give rise to a significant cost thus an inexpensive but efficient alternative electron donor is urgently needed park and yoo 2009 methane ch4 as a non toxic relatively inexpensive and widely available organic substrate can be a potentially attractive c source to take the place of the traditional ones thalasso et al 1997 using ch4 as a c source for denitrification is very suitable in wastewater treatment plants and landfills where ch4 can be largely generated onsite through methanogenesis modin et al 2007 depending on the involvement or not of oxygen the process of denitrification using ch4 as c source can be classified into two types anaerobic ch4 oxidation coupled to denitrification and aerobic ch4 oxidation coupled to denitrification ame d this study focused on the ame d process because of the easier acquisition of enrichment and faster rate of ch4 oxidation modin et al 2007 generally the ame d process is carried by the collaboration of aerobic methanotrophs and coexisting denitrifiers aerobic methanotrophs are mainly responsible for ch4 oxidation and secretion of some soluble organic compounds such as methanol meschner and hamer 1985 formaldehyde liu et al 2014 and acetate costa et al 2000 these secreted organic compounds can be used by denitrifiers for denitrification in the ame d process oxygen is needed for methane oxidation but it inhibits denitrification thus how to enhance the synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers and improve the nitrate removal efficiency is one of the major challenges of the ame d modin et al 2007 nitrate removal efficiency is usually defined as mol consumed ch4 mol reduced no3 n c n ratio i e the requirement of ch4 when per mol no3 n was reduced the lower the c n ratio is the higher nitrate removal efficiency will be from the literature c n in the ame d for the suspended cultures ranged from 4 0 to 16 1 houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 thalasso et al 1997 and for the membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs ranged from 2 7 to 5 56 modin et al 2008b 2010 sun et al 2013 much higher than the theoretical value 1 27 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 to improve the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d it is advantageous to let methanol act as cross feeding intermediates from aerobic methanotrophs to denitrifiers compared with other secreted organic compounds methanol can release the most amount of energy and reduce the most amount of nitrate when per mol of ch4 c is oxidized zhu et al 2016 however it is still a challenge to increase the yield of secreted methanol the methanol produced will be easily captured and oxidized by methanol dehydrogenase in aerobic methanotrophs myronova et al 2006 although the yield of methanol can be improved by adding some inhibitors such as sodium chloride nacl ammonium chloride nh4cl or ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta to inhibit methanol dehydrogenase of aerobic methanotrophs the conditions are harsh and difficult to scale up strong et al 2015 it is common in many natural habitats that nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs coexist with obligate methanotrophs he et al 2012 hutchens et al 2004 kalyuhznaya et al 2009 the cohabiting nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs have been proposed to feed on methanol leaked by the aerobic methanotrophs oshkin et al 2015 under hypoxic condition these nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs capable of denitrification appear to be most successful in consuming methanol secreted by methanotrophs beck et al 2013 krause et al 2017 found that under a low o2 ch4 ratio in the coculture of a methanotroph and a methylotrophic denitrifier a high level of methanol could be detected in the bulk liquid the coexisting nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs induced a change in expression of methanotroph methanol dehydrogenases and then more methanol could be released for its growth to increase the flux of secreted methanol in the ame d running an ame d reactor under a low o2 ch4 ratio may be an efficient way the mbfr has proven to be a promising bioreactor configuration for the ame d ch4 can be supplied from the interior of a membrane to a biofilm growing on the membrane surface to achieve high transfer rate of ch4 modin et al 2008a 2010 sun et al 2013 microorganisms attached to the membrane surface lived very close to each other which may have enhanced c transfer from aerobic methanotrophs to denitrifiers especially methanol utilizing denitrifiers we speculated that operating the mbfr under low o2 ch4 ratio can further enhance the relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers which would ultimately help to improve the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d in this study we tested the hypothesis that methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the ame d could be enhanced to improve the nitrate removal efficiency under a low o2 ch4 ratio in an mbfr ch4 and oxygen were provided through hollow fibres and the ratio of o2 ch4 was 0 06 the seed sludge was collected from a suspended growth reactor which had been enriched for more than one year under the same o2 ch4 ratio we monitored the performance of the mbfr regularly and evaluated nitrate removal efficiency by batch tests in order to study the methanol linked synergy of the ame d we also analyzed the abundance microbial community structure and spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs and methanol utilizing denitrifiers through quantitative pcr metagenomics and fluorescence in situ

use 2 2 inoculum the inoculum for the mbfr was activated sludge from the 1 0 l suspended growth reactor which ch4 was used as the electron donor liu et al 2014 at the time that the inoculum was

nitrate removal efficiency with previous studies a similar gaseous condition with an o2 ch4 ratio of 1 3 was selected in this batch experiment collected sludge was pre incubated in the mineral salts

results 3 1 increased nitrate removal rate of the mbfr compared with the suspended growth reactor after 140 days of enrichment a layer of biofilm was observed on the membrane surface fig s1 the sludge in the mbfr was mainly attached to the membrane surface rather than suspended in the liquid the concentrations of no3 n and no2 n at the beginning and the end of each batch cycle during the entire operation process under a low ratio of o2 ch4 0 06 in the mbfr are shown in fig 2 from fig 2 it was clear that the mbfr removed more nitrate compared to the suspended growth reactor at the start phase the nitrate removal rate increased slightly from 3 to 4 mg n l 1 d 1 in the suspended growth reactor to 6 59 1 27 mg n l 1 d 1 in the mbfr then the consumption rate for no3 n in the mbfr increased markedly to 13 17 1 61 mg n l 1 d 1 during stage i when the pressure of the mixed gas ch4 and air in the inlet was increased to 70 kpa stage ii the nitrate removal rate increased to 22 09 1 21 mg n l 1 d 1 almost 5 times that in the suspended growth reactor 3 2 decreased c n ratio of the mbfr sludge compared with the control sludge when the performance of the mbfr was stable in stage ii the sludge was sampled and evaluated for nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process through batch tests the consumption or production of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and ch4 in each test were measured and are presented in table 1 after 66 h incubation changes in concentrations of substrates in the liquid and in the headspace of the blank control test 5 were negligible significant reductions of no3 n were measured in tests 1 and 3 with ch4 oxidation while no or less consumption was detected in tests 2 and 4 without ch4 supplementation specifically 33 12 1 75 Î¼mol of no3 n was removed with a very small amount of no2 n accumulation 2 23 0 37 Î¼mol and without any production of nh4 n after incubation in test 1 for the control sludge in test 2 as a control without ch4 addition no significant no3 n reduction was measured while only a low level of accumulation of no2 n was detected for the mbfr sludge neither no2 n nor nh4 n accumulation was detected in test 3 with the reduction of 93 4 1 52 Î¼mol of no3 n overall the ch4 oxidation rate of the mbfr sludge was 511 64 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 which was higher than that of the activated sludge from the suspended growth reactor 430 56 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 but these were not significantly different p 0 072 however the ch4 derived nitrate removal rate of the mbfr sludge 286 5 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 was almost three times higher than that of the activated sludge from the suspended growth reactor 67 1 3 5 Î¼mol g 1 mlss d 1 consequently the c n ratio of the mbfr sludge 1 79 was significantly lower than that of the control sludge 6 39 p 0 003 table 1 3 3 microbial properties of the mbfr sludge compared with the control sludge 3 3 1 quantification of functional genes the abundance of the pmoa gene catalyzing the aerobic ch4 oxidation process and the abundance of genes involved in denitrification narg nirk nirs and nosz were determined in the control and mbfr sludges results suggested that the amount of both aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge was elevated compared with the control sludge fig s2 for the pmoa gene the abundance increased significantly from 2 92 1010 in the control sludge to 1 15 1011 copies g 1 dry biomass in the mbfr sludge p 0 05 for the denitrifying genes statistically significant increases in copy numbers were also observed in the mbfr sludge except for the narg gene fig s2 3 3 2 microbial community structure in the control and mbfr sludges shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis showed that microorganisms in both the control and mbfr sludges were primarily comprised of bacteria 65 and unclassified microorganisms 35 along with very few archaea and eukarya at the family level differences in the relative abundance of relevant bacterial taxa between the control and mbfr sludges are shown in fig 3 for aerobic methanotrophs type i aerobic methanotrophs in the methylococcaceae were the predominant methanotrophs the percentage of methylococcaceae increased from 6 47 to 9 78 after culturing in the mbfr methylocystaceae belonging to the type ii aerobic methanotrophs was also slightly enriched from 0 09 to 0 82 for non methanotrophs methylophilaceae 11 65 rhodocyclaceae 9 68 and xanthomonadaceae 5 48 were the three main families enriched in the mbfr sludge while the relative abundance of these three families were only 1 28 1 28 and 2 16 respectively in the control sludge although the percentage of ignavibacteriaceae 3 62 was highest among non methanotrophs in the control sludge it was reduced by 35 in the mbfr sludge the relative abundance of chitinophagaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were almost the same 2 60 2 78 in the control and mbfr sludges consequently the enriched non methanotrophic microbes methylophilaceae rhodocyclaceae and xanthomonadaceae may be contributing the most to nitrate removal in order to get more detailed information we further investigated the main aerobic methanotrophs and potential denitrifiers at the genus level after enriching the ame d sludge in the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio the main aerobic methanotrophs changed from methylocaldum 5 05 in the control sludge to methylomonas 8 56 in the mbfr sludge table 2 for potential denitrifiers methanol utilizing denitrifiers might be playing an important role as the relative abundance was highly increased in the mbfr sludge table 2 however not all of the potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched only the abundance of potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the families of methylophilaceae and rhodocyclaceae including methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were increased significantly table 2 although hyphomicrobium in the family hyphomicrobiaceae has been reported to be able to use methanol as a c source to conduct the denitrification process martineau et al 2015 it was not enriched in the mbfr sludge and its abundance was even slightly decreased 3 3 3 spatial distribution of methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers the spatial distribution of the main methanotrophs type â° methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the control and mbfr sludges was observed by confocal laser microscopy in combination with fish fig 4 image analysis revealed two completely different distribution patterns in the control sludge methanotrophic cells and methanol utilizing denitrifying cells were largely dispersed throughout the sludge fig 4b in contrast potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge formed many globular aggregates with methanotrophs 5 10 Î¼m in diameter fig 4a moreover for the control sludge the signal of potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers was so weak that barely any image was captured however a strong signal was easily observed in the mbfr sludge fig 4a the spatial distribution relationship between type ii methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the mbfr sludge is illustrated in fig s3 with a result similar to that shown in fig 4 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated that under a low o2 ch4 ratio operating the mbfr could achieve much a higher nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process compared with operating a suspended growth reactor the nitrate removal rate in the mbfr was much higher than that in the suspended growth reactor fig 2 at stage ii the nitrate removal rate had reached 22 09 1 21 mg n l 1 d 1 almost five times that in the suspended growth reactor in addition we observed a significant decrease in the c n value compared with that in the suspended growth reactor in the batch tests table 1 the indicator mol consumed ch4 mol reduced no3 n c n in the mbfr was quite low 1 79 0 197 and very close to the theoretical minimum value 1 27 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 the high nitrate removal rate and low c n value in the mbfr indicated that the nitrogen removal efficiency of the ame d was successfully elevated and a higher proportion of electrons generated by ch4 oxidation could flow to denitrifiers however it should be noted that the calculated apparent c n value might exaggerate the role of denitrification as nitrate assimilation could be another important pathway for nitrate removal therefore the percentage of denitrification in the total amount of nitrate removal should be adjusted according to the results of the batch test the value mol reduced no3 n mol consumed ch4 in the control sludge was 0 156 while for the mbfr sludge it was 0 562 table 1 when 1 mol of ch4 is consumed by aerobic methanotrophs 0 062 0 11 mol of no3 n will be removed through assimilation modin et al 2010 after deducting the amount of nitrate removal likely due to assimilation the reduced nitrate in the control sludge would be 0 046 0 094 mol mol 1 of ch4 consumed and in the mbfr sludge it would be 0 452 0 5 mol mol 1 ch4 consumed considering that there was no obvious accumulation of ammonia or nitrite in the batch test tests 1 and 3 and all of the nitrogen removal activity was ch4 dependent table 1 the corrected nitrate consumption was mainly attributed to denitrification the proportion of denitrification derived nitrogen removal of the total nitrogen lost can be estimated according to eq 1 1 pdenitrification n t o t a l n a s s i m i l a t i o n n t o t a l 100 where nassimilation represents the nitrogen removed through assimilation by aerobic methanotrophs which ranged from 0 062 to 0 11 mol mol 1 ch4 consumed for the control sludge denitrification contributed to about 29 5 60 3 of the nitrogen removed while for the mbfr sludge it was 80 4 88 9 the corrected c n value in the mbfr could also be calculated 2 1 79 88 9 corrected c n 1 79 80 4 2 0 corrected c n 2 2 the corrected c n value was still close to the theoretical minimum value after considering nitrate assimilation the synergistic relationship between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr was indeed strengthened the ability to promote the cooperation between aerobic methanotrophs and co existing denitrifiers and then lower the value of c n has always been a concern with the ame d process however due to the different oxygen preferences between the two microorganisms it has been a challenge modin et al 2007 c n in the ame d for the suspended cultures was 4 0 16 1 and for the mbfrs was 2 7 5 56 thalasso et al 1997 houbron et al 1999 rajapakse and scutt 1999 modin et al 2008b 2010 sun et al 2013 much higher than the theoretical value 1 27 1 39 in this study we found that operating the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio could decrease the c n and achieve the lowest level 1 79 0 197 table 1 the need for external electron donors of the denitrification could be significantly reduced when using ch4 generated in situ especially in these ame d systems with high nitrate removal efficiency for a typical wastewater treatment plant the production of ch4 is about 2 11 mol ch4 m 3 modin et al 2008a the nitrate removal capacity in the ame d system with c n of 1 79 at a typical wastewater treatment plant would be 16 5 g n m 3 which is close to the concentration of nitrate in medium strength nitrified wastewater 20 g n m 3 although there are still some problems need to be resolved such as low methane oxidation rate and optimization of operating parameters operating mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio provides a feasible way to increase the nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process to investigate the mechanism of nitrate removal efficiency improvement we first quantified the copy number of pmoa genes and denitrification functional genes compared with the control sludge the abundance of pmoa nirk nirs and nosz were significantly increased fig s2 the functional microorganisms involved in the ame d were highly enriched in the mbfr which likely increased the nitrate removal efficiency to better understand how the functional microorganisms enriched in the mbfr cooperated with each other a simplified model for the ame d was established fig 5 if 1 mol of ch4 is utilized by aerobic methanotrophs for energy production synthesis of cellular matter etc and input to the ame d system a portion of the ch4 will be converted into some soluble organic products cnhaob and then be secreted to the liquid phase by aerobic methanotrophs the average yield of these organic molecules will be y mol cnhaob mol 1 ch4 of course not all secreted organic molecules will be utilized by denitrifying bacteria and the proportion for denitrification will be w then the ame d process can be described by the following reaction reaction 1 produce cnhaob ch 4 2 x 4 1 ny o 2 y c n h a o b 1 ny co 2 2 0 5 ay h 2 o reaction 2 cnhaob is used for denitrification y w c n h a o b 4 x n y w 5 no 3 4 x n y w 5 h y w n co 2 4 x n y w 10 n 2 y w a 2 4 x n y w 10 h 2 o where x is the valence of c in cnhaob and equals 2 b a n y is the average yield of cnhaob mol cnhaob mol 1 ch4 and w is the proportion of cnhaob that is used by denitrifiers for denitrification from reaction 2 c n can be easily calculated 3 c n 5 n y w 4 x for the mbfr sludge in our study c n was 2 0 2 2 after deducting the amount of nitrate removal due to assimilation eq 2 if we take the value of c n as 2 2 4 5 n y w 4 x 2 2 fig s4 describes the relationship among ny w x in detail based on eq 4 here we were interested in the valence of c in the organic molecules utilized by denitrifiers and transform eq 4 5 x 4 5 2 2 n y w according to the conservation of c ny 1 and 0 w 1 so from eq 5 6 x 4 5 2 2 n y w 4 5 2 2 n 1 1 1 7 x 1 7 it should be noted that both ny and w would be less than 1 in the actual situation so x will be even smaller than 1 7 fig s4 therefore some low valence organic compounds were involved in the cross feeding of these enriched methanotrophs and denitrifiers when operating the ame d process under low o2 ch4 ratio in the mbfr the next question was what were these low valence organic molecules utilized by denitrifiers for denitrification in the mbfr let us reconsider the oxidation process of ch4 ch4 is first oxidized to methanol 2 then to formaldehyde 0 formate 2 and finally carbon dioxide 4 beyond that formaldehyde the intermediate in the oxidation of ch4 can be converted to acetyl coa by methanotrophs and used to synthesize multiple organic intermediary compounds kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 considering that formaldehyde is not only harmful for aerobic methanotrophs but also for denitrifiers it is not likely to be the major cross feeding intermediate so from the perspective of valence state of c in organic molecules we speculate that methanol x 2 might be one of intermediates for the cross feeding of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers to verify this we explored the diversity and abundance of methylotrophic microorganisms in the reactor as we expected some methanol oxidizing bacteria were markedly enriched in the mbfr fig 3 table 2 in particular the abundance of major methylotrophic microorganisms in the methylophilaceae was enriched comparably to that of the aerobic methanotrophs in the mbfr thus methanol seemed to be one of the cross feeding intermediates between these enriched aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr to further understand the potential role of methanol linked synergy in the mbfr we simplified the analysis and assumed that methanol was the only cross feeding intermediate under this assumption cnhaob in the model was ch3oh and x 2 1 4 2 substitute x 2 into eq 5 7 2 4 5 2 2 y w to calculate the amount of secreted methanol 8 y 0 38 w since w 1 we get 9 y 0 38 w 0 38 1 0 38 in previous work we calculated the maximum value of y as 0 6 by use of thermodynamic method zhu et al 2016 10 0 38 y 0 6 although eq 10 was based on the ideal assumption that methanol was the only cross feeding intermediate organic molecule in the ame d process the large y value implied that a certain percentage of ch4 would be converted to methanol and then secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized in the mbfr therefore methanol seemed to be the major cross feeding intermediate between these enriched aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers in the mbfr since secreted methanol could be utilized by denitrifiers but also by other aerobic heterotrophic bacteria we transformed eq 8 to determine the range of the percentage of methanol used for denitrification 11 w 0 38 y considering 0 38 y 0 6 12 0 38 0 6 w 0 38 0 38 0 63 w 1 eq 12 suggested that in the mbfr the released methanol would be mainly captured by methanol utilizing denitrifiers this may be the reason why several potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched table 2 in the mbfr methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis which had been reported to have denitrification capacity ginige et al 2004 kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 lu et al 2014 became an important part of the potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers and their abundance was significantly increased in the mbfr sludge table 2 in addition there were some other abundant bacteria that could be responsible for methanol utilizing denitrification such as hyphomicrobium although their abundance was not increased compared with that in the control sludge table 2 interestingly not all potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were enriched paraccocus which has been identified in various methanol feeding denitrification systems lu et al 2014 was not enriched and the abundance remained very low 0 02 in the mbfr oshkin et al 2015 also reported that cultures with methane as a sole carbon source contained accompanying types belonging to a limited number of bacterial taxa methylotrophs and non methylotrophs so it is likely that the secreted methanol was not public food and that the enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers were likely to have a competitive advantage in capturing the secreted methanol to capture methanol more efficiently these enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers should be spatially closely associate with the aerobic methanotrophs in the mbfr sludge we used fish to observe the spatial distribution of aerobic methanotrophs and potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers in the control and mbfr sludges the results supported our hypothesis as these two types of microorganisms were closely coincide spatially in the mbfr sludge while in the control sludge they were dispersed fig 4 fig s3 we noticed that there were also some non methanol utilizing denitrifiers belonging to rhodocyclaceae 9 68 and xanthomonadaceae 5 48 enriched in the mbfr fig 3 aerobic methanotrophs could also secrete some other organic intermediates besides methanol to denitrifiers so we modified the model and considered the case of mixed cross feeding intermediates for more detail please see supporting material figs s5 and s6 according to the modified model methanol still seemed to play an important role in the ame d there are several studies in natural microbial populations crevecoeur et al 2015 karwautz et al 2018 kumaresan et al 2018 and manipulated laboratory microcosms beck et al 2013 hernandez et al 2015 oshkin et al 2015 support the hypothesis and species of methylophilaceae are most commonly co occurring with type i aerobic methanotrophs methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers may be a strategy for aerobic methanotrophs to survive under oxygen limiting condition the strategy seems to be win win for aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers for aerobic methanotrophs linking methane oxidation to denitrification decrease the demand for oxygen for methanol utilizing denitrifiers they can gain energy when oxidizing the organic compounds secreted by aerobic methanotroph strengthen the methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers is of great significance for the application of the ame d 5 conclusions we demonstrated that nitrate removal efficiency of the ame d process could be improved by operating the mbfr under a low o2 ch4 ratio it is thus far the highest nitrate removal efficiency obtained in an mbfr system for the ame d process in the mbfr some potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers i e methylobacillus methylotenera methylophilus and methyloversatilis were highly enriched moreover those enriched potential methanol utilizing denitrifiers formed many small aggregates co located with aerobic methanotrophs 5 10 Î¼m diameter based on these findings we speculated that the enhanced methanol linked synergy between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers resulted in the increased nitrogen removal efficiency in the mbfr if we assume methanol is the only cross feeding intermediate in the mbfr about 38 60 of ch4 will be converted to methanol and secreted rather than continuing to be oxidized at least 63 of this secreted methanol is apparently utilized for denitrification declaration of competing interest the authors
