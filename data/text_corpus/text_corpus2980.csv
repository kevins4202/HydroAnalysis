oxygen rich environment demonstrating the possibility to employ bacteria with two competitive respiration pathways for pollution detection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosensor bod monitoring acinetobacter eelectrotrophic bacteria heterotrophic respiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global water crisis becomes more serious because of water pollution boretti and rosa 2019 yan and wang 2022 more and more pollutants are deposited into natural water as the runoff moves called non point source pollutions and the on time measurement of these pollutions is critical to guarantee a safe water source for drinking wang et al 2019 organic compounds are usually the dominant pollutants in water which is a key indicator to monitor the quality of natural water mccabe et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 since it is hard to tell the concentration of each pollutant in water the measuring of biochemical oxygen demand bod is one of the applicable ways to evaluate the level of organic pollutions sonawane et al 2020 however as a parameter relating to microbial metabolism bod is measured on the basis of the amount of oxygen consumed by living microbes during degradation which usually takes a long time usually 5 days jiang et al 2016 and existing physical techniques such as spectroscopy and piezometry have high requirements for the measured water environment and large measurement errors these restricted bod to be an off line parameter table s1 not possible for the early warning of pollution in natural water in recent decades the cognitive breakthrough on bacterial extracellular electron transfer linked the microbial respiration to electrochemical signals directly li et al 2022 providing a fundamental to construct bioelectrochemical sensors for measurement online kim et al 2003 electroactive biofilm on the anode was employed as the sensing element which required a strict anaerobic environment to guarantee the anode to harvest all microbial electrons from organic oxidation jiang et al 2017 it had been successfully applied to monitor bod in multiple anaerobic scenarios such as anaerobic digestors and deoxygenated wastewaters guo and liu 2020 however not in oxygen rich environments but there is a heavy demand for bod monitoring in aerobic environments such as water quality control in aquaculture or the production of reclaimed water etc fortunately in addition to anaerobic heterotrophic exoelectrogens on the anode some aerobic autotrophs are able to catch electrons from the cathode taking oxygen as the electron acceptor to grow namely electrotrophs logan et al 2019 jiang et al firstly used electrotrophs as the sensing element to detect biotoxicity of formaldehyde which successfully reduced the minimum detection limit by 80 to 0 0005 jiang et al 2018 indicating that electrotrophs are more sensitive than heterotrophic exoelectrogens to target pollutants according to recent reports some of electrotrophs such as shewanella oneidensiss desulfosporosinus orientis thiobacillus delates and pseudomonas stutzeri are facultative autotrophs zaybak et al 2013 therefore we propose a hypothesis to use facultative electrotrophs as the sensing element to detect bod in aerobic environment the baseline current can be generated from their electrotrophic respiration when water samples are contaminated by organics these microbes may switch to heterotrophic respiration appearing as the decline of cathodic current here in order to demonstrate the possibility of the hypothesis mentioned above a novel sensor employing facultative electrotrophs as the sensing element was constructed we prepared the bioelectroactive sensor by immobilizing different electrotrophs isolated from

supplementary s1 a three electrode reactor was constructed as the prototype of bod sensor the prepared sensing electrode was connected to a potentiostat chi 1000c chenhua instruments co ltd shanghai china as the working electrode while a piece of platinum sheet 1 cm2 and an ag agcl electrode 4 0 m kcl 0 197 mv vs she were used as the counter and reference electrodes the potential of working

autolab pgstat 302 n metrohm switzerland all experiments were carried out in triplicate at room temperature 25 1 c 2 3 bod measurement and calculations glucose and acetate were selected as representative organics to test the sensitivity of bod sensors after successful activation of each sensor different concentrations of bod5 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l o2 consisting of glucose alone acetate alone and the mixture of both organics were utilized as lab simulated pollutions the reactor was recirculated with a pump and the electrolyte was continuously aerated to maintain a saturated oxygen concentration each test was compared to a control with only pure water added natural water in mati lake of nankai university and the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant at jinnan campus were collected as real samples to verify the applicability of this bod sensor the baseline current was obtained by pumping fresh lake water or the effluent of wastewater treatment plant into the sensor individually fig s2 the standard curve of bod5 and current drop was made by mixing acetate with different concentrations into each water samples the contaminated water samples for bod testing were prepared by 1 adding bovine serum protein or humic acid into real water samples 2 adding sediment extraction into lake water 3 adding domestic wastewater into the effluent as a comparison bod5 of each contaminated water samples were determined by the 5 day standard method lin et al 2022 other parameters including ph conductivity etc were listed in table s2 start up time ts referred to the time required to reach the peak current during the activation phase response time tr was the time elapsed from the moment of bod injection until the sensors approached typically 95 the final steady state current moon et al 2004 δ j ma m2 was defined as the changes of current density after exposure to organics to eliminate errors in the baseline currents between different reactors j was normalized as δ j j a j b where j b ma m2 the stable baseline current density before testing and j a ma m2 the stable current density after testing the sensitivity ss was calculated as s s δ j δ c where c mg l represented the injected bod5 concentrations 2 4 microbial and transcriptomic analysis the viability of bacterial cells on sensing electrodes were measured by staining all cells were

analysis http www genome jp eg pathway html of degs sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of cathodic bacteria for bod sensing the same bacterial loading 1 0 au μl cm2 of bl21 mr 1 and rag 1 were uniformly encapsulated using ptfe nafion as the binder to form artificial biofilms on electrodes fig s3a sem images showed that all three biofilms were consisted of rod shaped cells 3 5 μm in length 1 μm in diameter in contact with each other and cross linked by binders to form a rough and porous surface fig s3b clsm images of biofilms showed a nearly 78 viability after immobilization fig 1 a illustrating that the treatment had limited effect on cells all sensors were stabilized under 0 2 v for 20 h and then 50 mg l of bod5 standard solution was injected both viability and cellular activity of the non electrotropic bl21 declined by 72 0 3 and 49 0 4 figs 1b and s4 possibly because bl21 was heterotroph that cannot survive for a long time in autotrophic environment in contrast the viability and activity of two electrotrophs including mr 1 and rag 1 were relatively stable except for a slight loss of biomass for the electrochemical performance the rag 1 had the shortest start up time 7 h and the highest stable baseline currents 128 12 ma m2 while bl21 and sterile control barely produced current fig 1c similar results were more evident in cv curves the maximum current density of rag 1 reached the highest of 239 2 ma m2 which was 42 and 72 higher than that of mr 1 138 2 ma m2 and bl21 67 2 ma m2 fig s5 when acetate and lactic acid 50 mg l bod5 were individually injected into each sensor both rag 1 and mr 1 exhibited a fast decline in current the sensitivity of the rag 1 reached 2 2 0 2 ma m2 mg l which was 9 2 times higher than that of mr 1 0 24 0 02 ma m2 mg l figs 1c and s6 both bl21 and the control did not have any response thus rag 1 was selected as the key strain in the following studies 3 2 optimization of bacterial loading and binder the electroactivity of the biofilm determined the performance of this sensor according to previous reports the electroactivity of the biocathode closely related to the loading of bacteria massazza et al 2021 in this study the stable baseline current tended to increase with rag 1 loading approaching to a maximum fig 2 a which can be fitted well with a saturation kinetics of δ j 703 7 b l 1 9 b l fig 2b the plateau of baseline current was 474 6 ma m2 at a bl of 3 5 au μl cm2 with a constant value when bl further increased to 4 6 au μl cm2 interestingly δj and bl showed the similar saturation kinetics after acetate bod5 50 mg l addition fig 2c and d a normal understanding was that when the bl was in the range of 1 to 3 5 au μl cm2 the performance of the bioelectrochemical sensor was limited by the amount of electrotrophs involved in the cathode electron transfer however as the bacterial population gradually saturates the rates of mass transfer and the cathode electron transfer become limiting factors at this time the baseline current did not increase correspondingly and j tended to be stable according to the relevant definition of sensitivity the higher baseline current the higher sensitivity of the biosensors so the bacterial loading was optimized as 3 5 au μl cm2 the natural formation of autotrophic biofilms are time consuming and susceptible to culture conditions qi et al 2021 this is a key bottleneck for bioelectrochemical sensors that use electrotrophic biofilms as the sensing element to develop a rapid method to prepare artificial biofilms with excellent electroactivity and stability 4 binders including sodium alginate nafion ptfe and nafion ptfe were tested to immobilize rag 1 on electrodes fig s7 according to cv curves the current densities decreased as nafion ptfe 164 2 a m2 nafion 141 2 a m2 sodium alginate 97 2 a m2 ptfe 49 2 a m2 fig 3 a when the sensor was operated at 0 2 v the artificial biofilm using nafion ptfe hybrid binder had the highest baseline current density 127 2 a m2 and sensitivity 2 5 0 1 ma m2 mg l fig 3b and c ptfe was found to wrap around rag 1 cells tightly fig 3d providing a relatively stronger bond to electrodes but with a lower current because the hydrophobic surface was not suitable for ion diffusion while the use of hydrophilic binders such as nafion and sodium alginate had a relatively higher baseline current than ptfe but they suffered from falling off during long time operations mixing part of hydrophobic polymer into hydrophilic binder was found to substantially enhance the stability and therefore the sensor performance wang et al 2010 3 3 measurement of bod using lab simulated and real water samples aiming to test the applicability of this new sensor to various water samples we prepared three lab simulated water samples by adding different amounts of acetate glucose and the mixture of both to water to final bod5 of 5 to 50 mg l fig 4 a c simulated water samples were air saturated before being fed into the reactor do was monitored to be stable during the whole process of bod measurement fig s8 it was shown that δj linearly increased with bod5 and the r2 were all above 0 96 r1 2 0 9915 r2 2 0 9839 r3 2 0 9630 fig 4d the biosensor had different sensitivity to different types of organics with values decreased from 9 9 0 6 ma m2 mg l of glucose to 5 2 0 5 ma m2 mg l of the mixture and 3 8 0 2 ma m2 mg l of acetate this indicated that the sensor was able to determine the bod accurately with acetate or glucose as the simulated contamination to further confirm the practical value of the sensor it was then utilized to measure protein humic acid and unknown contaminations in oxygen saturated water samples from real environments including lake water and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant table s2 standard curves were plotted using acetate to simulate different concentrations of bod in the actual environment as soon as each water sample was injected into the sensor a sudden decrease in current was observed fig 5 a and the δj linearly decreased with the bod5 concentration r4 2 0 9825 r5 2 0 9924 fig 5b demonstrating that the sensor was able to measure bod in complex natural water independent of the complex physical and chemical properties of the water sample the sensor covered the bod range of 0 40 mg l required by the environmental quality standards for surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment in china gb 3838 2002 and gb 18918 2002 with a short response time of 0 3 to 3 h for testing bod originated from protein humic acid extraction of lake sediment or domestic wastewater showing the possibility of online monitoring of bod in real environments fig 5c most importantly the bod values measured by the sensor had an error of less than 10 compared to the bod5 obtained by the 5 day standard method table s3 similar to lab simulated samples the sensor also exhibited different sensitivities to different samples from real environments fig 5d this could be attributed to the specific metabolic pathways of rag 1 to different substrates which can be further utilized as identity tags to recognize specific components from mixed water samples with the help of machine learning in the future du et al 2022 additionally the interference of toxicants in natural water could be distinguished by the characteristic response of the current changes fig s9 the specific response of the biosensor to the toxicant 1 8 mg l formaldehyde to simulate was manifested as a transient current rise due to microbial stress prevoteau et al 2019 and an irrecoverable current drop which was due to the inhibition of rag 1 metabolic activity by the toxicant that could not be recovered in a short time in contrast bod was consumed by microorganisms which gradually slow down the competition for electron donors and could restore the current autonomously this sensor enabled a rapid and accurate measurement of bod with specific components and was also capable to estimate the bod range of unknown pollutants in real water samples although more tests including the longevity the performance at various temperature the natural fouling on the sensing element have to be investigated in the future as a sensor developed to measure low concentration of bod it only suits to be utilized in water quality monitoring of oligotrophic environments fig s10 3 4 genetic evidence of switchover of electrotrophic and heterotrophic respirations in order to interpret the response mechanisms of rag 1 to bod 4 different bacterial samples collected from different periods hr er dt and at were submitted for transcriptomic analysis analysis of degs revealed that significant gene expression differences log2fc 1 occurred between the heterotrophic and electrotrophic respiratory states with a total of 1087 degs were altered figs s11 and s12 among them a large number of degs related to carbon metabolism energy metabolism nadh atp fad and fatty acid metabolism were identified fig s13 which were the basis for aerobic respiratory metabolism in cells in detail genes related to glycolysis f959 rs12580 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase f959 rs07510 phosphoglycerate kinase eno phosphopyruvate hydratase f959 rs13710 ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase fatty acid synthesis and degradation as well as atp and fad were generally upregulated in electrotrophic growth compared to the heterotrophic growth whereas genes related to nadp were generally downregulated fig 6 a more interestingly these genes were diminished in upregulation and enhanced in downregulation during the bod testing suggesting that these upregulated genes were essential in electrotrophic respiration while the downregulated genes were strongly associated with heterotrophic respiration of rag 1 importantly the expression of glta citrate synthase was significantly upregulated whenever the electrotrophic respiratory happened er dt at where high level of glta were the most critical enzyme for promoting bacteria toward the reverse oxidative tca cycle rotca zhang et al 2020 thus this was preliminary key evidence that rag 1 underwent autotrophic respiration on the electrode the metabolic processes of rag 1 under the heterotrophic or electrotrophic respiration were postulated by comprehensive analysis of degs fig 6b in the heterotrophic state rag 1 carried out the carbon metabolic cycle and aerobic respiratory energy metabolism normally like ordinary bacteria organics were converted to acetyl coa via pyruvate to enter the tca cycle and eventually oxidized to produce co2 and h2o nadh transferred electrons through respiratory chain accompanied by an oxidative phosphorylation process to produce atp electrons were transferred inside the bacterial cell when rag 1 performed the electrotrophic respiration on the electrode electrons were transferred from the electrode across cell membrane to o2 possibly via the respiratory chain systems of fad the proton motive force generated during this process partly promoted the continuous synthesis of atp and the rest powered the carbon metabolism to realize co2 fixation carbon metabolism relied mainly on the highly expressed citrate synthase glta to promote the production of acetyl coa which in turn synthesizes pyruvate into the rotca cycle to produce the nutrients needed for microbial growth electrons that powering the synthesis of the atp in rag 1 were competitively supplied by bod or electrodes during the bod testing the enhancement of degs associated with nadh and atp indicated that the addition of organics shifted a part of rag 1 from electrotrophic to heterotrophic respiration notably f959 rs13710 padj 0 05 a key enzyme associated with the pentose phosphate pathway which was the key pathway for cells to produce 5 phosphate ribose from intracellular glucose tang et al 2021 was significantly downregulated during the bod testing when rag 1 was suddenly exposed to bod from electrotrophic growth the bacteria preferred to utilize the more readily and metabolizable organics thereby the original intracellular glycogen metabolism was downregulated however in contrast to the fully heterotrophic respiratory state degs during the bod testing showed evidence of electrotrophic respiration in terms of energy and material metabolism suggesting that a part of the bacteria may keep on respirating via electrode or the bacteria turned on both heterotrophic and electrode respiratory pathways requiring more in depth studies rag 1 gradually returned back to electrotrophic respiration after the bod testing and their gene expressions were almost identical compared to those sampled before bod addition supporting that the switchover of electrotrophic and heterotrophic respiration of rag 1 was reversible which also demonstrated the commercial value of the reusability of the biosensors overall we proposed a new strategy to realize the fast measurement of bod in oxygen rich environment and demonstrated it using a strain of facultative electrotrophic bacteria of acinetobacter venetiensis rag 1 fig 7 rag 1 performed electrotrophic respiration in autotrophic environment producing a baseline current by taking in electrons from the electrode to reduce oxygen once the water was contaminated by bod parts of rag 1 switched to heterotrophic respiration because rag 1 preferred to consume metabolizable organics as the electron donor this was reflected as a decline on current density and the bod concentration can be fast calculated from δj transcriptomics identified the key pathways that may involve in the switchover and confirmed the transition between both respirations was repeatable and the recoverability of the current change was markedly different from the current decrease due to the inhibition of metabolic activity of electrotrophs induced by toxic substances 4 conclusions it is a strong demand to measure bod online in oxygen rich environment such as the monitoring of water quality in reservoir however so far as we known there s no technology can achieve this goal until this new principle of bod sensing was proposed our works demonstrated the switchover between electrotrophic and heterotrophic respirations was able to sensitively detect bod showing the possibility to employ bacteria switching between two competitive metabolic pathways as biosensors with the further study on the metabolic pathways of facultative electrotrophic bacteria we can deeply understand how these bacteria adapt to contaminated environments and whether they can return back to their autotrophic respiration after pollutants are removed on the basis of this new principle we believe more and more bacteria can be found suitable as sensing elements and this new biosensor can be commercially applied in the online monitoring of bod in multiple environmental scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

representative organics to test the sensitivity of bod sensors after successful activation of each sensor different concentrations of bod5 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l o2 consisting of glucose alone acetate alone and the mixture of both organics were utilized as lab simulated pollutions the reactor was recirculated with a pump and the electrolyte was continuously aerated to maintain a saturated oxygen concentration each test was compared to a control with only pure water added natural water in mati lake of nankai university and the effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant at jinnan campus were collected as real samples to verify the applicability of this bod sensor the baseline current was obtained by pumping fresh lake water or the effluent of wastewater treatment plant into the sensor individually fig s2 the standard curve of bod5 and current drop was made by mixing acetate with different concentrations into each water samples the contaminated water samples for bod testing were prepared by 1 adding bovine serum protein or humic acid into real water samples 2 adding sediment extraction into lake water 3 adding domestic wastewater into the effluent as a comparison bod5 of each contaminated water samples were determined by the 5 day standard method lin et al 2022 other parameters including ph conductivity etc were listed in table s2 start up time ts referred to the time required to reach the peak current during the activation phase response time tr was the time elapsed from the moment of bod injection until the sensors approached typically 95 the final steady state current moon et al 2004 δ j ma m2 was defined as the changes of current density after exposure to organics to eliminate errors in the baseline currents between different reactors j was normalized as δ j j a j b where j b ma m2 the stable baseline current density before testing and j a ma m2 the stable current density after testing the sensitivity ss was calculated as s s δ j δ c where c mg l represented the injected bod5 concentrations 2 4 microbial and transcriptomic analysis the viability of bacterial cells on sensing electrodes were measured by staining all cells were stained by the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l13152 thermo fisher scientific under dark conditions for 30 min before rinsing with 50 mm pbs to remove excess dye and a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm880 zeiss germany was employed to image additionally excitation wavelengths of 340 380 nm and emission wavelengths of 435 485 nm were set to excite the autofluorescence of proteins in the biofilm which had been reported to monitor cellular metabolism and redox levels wu et al 2007 the morphological structures of the artificial biofilms were characterized by scanning

analysis http www genome jp eg pathway html of degs sets 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of cathodic bacteria for bod sensing the same bacterial loading 1 0 au μl cm2 of bl21 mr 1 and rag 1 were uniformly encapsulated using ptfe nafion as the binder to form artificial biofilms on electrodes fig s3a sem images showed that all three biofilms were consisted of rod shaped cells 3 5 μm in length 1 μm in diameter in contact with each other and cross linked by binders to form a rough and porous surface fig s3b clsm images of biofilms showed a nearly 78 viability after immobilization fig 1 a illustrating that the treatment had limited effect on cells all sensors were stabilized under 0 2 v for 20 h and then 50 mg l of bod5 standard solution was injected both viability and cellular activity of the non electrotropic bl21 declined by 72 0 3 and 49 0 4 figs 1b and s4 possibly because bl21 was heterotroph that cannot survive for a long time in autotrophic environment in contrast the viability and activity of two electrotrophs including mr 1 and rag 1 were relatively stable except for a slight loss of biomass for the electrochemical performance the rag 1 had the shortest start up time 7 h and the highest stable baseline currents 128 12 ma m2 while bl21 and sterile control barely produced current fig 1c similar results were more evident in cv curves the maximum current density of rag 1 reached the highest of 239 2 ma m2 which was 42 and 72 higher than that of mr 1 138 2 ma m2 and bl21 67 2 ma m2 fig s5 when acetate and lactic acid 50 mg l bod5 were individually injected into each sensor both rag 1 and mr 1 exhibited a fast decline in current the sensitivity of the rag 1 reached 2 2 0 2 ma m2 mg l which was 9 2 times higher than that of mr 1 0 24 0 02 ma m2 mg l figs 1c and s6 both bl21 and the control did not have any response thus rag 1 was selected as the key strain in the following studies 3 2 optimization of bacterial loading and binder the electroactivity of the biofilm determined the performance of this sensor according to previous reports the electroactivity of the biocathode closely related to the loading of bacteria massazza et al 2021 in this study the stable baseline current tended to increase with rag 1 loading approaching to a maximum fig 2 a which can be fitted well with a saturation kinetics of δ j 703 7 b l 1 9 b l fig 2b the plateau of baseline current was 474 6 ma m2 at a bl of 3 5 au μl cm2 with a constant value when bl further increased to 4 6 au μl cm2 interestingly δj and bl showed the similar saturation kinetics after acetate bod5 50 mg l addition fig 2c and d a normal understanding was that when the bl was in the range of 1 to 3 5 au μl cm2 the performance of the bioelectrochemical sensor was limited by the amount of electrotrophs involved in the cathode electron transfer however as the bacterial population gradually saturates the rates of mass transfer and the cathode electron transfer become limiting factors at this time the baseline current did not increase correspondingly and j tended to be stable according to the relevant definition of sensitivity the higher baseline current the higher sensitivity of the biosensors so the bacterial loading was optimized as 3 5 au μl cm2 the natural formation of autotrophic biofilms are time consuming and susceptible to culture conditions qi et al 2021 this is a key bottleneck for bioelectrochemical sensors that use electrotrophic biofilms as the sensing element to develop a rapid method to prepare artificial biofilms with excellent electroactivity and stability 4 binders including sodium alginate nafion ptfe and nafion ptfe were tested to immobilize rag 1 on electrodes fig s7 according to cv curves the current densities decreased as nafion ptfe 164 2 a m2 nafion 141 2 a m2 sodium alginate 97 2 a m2 ptfe 49 2 a m2 fig 3 a when the sensor was operated at 0 2 v the artificial biofilm using nafion ptfe hybrid binder had the highest baseline current density 127 2 a m2 and sensitivity 2 5 0 1 ma m2 mg l fig 3b and c ptfe was found to wrap around rag 1 cells tightly fig 3d providing a relatively stronger bond to electrodes but with a lower current because the hydrophobic surface was not suitable for ion diffusion while the use of hydrophilic binders such as nafion and sodium alginate had a relatively higher baseline current than ptfe but they suffered from falling off during long time operations mixing part of hydrophobic polymer into hydrophilic binder was found to substantially enhance the stability and therefore the sensor performance wang et al 2010 3 3 measurement of bod using lab simulated and real water samples aiming to test the applicability of this new sensor to various water samples we prepared three lab simulated water samples by adding different amounts of acetate glucose and the mixture of both to water to final bod5 of 5 to 50 mg l fig 4 a c simulated water samples were air saturated before being fed into the reactor do was monitored to be stable during the whole process of bod measurement fig s8 it was shown that δj linearly increased with bod5 and the r2 were all above 0 96 r1 2 0 9915 r2 2 0 9839 r3 2 0 9630 fig 4d the biosensor had different sensitivity to different types of organics with values decreased from 9 9 0 6 ma m2 mg l of glucose to 5 2 0 5 ma m2 mg l of the mixture and 3 8 0 2 ma m2 mg l of acetate this indicated that the sensor was able to determine the bod accurately with acetate or glucose as the simulated contamination to further confirm the practical value of the sensor it was then utilized to measure protein humic acid and unknown contaminations in oxygen saturated water samples from real environments including lake water and the effluent of wastewater treatment plant table s2 standard curves were plotted using acetate to simulate different concentrations of bod in the actual environment as soon as each water sample was injected into the sensor a sudden decrease in current was observed fig 5 a and the δj linearly decreased with the bod5 concentration r4 2 0 9825 r5 2 0 9924 fig 5b demonstrating that the sensor was able to measure bod in complex natural water independent of the complex physical and chemical properties of the water sample the sensor covered the bod range of 0 40 mg l required by the environmental quality standards for surface water and effluent of wastewater treatment in china gb 3838 2002 and gb 18918 2002 with a short response time of 0 3 to 3 h for testing bod originated from protein humic acid extraction of lake sediment or domestic wastewater showing the possibility of online monitoring of bod in real environments fig 5c most importantly the bod values measured by the sensor had an error of less than 10 compared to the bod5 obtained by the 5 day standard method table s3 similar to lab simulated samples the sensor also exhibited different sensitivities to different samples from real environments fig 5d this could be attributed to the specific metabolic pathways of rag 1 to different substrates which can be further utilized as identity tags to recognize specific components from mixed water samples with the help of machine learning in the future du et al 2022 additionally the interference of toxicants in natural water could be distinguished by the characteristic response of the current changes fig s9 the specific response of the biosensor to the toxicant 1 8 mg l formaldehyde to simulate was manifested as a transient current rise due to microbial stress prevoteau et al 2019 and an irrecoverable current drop which was due to the inhibition of rag 1 metabolic activity by the toxicant that could not be recovered in a short time in contrast bod was consumed by microorganisms which gradually slow down the competition for electron donors and could restore the current autonomously this sensor enabled a rapid and accurate measurement of bod with specific components and was also capable to estimate the bod range of unknown pollutants in real water samples although more tests including the longevity the performance at various temperature the natural fouling on the sensing element have to be investigated in the future as a sensor developed to measure low concentration of bod it only suits to be utilized in water quality monitoring of oligotrophic environments fig s10 3 4 genetic evidence of switchover of electrotrophic and heterotrophic respirations in order to interpret the response mechanisms of rag 1 to bod 4 different bacterial samples collected from different periods hr er dt and at were submitted for transcriptomic analysis analysis of degs revealed that significant gene expression differences log2fc 1 occurred between the heterotrophic and electrotrophic respiratory states with a total of 1087 degs were altered figs s11 and s12 among them a large number of degs related to carbon metabolism energy metabolism nadh atp fad and fatty acid metabolism were identified fig s13 which were the basis for aerobic respiratory metabolism in cells in detail genes related to glycolysis f959 rs12580 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase f959 rs07510 phosphoglycerate kinase eno phosphopyruvate hydratase f959 rs13710 ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinase fatty acid synthesis and degradation as well as atp and fad were generally upregulated in electrotrophic growth compared to the heterotrophic growth whereas genes related to nadp were generally downregulated fig 6 a more interestingly these genes were diminished in upregulation and enhanced in downregulation during the bod testing suggesting that these upregulated genes were essential in electrotrophic respiration while the downregulated genes were strongly associated with heterotrophic respiration of rag 1 importantly the expression of glta citrate synthase was significantly upregulated whenever the electrotrophic respiratory happened er dt at where high level of glta were the most critical enzyme for promoting bacteria toward the reverse oxidative tca cycle rotca zhang et al 2020 thus this was preliminary key evidence that rag 1 underwent autotrophic respiration on the electrode the metabolic processes of rag 1 under the heterotrophic or electrotrophic respiration were postulated by comprehensive analysis of degs fig 6b in the heterotrophic state rag 1 carried out the carbon metabolic cycle and aerobic respiratory energy metabolism normally like ordinary bacteria organics were converted to acetyl coa via pyruvate to enter the tca cycle and eventually oxidized to produce co2 and h2o nadh transferred electrons through respiratory chain accompanied by an oxidative phosphorylation process to produce atp electrons were transferred inside the bacterial cell when rag 1 performed the electrotrophic respiration on the electrode electrons were transferred from the electrode across cell membrane to o2 possibly via the respiratory chain systems of fad the proton motive force generated during this process partly promoted the continuous synthesis of atp and the rest powered the carbon metabolism to realize co2 fixation carbon metabolism relied mainly on the highly expressed citrate synthase glta to promote the production of acetyl coa which in turn synthesizes pyruvate into the rotca cycle to produce the nutrients needed for microbial growth electrons that powering the synthesis of the atp in rag 1 were competitively supplied by bod or electrodes during the bod testing the enhancement of degs associated with nadh and atp indicated that the addition of organics shifted a part of rag 1 from electrotrophic to heterotrophic respiration notably f959 rs13710 padj 0 05 a key enzyme associated with the pentose phosphate pathway which was the key pathway for cells to produce 5 phosphate ribose from intracellular glucose tang et al 2021 was significantly downregulated during the bod testing when rag 1 was suddenly exposed to bod from electrotrophic growth the bacteria preferred to utilize the more readily and metabolizable organics thereby the original intracellular glycogen metabolism was downregulated however in contrast to the fully heterotrophic respiratory state degs during the bod testing showed evidence of electrotrophic respiration in terms of energy and material metabolism suggesting that a part of the bacteria may keep on respirating via electrode or the bacteria turned on both heterotrophic and electrode respiratory pathways requiring more in depth studies rag 1 gradually returned back to electrotrophic respiration after the bod testing and their gene expressions were almost identical compared to those sampled before bod addition supporting that the switchover of electrotrophic and heterotrophic respiration of rag 1 was reversible which also demonstrated the commercial value of the reusability of the biosensors overall we proposed a new strategy to realize the fast measurement of bod in oxygen rich environment and demonstrated it using a strain of facultative electrotrophic bacteria of acinetobacter venetiensis rag 1 fig 7 rag 1 performed electrotrophic respiration in autotrophic environment producing a baseline current by taking in electrons from the electrode to reduce oxygen once the water was contaminated by bod parts of rag 1 switched to heterotrophic respiration because rag 1 preferred to consume metabolizable organics as the electron donor this was reflected as a decline on current density and the bod concentration can be fast calculated from δj transcriptomics identified the key pathways that may involve in the switchover and confirmed the transition between both respirations was repeatable and the recoverability of the current change was markedly different from the current decrease due to the inhibition of metabolic activity of electrotrophs induced by toxic substances 4 conclusions it is a strong demand to measure bod online in oxygen rich environment such as the monitoring of water quality in reservoir however so far as we known there s no technology can achieve this goal until this new principle of bod sensing was proposed our works demonstrated the switchover between electrotrophic and heterotrophic respirations was able to sensitively detect bod showing the possibility to employ bacteria switching between two competitive metabolic pathways as biosensors with the further study on the metabolic pathways of facultative electrotrophic bacteria we can deeply understand how these bacteria adapt to contaminated environments and whether they can return back to their autotrophic respiration after pollutants are removed on the basis of this new principle we believe more and more bacteria can be found suitable as sensing elements and this new biosensor can be commercially applied in the online monitoring of bod in multiple environmental scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

appreciable amounts of fresh waste leachate having high nh4 nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2015 the high ammonia nitrogen content means that the leachate could be treated for resource recovery santos et al 2020 thus moving from a contaminant removal model to a sustainable wastewater treatment model with nutrient recovery wu and céline 2022 commercial ammonia stripping is widely used to remove nh3 from waste leachate kurniawan et al 2021 at present the large scale reactors required and the low ammonia removal efficiency restrict the application of conventional stripping technology li et al 2020 the use of many alkaline chemicals and the long operation times also pose serious challenges to stripping operations kinidi et al 2018 thus the development of novel equipment is urgently required to improve the mass transfer performance and economic efficiency of ammonia stripping applications one potential solution is to use process intensification technology to reduce the capital cost chen et al 2021 examined existing advanced ammonia removal technologies and reported that stripping coupled with a high gravity field could reduce the cost of removing ammonia from wastewater by 8 compared with conventional stripper towers high gravity technology as realized with a rotating packed bed rpb effectively enhances the gas liquid mass transfer effect by overcoming boundary barriers at the gas liquid interface through strong centrifugal forces tung and mah 2007 rpbs can be classified into three categories according to the direction of gas flow co current counter current and cross current dhaneesh and ranganathan 2022 at high rotational speeds the reduction in gas pressure results in less energy consumption and lower operating costs in the co current flow mode than in the counter flow and cross flow modes but these savings are offset by a reduction in the mass transfer effect chu et al 2014a the successful application of multi stage rpbs in distillation overcomes the short gas liquid contact time luo et al 2016 and has the potential to achieve effective mass transfer especially in processes requiring long residence times for both the gas and liquid wang et al 2019 mathematical models and visual experiments have demonstrated that the most important section for mass transfer in rpbs is the end effect zone of the packing bed guo et al 2014 multiple passes through the area from the inner edge of the packing bed to the point where the liquid is captured by the rotating packing bed are instrumental in improving the mass transfer efficiency luo et al 2016 connecting co current flow rpbs in cycle series to form a multi stage model produces a better balance between energy consumption and efficiency however few studies have investigated such an approach to ammonia stripping and high gravity technology has rarely been applied to raw waste leachate treatment despite the good performance of rpbs in ammonia stripping predicting the rpb mass transfer performance is theoretically complex owing to the variation in mass transfer coefficients at various points in the contactor ghadyanlou et al 2021 for such complex nonlinear issues machine learning ml provides an instrumental solution with its simple model structure and efficient simulation process wang et al 2022b research on ml algorithms and their applications has gradually gained attention over recent years for example qaiyum et al 2019 presented an improved interval type 2 fuzzy c means clustering algorithm based on ant colony optimization and subsequently improved this algorithm to handle large data streams qaiyum et al 2020 the prediction and classification of water quality islam and irshad 2022 thermoelectric air cooling system parameters sayed et al 2021 and airborne particle bound matter almalawi et al 2022 have benefited from the application of ml techniques ml has also been employed to minimize the mass transfer limitations encountered in rpbs liu et al 2018 various ml approaches can be applied such as support vector machines aftab et al 2021 random forests zhu et al 2022 artificial neural networks anns wang et al 2022a and tree based models rahmani et al 2022 a scalable boosting tree system named extreme gradient boosting xgb is an excellent ensemble algorithm that harnesses the power of weak learners to achieve strong performance li et al 2022b the design of parallel learning column blocks cache aware access and out of core computation blocks ensure the high computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of the xgb algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 the applicability and successful implementation of xgb for small sample datasets in the environmental science field has been demonstrated in recent studies on atmospheric pollutant concentrations li et al 2022a biochar adsorption performance pathy et al 2020 heavy metal contamination bhagat et al 2021 and beach water quality li et al 2022b nevertheless few studies have applied the xgb algorithm to the treatment of wastewater to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional ammonia stripping industry this paper describes the use of a multi stage co current flow rpb to upgrade the treatment process of fresh waste leachate the xgb algorithm is systematically applied to provide predictions of the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping performance finally the feature importance is evaluated for the predictive model via the shapley additive explanation shap framework the combination of high gravity technology with an ml model not only provides a more effective method for removing ammonia from leachate but also addresses the lack of tree based integrated algorithms applied in this field the results of this study are expected to make a significant contribution to the efficient stripping of ammonia from fresh waste leachate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus fig 1 shows a schematic of the laboratory scale high gravity integrated

rpb horizontal shaft packing motor casing gas inlet outlet liquid inlet outlet and distributor gas liquid separation unit equipped with a packing bed an tank for absorbing exhaust gas and auxiliary devices air compressor liquid pump gas flow meter liquid flow meter and wastewater tank table a1 summarizes the characteristics of the rpb reactor the fresh raw waste leachate used in the present study was supplied by the beijing chaoyang municipal solid waste site in china the leachate had an original ph of 6 6 5 and was obtained after filtering through a coarse grid to remove coarse suspended solids the properties of the leachate are listed in table 1 the naoh used to adjust the ph was procured from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all other reagents used were of analytical grade the ph of the raw waste leachate was adjusted with a known amount of naoh before the experiment and the leachate was then fed from the wastewater tank into the center of the rpb air was fed into the center of the rpb by an air compressor at the same time during the reaction process the gas and the liquid were transported in the same direction throughout the co current flow rpb as shown by the arrows in fig 1 the gas and liquid left the bottom of the reactor at the same time and entered the gas liquid separation unit where they were separated according to their difference in density the gas liquid separation unit was equipped with a packing bed and the gas after passing through the packing bed was conducted to sealed gas scrubbers containing sulfuric acid solution to finally obtain nh4so4 the liquid entrained in the gas was trapped by the packing bed and pooled with the liquid remaining below the gas liquid separation unit to form the effluent from which samples were taken for testing and analysis all experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions at a room temperature of 20 5 c repeated analyses of the obtained samples were performed in triplicate to verify that the obtained results were within accepted analytical error 5 ammonia nitrogen was analyzed using distillation neutralization titration and a kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer buchi distillation unit k 350 the ph was measured using a ph meter hq30d 2 2 theoretical calculation throughout the experiments the stripping efficiency η liquid residence time t and liquid volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla

value of output variable y 2 4 model development and hyperparameter tuning the tree based xgb model was developed using the experimental data by considering the operational parameters as input variables their roles and effects on the performance of high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping were predicted the dataset obtained in the experiments was randomly divided into two parts 70 of the dataset was used for ml model training and the remaining 30 was used for the final model testing the xgboost 1 6 1 package was used to fit the gradient boosted regression tree ensemble the main idea of this algorithm is that each update is based on the prediction results of the previous model the objective function is chen and guestrin 2016 4 y i 0 y i 1 y i 0 f 1 x i y i 2 y i 1 f 2 x i y i

feature respectively n is the data point at any given instance and n is the total number of data points after the models had been trained and achieved satisfactory predictive performance the shap framework was applied to interpret the model shap theory constructs an additive interpretation model that treats all feature quantities as contributors to the target prediction zhong et al 2022 the shapley value was calculated as gao et al 2022 7 j v a l s x 1 x p x j s p s 1 p v a l s x j v a l s where s is a subset of all features x denotes the vector feature values of the samples to be explained p is the number of features val s x j denotes the prediction by the built ml model considering feature x j and val s denotes the prediction without considering feature x j the differences among all possible subsets of s n are calculated according to the dependency of the effect of withholding a feature on other features in the ml model a feature with a higher absolute shapley value makes a greater contribution to the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping performance all the calculations and ml methods described here were performed using qrigin 2022 and the python programming language version 3 10 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of ph the ammonia stripping performance is affected by the fraction of free ammonia and depends on factors that influence the chemical equilibrium such as the ph and temperature karri et al 2018 ammonium ions nh4 in wastewater first generate ammonia monohydrate nh3 h2o as an intermediate product during conversion to the gaseous ammonia molecules that leave the system the distribution of nh3 h2o in the aqueous solution is presented in table 3 jiang et al 2019 in removing all ammonia nitrogen compounds the ph of the raw waste leachate is allowed to increase above a certain value to induce the conversion of almost all nh4 into the gaseous form nh3 el gohary and kamel 2016 fig 2 shows that the maximum ammonia removal efficiency increases from 42 to 90 as the ph increases from 9 to 11 during the stripping process in a high gravity field the leachate stripping is relatively poor at ph 9 with the high gravity field being ineffective under low ph conditions ammonia monohydrate is difficult to generate as a physical process air stripping has a limited ability to facilitate the further conversion of ammonia monohydrate to gas molecules at ph 10 the removal of ammonia under an 800 rpm high gravity field is 48 greater than that achieved with a normal gravity field indicating that the high gravity field plays an important role the molar ratio of ammonia monohydrate in the system exceeds 80 following the increase in ph at this molar ratio air stripping promotes a cycle series of changes from ammonium ions to ammonia monohydrate and then to gaseous ammonia molecules the high gravity field coupled stripping enhances this promotion and the removal rate achieved using the 800 rpm high gravity field at ph 10 is close to that achieved using the normal gravity field at an even higher ph value of 12 thereafter the enhancement effect of the high gravity field decreases with any further increase in ph the high ph leads to a large accumulation of ammonia monohydrate in the system whereby any form of air stripping can easily extract ammonia in this case the contribution of the high gravity field is not obvious overall the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping is mainly dependent on the ph but the high gravity field improves the ammonia removal under low ph conditions enabling almost the same removal effect as achieved at higher ph values this is most important in terms of reducing the use of alkaline chemicals in leachate treatment and promoting the environmentally friendly development of the wastewater treatment industry 3 2 effects of operational parameters 3 2 1 rpb rotation speed n fig 3 a shows that η and kla obviously increase with the rotation speed n the kla value of 0 00055 s 1 at n 1200 rpm is approximately 2 5 times that of the control with no high gravity field n 0 rpm η increases by approximately 28 the enhanced mass transfer rate is attributable to the accelerated centrifugal force which generates a high gravity field and breaks the heterogeneous interface barriers wu et al 2020 the mechanism whereby the mass transfer improves under high gravity is mainly based on the enhancement of liquid flow which includes both perturbation and cutting effects the perturbation effects of a high gravity field increase the frequency of liquid surface renewal and this constant renewal of the interface enhances the gas liquid transfer process chen et al 2004 surface renewal theory states that the fluid in the flow process is constantly exposed to air providing the liquid with a greater opportunity to make contact with the gas luo et al 2021 the increase in the gas liquid contact area and the renewal frequency increase the interphase material transfer per unit time additionally the cutting effect of the high gravity field on the liquid divides the liquid into small units which greatly reduces the molecular mass transfer resistance in the liquid wang et al 2021 the rate of molecular diffusion of substances in the liquid phase is approximately 4 5 orders of magnitude smaller than that in the gas phase and the liquid film resistance accounts for 5 40 of the total mass transfer resistance in the gas liquid mass transfer hence the enhanced liquid flow greatly reduces the mass transfer resistance of air stripping and effectively increases the efficiency of ammonia removal however the actual flow of liquid in the rpb under different rotation speeds is complex and variable fig 3 shows that the mass transfer is mainly enhanced at rotation speeds of 200 1000 rpm a visualization of the rpb reveals that at low rotation speeds severe liquid maldistribution occurs with predominant rivulet flow on the packing bed resulting in poor mass transfer wang et al 2019 rivulet flow is replaced by more droplets as the rotation speed increases and droplets are widely believed to dominate the mass transfer performance wang et al 2019 the reduction in mass transfer resistance with further increases in rotation speed is counterbalanced by the reduction in the liquid residence time which hinders further improvement of the mass transfer performance of the rotating bed as a result the ammonia stripping efficiency and mass transfer coefficient remain almost constant xie et al 2017 3 2 2 air supply qg fig 3 b shows that η and kla increase with increasing qg after five stages under a set liquid flow rate as qg increases from 2000 to 6000 l h η increases by 19 and kla increases by a factor of approximately 1 7 the transfer of ammonia between the gas and liquid phases is a typical gas film controlled process and the increase in qg effectively reduces the gas phase resistance thus the ammonia removal performance improves with an increasing gas flow rate yin et al 2018 as the residence time of the air in the rpb shortens the ammonium content per unit time and volume in the air decrease which increases the equilibrium driving force this is beneficial to the stripping of ammonia gui and li 2019 additionally higher air velocities cut and break the liquid surface through the intense turbulence between the two phases on the contact surface areas this not only produces a larger contact area between the gas and liquid but also reduces the liquid film thickness gui and li 2019 fig 3 b shows that the variation in kla follows the same trend as the variation in η this indicates that kla is almost unaffected by the variation in qg investigations on the two phase reactions of ammonia and water have revealed that there is only a weak correlation between the gas phase mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer performance in rpbs wang et al 2019 3 2 3 liquid supply ql the experimental results presented in fig 3 c clearly show that kla increases and η decreases as the liquid flow rate rises this phenomenon is consistent with that reported in studies on ammonia nitrogen removal from preparation water yuan et al 2016 kla increases by a factor of 3 as ql increases from 4 to 20 l h this is mainly because of an increase in the quantities of droplets liquid filaments and liquid films within the rpb as the liquid inlet velocity rises at a fixed rotation speed which enhances the gas liquid interfacial area and liquid side mass transfer coefficient ouyang et al 2018 studies on liquid mass transfer coefficients for different rpbs such as stainless wire mesh packing beds zhang et al 2011 and blade packing beds lin and jian 2007 suggest that the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient is exponentially proportional to the liquid flow rate as expressed by eq 8 and the magnitude of the proportionality coefficient is closely related to the packing structure and material tsai and chen 2015 8 k l a q l n fig 3 c also shows that there is an 18 decrease in η and a 42 min reduction in the liquid residence time as ql rises from 4 to 20 l h this contrasts with the relation between kla and ql the results show that the liquid film on the packing surface thickens as the liquid flow rate increases which is supported by a study on the determination of the liquid holding rates of packing beds using x ray computed tomography yang et al 2015 hence an increase in the liquid flow rate increases the rpb liquid holding rate an increase in the liquid holding rate and a decrease in the average liquid residence time weaken the surface renewal effect of the supergravity field on the liquid reducing the total amount of ammonia transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase per unit volume yuan et al 2016 this is reflected by the decrease in the total amount of ammonia removed from 1414 to 1061 mg per liter of leachate fig 3 c the throughput of the equipment increases by up to a factor of 5 as ql increases from 4 to 20 l h a simple mass balance shows a much higher rate of total ammonia separation from the liquid despite the lower stripping efficiency yin et al 2018 at a liquid flow rate of 20 l h the net removal of ammonia from the liquid in the same treatment period is 5305 mg corresponding to a removal efficiency of 55 whereas it is only 1414 mg corresponding to 73 removal efficiency at a liquid flow rate of 4 l h hence the compensating effect of increasing ql slightly reduces the ammonia removal performance per unit volume of leachate but significantly increases the total ammonia removal gui and li 2019 3 2 4 number of stripping stages s fig 4 shows that both η and kla increase with the number of stripping stages for different values of n qg and ql nevertheless η and kla mainly increase in the first two stripping stages at higher n and lower qg after which the stripping efficiency increases to a lesser extent with each stripping stage at higher rotation speeds the available free ammonia concentration is much lower in the later stages and the reduction of the mass transfer drive force limits the effectiveness of ammonia removal yin et al 2018 at lower gas flow rates the effect of multi stage stripping is limited by the small gas volume yin et al 2018 the contribution of different stripping stages to the mass transfer effectiveness can be attributed to the increase in the inlet gas volume and the role of the end effect zone at first the increase in the inlet gas volume effectively enhances the mass transfer drive and improves the performance of ammonia stripping in a comparative study of single parallel and series mode rpb configurations the inlet gas volume of two rpbs in series mode was found to be higher than that for other configurations yu et al 2016 the gas liquid reactions mainly occur in the packing end effect zone of the rpb chu et al 2015 the deformation of the liquid phase fluid by the shear force and shear stress is greatest in the edge zone of the packing layer inner diameter and the mass transfer is higher in this zone than in other zones of the packing bed guo et al 2014 rpbs with multiple end zones have greater mass transfer efficiency than simple rpbs owing to the intense contact between the liquid elements and packing bed the strong interaction between gas and liquid and the fast moving outlet of fresh liquid from the liquid distributor chu et al 2014b multiple passes through the end effect zone provide longer residence times for gas liquid reactions within the rpb thus the multi stage configuration is suitable for chemical processes that require a long gas liquid contact time chu et al 2015 3 3 prediction models of kla and η 3 3 1 descriptive statistics and preprocessing of data to gain preliminary insights descriptive statistical analysis of all the input and target variables was first performed using the experimental data the statistical distributions of the univariates are depicted using violin plots in figure a3 annex part ⅲ pearson s correlation test was conducted to measure the linear dependencies between any two features and the results are presented in figure a4 and table a2 annex part ⅲ the value of the pcc varies between 1 and 1 with a value of 1 indicating a strong negative correlation a value of 1 indicating a strong positive correlation and a value of 0 indicating no linear correlation rahmani et al 2022 the value of the correlation coefficient and the degree of correlation are generally defined as shown in table a3 annex part ⅲ susan and haerling 2014 there is no significant correlation between any two factors except for the positive correlation between ql and kla which has a pcc as high as 0 72 the lack of strong correlation between the various input features is helpful in constructing the predictive model because each feature contributes individually to the xgb model yuan et al 2021 there is a similar lack of correlation between the two output variables and so regression analysis was applied to η and kla to determine the most influential input parameter the magnitude of kla obtained from the above experimental results is too small to produce good training results the input dataset of kla values must therefore be processed prior to model development constants including the molecular liquid diffusion coefficient of ammonia dl 1 76 10 9 m2 s t 19 85 c and the correlation coefficient of the packing bed dp the equivalent diameter of the plastic filler ball 0 025 m ap the specific area of packing per unit volume of the packed bed 500 m2 m3 have significant effects on the mass transfer coefficient in this study all kla data points were normalized according to k l a k l a d p d l a p for convenience of description we write kla in place of kla the data records after normalization in the following subsections 3 3 2 model prediction tree based xgb models were established and evaluated to predict η and kla for high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping using the data obtained in the experiments the prediction accuracy of the test dataset was evaluated once the ml model had been developed and its hyperparameters optimized as illustrated in fig 5 a and b which present the prediction performance of the xgb model for η and kla respectively the fitting accuracy r 2 of the xgb models for η and kla is 0 9946 and 0 9964 respectively for the training data and 0 9783 and 0 9923 respectively for the test data the prediction results may suffer from overfitting which would affect the generalization and capability of the model yuan et al 2021 overfitting is the condition in which the model learns the noise and random fluctuations in the training data to the extent that the prediction performance is negatively affected when the model encounters unseen test data especially for smaller datasets feng et al 2017 a loss function based on the root mean square error was used to detect the overfitting of the xgb models for η and kla as shown in fig 5 c and d the decreases in the training and testing losses converge to stable points with a minimal gap between the two final loss values indicating that the model is well fitted anzanello and fogliatto 2011 the high r 2 value indicates that the model performs well on the training and test data and that the xgb algorithm is suitable for the prediction of η and kla in rpbs to further evaluate the accuracy and generalization ability of the ml models additional experiments were performed at 300 rpm stages 1 5 and 1300 rpm stages 1 2 these conditions were not considered in the model development the experimental validation results are in good agreement with the predicted values supporting the reliability of the established models annex part ⅳ fig a5 a comparative study of ann and xgb models was performed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model performance the training details for the ann model can be found in the annex the comparison results are presented in table 4 the xgb model performs slightly better than the ann model for the small dataset used in this study although anns are widely used in research on rpb transfer li et al 2017 the complex structural model of the ann often results in overfitting leading to poor model generalization performance piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 given the similar level of accuracy achieved in this study the xgb algorithm provides a lightweight alternative compared to the ann model and achieves better model development parameter adjustment and computational speed xgb models are more suitable for application to the treatment of wastewater in engineered water systems because of their remarkable precision speed interpretability and simplicity in the modeling of nonlinear phenomena huang et al 2021 they can simultaneously consider parameters such as rotation speed gas flow rate liquid flow rate and number of stripping stages and produce accurate predictions of the ammonia removal performance under different high gravity field coupled stripping conditions thus xgb models provide a reference for further research and industrial applications 3 3 3 feature importance analysis after validating the ml models on both datasets model interpretation was performed using the shap framework interpretation is essential for evaluating the predictions of the ml models while ensuring consistency with the underlying domain knowledge and experimental experience gao et al 2022 the application of shap overcomes the obstacles presented by black box ml models and provides a more comprehensive interpretation of the xgb model which in turn provides valuable insights for further research lundberg and lee 2017 in fig 6 the x axis gives the shap values and the y axis shows the order of influence of the input parameters with the most influential variable at the top the shap value of each feature is colored according to significance with blue to pinkish red representing low to high significance more data points falling in a particular range of the shap value indicates greater correlation of the input variable with η and kla pathy et al 2020 fig 6 shows that the number of stripping stages is the most influential parameter affecting η whereas the input parameter contributing most to kla is the liquid flow rate a higher number of stripping stages and higher liquid flow rate correspond to a higher shap value overall the number of stripping stages and the liquid flow rate are the key factors affecting the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping the core idea of a high gravity device is to improve the process efficiency by increasing the turbulence level and contact area and decreasing the boundary layer thickness jiao et al 2017 although ammonia stripping is a typical gas film controlled process the liquid flow rate is influential because of the strong effect of the high gravity field on the liquid film resistance in driving efficient stripping ghadyanlou et al 2021 the end effect in rpbs has been demonstrated in many studies and the present study has shown that the use of the multi stage cycle series mode further enhances the removal of ammonia from leachate yu et al 2016 3 4 comparison with traditional ammonia stripping from waste leachate traditional ammonia stripping mostly relies on packed towers or tanks with wastewater entering from the top and air entering from the bottom there is a great time cost in obtaining the final emission index the average height of a typical packed tower ranges from 6 1 to 7 6 m kinidi et al 2018 with the large footprint and large equipment volume increasing the cost of ammonia stripping compared with the results of recent studies on raw leachate stripping the multi stage co current flow rpb considered in this study has an appreciably lower operation time but achieves similar performance table 4 a comparative study of ammonia stripping between conventional equipment and rpbs showed that the small size of rpbs effectively improves the economics of the treatment process yin et al 2018 high gravity technology has obvious advantages for ammonia removal from fresh waste leachate table 5 4 conclusion in this study a co current flow rpb in multi stage cycle series mode was applied to enhance the ammonia stripping treatment of fresh waste leachate using high gravity technology ml models systematically provided predictions of the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping process under a ph value of 10 at ambient temperature and with a gas flow rate of 6000 l h and liquid flow rate of 4 l h an ammonia removal efficiency of 83 was achieved with a co current flow rpb rotation speed of 1200 rpm and a five stage cycle increasing the gas flow rate liquid flow rate rotation speed and number of stripping stages improves the mass transfer effect of the rpb the adoption of two stripping stages is recommended to achieve a desirable removal effect when the rotation speed of the rpb is high the ml modeling results indicate that the liquid flow rate and number of stripping stages are the key factors affecting the removal of ammonia from leachate the liquid flow rate of leachate must be carefully regulated according to the actual demands of industrial applications the advantages of high gravity technology reduce the use of alkaline chemicals and the economic costs of wastewater management which is critical for the treatment of waste leachates accurate ml models produce extremely valuable information and thus provide an important reference for the rational design of high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping projects in future research equipment that can achieve both ammonia stripping and absorption will be investigated for better

14901,stripping is widely applied for the removal of ammonia from fresh waste leachate however the development of air stripping technology is restricted by the requirements for large scale equipment and long operation periods this paper describes a high gravity technology that improves ammonia stripping from actual fresh waste leachate and a machine learning approach that predicts the stripping performance under different operational parameters the high gravity field is implemented in a co current flow rotating packed bed in multi stage cycle series mode the extreme gradient boosting algorithm is applied to the experimental data to predict the liquid volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla and removal efficiency η for various rotation speeds numbers of stripping stages gas flow rates and liquid flow rates ammonia stripping under a high gravity field achieves η 82 73 and kla 5 551 10 4 s 1 at a ph value of 10 and ambient temperature the results suggest that the extreme gradient boosting model provides good accuracy and predictive performance with r2 values of 0 9923 and 0 9783 for kla and η respectively the machine learning models developed in this study are combined with experimental results to provide more comprehensive information on rotating packed bed operations and more accurate predictions of kla and η the information mining behind the model is an

appreciable amounts of fresh waste leachate having high nh4 nitrogen concentrations liu et al 2015 the high ammonia nitrogen content means that the leachate could be treated for resource recovery santos et al 2020 thus moving from a contaminant removal model to a sustainable wastewater treatment model with nutrient recovery wu and céline 2022 commercial ammonia stripping is widely used to remove nh3 from waste leachate kurniawan et al 2021 at present the large scale reactors required and the low ammonia removal efficiency restrict the application of conventional stripping technology li et al 2020 the use of many alkaline chemicals and the long operation times also pose serious challenges to stripping operations kinidi et al 2018 thus the development of novel equipment is urgently required to improve the mass transfer performance and economic efficiency of ammonia stripping applications one potential solution is to use process intensification technology to reduce the capital cost chen et al 2021 examined existing advanced ammonia removal technologies and reported that stripping coupled with a high gravity field could reduce the cost of removing ammonia from wastewater by 8 compared with conventional stripper towers high gravity technology as realized with a rotating packed bed rpb effectively enhances the gas liquid mass transfer effect by overcoming boundary barriers at the gas liquid interface through strong centrifugal forces tung and mah 2007 rpbs can be classified into three categories according to the direction of gas flow co current counter current and cross current dhaneesh and ranganathan 2022 at high rotational speeds the reduction in gas pressure results in less energy consumption and lower operating costs in the co current flow mode than in the counter flow and cross flow modes but these savings are offset by a reduction in the mass transfer effect chu et al 2014a the successful application of multi stage rpbs in distillation overcomes the short gas liquid contact time luo et al 2016 and has the potential to achieve effective mass transfer especially in processes requiring long residence times for both the gas and liquid wang et al 2019 mathematical models and visual experiments have demonstrated that the most important section for mass transfer in rpbs is the end effect zone of the packing bed guo et al 2014 multiple passes through the area from the inner edge of the packing bed to the point where the liquid is captured by the rotating packing bed are instrumental in improving the mass transfer efficiency luo et al 2016 connecting co current flow rpbs in cycle series to form a multi stage model produces a better balance between energy consumption and efficiency however few studies have investigated such an approach to ammonia stripping and high gravity technology has rarely been applied to raw waste leachate treatment despite the good performance of rpbs in ammonia stripping predicting the rpb mass transfer performance is theoretically complex owing to the variation in mass transfer coefficients at various points in the contactor ghadyanlou et al 2021 for such complex nonlinear issues machine learning ml provides an instrumental solution with its simple model structure and efficient simulation process wang et al 2022b research on ml algorithms and their applications has gradually gained attention over recent years for example qaiyum et al 2019 presented an improved interval type 2 fuzzy c means clustering algorithm based on ant colony optimization and subsequently improved this algorithm to handle large data streams qaiyum et al 2020 the prediction and classification of water quality islam and irshad 2022 thermoelectric air cooling system parameters sayed et al 2021 and airborne particle bound matter almalawi et al 2022 have benefited from the application of ml techniques ml has also been employed to minimize the mass transfer limitations encountered in rpbs liu et al 2018 various ml approaches can be applied such as support vector machines aftab et al 2021 random forests zhu et al 2022 artificial neural networks anns wang et al 2022a and tree based models rahmani et al 2022 a scalable boosting tree system named extreme gradient boosting xgb is an excellent ensemble algorithm that harnesses the power of weak learners to achieve strong performance li et al 2022b the design of parallel learning column blocks cache aware access and out of core computation blocks ensure the high computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of the xgb algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 the applicability and successful implementation of xgb for small sample datasets in the environmental science field has been demonstrated in recent studies on atmospheric pollutant concentrations li et al 2022a biochar adsorption performance pathy et al 2020 heavy metal contamination bhagat et al 2021 and beach water quality li et al 2022b nevertheless few studies have applied the xgb algorithm to the treatment of wastewater to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional ammonia stripping industry this paper describes the use of a multi stage co current flow rpb to upgrade the treatment process of fresh waste leachate the xgb algorithm is systematically applied to provide predictions of the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping performance finally the feature importance is evaluated for the predictive model via the shapley additive explanation shap framework the combination of high gravity technology with an ml model not only provides a more effective method for removing ammonia from leachate but also addresses the lack of tree based integrated algorithms applied in this field the results of this study are expected to make a significant contribution to the efficient stripping of ammonia from fresh waste leachate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus fig 1 shows a schematic of the laboratory scale high gravity integrated system used in this study the multi stage cycle series co current flow rpb mainly comprises an electrical unit circuit switch and control panel pipeline control unit gas pipes liquid pipes and valves rpb horizontal shaft packing motor casing gas inlet outlet liquid inlet outlet and distributor gas liquid separation unit equipped with a packing bed an tank for absorbing exhaust gas and auxiliary devices air compressor liquid pump gas flow meter liquid flow meter and wastewater tank table a1 summarizes the characteristics of the rpb reactor the fresh raw waste leachate used in the present study was supplied by the beijing chaoyang municipal solid waste site in china the leachate had an original ph of 6 6 5 and was obtained after filtering through a coarse grid to remove coarse suspended solids the properties of the leachate are listed in table 1 the naoh used to adjust the ph was procured from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all other reagents used were of analytical grade the ph of the raw waste leachate was adjusted with a known amount of naoh before the experiment and the leachate was then fed from the wastewater tank into the center of the rpb air was fed into the center of the rpb by an air compressor at the same time during the reaction process the gas and the liquid were transported in the same direction throughout the co current flow rpb as shown by the arrows in fig 1 the gas and liquid left the bottom of the reactor at the same time and entered the gas liquid separation unit where they were separated according to their difference in density the gas liquid separation unit was equipped with a packing bed and the gas after passing through the packing bed was conducted to sealed gas scrubbers containing sulfuric acid solution to finally obtain nh4so4 the liquid entrained in the gas was trapped by the packing bed and pooled with the liquid remaining below the gas liquid separation unit to form the effluent from which samples were taken for testing and analysis all experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions at a room temperature of 20 5 c repeated analyses of the obtained samples were performed in triplicate to verify that the obtained results were within accepted analytical error 5 ammonia nitrogen was analyzed using distillation neutralization titration and a kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer buchi distillation unit k 350 the ph was measured using a ph meter hq30d 2 2 theoretical calculation throughout the experiments the stripping efficiency η liquid residence time t and liquid volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla

value of output variable y 2 4 model development and hyperparameter tuning the tree based xgb model was developed using the experimental data by considering the operational parameters as input variables their roles and effects on the performance of high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping were predicted the dataset obtained in the experiments was randomly divided into two parts 70 of the dataset was used for ml model training and the remaining 30 was used for the final model testing the xgboost 1 6 1 package was used to fit the gradient boosted regression tree ensemble the main idea of this algorithm is that each update is based on the prediction results of the previous model the objective function is chen and guestrin 2016 4 y i 0 y i 1 y i 0 f 1 x i y i 2 y i 1 f 2 x i y i

is to make the predicted value y i as close as possible to the true value y i which requires the greatest possible generalization capability to attain the optimal model performance several hyperparameters were optimized n estimators learning rate max depth min child weight subsample colsample bytree gamma and alpha li et al 2022a table 2 presents the xgb parameter settings for optimizing kla and η the detailed tuning process is described in annex part ⅱ 2 5 model evaluation and interpretation the performance of the regression models was evaluated in terms of the correlation

feature respectively n is the data point at any given instance and n is the total number of data points after the models had been trained and achieved satisfactory predictive performance the shap framework was applied to interpret the model shap theory constructs an additive interpretation model that treats all feature quantities as contributors to the target prediction zhong et al 2022 the shapley value was calculated as gao et al 2022 7 j v a l s x 1 x p x j s p s 1 p v a l s x j v a l s where s is a subset of all features x denotes the vector feature values of the samples to be explained p is the number of features val s x j denotes the prediction by the built ml model considering feature x j and val s denotes the prediction without considering feature x j the differences among all possible subsets of s n are calculated according to the dependency of the effect of withholding a feature on other features in the ml model a feature with a higher absolute shapley value makes a greater contribution to the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping performance all the calculations and ml methods described here were performed using qrigin 2022 and the python programming language version 3 10 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of ph the ammonia stripping performance is affected by the fraction of free ammonia and depends on factors that influence the chemical equilibrium such as the ph and temperature karri et al 2018 ammonium ions nh4 in wastewater first generate ammonia monohydrate nh3 h2o as an intermediate product during conversion to the gaseous ammonia molecules that leave the system the distribution of nh3 h2o in the aqueous solution is presented in table 3 jiang et al 2019 in removing all ammonia nitrogen compounds the ph of the raw waste leachate is allowed to increase above a certain value to induce the conversion of almost all nh4 into the gaseous form nh3 el gohary and kamel 2016 fig 2 shows that the maximum ammonia removal efficiency increases from 42 to 90 as the ph increases from 9 to 11 during the stripping process in a high gravity field the leachate stripping is relatively poor at ph 9 with the high gravity field being ineffective under low ph conditions ammonia monohydrate is difficult to generate as a physical process air stripping has a limited ability to facilitate the further conversion of ammonia monohydrate to gas molecules at ph 10 the removal of ammonia under an 800 rpm high gravity field is 48 greater than that achieved with a normal gravity field indicating that the high gravity field plays an important role the molar ratio of ammonia monohydrate in the system exceeds 80 following the increase in ph at this molar ratio air stripping promotes a cycle series of changes from ammonium ions to ammonia monohydrate and then to gaseous ammonia molecules the high gravity field coupled stripping enhances this promotion and the removal rate achieved using the 800 rpm high gravity field at ph 10 is close to that achieved using the normal gravity field at an even higher ph value of 12 thereafter the enhancement effect of the high gravity field decreases with any further increase in ph the high ph leads to a large accumulation of ammonia monohydrate in the system whereby any form of air stripping can easily extract ammonia in this case the contribution of the high gravity field is not obvious overall the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping is mainly dependent on the ph but the high gravity field improves the ammonia removal under low ph conditions enabling almost the same removal effect as achieved at higher ph values this is most important in terms of reducing the use of alkaline chemicals in leachate treatment and promoting the environmentally friendly development of the wastewater treatment industry 3 2 effects of operational parameters 3 2 1 rpb rotation speed n fig 3 a shows that η and kla obviously increase with the rotation speed n the kla value of 0 00055 s 1 at n 1200 rpm is approximately 2 5 times that of the control with no high gravity field n 0 rpm η increases by approximately 28 the enhanced mass transfer rate is attributable to the accelerated centrifugal force which generates a high gravity field and breaks the heterogeneous interface barriers wu et al 2020 the mechanism whereby the mass transfer improves under high gravity is mainly based on the enhancement of liquid flow which includes both perturbation and cutting effects the perturbation effects of a high gravity field increase the frequency of liquid surface renewal and this constant renewal of the interface enhances the gas liquid transfer process chen et al 2004 surface renewal theory states that the fluid in the flow process is constantly exposed to air providing the liquid with a greater opportunity to make contact with the gas luo et al 2021 the increase in the gas liquid contact area and the renewal frequency increase the interphase material transfer per unit time additionally the cutting effect of the high gravity field on the liquid divides the liquid into small units which greatly reduces the molecular mass transfer resistance in the liquid wang et al 2021 the rate of molecular diffusion of substances in the liquid phase is approximately 4 5 orders of magnitude smaller than that in the gas phase and the liquid film resistance accounts for 5 40 of the total mass transfer resistance in the gas liquid mass transfer hence the enhanced liquid flow greatly reduces the mass transfer resistance of air stripping and effectively increases the efficiency of ammonia removal however the actual flow of liquid in the rpb under different rotation speeds is complex and variable fig 3 shows that the mass transfer is mainly enhanced at rotation speeds of 200 1000 rpm a visualization of the rpb reveals that at low rotation speeds severe liquid maldistribution occurs with predominant rivulet flow on the packing bed resulting in poor mass transfer wang et al 2019 rivulet flow is replaced by more droplets as the rotation speed increases and droplets are widely believed to dominate the mass transfer performance wang et al 2019 the reduction in mass transfer resistance with further increases in rotation speed is counterbalanced by the reduction in the liquid residence time which hinders further improvement of the mass transfer performance of the rotating bed as a result the ammonia stripping efficiency and mass transfer coefficient remain almost constant xie et al 2017 3 2 2 air supply qg fig 3 b shows that η and kla increase with increasing qg after five stages under a set liquid flow rate as qg increases from 2000 to 6000 l h η increases by 19 and kla increases by a factor of approximately 1 7 the transfer of ammonia between the gas and liquid phases is a typical gas film controlled process and the increase in qg effectively reduces the gas phase resistance thus the ammonia removal performance improves with an increasing gas flow rate yin et al 2018 as the residence time of the air in the rpb shortens the ammonium content per unit time and volume in the air decrease which increases the equilibrium driving force this is beneficial to the stripping of ammonia gui and li 2019 additionally higher air velocities cut and break the liquid surface through the intense turbulence between the two phases on the contact surface areas this not only produces a larger contact area between the gas and liquid but also reduces the liquid film thickness gui and li 2019 fig 3 b shows that the variation in kla follows the same trend as the variation in η this indicates that kla is almost unaffected by the variation in qg investigations on the two phase reactions of ammonia and water have revealed that there is only a weak correlation between the gas phase mass transfer coefficient and mass transfer performance in rpbs wang et al 2019 3 2 3 liquid supply ql the experimental results presented in fig 3 c clearly show that kla increases and η decreases as the liquid flow rate rises this phenomenon is consistent with that reported in studies on ammonia nitrogen removal from preparation water yuan et al 2016 kla increases by a factor of 3 as ql increases from 4 to 20 l h this is mainly because of an increase in the quantities of droplets liquid filaments and liquid films within the rpb as the liquid inlet velocity rises at a fixed rotation speed which enhances the gas liquid interfacial area and liquid side mass transfer coefficient ouyang et al 2018 studies on liquid mass transfer coefficients for different rpbs such as stainless wire mesh packing beds zhang et al 2011 and blade packing beds lin and jian 2007 suggest that the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient is exponentially proportional to the liquid flow rate as expressed by eq 8 and the magnitude of the proportionality coefficient is closely related to the packing structure and material tsai and chen 2015 8 k l a q l n fig 3 c also shows that there is an 18 decrease in η and a 42 min reduction in the liquid residence time as ql rises from 4 to 20 l h this contrasts with the relation between kla and ql the results show that the liquid film on the packing surface thickens as the liquid flow rate increases which is supported by a study on the determination of the liquid holding rates of packing beds using x ray computed tomography yang et al 2015 hence an increase in the liquid flow rate increases the rpb liquid holding rate an increase in the liquid holding rate and a decrease in the average liquid residence time weaken the surface renewal effect of the supergravity field on the liquid reducing the total amount of ammonia transfer from the liquid phase to the gas phase per unit volume yuan et al 2016 this is reflected by the decrease in the total amount of ammonia removed from 1414 to 1061 mg per liter of leachate fig 3 c the throughput of the equipment increases by up to a factor of 5 as ql increases from 4 to 20 l h a simple mass balance shows a much higher rate of total ammonia separation from the liquid despite the lower stripping efficiency yin et al 2018 at a liquid flow rate of 20 l h the net removal of ammonia from the liquid in the same treatment period is 5305 mg corresponding to a removal efficiency of 55 whereas it is only 1414 mg corresponding to 73 removal efficiency at a liquid flow rate of 4 l h hence the compensating effect of increasing ql slightly reduces the ammonia removal performance per unit volume of leachate but significantly increases the total ammonia removal gui and li 2019 3 2 4 number of stripping stages s fig 4 shows that both η and kla increase with the number of stripping stages for different values of n qg and ql nevertheless η and kla mainly increase in the first two stripping stages at higher n and lower qg after which the stripping efficiency increases to a lesser extent with each stripping stage at higher rotation speeds the available free ammonia concentration is much lower in the later stages and the reduction of the mass transfer drive force limits the effectiveness of ammonia removal yin et al 2018 at lower gas flow rates the effect of multi stage stripping is limited by the small gas volume yin et al 2018 the contribution of different stripping stages to the mass transfer effectiveness can be attributed to the increase in the inlet gas volume and the role of the end effect zone at first the increase in the inlet gas volume effectively enhances the mass transfer drive and improves the performance of ammonia stripping in a comparative study of single parallel and series mode rpb configurations the inlet gas volume of two rpbs in series mode was found to be higher than that for other configurations yu et al 2016 the gas liquid reactions mainly occur in the packing end effect zone of the rpb chu et al 2015 the deformation of the liquid phase fluid by the shear force and shear stress is greatest in the edge zone of the packing layer inner diameter and the mass transfer is higher in this zone than in other zones of the packing bed guo et al 2014 rpbs with multiple end zones have greater mass transfer efficiency than simple rpbs owing to the intense contact between the liquid elements and packing bed the strong interaction between gas and liquid and the fast moving outlet of fresh liquid from the liquid distributor chu et al 2014b multiple passes through the end effect zone provide longer residence times for gas liquid reactions within the rpb thus the multi stage configuration is suitable for chemical processes that require a long gas liquid contact time chu et al 2015 3 3 prediction models of kla and η 3 3 1 descriptive statistics and preprocessing of data to gain preliminary insights descriptive statistical analysis of all the input and target variables was first performed using the experimental data the statistical distributions of the univariates are depicted using violin plots in figure a3 annex part ⅲ pearson s correlation test was conducted to measure the linear dependencies between any two features and the results are presented in figure a4 and table a2 annex part ⅲ the value of the pcc varies between 1 and 1 with a value of 1 indicating a strong negative correlation a value of 1 indicating a strong positive correlation and a value of 0 indicating no linear correlation rahmani et al 2022 the value of the correlation coefficient and the degree of correlation are generally defined as shown in table a3 annex part ⅲ susan and haerling 2014 there is no significant correlation between any two factors except for the positive correlation between ql and kla which has a pcc as high as 0 72 the lack of strong correlation between the various input features is helpful in constructing the predictive model because each feature contributes individually to the xgb model yuan et al 2021 there is a similar lack of correlation between the two output variables and so regression analysis was applied to η and kla to determine the most influential input parameter the magnitude of kla obtained from the above experimental results is too small to produce good training results the input dataset of kla values must therefore be processed prior to model development constants including the molecular liquid diffusion coefficient of ammonia dl 1 76 10 9 m2 s t 19 85 c and the correlation coefficient of the packing bed dp the equivalent diameter of the plastic filler ball 0 025 m ap the specific area of packing per unit volume of the packed bed 500 m2 m3 have significant effects on the mass transfer coefficient in this study all kla data points were normalized according to k l a k l a d p d l a p for convenience of description we write kla in place of kla the data records after normalization in the following subsections 3 3 2 model prediction tree based xgb models were established and evaluated to predict η and kla for high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping using the data obtained in the experiments the prediction accuracy of the test dataset was evaluated once the ml model had been developed and its hyperparameters optimized as illustrated in fig 5 a and b which present the prediction performance of the xgb model for η and kla respectively the fitting accuracy r 2 of the xgb models for η and kla is 0 9946 and 0 9964 respectively for the training data and 0 9783 and 0 9923 respectively for the test data the prediction results may suffer from overfitting which would affect the generalization and capability of the model yuan et al 2021 overfitting is the condition in which the model learns the noise and random fluctuations in the training data to the extent that the prediction performance is negatively affected when the model encounters unseen test data especially for smaller datasets feng et al 2017 a loss function based on the root mean square error was used to detect the overfitting of the xgb models for η and kla as shown in fig 5 c and d the decreases in the training and testing losses converge to stable points with a minimal gap between the two final loss values indicating that the model is well fitted anzanello and fogliatto 2011 the high r 2 value indicates that the model performs well on the training and test data and that the xgb algorithm is suitable for the prediction of η and kla in rpbs to further evaluate the accuracy and generalization ability of the ml models additional experiments were performed at 300 rpm stages 1 5 and 1300 rpm stages 1 2 these conditions were not considered in the model development the experimental validation results are in good agreement with the predicted values supporting the reliability of the established models annex part ⅳ fig a5 a comparative study of ann and xgb models was performed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model performance the training details for the ann model can be found in the annex the comparison results are presented in table 4 the xgb model performs slightly better than the ann model for the small dataset used in this study although anns are widely used in research on rpb transfer li et al 2017 the complex structural model of the ann often results in overfitting leading to poor model generalization performance piotrowski and napiorkowski 2013 given the similar level of accuracy achieved in this study the xgb algorithm provides a lightweight alternative compared to the ann model and achieves better model development parameter adjustment and computational speed xgb models are more suitable for application to the treatment of wastewater in engineered water systems because of their remarkable precision speed interpretability and simplicity in the modeling of nonlinear phenomena huang et al 2021 they can simultaneously consider parameters such as rotation speed gas flow rate liquid flow rate and number of stripping stages and produce accurate predictions of the ammonia removal performance under different high gravity field coupled stripping conditions thus xgb models provide a reference for further research and industrial applications 3 3 3 feature importance analysis after validating the ml models on both datasets model interpretation was performed using the shap framework interpretation is essential for evaluating the predictions of the ml models while ensuring consistency with the underlying domain knowledge and experimental experience gao et al 2022 the application of shap overcomes the obstacles presented by black box ml models and provides a more comprehensive interpretation of the xgb model which in turn provides valuable insights for further research lundberg and lee 2017 in fig 6 the x axis gives the shap values and the y axis shows the order of influence of the input parameters with the most influential variable at the top the shap value of each feature is colored according to significance with blue to pinkish red representing low to high significance more data points falling in a particular range of the shap value indicates greater correlation of the input variable with η and kla pathy et al 2020 fig 6 shows that the number of stripping stages is the most influential parameter affecting η whereas the input parameter contributing most to kla is the liquid flow rate a higher number of stripping stages and higher liquid flow rate correspond to a higher shap value overall the number of stripping stages and the liquid flow rate are the key factors affecting the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping the core idea of a high gravity device is to improve the process efficiency by increasing the turbulence level and contact area and decreasing the boundary layer thickness jiao et al 2017 although ammonia stripping is a typical gas film controlled process the liquid flow rate is influential because of the strong effect of the high gravity field on the liquid film resistance in driving efficient stripping ghadyanlou et al 2021 the end effect in rpbs has been demonstrated in many studies and the present study has shown that the use of the multi stage cycle series mode further enhances the removal of ammonia from leachate yu et al 2016 3 4 comparison with traditional ammonia stripping from waste leachate traditional ammonia stripping mostly relies on packed towers or tanks with wastewater entering from the top and air entering from the bottom there is a great time cost in obtaining the final emission index the average height of a typical packed tower ranges from 6 1 to 7 6 m kinidi et al 2018 with the large footprint and large equipment volume increasing the cost of ammonia stripping compared with the results of recent studies on raw leachate stripping the multi stage co current flow rpb considered in this study has an appreciably lower operation time but achieves similar performance table 4 a comparative study of ammonia stripping between conventional equipment and rpbs showed that the small size of rpbs effectively improves the economics of the treatment process yin et al 2018 high gravity technology has obvious advantages for ammonia removal from fresh waste leachate table 5 4 conclusion in this study a co current flow rpb in multi stage cycle series mode was applied to enhance the ammonia stripping treatment of fresh waste leachate using high gravity technology ml models systematically provided predictions of the high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping process under a ph value of 10 at ambient temperature and with a gas flow rate of 6000 l h and liquid flow rate of 4 l h an ammonia removal efficiency of 83 was achieved with a co current flow rpb rotation speed of 1200 rpm and a five stage cycle increasing the gas flow rate liquid flow rate rotation speed and number of stripping stages improves the mass transfer effect of the rpb the adoption of two stripping stages is recommended to achieve a desirable removal effect when the rotation speed of the rpb is high the ml modeling results indicate that the liquid flow rate and number of stripping stages are the key factors affecting the removal of ammonia from leachate the liquid flow rate of leachate must be carefully regulated according to the actual demands of industrial applications the advantages of high gravity technology reduce the use of alkaline chemicals and the economic costs of wastewater management which is critical for the treatment of waste leachates accurate ml models produce extremely valuable information and thus provide an important reference for the rational design of high gravity field coupled ammonia stripping projects in future research equipment that can achieve both ammonia stripping and absorption will be investigated for better resource treatment of leachate in terms of prediction studies multivariate output models will be developed to obtain better performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

engineering faculty queensland university of technology queensland 4001 australia corresponding author water sensitive urban design wsud has attracted growing attention as a sustainable approach for mitigating pluvial flooding also known as flash flooding which is expected to increase in frequency and intensity under the impacts of climate change and urbanisation however spatial planning of wsud is not an easy task not only due to the complex urban environment but also the fact that not all locations in the catchment are equally effective for flood mitigation in this study we developed a new wsud spatial prioritisation framework that applies global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify priority subcatchments where wsud implementation will be most effective for flood mitigation for the first time the complex impact of wsud locations on catchment flood volume can be assessed and the gsa in hydrological modelling is adopted for applications in wsud spatial planning the framework uses a spatial wsud planning model the urban biophysical environments and technologies simulator urbanbeats to generate a grid based spatial representation of catchment and an urban drainage model the u s epa storm water management model swmm to simulate catchment flooding the effective imperviousness of all subcatchments was varied simultaneously in the gsa to mimic the effect of wsud implementation and future developments priority subcatchments were identified based on their influence on catchment flooding computed through the gsa the method was tested for an urbanised catchment in sydney australia we found that high priority subcatchments were clustering in the upstream and midstream of the main drainage network with a few distributed close to the catchment outlets rainfall frequency subcatchment characteristics and pipe network configuration were found to be important factors determining the influence of changes in different subcatchments on catchment flooding the effectiveness of the framework in identifying influential subcatchments was validated by comparing the effect of removing 6 of the sydney catchment s effective impervious area under four wsud spatial distribution scenarios our results showed that wsud implementation in high priority subcatchments consistently achieved the largest flood volume reduction 3 5 31 3 for 1 aep to 50 aep storms followed by medium priority subcatchments 3 1 21 3 and catchment wide implementation 2 9 22 1 under most design storms overall we have demonstrated that the proposed method can be useful for maximising wsud flood

github com vww wrc wsud spatial prioritisation through gsa for effective pluvial flood mitigatition 1 introduction pluvial or rain related flooding caused by intense precipitation exceeding the capacity of stormwater drainage systems is expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change and urbanisation ipcc 2021 traditional urban flood management relies on engineered drainage systems such as gutters and pipes to convey stormwater away rosenzweig et al 2018 however there has been growing recognition that such single purpose systems are becoming increasingly unaffordable to maintain and expand to meet growing demands urging a paradigm shift to more sustainable approaches ashley et al 2020 in light of this water sensitive urban design wsud alternatively known as sustainable urban drainage systems low impact development and sponge cities fletcher et al 2015 yin et al 2021 has been proposed with an aim to minimise impacts of urban development on the natural water cycle wsud manages stormwater quality and quantity through decentralised infrastructures such as green roofs permeable pavements bio retention cells constructed wetlands and rainwater tanks lloyd et al 2002 through retention and detention of surface runoff these technologies have been found effective in mitigating flooding especially small and frequent floods myers and pezzaniti 2019 these diverse infrastructure options offer flexibility in how they can be distributed across the urban environment zhang and chui 2018 studies have shown that targeted locations for wsud implementation led to better performance in flood mitigation than random or homogeneous placement across the catchment ercolani et al 2018 webber et al 2019 however spatial planning of wsud in the complex urban environment with physical and socio economic constraints is not an easy task zhang and chui 2018 several spatial wsud planning support tools and models such as sustain lee et al 2012 sudsloc viavattene and ellis 2013 and the adaptation support tool van de ven et al 2016 have been developed to assist decision makers in finding feasible locations for wsud many of these models rely on the users to specify specific wsud types and designs which can be time consuming with limited options explored a recently developed planning tool urbanbeats bach et al 2020 allows systematic exploration of thousands of combinations of feasible wsud options and spatial layouts across the urban landscape to meet stormwater harvesting and pollution control objectives in a timely manner urbanbeats has been applied to explore the effect of spatial distribution of rainwater harvesting on water supply networks sitzenfrei et al 2017 and the robustness of wsud implementation scenarios for stormwater pollution management castonguay et al 2018 however urban flood mitigation has not been included as an objective in urbanbeats indeed installing wsud wherever possible lacks strategic consideration of the best location for effective flood mitigation zhang and chui 2018 identification of priority locations for wsud implementation is vital for maximising wsud s potential for flood mitigation but such spatial prioritisation is currently lacking in wsud planning support tools various types of locations have been prioritised for wsud implementation to mitigate flooding flood prone areas are a commonly targeted location to apply wsud for on site flood impact reduction lu et al 2019 alternatively recognising the need to address flooding at its source flood source area has attracted growing attention singh et al 2021 as pluvial flooding is caused by excess stormwater runoff subcatchments with characteristics contributing to high probability of runoff generation are often prioritised these characteristics include upstream locations kapetas and fenner 2020 high impervious area ratios samouei and özger 2020 steep slopes and soils of low infiltration rates kaykhosravi et al 2019 however there is high uncertainty in the occurrence of pluvial flooding due to influence of rainfall characteristics and performance of existing urban drainage systems penning rowsell and korndewal 2019 which means simple subcatchment characteristics may not be sufficient for identifying influential flood source locations for example vercruysse et al 2019 reported high contributions to catchment maximum flood depth from downstream subcatchments this finding was based on results from analysing the sensitivity of catchment flooding to removal of rainfall input in individual subcatchments similarly zischg et al 2018 and rodriguez et al 2021 identified priority locations for wsud implementation by successively implementing fixed extent of wsud in each subcatchment and assessing the corresponding changes in catchment flood volume a bioretention of 500m2 was placed in each subcatchment in zischg et al 2018 s study and the maximum spatial extent for bioretention cells green roofs and permeable pavements in each subcatchment was modelled in the work of rodriguez et al 2021 simperler et al 2020 calculated the discharge reduction potential of each subcatchment by disconnecting that subcatchment from the drainage network in each simulation as there was no correlation between subcatchments discharge reduction potential and their impervious area size or their distance from the overflow point the authors stressed the importance of applying sensitivity analysis for wsud spatial prioritisation current research on wsud spatial prioritisation has seen popular applications of local sensitivity analysis lsa in which the response of the model output i e catchment flooding to variations in the model parameters i e changes in subcatchments is evaluated based on changing the value of a single model parameter e g rainfall input or runoff volume in a single subcatchment around a nominal value one at a time whilst keeping all other parameters fixed saltelli and annoni 2010 despite its popularity there are numerous issues with the application of lsa in wsud spatial prioritisation first traditional lsa has been criticised for their limited applicability to non linear models and inability to consider interactions between parameters saltelli and annoni 2010 song et al 2015 however studies have reported non linear changes in catchment flooding as wsud implementation level increased zeng et al 2019 in addition the effect of interactions i e the compounding effect of implementing wsud in two or more subcatchments at the same time on catchment flooding is not considered in lsa furthermore studies often only simulated limited possible scenarios in each subcatchment either complete removal of runoff simperler et al 2020 or maximum possible wsud implementation based on current land use rodriguez et al 2021 given uncertainty in the nature of future urban development it is critical to understand the catchment s response to a wide range of wsud implementation scenarios across the catchment for identifying futureproof effective locations for flood mitigation in this paper we present a novel wsud spatial prioritisation framework for pluvial flood mitigation using global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify effective subcatchments where wsud implementation would lead to optimum flood volume reduction under a range of design storms gsa explores the entire range of possible values of all input parameters and their interactions making it well suited for analysing non linear models and assessing effects of parameter interactions song et al 2015 it has been useful for identifying influential parameters in hydrological models wang and solomatine 2019 and urban drainage models vanrolleghem et al 2015 to our knowledge this is the first framework for wsud spatial prioritisation for pluvial flood mitigation using gsa by coupling urbanbeats and swmm and then applying gsa we introduce a simple approach to simulate all possible extents of wsud implementation and future development scenarios through changes in effective impervious area eia ratio of subcatchments as a proxy for wsud s effect in reducing runoff by converting impervious area to pervious this enables assessment of the complex impact of wsud implementation in different locations on catchment flooding for the first time based on the influence of subcatchments on flooding under all design storms priority subcatchments that are futureproof for achieving effective flood mitigation can be identified this work also provides the basis for setting a simple and quantifiable target for the selection of wsud design and types at subcatchment scale to meet catchment wide flood mitigation targets which is an essential part of wsud planning for pluvial flood mitigation 2 methodology 2 1 proposed wsud spatial prioritisation framework the proposed framework consists of four modules m1 4 fig 1 module m1 involves setting up a flood model to simulate pluvial flooding a gsa algorithm is applied in module m2 using inputs and outputs of the flood model to assess the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in the effective impervious area eia ratio of different subcatchments the results from the gsa are used to prioritise subcatchments in module m3 finally the effectiveness of the prioritised subcatchments for flood reduction is validated in module m4 m1 flood model set up m1 1 subcatchment delineation a spatial representation of the catchment is produced using urbanbeats bach et al 2020 with input data including the catchment boundary elevation land use types population density and soil types generated through arcmap subcatchments are delineated into scalable grid cells known as blocks using urbanbeats gis based automated block delineation each block contains aggregated spatial information from the input data including key characteristics such as imperviousness which is essential for runoff estimation bach et al 2018 such uniform block based subcatchment delineation has been applied in previous flood source identification studies saghafian et al 2010 vercruysse et al 2019 it reduces the influence of subcatchment size on flood contribution and offers simplicity in communicating with stakeholders for wsud planning it also provides matching spatial scales for future coupling with urbanbeats to select optimal wsud options for flood mitigation m1 2 swmm model preparation catchment flood simulation is performed using the u s epa storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 one of the most commonly used models in urban drainage flood simulation jamali et al 2020 niazi et al 2017 subcatchment properties such as subcatchment area imperviousness and slope in swmm are set based on m1 1 s output catchment shapefile from urbanbeats each subcatchment s outlet is set to the nearest inlet node in the pipe network in swmm following slope gradients ten design storms of 1 50 annual exceedance probabilities aeps under short and long durations are simulated to assess the catchment response the rainfall temporal pattern that resembles the average peak runoff in ten temporal patterns for a given aep and duration is selected to reflect natural storm variability ball et al 2019 m2 sensitivity analysis a popular gsa algorithm known as the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 is applied to assess the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in the eia ratio in subcatchments the efast algorithm is a variance based method which quantifies the variability in the model output caused by variability of individual model parameters and parameter interactions norton 2015 it is capable of generating accurate and robust results at higher computational efficiency than other variance based methods saltelli et al 1999 song et al 2015 an open source python package called salib herman and usher 2017 is deployed to perform efast generating two outputs the first order sensitivity indices fosi and the total order sensitivity indices tosi fosi quantifies what proportion of variations in the model output is caused by varying a single parameter tosi accounts for additional variations in the model output caused by that parameter s interactions with others the effect of a parameter s interactions with others on the model output can be quantified by the arithmetic difference between its tosi and fosi m2 1 sensitivity analysis model set up using salib four steps are involved to compute fosi and tosi for each subcatchment in step 1 the eia ratio of each individual subcatchment in the catchment is set as an input parameter in the efast algorithm with a value range of 0 100 this value range allows consideration of all possible extent of eia in the subcatchment representing possible scenarios of future development increase in eia and effects of wsud implementation in converting eia into pervious area thus reducing the amount of runoff generated in eia from entering drainage networks reduction in eia previous studies have introduced concepts to quantify and represent the effectiveness of wsud for stormwater quality control in relation to imperviousness walsh et al 2009 used an index called retention capacity to quantify the degree of disconnection between effective impervious area and its receiving waters zhang et al 2020 introduced an indicator called impervious area offset to provide a straight forward representation of how much additional impervious area can be left untreated due to implementation of stormwater harvesting measures to meet a set pollution control objective similar practice of simulating the effect of wsud for stormwater quantity management through changes in imperviousness has also been applied in the work of löwe et al 2017 where the effect of rainwater harvesting tanks on runoff and flood risk reduction was computed by converting the roof area of buildings from impervious area to pervious area when rainwater tanks were installed in the building a key merit of this approach is that it provides simplicity in simulating possible runoff reduction scenarios in each subcatchment without the burden of exploring and setting up countless possible wsud types designs and sizes in each subcatchment in swmm model it also provides the basis for setting runoff volume reduction targets at subcatchment levels calculated by changes in runoff due to reduction in eia to select appropriate sizes of wsud design to meet flood mitigation objectives at catchment scale in step 2 a sample set containing all input parameters values within the defined value ranges is generated using the efast sampling algorithm in salib the size of the sample set is determined by eq 1 1 n n d where n is the size of the sample set i e total number of swmm model simulations n is the size of base samples user defined and d is the number of model input parameters i e number of subcatchments each with a corresponding eia as n is a function of n the chosen value of n determines the size of n required to obtain reliable results for the sensitivity analysis and its computational cost pianosi et al 2016 the process of deciding an optimal value of n is given in m2 3 in step 3 the swmm model is run with new eia ratio values from the generated sample set the resulting catchment flood volume i e total node flooding in the unit of 10 6 litre and peak flow rates litre per second are recorded and processed in step 4 using salib s efast analysis algorithm to compute fosi and tosi for each subcatchment in step 4 a simple summation of catchment flood volume values and peak flow rate values is used to represent catchment flooding while catchment flood volume is the primary performance indicator in our study preliminary analysis showed that using peak flow rate accelerated the process of identifying influential subcatchments when there was no or limited node overflowing as catchment flood volume values are usually significantly larger than peak flow adding peak flow rate is expected to have limited impact on the prioritisation results step 1 4 is repeated using swmm models with ten design storms created in m1 2 they are of 1 5 10 20 and 50 aeps under short and long durations with varying rainfall temporal patterns m2 2 subcatchment rank based grouping the tosi value of each subcatchment from m2 1 is used to determine the subcatchment s ranking in terms of its influence on catchment flooding tosi is used instead of fosi because a larger tosi value indicates a stronger influence of a subcatchment on flood volume both by itself and through its interactions with others as it would take more than a handful of subcatchments to implement wsud to achieve substantial reduction in flooding subcatchments are further categorised into three influence groups based on their ranking high influence top third medium influence median third and low influence bottom third m2 3 convergence test to ensure robustness of the sensitivity analysis results an appropriate base sample size n is pivotal if n is too small it does not generate enough samples to explore the entire range of the input parameters values for quantifying their impacts on model output if n is too big it results in unnecessarily large sample set n therefore a convergence test is necessary for identifying the minimum n that balances result robustness and computational expense the size of n depends on several factors including the number of input parameters the level of model complexity and the type of convergence of interest e g convergence of sensitivity indices or ranking order of parameters based on the sensitivity indices sarrazin et al 2016 wang and solomatine 2019 for the purpose of our study convergence of subcatchment ranking orders is adopted because it is well suited for identifying top ranking influential subcatchments and is more computationally economic requiring fewer samples than convergence of tosi values sarrazin et al 2016 to further reduce the computational cost convergence is consider reached when a subcatchment ranking stays in the same influence group as n increases the convergence test is carried out by repeatedly running step 2 to 4 in m2 1 and m2 2 with increasing value of n at an interval of 2000 until there is no change in the subcatchments influence groups based on their rankings when over 80 of the subcatchments in the catchment has reached convergence under all design storms the three largest n are considered sufficient and the three sample sets created using these three n values are selected the resulting subcatchment tosi values ranking orders and influence groups from these three sample sets are used in m3 m3 subcatchment prioritisation results from m2 3 are processed to decide subcatchments final influence levels under each design storm assess effect of interactions between subcatchments on catchment flooding and determine subcatchment priorities m3 1 subcatchments influence and certainty levels categorisation a final influence level high medium and low of each subcatchment is determined according to its influence group results based on tosi values from the sensitivity analysis using the largest sample set because the largest sample set is believed to provide the most robust results among the three sample sets subcatchments that are in the same influence groups under all three sample sets have high certainty in their influence level those with fluctuations in their influence groups over the three sample sets are marked with low certainty the influence levels and certainty levels of each subcatchment under all design storms are compared and analysed m3 2 subcatchments interaction assessment under each design storm the effect of each subcatchment s interactions with other subcatchments on catchment flooding known as effectint is quantified by the arithmetic difference between the subcatchment s tosi and fosi values from the sensitivity analysis with the largest sample set m3 3 final priority grouping a scoring system is applied to decide the priority order of subcatchments based on their final influence levels from m3 1 across all design storms for each design storm each subcatchment is awarded 10 points for having high influence 5 for medium and 0 for low the total score for each subcatchment is then used to rank their priority and decide their priority groups three priority groups high medium low priority subcatchments containing equal number of subcatchments are created m4 validation of spatial prioritisation s effectiveness for flood mitigation we apply a validation method adopted from published studies zeng et al 2019 zischg et al 2018 to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying priority subcatchments wsud is assumed to be implemented 1 catchment wide evenly in every subcatchment 2 in high priority subcatchments only 3 in medium priority subcatchments only 4 in low priority subcatchments only under each scenario the same total amount of eia in the catchment is reduced to represent wsud implementation i e the connected impervious area is converted to pervious area reducing runoff to the receiving drainage system the total eia to be reduced is calculated as 2 e i a t o t a l e i a m i n x p g where e i a t o t a l is the total amount of effective impervious area eia to be reduced in the catchment e i a m i n is the numerical size of eia in the smallest subcatchment and x p g is the number of subcatchments in each priority group under scenario 1 catchment wide implementation e i a t o t a l is evenly distributed across the catchment and the amount of eia to be reduced in each subcatchment e i a c w is calculated as 3 e i a c w e i a t o t a l x t o t a l where x t o t a l is the total number of subcatchments in the catchment under scenario 2 4 with targeted implementation in high medium and low priority subcatchments only e i a t o t a l is only distributed to the subcatchments in the priority group considered in the scenario thus eq 3 is modified to 4 e i a t i e i a t o t a l x p g where e i a t i is the amount of eia to be reduced in each subcatchment in the priority group and x p g is the number of subcatchments in the priority group the effectiveness of each scenario under each design storm is then assessed by 5 v r e d u c t i o n v b a s e l i n e v s c e n a r i o v b a s e l i n e where v r e d u c t i o n is the percentage reduction in catchment flood volume v b a s e l i n e is the baseline catchment flood volume under current land use and v s c e n a r i o is the catchment flood volume under each wsud distribution scenario 2 2 case study application the proposed framework was applied in coogee catchment in sydney australia a highly urbanised and steep catchment draining eastward into the sea fig 2 approximately 80 of the catchment is connected to a large stormwater pipe network and the southern part of the catchment is drained by smaller local pipe networks williams 2013 fig 2b most of the pipe networks were designed to cope with rainfalls of 20 aep to 10 aep williams 2013 previous floodplain risk assessment commissioned by randwick city council has revealed significant impact of flooding on the catchment with nearly 2 1 million annual average damage on properties griffin 2016 a spatial representation of the catchment was created using urbanbeats with subcatchments delineated into blocks of 250 250m 6 25 ha a subcatchment size that has been tested and validated in bach et al 2018 see appendix a1 for input data source this size resulted in a manageable number of subcatchments and produced similar runoff volume to a finer block size of 200 200m a total of 57 subcatchments with a total area of 286 89 ha were set up in swmm see appendix a2 for swmm data preparation note that due to limited data available the swmm model in this study was not calibrated future applications of the framework should be used with a calibrated model if feasible ten design storms were created using local rainfall data covering design storms of 1 5 10 20 and 50 aeps under short 90min and long 360min durations see appendix a3 for rainfall intensity and rainfall distribution convergence tests showed that sample sets created with base sample size n 6000 8000 and 10 000 were sufficient to reach convergence for over 80 of the subcatchments under all ten design storms except under the 50 aep 360min duration rainfall see appendix a5 for details only 77 of subcatchments reached convergence under this 50 aep event with no signs of increase in convergence even with n 14000 this is likely a result of limited flooding under low intensity rainfall of long duration the ranking order of subcatchments from the largest sample set created with n 10 000 was used to decide the final influence level of subcatchment for prioritisation given 57 subcatchments in total each influence group had 19 subcatchments as did each priority group with the total number of subcatchments in coogee and the number of subcatchments in each priority group x t o t a l 57 and x p g 19 the smallest size of eia in subcatchments e i a m i n was 0 6 ha according to eq 2 this resulted in e i a t o t a l 11 4 ha which is approximately 4 of total catchment area and 6 of total catchment eia using eq 3 and 4 e i a c w and e i a t i were calculated to be 0 2 ha and 0 6 ha respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 subcatchments influence and certainty levels under different rainfalls there were considerable variations in the subcatchment influence levels under different design storms fig 3 only 40 of the subcatchments had the same level of influence under all storms the variations are likely caused by compounded effects of rainfall characteristics subcatchment locations and interactions with the pipe networks the spatial distribution of subcatchments of different influence levels under different design storms and their relative locations to the pipe networks are shown in fig 4 under rare rainfalls e g 1 aep the majority of highly influential subcatchments were clustered upstream and midstream of the large pipe network as reported in the literature zeng et al 2019 this is mainly due to the direct influences these subcatchments had on the amount of runoff entering the entire large pipe network relieving or aggravating flooding downstream in addition since most of the pipe network was designed for managing runoff from rainfalls of up to 10 aep catchment flooding is more sensitive to changes in these subcatchments under rare and intense rainfalls because these subcatchments have a dominating effect in determining whether the pipe s drainage capacity would be exceeded and by how much as rainfall frequency increased highly influential subcatchments became scattered across the catchment including in downstream areas the spatial dispersion of highly influential subcatchments can be attributed to reduction in flooding under more frequent rainfall of lower intensity while changes in the upstream and midstream subcatchments would still impact the amount of runoff going into the pipe network their effects on catchment flooding were much less pronounced as the pipe network can cope with most of runoff from small rainfalls despite large increase in eia in these subcatchments in addition while the study area is a steep catchment which facilitates rapid flow of runoff and flooding the impact of catchment slope on flood generation is less significant under frequent low intensity storms resulting in localised conditions to be more influential catchment flooding thus became more sensitive to localised changes in subcatchments across the catchment this result highlights the importance of considering pipe network drainage capacity in identifying influential subcatchments under different rainfalls the variation in the spatial distribution of influential subcatchments over different rainfall aeps was observed in both short and long duration rainfalls no other distinctive patterns were found when comparing subcatchments influence between short and long duration rainfalls while some subcatchments e g s6 and s11 fig 3 showed a similar increase or decrease in their influence levels under both short and long duration rainfalls others displayed completely different patterns e g s25 s28 and s48 possibly due to differences in rainfall temporal patterns local drainage configuration relative location to the outlets and uncertainty in the subcatchments influence levels as rainfall frequency increased there was growing uncertainty in subcatchment influence levels fig 4 see appendix a5 for data on certainty levels under 1 aep events there was high certainty in those highly influential subcatchments clustered in the upstream and midstream of the large pipe network and low certainty in only four subcatchments distributed across the catchment however under 50 aep events there were over 10 subcatchments with low certainty in their influence levels all distributed in the areas drained by the large pipe network especially upstream and midstream similar to the changes observed in influence levels uncertainty in these subcatchments could be due to overall limited flooding in the drainage systems under frequent rainfalls of reduced intensity changes in these subcatchments had less deterministic effect on causing substantial changes in flooding as the pipe networks capacity was not always overwhelmed under such rainfalls similar findings have been reported by zeng et al 2019 who noted high instability in the effect of wsud implementation in different locations on flood reduction under low intensity rainfall events due to small flood volume followed by gradual stabilisation as rainfall intensity increased while previous studies have considered a range of rainfall events in identifying influential subcatchments rodriguez et al 2021 simperler et al 2020 our results provide new insights into how the spatial distribution of influential subcatchments varied under different rainfall frequencies considering the notable variations in subcatchment influence and certainty levels under different rainfall intensities flood mitigation targets set based on rainfall aeps will have implications on the optimum spatial distribution of priority subcatchments for wsud implementation rainfall temporal patterns may have contributed to the variations in subcatchments influence but no distinctive effect of rainfall duration on subcatchments influence was found the choice of design storms should be given careful consideration to ensure confidence in the prioritised locations if the main objective is to implement wsud to mitigate flooding from more frequent rainfalls in this catchment the priority locations for its implementation would be more scattered in the catchment apart from the impact of rainfall the high uncertainty in subcatchments influence levels under frequent rainfalls could be due to strong non linearity in the catchment s response to variations in these subcatchments while a larger sensitivity analysis sample set size may help reach better convergence of these subcatchments influence groups there has been reported increase in instability in sensitivity analysis results due to high model complexity wang and solomatine 2019 it is possible that because of the complex hydrological and hydraulic responses of the catchment to variations in subcatchments eia ratio complete stabilisation of these subcatchments effect on catchment flooding may not be reached even with substantial computational effort more future applications of this framework on flood models for other catchments with different levels of complexity would help build a better understanding of such uncertainty in the model 3 2 subcatchment prioritisation based the subcatchments influence levels under ten design storms almost 90 of the high priority subcatchments were found clustered in the upstream and midstream of the large stormwater pipe network with a few placed closed to the network outlets fig 5 among the high priority subcatchments three subcatchments s14 s19 and s26 were highly influential under all design storms i e priority score 100 one key factor that contributed to such high influence of s19 is slope across the catchment the subcatchments slope ranged from 0 11 to 10 15 with a median slope of 5 34 s19 with a slope of 8 03 was among the steepest subcatchments in the area for slope map see appendix a4 similarly s47 priority score 95 had a slope of 7 53 creating a steep gradient for runoff generation resulting in large influx of runoff at fast speed to cause flooding in the receiving conduit while strong influences of catchment slope on flood generation have been observed in absence of modelling underground drainage networks gao et al 2018 our study further shows that slope is influential for subcatchments contribution to pluvial flooding in addition to slope drainage system configuration also plays an important role in subcatchment influence for example the other two subcatchments with priority score of 100 s14 and s26 have a gentler slope 6 14 and 5 4 respectively but were both drained by a small conduit 0 3m in diameter in particular the small conduit receiving runoff from s26 was connected to a downstream conduit with less steep slope which acts as a bottleneck to restrict flows from going downstream an increase in the amount of runoff from s26 could easily overload this part of the network and cause node flooding furthermore the pipe networks configuration can also create compounding effects with slope together for example s6 one of the high priority subcatchments had the steepest slope 10 15 in the catchment and was drained by a small conduit 0 225m in diameter despite its spatial proximity to a catchment outlet this subcatchment was highly influential on catchment flooding when its eia ratio was varied while our results confirm the strong influences of upstream subcatchments as noted in previous studies rodriguez et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 our results also show that subcatchments in other parts of the catchment could be influential due to local subcatchments characteristics and drainage networks configuration in addition to prioritising wsud implementation in these influential subcatchments future developments in these subcatchments should also be given careful consideration as an increase in eia in these locations will likely lead to more flooding than other locations thirteen subcatchments were of low influence under all design storms priority score 0 mostly due to their marginalised location at the catchment boundary with irregular subcatchment shapes i e smaller sizes fig 5 the only exception was subcatchment s22 which had a standard 250 250m catchment area drained by a large conduit 0 75m in diameter to a catchment outlet so changes in this subcatchment did not have significant effects on flooding it is worth noting that in our case study application the priority scores and grouping were based on subcatchment influence levels only i e their certainty levels discussed in section 3 1 were not taken into account to ensure consideration of uncertainty subcatchments with fluctuating influence on catchment flooding can be given weighted scores in the prioritisation process the scoring system is arbitrary depending on the level of risk aversion since there were only three priority groups in our case study and the majority of uncertainties occurred under design storms of 20 and 50 aep which were of relatively low flood risk we expected minimum changes in the subcatchments overall grouping even if each subcatchment with low certainty was given additional weights another aspect to consider is that if certain rainfall frequencies were of interest for instance 20 and 50 aep then the priority scoring system should be modified to prioritise subcatchments that have higher influence levels under these rainfall frequencies and those with high uncertainty in their influence levels should also be carefully considered 3 3 effect of interactions between subcatchments there was evidence of interactions between varying eia ratio in different subcatchments but this was marginal compared to the subcatchments independent influence quantified by effectint values the effect of interaction accounted for on average only 0 11 of variations in catchment flooding across all design storms see appendix a6 for detailed effectint values this means that a subcatchment s overall influence on catchment flooding is predominantly caused by changes in its own eia ratios with low dependency on simultaneous changes in other subcatchments eia ratio thus limited effect of interactions such limited effect is likely a result of homogenous behaviour of the subcatchments due to catchment characteristics subcatchment size and rainfall intensity the catchment overall is steep and highly urbanised so similar hydrological response across the catchment is expected the typical size of subcatchments is 250 250m although this is smaller than the 500 500m subcatchment size used in vercruysse et al 2019 the inclusion of pipe networks in our study means that the inlets of drainage networks could easily experience surcharge because the inlets were originally designed to drain much smaller subcatchments furthermore under heavy rainfalls the runoff generated from individual subcatchments was enough to overload or reduce flooding in the pipe networks leaving limited room for influence from other subcatchments under 1 and 5 aep rainfalls all subcatchments had similar and low effectint values range between 0 06 and 0 14 fig 6 slightly higher effectint values range between 0 09 0 31 were found under rainfalls of 50 aep especially under long duration where the strongest effect of interaction between subcatchments 0 31 was observed in subcatchments drained by the large pipe networks fig 7 this illustrates that with reduced amount of runoff under small rainfalls changes in the eia ratio of multiple subcatchments connected by the same drainage network could have marginally more compounded effects on catchment flooding while our results showed stronger effects of interactions in closely linked subcatchments under small rainfalls than heavy rainfalls it is surprising to see overall limited effects of interaction between subcatchments in the study area this implies that for the study area while gsa is still needed to capture non linear responses of catchment flooding to changes in different subcatchments the subcatchments individual influence on flooding indicated by fosi may be sufficient for prioritising subcatchments for wsud implementation although we did not find significant effect of interactions in the study catchment application of our framework in other catchments with higher heterogeneity across the catchment or smaller subcatchment sizes may yield different results this calls for further research applying the proposed framework to other catchments to gain a better understanding of the effect of interactions should the effect of interactions be significant then focusing on a cluster of subcatchments or a subpart of the drainage network would be necessary for achieving effective flood mitigation 3 4 effectiveness of wsud spatial prioritisation for flood mitigation applying a validation approach adopted from existing studies zischg et al 2018 our results showed that wsud implementation represented by reduction of eia in the high priority subcatchments achieved the largest percentage reduction in flood volume across all design storms ranging between 3 5 to 31 3 for 1 aep to 50 aep storms see fig 8 for percentage reduction in flooding and table 1 for catchment total flood volume under each design storm this demonstrates the success of our framework using gsa in identifying effective locations even with high uncertainty under small rainfalls implementation in medium priority subcatchments ranked second 3 1 21 3 and performed slightly better than catchment wide implementation 2 9 22 1 under all design storms except in 50 aep of long duration low priority subcatchments produced the least reduction under all rainfall scenarios 2 3 11 4 under rainfalls of the same duration all scenarios achieved more flood reduction as rainfall frequency increased this confirms the reported effectiveness of wsud implementation for flood reduction under more frequent rainfalls in existing literature myers and pezzaniti 2019 the differences in flood reduction achieved by the four scenarios also increased with rainfall frequency with the biggest difference observed under long duration rainfall of 50 aep where implementation in high priority subcatchments achieved almost tripled the reduction in low priority subcatchments 11 39 this further highlights the importance of prioritising the most effective subcatchments especially under frequent and small rainfalls the reduced differences under rare rainfalls can be explained by the fact that under rare rainfalls the entire drainage networks became so overloaded that there were limited differences in the effect of changes in subcatchments at different locations of the catchment on flood reduction our finding agrees with the reported decrease in flood reduction differences between different wsud sitting strategies under high intensity rainfall in the work by zeng et al 2019 under rainfalls of the same aep all scenarios showed higher percentage reduction in flood volume under short duration than long duration except in the case of 50 aep due to the smaller amount of flooding generated under most short duration rainfalls table 1 the limited flooding generated under the long duration rainfall of 50 aep may help explain the exception where catchment wide implementation outperformed medium priority subcatchments fig 8 as discussed earlier under frequent low intensity rainfalls catchment flooding became more sensitive to localised distributed changes across the catchment due to more adequate drainage capacity and less significant impact from steep slopes so implementation of wsud homogenously across the catchment may cover more influential subcatchments to deliver better flood reduction than targeting medium priority subcatchments only this may also explain the reported better performance of catchment wide implementation than mid stream subcatchments for flood volume reduction in zeng et al 2019 s work as zeng et al 2019 only simulated one moderate intensity design storm for the comparison with catchment wide implementation it is unknown whether the same conclusion could be drawn under different rainfalls in contrast our results demonstrate that the identified high and medium priority subcatchments achieved more reduction than catchment wide implementation under nine out of ten design storms especially in those of higher intensity providing confidence in the effectiveness of wsud implementation in the prioritised subcatchments for flood mitigation as demonstrated above our framework has been shown to be effective for assessing complex impact of wsud spatial distribution on catchment flooding to identify priority locations the use of changes in eia ratio in subcatchments in our framework offers simplicity and flexibility in simulating the effect of wsud implementation wsud planners can freely decide the range of reduction in eia in each subcatchment based on subcatchment characteristics and development plans in addition assessing the effect of reduction in subcatchment eia on catchment flooding provides the basis for setting a simple and quantifiable subcatchment level wsud runoff volume reduction performance target for selecting wsud options to achieve catchment scale flood mitigation objectives our framework can be coupled with wsud planning models such as urbanbeats to rapidly explore effective wsud options and feasible locations within the prioritised subcatchments to help planners deliver wsud planning for a set of water management targets to achieve integrated urban water management however it is worth noting that the use of reducing eia only simulates the effect of wsud on reducing runoff through converting impervious area to pervious area key wsud performance factors such as retention capacity limitations yao et al 2020 and antecedent conditions including pre burst rainfall and storage capacity myers and pezzaniti 2019 were not considered therefore future work on understanding wsud performance using continuous rainfall simulation and selecting optimal wsud options to realise equivalent effects of impervious area offset zhang et al 2020 for stormwater quantity management would be instrumental to ensure the robustness of the framework future studies should also consider beyond catchment flood volume as flood mitigation is not just about reducing flood volume due to limitation on data availability modelling capacity of swmm and computation cost for running time consuming flood models for gsa our framework focuses primarily on flood volume from overflowing nodes further research modelling actual flood risk and damage taking into account flood duration and velocity would provide a more accurate simulation of the impact of wsud implementation on flood mitigation a weighted multi criteria system and a cost benefit analysis based on flood damage reduction can be adopted to rank and prioritise subcatchments for their overall influence on flood damage to identify the best wsud implementation strategies 4 conclusion to the authors knowledge our proposed framework is the first application of wsud spatial prioritisation for pluvial flood mitigation using global sensitivity analysis through assessing the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in effective impervious area ratio in all subcatchments under multiple design storms our framework provides a systematic assessment of the complex impact of wsud locations on catchment flood volume for the first time enabling identification of wsud implementation strategies with the best outcome for pluvial flood mitigation application of this framework to a highly urbanised steep catchment in sydney australia demonstrated the usefulness of the framework in identifying priority subcatchments even

engineering faculty queensland university of technology queensland 4001 australia corresponding author water sensitive urban design wsud has attracted growing attention as a sustainable approach for mitigating pluvial flooding also known as flash flooding which is expected to increase in frequency and intensity under the impacts of climate change and urbanisation however spatial planning of wsud is not an easy task not only due to the complex urban environment but also the fact that not all locations in the catchment are equally effective for flood mitigation in this study we developed a new wsud spatial prioritisation framework that applies global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify priority subcatchments where wsud implementation will be most effective for flood mitigation for the first time the complex impact of wsud locations on catchment flood volume can be assessed and the gsa in hydrological modelling is adopted for applications in wsud spatial planning the framework uses a spatial wsud planning model the urban biophysical environments and technologies simulator urbanbeats to generate a grid based spatial representation of catchment and an urban drainage model the u s epa storm water management model swmm to simulate catchment flooding the effective imperviousness of all subcatchments was varied simultaneously in the gsa to mimic the effect of wsud implementation and future developments priority subcatchments were identified based on their influence on catchment flooding computed through the gsa the method was tested for an urbanised catchment in sydney australia we found that high priority subcatchments were clustering in the upstream and midstream of the main drainage network with a few distributed close to the catchment outlets rainfall frequency subcatchment characteristics and pipe network configuration were found to be important factors determining the influence of changes in different subcatchments on catchment flooding the effectiveness of the framework in identifying influential subcatchments was validated by comparing the effect of removing 6 of the sydney catchment s effective impervious area under four wsud spatial distribution scenarios our results showed that wsud implementation in high priority subcatchments consistently achieved the largest flood volume reduction 3 5 31 3 for 1 aep to 50 aep storms followed by medium priority subcatchments 3 1 21 3 and catchment wide implementation 2 9 22 1 under most design storms overall we have demonstrated that the proposed method can be useful for maximising wsud flood

capacity of stormwater drainage systems is expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change and urbanisation ipcc 2021 traditional urban flood management relies on engineered drainage systems such as gutters and pipes to convey stormwater away rosenzweig et al 2018 however there has been growing recognition that such single purpose systems are becoming increasingly unaffordable to maintain and expand to meet growing demands urging a paradigm shift to more sustainable approaches ashley et al 2020 in light of this water sensitive urban design wsud alternatively known as sustainable urban drainage systems low impact development and sponge cities fletcher et al 2015 yin et al 2021 has been proposed with an aim to minimise impacts of urban development on the natural water cycle wsud manages stormwater quality and quantity through decentralised infrastructures such as green roofs permeable pavements bio retention cells constructed wetlands and rainwater tanks lloyd et al 2002 through retention and detention of surface runoff these technologies have been found effective in mitigating flooding especially small and frequent floods myers and pezzaniti 2019 these diverse infrastructure options offer flexibility in how they can be distributed across the urban environment zhang and chui 2018 studies have shown that targeted locations for wsud implementation led to better performance in flood mitigation than random or homogeneous placement across the catchment ercolani et al 2018 webber et al 2019 however spatial planning of wsud in the complex urban environment with physical and socio economic constraints is not an easy task zhang and chui 2018 several spatial wsud planning support tools and models such as sustain lee et al 2012 sudsloc viavattene and ellis 2013 and the adaptation support tool van de ven et al 2016 have been developed to assist decision makers in finding feasible locations for wsud many of these models rely on the users to specify specific wsud types and designs which can be time consuming with limited options explored a recently developed planning tool urbanbeats bach et al 2020 allows systematic exploration of thousands of combinations of feasible wsud options and spatial layouts across the urban landscape to meet stormwater harvesting and pollution control objectives in a timely manner urbanbeats has been applied to explore the effect of spatial distribution of rainwater harvesting on water supply networks sitzenfrei et al 2017 and the robustness of wsud implementation scenarios for stormwater pollution management castonguay et al 2018 however urban flood mitigation has not been included as an objective in urbanbeats indeed installing wsud wherever possible lacks strategic consideration of the best location for effective flood mitigation zhang and chui 2018 identification of priority locations for wsud implementation is vital for maximising wsud s potential for flood mitigation but such spatial prioritisation is currently lacking in wsud planning support tools various types of locations have been prioritised for wsud implementation to mitigate flooding flood prone areas are a commonly targeted location to apply wsud for on site flood impact reduction lu et al 2019 alternatively recognising the need to address flooding at its source flood source area has attracted growing attention singh et al 2021 as pluvial flooding is caused by excess stormwater runoff subcatchments with characteristics contributing to high probability of runoff generation are often prioritised these characteristics include upstream locations kapetas and fenner 2020 high impervious area ratios samouei and özger 2020 steep slopes and soils of low infiltration rates kaykhosravi et al 2019 however there is high uncertainty in the occurrence of pluvial flooding due to influence of rainfall characteristics and performance of existing urban drainage systems penning rowsell and korndewal 2019 which means simple subcatchment characteristics may not be sufficient for identifying influential flood source locations for example vercruysse et al 2019 reported high contributions to catchment maximum flood depth from downstream subcatchments this finding was based on results from analysing the sensitivity of catchment flooding to removal of rainfall input in individual subcatchments similarly zischg et al 2018 and rodriguez et al 2021 identified priority locations for wsud implementation by successively implementing fixed extent of wsud in each subcatchment and assessing the corresponding changes in catchment flood volume a bioretention of 500m2 was placed in each subcatchment in zischg et al 2018 s study and the maximum spatial extent for bioretention cells green roofs and permeable pavements in each subcatchment was modelled in the work of rodriguez et al 2021 simperler et al 2020 calculated the discharge reduction potential of each subcatchment by disconnecting that subcatchment from the drainage network in each simulation as there was no correlation between subcatchments discharge reduction potential and their impervious area size or their distance from the overflow point the authors stressed the importance of applying sensitivity analysis for wsud spatial prioritisation current research on wsud spatial prioritisation has seen popular applications of local sensitivity analysis lsa in which the response of the model output i e catchment flooding to variations in the model parameters i e changes in subcatchments is evaluated based on changing the value of a single model parameter e g rainfall input or runoff volume in a single subcatchment around a nominal value one at a time whilst keeping all other parameters fixed saltelli and annoni 2010 despite its popularity there are numerous issues with the application of lsa in wsud spatial prioritisation first traditional lsa has been criticised for their limited applicability to non linear models and inability to consider interactions between parameters saltelli and annoni 2010 song et al 2015 however studies have reported non linear changes in catchment flooding as wsud implementation level increased zeng et al 2019 in addition the effect of interactions i e the compounding effect of implementing wsud in two or more subcatchments at the same time on catchment flooding is not considered in lsa furthermore studies often only simulated limited possible scenarios in each subcatchment either complete removal of runoff simperler et al 2020 or maximum possible wsud implementation based on current land use rodriguez et al 2021 given uncertainty in the nature of future urban development it is critical to understand the catchment s response to a wide range of wsud implementation scenarios across the catchment for identifying futureproof effective locations for flood mitigation in this paper we present a novel wsud spatial prioritisation framework for pluvial flood mitigation using global sensitivity analysis gsa to identify effective subcatchments where wsud implementation would lead to optimum flood volume reduction under a range of design storms gsa explores the entire range of possible values of all input parameters and their interactions making it well suited for analysing non linear models and assessing effects of parameter interactions song et al 2015 it has been useful for identifying influential parameters in hydrological models wang and solomatine 2019 and urban drainage models vanrolleghem et al 2015 to our knowledge this is the first framework for wsud spatial prioritisation for pluvial flood mitigation using gsa by coupling urbanbeats and swmm and then applying gsa we introduce a simple approach to simulate all possible extents of wsud implementation and future development scenarios through changes in effective impervious area eia ratio of subcatchments as a proxy for wsud s effect in reducing runoff by converting impervious area to pervious this enables assessment of the complex impact of wsud implementation in different locations on catchment flooding for the first time based on the influence of subcatchments on flooding under all design storms priority subcatchments that are futureproof for achieving effective flood mitigation can be identified this work also provides the basis for setting a simple and quantifiable target for the selection of wsud design and types at subcatchment scale to meet catchment wide flood mitigation targets which is an essential part of wsud planning for pluvial flood mitigation 2 methodology 2 1 proposed wsud spatial prioritisation framework the proposed framework consists of four modules m1 4 fig 1 module m1 involves setting up a flood model to simulate pluvial flooding a gsa algorithm is applied in module m2 using inputs and outputs of the flood model to assess the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in the effective impervious area eia ratio of different subcatchments the results from the gsa are used to prioritise subcatchments in module m3 finally the effectiveness of the prioritised subcatchments for flood reduction is validated in module m4 m1 flood model set up m1 1 subcatchment delineation a spatial representation of the catchment is produced using urbanbeats bach et al 2020 with input data including the catchment boundary elevation land use types population density and soil types generated through arcmap subcatchments are delineated into scalable grid cells known as blocks using urbanbeats gis based automated block delineation each block contains aggregated spatial information from the input data including key characteristics such as imperviousness which is essential for runoff estimation bach et al 2018 such uniform block based subcatchment delineation has been applied in previous flood source identification studies saghafian et al 2010 vercruysse et al 2019 it reduces the influence of subcatchment size on flood contribution and offers simplicity in communicating with stakeholders for wsud planning it also provides matching spatial scales for future coupling with urbanbeats to select optimal wsud options for flood mitigation m1 2 swmm model preparation catchment flood simulation is performed using the u s epa storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 one of the most commonly used models in urban drainage flood simulation jamali et al 2020 niazi et al 2017 subcatchment properties such as subcatchment area imperviousness and slope in swmm are set based on m1 1 s output catchment shapefile from urbanbeats each subcatchment s outlet is set to the nearest inlet node in the pipe network in swmm following slope gradients ten design storms of 1 50 annual exceedance probabilities aeps under short and long durations are simulated to assess the catchment response the rainfall temporal pattern that resembles the average peak runoff in ten temporal patterns for a given aep and duration is selected to reflect natural storm variability ball et al 2019 m2 sensitivity analysis a popular gsa algorithm known as the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 is applied to assess the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in the eia ratio in subcatchments the efast algorithm is a variance based method which quantifies the variability in the model output caused by variability of individual model parameters and parameter interactions norton 2015 it is capable of generating accurate and robust results at higher computational efficiency than other variance based methods saltelli et al 1999 song et al 2015 an open source python package called salib herman and usher 2017 is deployed to perform efast generating two outputs the first order sensitivity indices fosi and the total order sensitivity indices tosi fosi quantifies what proportion of variations in the model output is caused by varying a single parameter tosi accounts for additional variations in the model output caused by that parameter s interactions with others the effect of a parameter s interactions with others on the model output can be quantified by the arithmetic difference between its tosi and fosi m2 1 sensitivity analysis model set up using salib four steps are involved to compute fosi and tosi for each subcatchment in step 1 the eia ratio of each individual subcatchment in the catchment is set as an input parameter in the efast algorithm with a value range of 0 100 this value range allows consideration of all possible extent of eia in the subcatchment representing possible scenarios of future development increase in eia and effects of wsud implementation in converting eia into pervious area thus reducing the amount of runoff generated in eia from entering drainage networks reduction in eia previous studies have introduced concepts to quantify and represent the effectiveness of wsud for stormwater quality control in relation to imperviousness walsh et al 2009 used an index called retention capacity to quantify the degree of disconnection between effective impervious area and its receiving waters zhang et al 2020 introduced an indicator called impervious area offset to provide a straight forward representation of how much additional impervious area can be left untreated due to implementation of stormwater harvesting measures to meet a set pollution control objective similar practice of simulating the effect of wsud for stormwater quantity management through changes in imperviousness has also been applied in the work of löwe et al 2017 where the effect of rainwater harvesting tanks on runoff and flood risk reduction was computed by converting the roof area of buildings from impervious area to pervious area when rainwater tanks were installed in the building a key merit of this approach is that it provides simplicity in simulating possible runoff reduction scenarios in each subcatchment without the burden of exploring and setting up countless possible wsud types designs and sizes in each subcatchment in swmm model it also provides the basis for setting runoff volume reduction targets at subcatchment levels calculated by changes in runoff due to reduction in eia to select appropriate sizes of wsud design to meet flood mitigation objectives at catchment scale in step 2 a sample set containing all input parameters values within the defined value ranges is generated using the efast sampling algorithm in salib the size of the sample set is determined by eq 1 1 n n d where n is the size of the sample set i e total number of swmm model simulations n is the size of base samples user defined and d is the number of model input parameters i e number of subcatchments each with a corresponding eia as n is a function of n the chosen value of n determines the size of n required to obtain reliable results for the sensitivity analysis and its computational cost pianosi et al 2016 the process of deciding an optimal value of n is given in m2 3 in step 3 the swmm model is run with new eia ratio values from the generated sample set the resulting catchment flood volume i e total node flooding in the unit of 10 6 litre and peak flow rates litre per second are recorded and processed in step 4 using salib s efast analysis algorithm to compute fosi and tosi for each subcatchment in step 4 a simple summation of catchment flood volume values and peak flow rate values is used to represent catchment flooding while catchment flood volume is the primary performance indicator in our study preliminary analysis showed that using peak flow rate accelerated the process of identifying influential subcatchments when there was no or limited node overflowing as catchment flood volume values are usually significantly larger than peak flow adding peak flow rate is expected to have limited impact on the prioritisation results step 1 4 is repeated using swmm models with ten design storms created in m1 2 they are of 1 5 10 20 and 50 aeps under short and long durations with varying rainfall temporal patterns m2 2 subcatchment rank based grouping the tosi value of each subcatchment from m2 1 is used to determine the subcatchment s ranking in terms of its influence on catchment flooding tosi is used instead of fosi because a larger tosi value indicates a stronger influence of a subcatchment on flood volume both by itself and through its interactions with others as it would take more than a handful of subcatchments to implement wsud to achieve substantial reduction in flooding subcatchments are further categorised into three influence groups based on their ranking high influence top third medium influence median third and low influence bottom third m2 3 convergence test to ensure robustness of the sensitivity analysis results an appropriate base sample size n is pivotal if n is too small it does not generate enough samples to explore the entire range of the input parameters values for quantifying their impacts on model output if n is too big it results in unnecessarily large sample set n therefore a convergence test is necessary for identifying the minimum n that balances result robustness and computational expense the size of n depends on several factors including the number of input parameters the level of model complexity and the type of convergence of interest e g convergence of sensitivity indices or ranking order of parameters based on the sensitivity indices sarrazin et al 2016 wang and solomatine 2019 for the purpose of our study convergence of subcatchment ranking orders is adopted because it is well suited for identifying top ranking influential subcatchments and is more computationally economic requiring fewer samples than convergence of tosi values sarrazin et al 2016 to further reduce the computational cost convergence is consider reached when a subcatchment ranking stays in the same influence group as n increases the convergence test is carried out by repeatedly running step 2 to 4 in m2 1 and m2 2 with increasing value of n at an interval of 2000 until there is no change in the subcatchments influence groups based on their rankings when over 80 of the subcatchments in the catchment has reached convergence under all design storms the three largest n are considered sufficient and the three sample sets created using these three n values are selected the resulting subcatchment tosi values ranking orders and influence groups from these three sample sets are used in m3 m3 subcatchment prioritisation results from m2 3 are processed to decide subcatchments final influence levels under each design storm assess effect of interactions between subcatchments on catchment flooding and determine subcatchment priorities m3 1 subcatchments influence and certainty levels categorisation a final influence level high medium and low of each subcatchment is determined according to its influence group results based on tosi values from the sensitivity analysis using the largest sample set because the largest sample set is believed to provide the most robust results among the three sample sets subcatchments that are in the same influence groups under all three sample sets have high certainty in their influence level those with fluctuations in their influence groups over the three sample sets are marked with low certainty the influence levels and certainty levels of each subcatchment under all design storms are compared and analysed m3 2 subcatchments interaction assessment under each design storm the effect of each subcatchment s interactions with other subcatchments on catchment flooding known as effectint is quantified by the arithmetic difference between the subcatchment s tosi and fosi values from the sensitivity analysis with the largest sample set m3 3 final priority grouping a scoring system is applied to decide the priority order of subcatchments based on their final influence levels from m3 1 across all design storms for each design storm each subcatchment is awarded 10 points for having high influence 5 for medium and 0 for low the total score for each subcatchment is then used to rank their priority and decide their priority groups three priority groups high medium low priority subcatchments containing equal number of subcatchments are created m4 validation of spatial prioritisation s effectiveness for flood mitigation we apply a validation method adopted from published studies zeng et al 2019 zischg et al 2018 to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying priority subcatchments wsud is assumed to be implemented 1 catchment wide evenly in every subcatchment 2 in high priority subcatchments only 3 in medium priority subcatchments only 4 in low priority subcatchments only under each scenario the same total amount of eia in the catchment is reduced to represent wsud implementation i e the connected impervious area is converted to pervious area reducing runoff to the receiving drainage system the total eia to be reduced is calculated as 2 e i a t o t a l e i a m i n x p g where e i a t o t a l is the total amount of effective impervious area eia to be reduced in the catchment e i a m i n is the numerical size of eia in the smallest subcatchment and x p g is the number of subcatchments in each priority group under scenario 1 catchment wide implementation e i a t o t a l is evenly distributed across the catchment and the amount of eia to be reduced in each subcatchment e i a c w is calculated as 3 e i a c w e i a t o t a l x t o t a l where x t o t a l is the total number of subcatchments in the catchment under scenario 2 4 with targeted implementation in high medium and low priority subcatchments only e i a t o t a l is only distributed to the subcatchments in the priority group considered in the scenario thus eq 3 is modified to 4 e i a t i e i a t o t a l x p g where e i a t i is the amount of eia to be reduced in each subcatchment in the priority group and x p g is the number of subcatchments in the priority group the effectiveness of each scenario under each design storm is then assessed by 5 v r e d u c t i o n v b a s e l i n e v s c e n a r i o v b a s e l i n e where v r e d u c t i o n is the percentage reduction in catchment flood volume v b a s e l i n e is the baseline catchment flood volume under current land use and v s c e n a r i o is the catchment flood volume under each wsud distribution scenario 2 2 case study application the proposed framework was applied in coogee catchment in sydney australia a highly urbanised and steep catchment draining eastward into the sea fig 2 approximately 80 of the catchment is connected to a large stormwater pipe network and the southern part of the catchment is drained by smaller local pipe networks williams 2013 fig 2b most of the pipe networks were designed to cope with rainfalls of 20 aep to 10 aep williams 2013 previous floodplain risk assessment commissioned by randwick city council has revealed significant impact of flooding on the catchment with nearly 2 1 million annual average damage on properties griffin 2016 a spatial representation of the catchment was created using urbanbeats with subcatchments delineated into blocks of 250 250m 6 25 ha a subcatchment size that has been tested and validated in bach et al 2018 see appendix a1 for input data source this size resulted in a manageable number of subcatchments and produced similar runoff volume to a finer block size of 200 200m a total of 57 subcatchments with a total area of 286 89 ha were set up in swmm see appendix a2 for swmm data preparation note that due to limited data available the swmm model in this study was not calibrated future applications of the framework should be used with a calibrated model if feasible ten design storms were created using local rainfall data covering design storms of 1 5 10 20 and 50 aeps under short 90min and long 360min durations see appendix a3 for rainfall intensity and rainfall distribution convergence tests showed that sample sets created with base sample size n 6000 8000 and 10 000 were sufficient to reach convergence for over 80 of the subcatchments under all ten design storms except under the 50 aep 360min duration rainfall see appendix a5 for details only 77 of subcatchments reached convergence under this 50 aep event with no signs of increase in convergence even with n 14000 this is likely a result of limited flooding under low intensity rainfall of long duration the ranking order of subcatchments from the largest sample set created with n 10 000 was used to decide the final influence level of subcatchment for prioritisation given 57 subcatchments in total each influence group had 19 subcatchments as did each priority group with the total number of subcatchments in coogee and the number of subcatchments in each priority group x t o t a l 57 and x p g 19 the smallest size of eia in subcatchments e i a m i n was 0 6 ha according to eq 2 this resulted in e i a t o t a l 11 4 ha which is approximately 4 of total catchment area and 6 of total catchment eia using eq 3 and 4 e i a c w and e i a t i were calculated to be 0 2 ha and 0 6 ha respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 subcatchments influence and certainty levels under different rainfalls there were considerable variations in the subcatchment influence levels under different design storms fig 3 only 40 of the subcatchments had the same level of influence under all storms the variations are likely caused by compounded effects of rainfall characteristics subcatchment locations and interactions with the pipe networks the spatial distribution of subcatchments of different influence levels under different design storms and their relative locations to the pipe networks are shown in fig 4 under rare rainfalls e g 1 aep the majority of highly influential subcatchments were clustered upstream and midstream of the large pipe network as reported in the literature zeng et al 2019 this is mainly due to the direct influences these subcatchments had on the amount of runoff entering the entire large pipe network relieving or aggravating flooding downstream in addition since most of the pipe network was designed for managing runoff from rainfalls of up to 10 aep catchment flooding is more sensitive to changes in these subcatchments under rare and intense rainfalls because these subcatchments have a dominating effect in determining whether the pipe s drainage capacity would be exceeded and by how much as rainfall frequency increased highly influential subcatchments became scattered across the catchment including in downstream areas the spatial dispersion of highly influential subcatchments can be attributed to reduction in flooding under more frequent rainfall of lower intensity while changes in the upstream and midstream subcatchments would still impact the amount of runoff going into the pipe network their effects on catchment flooding were much less pronounced as the pipe network can cope with most of runoff from small rainfalls despite large increase in eia in these subcatchments in addition while the study area is a steep catchment which facilitates rapid flow of runoff and flooding the impact of catchment slope on flood generation is less significant under frequent low intensity storms resulting in localised conditions to be more influential catchment flooding thus became more sensitive to localised changes in subcatchments across the catchment this result highlights the importance of considering pipe network drainage capacity in identifying influential subcatchments under different rainfalls the variation in the spatial distribution of influential subcatchments over different rainfall aeps was observed in both short and long duration rainfalls no other distinctive patterns were found when comparing subcatchments influence between short and long duration rainfalls while some subcatchments e g s6 and s11 fig 3 showed a similar increase or decrease in their influence levels under both short and long duration rainfalls others displayed completely different patterns e g s25 s28 and s48 possibly due to differences in rainfall temporal patterns local drainage configuration relative location to the outlets and uncertainty in the subcatchments influence levels as rainfall frequency increased there was growing uncertainty in subcatchment influence levels fig 4 see appendix a5 for data on certainty levels under 1 aep events there was high certainty in those highly influential subcatchments clustered in the upstream and midstream of the large pipe network and low certainty in only four subcatchments distributed across the catchment however under 50 aep events there were over 10 subcatchments with low certainty in their influence levels all distributed in the areas drained by the large pipe network especially upstream and midstream similar to the changes observed in influence levels uncertainty in these subcatchments could be due to overall limited flooding in the drainage systems under frequent rainfalls of reduced intensity changes in these subcatchments had less deterministic effect on causing substantial changes in flooding as the pipe networks capacity was not always overwhelmed under such rainfalls similar findings have been reported by zeng et al 2019 who noted high instability in the effect of wsud implementation in different locations on flood reduction under low intensity rainfall events due to small flood volume followed by gradual stabilisation as rainfall intensity increased while previous studies have considered a range of rainfall events in identifying influential subcatchments rodriguez et al 2021 simperler et al 2020 our results provide new insights into how the spatial distribution of influential subcatchments varied under different rainfall frequencies considering the notable variations in subcatchment influence and certainty levels under different rainfall intensities flood mitigation targets set based on rainfall aeps will have implications on the optimum spatial distribution of priority subcatchments for wsud implementation rainfall temporal patterns may have contributed to the variations in subcatchments influence but no distinctive effect of rainfall duration on subcatchments influence was found the choice of design storms should be given careful consideration to ensure confidence in the prioritised locations if the main objective is to implement wsud to mitigate flooding from more frequent rainfalls in this catchment the priority locations for its implementation would be more scattered in the catchment apart from the impact of rainfall the high uncertainty in subcatchments influence levels under frequent rainfalls could be due to strong non linearity in the catchment s response to variations in these subcatchments while a larger sensitivity analysis sample set size may help reach better convergence of these subcatchments influence groups there has been reported increase in instability in sensitivity analysis results due to high model complexity wang and solomatine 2019 it is possible that because of the complex hydrological and hydraulic responses of the catchment to variations in subcatchments eia ratio complete stabilisation of these subcatchments effect on catchment flooding may not be reached even with substantial computational effort more future applications of this framework on flood models for other catchments with different levels of complexity would help build a better understanding of such uncertainty in the model 3 2 subcatchment prioritisation based the subcatchments influence levels under ten design storms almost 90 of the high priority subcatchments were found clustered in the upstream and midstream of the large stormwater pipe network with a few placed closed to the network outlets fig 5 among the high priority subcatchments three subcatchments s14 s19 and s26 were highly influential under all design storms i e priority score 100 one key factor that contributed to such high influence of s19 is slope across the catchment the subcatchments slope ranged from 0 11 to 10 15 with a median slope of 5 34 s19 with a slope of 8 03 was among the steepest subcatchments in the area for slope map see appendix a4 similarly s47 priority score 95 had a slope of 7 53 creating a steep gradient for runoff generation resulting in large influx of runoff at fast speed to cause flooding in the receiving conduit while strong influences of catchment slope on flood generation have been observed in absence of modelling underground drainage networks gao et al 2018 our study further shows that slope is influential for subcatchments contribution to pluvial flooding in addition to slope drainage system configuration also plays an important role in subcatchment influence for example the other two subcatchments with priority score of 100 s14 and s26 have a gentler slope 6 14 and 5 4 respectively but were both drained by a small conduit 0 3m in diameter in particular the small conduit receiving runoff from s26 was connected to a downstream conduit with less steep slope which acts as a bottleneck to restrict flows from going downstream an increase in the amount of runoff from s26 could easily overload this part of the network and cause node flooding furthermore the pipe networks configuration can also create compounding effects with slope together for example s6 one of the high priority subcatchments had the steepest slope 10 15 in the catchment and was drained by a small conduit 0 225m in diameter despite its spatial proximity to a catchment outlet this subcatchment was highly influential on catchment flooding when its eia ratio was varied while our results confirm the strong influences of upstream subcatchments as noted in previous studies rodriguez et al 2021 zeng et al 2019 our results also show that subcatchments in other parts of the catchment could be influential due to local subcatchments characteristics and drainage networks configuration in addition to prioritising wsud implementation in these influential subcatchments future developments in these subcatchments should also be given careful consideration as an increase in eia in these locations will likely lead to more flooding than other locations thirteen subcatchments were of low influence under all design storms priority score 0 mostly due to their marginalised location at the catchment boundary with irregular subcatchment shapes i e smaller sizes fig 5 the only exception was subcatchment s22 which had a standard 250 250m catchment area drained by a large conduit 0 75m in diameter to a catchment outlet so changes in this subcatchment did not have significant effects on flooding it is worth noting that in our case study application the priority scores and grouping were based on subcatchment influence levels only i e their certainty levels discussed in section 3 1 were not taken into account to ensure consideration of uncertainty subcatchments with fluctuating influence on catchment flooding can be given weighted scores in the prioritisation process the scoring system is arbitrary depending on the level of risk aversion since there were only three priority groups in our case study and the majority of uncertainties occurred under design storms of 20 and 50 aep which were of relatively low flood risk we expected minimum changes in the subcatchments overall grouping even if each subcatchment with low certainty was given additional weights another aspect to consider is that if certain rainfall frequencies were of interest for instance 20 and 50 aep then the priority scoring system should be modified to prioritise subcatchments that have higher influence levels under these rainfall frequencies and those with high uncertainty in their influence levels should also be carefully considered 3 3 effect of interactions between subcatchments there was evidence of interactions between varying eia ratio in different subcatchments but this was marginal compared to the subcatchments independent influence quantified by effectint values the effect of interaction accounted for on average only 0 11 of variations in catchment flooding across all design storms see appendix a6 for detailed effectint values this means that a subcatchment s overall influence on catchment flooding is predominantly caused by changes in its own eia ratios with low dependency on simultaneous changes in other subcatchments eia ratio thus limited effect of interactions such limited effect is likely a result of homogenous behaviour of the subcatchments due to catchment characteristics subcatchment size and rainfall intensity the catchment overall is steep and highly urbanised so similar hydrological response across the catchment is expected the typical size of subcatchments is 250 250m although this is smaller than the 500 500m subcatchment size used in vercruysse et al 2019 the inclusion of pipe networks in our study means that the inlets of drainage networks could easily experience surcharge because the inlets were originally designed to drain much smaller subcatchments furthermore under heavy rainfalls the runoff generated from individual subcatchments was enough to overload or reduce flooding in the pipe networks leaving limited room for influence from other subcatchments under 1 and 5 aep rainfalls all subcatchments had similar and low effectint values range between 0 06 and 0 14 fig 6 slightly higher effectint values range between 0 09 0 31 were found under rainfalls of 50 aep especially under long duration where the strongest effect of interaction between subcatchments 0 31 was observed in subcatchments drained by the large pipe networks fig 7 this illustrates that with reduced amount of runoff under small rainfalls changes in the eia ratio of multiple subcatchments connected by the same drainage network could have marginally more compounded effects on catchment flooding while our results showed stronger effects of interactions in closely linked subcatchments under small rainfalls than heavy rainfalls it is surprising to see overall limited effects of interaction between subcatchments in the study area this implies that for the study area while gsa is still needed to capture non linear responses of catchment flooding to changes in different subcatchments the subcatchments individual influence on flooding indicated by fosi may be sufficient for prioritising subcatchments for wsud implementation although we did not find significant effect of interactions in the study catchment application of our framework in other catchments with higher heterogeneity across the catchment or smaller subcatchment sizes may yield different results this calls for further research applying the proposed framework to other catchments to gain a better understanding of the effect of interactions should the effect of interactions be significant then focusing on a cluster of subcatchments or a subpart of the drainage network would be necessary for achieving effective flood mitigation 3 4 effectiveness of wsud spatial prioritisation for flood mitigation applying a validation approach adopted from existing studies zischg et al 2018 our results showed that wsud implementation represented by reduction of eia in the high priority subcatchments achieved the largest percentage reduction in flood volume across all design storms ranging between 3 5 to 31 3 for 1 aep to 50 aep storms see fig 8 for percentage reduction in flooding and table 1 for catchment total flood volume under each design storm this demonstrates the success of our framework using gsa in identifying effective locations even with high uncertainty under small rainfalls implementation in medium priority subcatchments ranked second 3 1 21 3 and performed slightly better than catchment wide implementation 2 9 22 1 under all design storms except in 50 aep of long duration low priority subcatchments produced the least reduction under all rainfall scenarios 2 3 11 4 under rainfalls of the same duration all scenarios achieved more flood reduction as rainfall frequency increased this confirms the reported effectiveness of wsud implementation for flood reduction under more frequent rainfalls in existing literature myers and pezzaniti 2019 the differences in flood reduction achieved by the four scenarios also increased with rainfall frequency with the biggest difference observed under long duration rainfall of 50 aep where implementation in high priority subcatchments achieved almost tripled the reduction in low priority subcatchments 11 39 this further highlights the importance of prioritising the most effective subcatchments especially under frequent and small rainfalls the reduced differences under rare rainfalls can be explained by the fact that under rare rainfalls the entire drainage networks became so overloaded that there were limited differences in the effect of changes in subcatchments at different locations of the catchment on flood reduction our finding agrees with the reported decrease in flood reduction differences between different wsud sitting strategies under high intensity rainfall in the work by zeng et al 2019 under rainfalls of the same aep all scenarios showed higher percentage reduction in flood volume under short duration than long duration except in the case of 50 aep due to the smaller amount of flooding generated under most short duration rainfalls table 1 the limited flooding generated under the long duration rainfall of 50 aep may help explain the exception where catchment wide implementation outperformed medium priority subcatchments fig 8 as discussed earlier under frequent low intensity rainfalls catchment flooding became more sensitive to localised distributed changes across the catchment due to more adequate drainage capacity and less significant impact from steep slopes so implementation of wsud homogenously across the catchment may cover more influential subcatchments to deliver better flood reduction than targeting medium priority subcatchments only this may also explain the reported better performance of catchment wide implementation than mid stream subcatchments for flood volume reduction in zeng et al 2019 s work as zeng et al 2019 only simulated one moderate intensity design storm for the comparison with catchment wide implementation it is unknown whether the same conclusion could be drawn under different rainfalls in contrast our results demonstrate that the identified high and medium priority subcatchments achieved more reduction than catchment wide implementation under nine out of ten design storms especially in those of higher intensity providing confidence in the effectiveness of wsud implementation in the prioritised subcatchments for flood mitigation as demonstrated above our framework has been shown to be effective for assessing complex impact of wsud spatial distribution on catchment flooding to identify priority locations the use of changes in eia ratio in subcatchments in our framework offers simplicity and flexibility in simulating the effect of wsud implementation wsud planners can freely decide the range of reduction in eia in each subcatchment based on subcatchment characteristics and development plans in addition assessing the effect of reduction in subcatchment eia on catchment flooding provides the basis for setting a simple and quantifiable subcatchment level wsud runoff volume reduction performance target for selecting wsud options to achieve catchment scale flood mitigation objectives our framework can be coupled with wsud planning models such as urbanbeats to rapidly explore effective wsud options and feasible locations within the prioritised subcatchments to help planners deliver wsud planning for a set of water management targets to achieve integrated urban water management however it is worth noting that the use of reducing eia only simulates the effect of wsud on reducing runoff through converting impervious area to pervious area key wsud performance factors such as retention capacity limitations yao et al 2020 and antecedent conditions including pre burst rainfall and storage capacity myers and pezzaniti 2019 were not considered therefore future work on understanding wsud performance using continuous rainfall simulation and selecting optimal wsud options to realise equivalent effects of impervious area offset zhang et al 2020 for stormwater quantity management would be instrumental to ensure the robustness of the framework future studies should also consider beyond catchment flood volume as flood mitigation is not just about reducing flood volume due to limitation on data availability modelling capacity of swmm and computation cost for running time consuming flood models for gsa our framework focuses primarily on flood volume from overflowing nodes further research modelling actual flood risk and damage taking into account flood duration and velocity would provide a more accurate simulation of the impact of wsud implementation on flood mitigation a weighted multi criteria system and a cost benefit analysis based on flood damage reduction can be adopted to rank and prioritise subcatchments for their overall influence on flood damage to identify the best wsud implementation strategies 4 conclusion to the authors knowledge our proposed framework is the first application of wsud spatial prioritisation for pluvial flood mitigation using global sensitivity analysis through assessing the sensitivity of catchment flooding to changes in effective impervious area ratio in all subcatchments under multiple design storms our framework provides a systematic assessment of the complex impact of wsud locations on catchment flood volume for the first time enabling identification of wsud implementation strategies with the best outcome for pluvial

14903,catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate in water has been studied primarily using nanoparticle slurries with constant hydrogen gas h2 bubbling such slurry reactors are impractical in full scale water treatment applications because 1 unattached catalysts are difficult to be recycled reused and 2 gas bubbling is inefficient for delivering h2 membrane catalyst film reactors mcfr resolve these limitations by depositing nanocatalysts on the exterior of gas permeable hollow fiber membranes that deliver h2 directly to the catalyst film the goal of this study was to compare the technical feasibility and benefits of various methods for attaching bimetallic palladium indium pd in nanocatalysts for nitrate reduction in water and subsequently select the most effective method four pd in

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due largely to fertilizer run off into surface waters or infiltration into groundwater nitrate is widely occurring and among the most common water quality violations in drinking water systems globally allaire et al 2018 pennino et al 2017 picetti et al 2022 ward et al 2018 nitrate is regulated in drinking water because it causes methemoglobinemia in infants however nitrate also may alter thyroid function and has been identified as a possible carcinogen jones et al 2019 ward et al 2018 and it has been suggested the current usepa maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mgno3 n l who limit of 50 mg no3 l or 11 3 mg no3 n l may need to be lowered to at least 5 mgno3 n l to protect against these other health endpoints inoue choi et al 2015 jones et al 2017 consequently many drinking water systems require nitrate treatment most nitrate treatment technologies separate nitrate from water e g ion exchange and reverse osmosis khera et al 2021 creating concentrated brines that are costly to dispose of gayen et al 2018 guo et al 2018 tugaoen et al 2017 an alternative nitrate treatment is catalytic hydrogenation using h2 as the electron donor to reduce no3 to harmless di nitrogen gas n2 individual platinum group metals pgm promote rapid nitrite no2 reduction but are extremely slow or non reactive for reducing no3 to no2 marks et al 2019 one way to overcome the first rate limiting step is to integrate pgm catalysts within biofilms which can reduce no3 to no2 zhou et al 2017 another means to enable no3 reduction to no2 plus subsequent catalysis to n2 or ammonium ion nh4 is bimetallic catalysis guo et al 2018 maia et al 2007 valiyeva et al 2019 among the effective bimetallic catalysts for h2 based catalysis of no3 is palladium plus indium pd in daum and vorlop 1999 prüsse et al 2000 prüsse and vorlop 2001 heterogeneous reduction reactions of no3 to n2 involve adsorption of the n species followed by its reduction on the catalyst surface consuming 2 5 moles h2 mole no3 n species adsorption and reduction are represented by the following equations eq 1 2 n o 3 2 h 2 2 n o 3 p d i n 4 h p d 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o eq 2 2 n o 2 3 h 2 2 n o 2 p d 6 h p d n 2 2 o h 2 h 2 o where brackets i e pd or pd in indicate a mono or bi metallic catalyst site onto which the species are bound respectively the first step eq 1 achieving no3 conversion to no2 occurs on the surface of a pd in bimetallic catalyst i e no3 pd in this step often is rate limiting because after in abstracts an oxygen atom from no3 a neighboring site h pd acts as a redox mediator by reducing the oxidized in to its original elemental state gao and li 2011 ilinich et al 2003 the second step is no2 reduction which occurs on a pd surface i e no2 pd several stepwise mechanisms have been proposed for nitrite reduction pathways to n2 and nh4 ebbesen et al 2008 huo et al 2017 shin et al 2014 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 since consensus has not been reached on the stepwise mechanisms we present overall equations for the production of n2 gas eq 2 and nh4 eq 3 notable is that all the reactions produce hydroxide ion oh which can influence ph in poorly buffered solutions eq 3 2 n o 2 6 h 2 2 n o 2 p d 12 h p d 2 n h 4 4 o h pgm catalysis with h2 can achieve an excess of 90 nitrate removal in batch reactors with the catalyst present in slurry form and h2 bubbling bertoch et al 2017 heck et al 2019 sá and vinek 2005 trawczyński et al 2011 while the use of batch slurry reactors is useful for material discovery or mechanistic studies a major challenge to continuous flow water treatment process scale up is the need to recover the freely dispersed slurry catalyst from the water after denitrification catalyst separation and recycle are possible using magnetic separation or ceramic membranes falinski et al 2020 powell et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2016 but they risk catalyst loss or deactivation during the recycle process a second challenge of batch slurry reactors stems from the low solubility of h2 in water which results in costly bubbling and oversupply of h2 as well as unsafe off gassing of combustible h2 bertoch et al 2017 chen et al 2017 choe et al 2015 to resolve the challenges of batch slurry reactors we utilized the membrane catalyst film reactor mcfr first reported by zhou et al 2017 for mono metallic catalysts the mcfr delivers bubble free h2 by its diffusion through non porous membranes that have catalysts immobilized on the outer surface the membranes retain the catalyst and deliver h2 directly to the catalysts thus far catalyst immobilization in the mcfr has been achieved through autocatalytic reduction i e pd ii to pd 0 using only mono metallic pd catalytic films marks et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 2021 however catalytic nitrate hydrogenation calls for a bimetallic nanocatalyst thus we evaluated methods for synthesizing and attaching the bimetallic pd in nanocatalysts on the membrane surface the goal of this study is to evaluate four methods of synthesis and attachment to determine which method results in nearly irreversible attachment while simultaneously having rapid removal of nitrate the four methods evaluated were 1 in situ mcfr h2 where pd and in were autocatalytically reduced inside the reactor zhou et al 2021 2 in situ flask synthesis where pd and in were reduced directly on the hollow fibers in a flask 3 ex situ aerosol impaction driven assembly aida where pre formed pd in nanocatalysts were spray attached to the hollow fibers atkinson et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and 4 ex situ electrostatic where pre formed pd in nanocatalysts were attached to the hollow fibers electrostatically guo et al 2020 each of the four methods was evaluated in terms of its repeatable activity for reducing no3 and for the stability of the catalyst on the membranes as an outcome of these experiments we identified the superior method that exhibited negligible catalyst loss and consistent no3 removal over three sequential use cycles i e one cycle involves filling the reactor performing nitrate reduction replacing water in the reactor this study identified the superior deposition method for future optimization and scale up studies 2 experimental methods 2 1 four methods to deposit pd in bimetallic nanocatalysts on hollow fiber membranes polymer hollow fiber bundles polypropylene 200 μm od 100 110 μm id wall thickness 50 55 μm length 10 cm teijin ltd japan were prepared before nanocatalyst deposition tang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 zhou et al 2021 fiber bundles were formed by cutting 60 fibers to 25 centimeters in length and gluing the bundle together at both ends zhou et al 2017 2019 2021 table 1 and fig s1 summarize the four methods used to deposit pd in nanocatalysts on the surface of the membranes the quantity of metal on the surface μg cm2 was determined by acid digestion of fibers followed by icp ms analysis see below here we provide background on how catalyst synthesis occurs and the four methods being examined pd in synthesis and deposition involve three distinct steps 1 auto catalytic reduction of pd2 to pd0 2 pd0 catalyzed reduction of in3 to in0 and 3 attachment of pd in catalyst onto the h2 permeable hollow fiber surface we evaluated two general strategies for the pd and in reduction steps in the first strategy the pd in nanocatalysts were reduced and formed in the presence of the h2 delivering hollow fibers we call this in situ formation pd0 nanocatalysts produced in situ form robustly attached films on the hollow fibers marks et al 2020 2019 zhou et al 2021 in the second strategy the pd in nanocatalysts were pre formed before deposition onto the membranes we call this ex situ formation pre formed pd in nanocatalysts are known to be highly active for nitrate removal in a batch slurry reactor guo et al 2018 we evaluated two in situ and two ex situ methods to produce and deposit pd in nanocatalysts described below method 1 in situ mcfr h2 the mcfr method for pd autocatalytic reduction and deposition long et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 2021 was modified to form bimetallic pd in nanocatalysts this method used a 2 mm sodium tetrachloropalladate solution in a 4 mm phosphate buffer having a ph of 7 0 33 ml of this solution was added to a mcfr the same mcfr in which the reaction will take place as depicted in fig 1 and circulated overnight with 15 psig h2 pressure 2 atm absolute in the membranes lumen the pd2 precursor was autocatalytically reduced to pd0 and deposited on the membrane surface zhou et al 2017 following pd0 deposition the medium was removed and an indium coating medium 0 05 mm indium chloride tetrahydrate was added to the reactor to reduce in3 to in0 on the pd0nps again using 15 psig h2 for 24 hours method 2 in situ flask synthesis in the flask synthesis method pd and in reduction and attachment onto membranes were conducted in a round bottom flask with methanol and h2 reductants delivered from the solution similar to a previously published method guo et al 2018 pd in nanocatalysts were reduced and grown directly onto the fiber surface using palladium acetate precursor initially the pd2 precursor methanol reductant and the hollow fiber membranes were contained within a round bottom flask and stirred overnight when pd2 was reduced by methanol oxidation to form pd0 nanocatalysts on the membranes outer surface the in3 precursor was then added to the solution on a 1 10 mass ratio in pd and reduced to in0 on the hollow fiber surface with h2 bubbling for at least 30 minutes for the next two ex situ methods pd in nanocatalysts were prepared using sodium tetrachloropalladate palladium precursor indium chloride tetrahydrate precursor ethoxyethanol ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone by following previously published hydrothermal methods elias et al 2020 guo et al 2020 briefly an aqueous solution of pd2 salt was prepared by dissolving 57 mg of na2pdcl4 in 3 ml of deionized water the solution was added to a flask with 8 ml of an aqueous solution containing 105 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 60 mg of l ascorbic acid the reductant the flask was immersed in an 80 c oil bath for 4 hours with continuous stirring until ascorbic acid oxidation had reduced pd2 to pd0 nanocatalysts the solution was cooled to room temperature and the pd nanocatalysts were separated by centrifugation finally the in3 precursor was added to the pd0 nanocatalysts at a 1 10 mass ratio of in pd the in3 was reduced to in0 by bubbling h2 as the reductant for 30 minutes at room temperature 22 c method 3 ex situ aerosol impaction driven assembly a low pressure chamber and spray attachment called aerosol impaction driven assembly or aida atkinson et al 2020 was used to spray pre formed pd in nanocatalysts guo et al 2020 onto the hollow fibers 1000 mg l of the pre formed pd in catalysts was added to deionized water to form an aerosol spray medium atkinson et al 2020 the aerosol was accelerated through a low pressure chamber towards the hollow fibers which were wrapped around an oscillating plate the chamber was under vacuum 0 03 atm to ensure that the nanocatalysts traveled directly from the exit point of the nozzle to the hollow fibers surface method 4 ex situ electrostatic in the ex situ electrostatic method pre formed pd in nanocatalysts guo et al 2020 were attached to the membranes electrostatically the electrostatic attachment was between the pre formed pd in nanoparticles with a negative charge due to surface reactions with oxygen and the polypropylene fibers which had a positive surface charge li et al 2018 bundles of the polymer fibers were immersed overnight in a water slurry of 1000 mg l of pd in nanocatalyst the hollow fiber bundle was removed and dried for 24 hours at room temperature in a vacuum chamber to minimize oxygen exposure which could re oxidize the pd0 or in0 though xps characterization of the in situ mcfr h2 method indicated partial in oxidation fig s6 prior work by our group successfully demonstrated that the reductants utilized herein were able to reduce metal catalyst precursors to their elemental states this study also found oxidation to in3 was a result of exposure to air during sample preparation guo et al 2018 2 2 chemicals sodium nitrate nano3 99 0 sodium nitrite nano2 97 0 palladium ii

milli q system with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 2 3 catalytic hydrogenation reactor set up and operation membranes with deposited pd in nanocatalysts were assembled into an mcfr made of a glass tube 27 cm in length and 6 cm in diameter connected with chemical resistant and gas impermeable viton tubing masterflex usa stopcocks and barbed fittings following the methods of zhou zhou et al 2019 2017 2021 the membranes were directly connected to the h2 supply and pressurized to 15 20 psig 2 1 to 2 5 atm absolute in the membranes lumen and h2 diffused through the gas permeable nonporous polypropylene membranes experiments were performed in batch mode with water recirculation 320 ml min 1 via a peristaltic pump masterflex usa as an important safety note working with hydrogen gas can pose a fire hazard proper safety measures should be established and approved by safety authorities before conducting similar experiments reactivity performance of the bimetallic catalysts on the fibers was evaluated by the loss of no3 which gave the rate of catalytic hydrogenation of 100 mg l 1 of no3 23 mg l 1 as n equivalent to 1 6 mm and the formation of n2 and nh4 which defined selectivity the solution ph was set at the start of the batch experiment by bubbling the nitrate medium with co2 gas until it reached a ph of 5 0 the ph rose over the experiments due to base production as shown in eqs 2 and 3 aliquots of 0 5 ml were collected from the sampling port at time intervals and assayed for no3 no2 and nh4 2 4 analytical methods anions were measured by ion

pd and in on the membranes μg cm2 and enable mass balance on the catalyst metals pd in within the reactors fibers were removed from the reactor cut into equal length sections of 8 cm microwave digested in nitric and hydrochloric acids at a 1 1 volumetric ratio and then analyzed for dissolved pd and in fiber samples were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem and scanning transmission electron microscope stem jem arm200f to investigate attachment and distribution of nanocatalysts detailed procedures of sample collection preparation and instrument model and setup followed zhou et al 2014 water samples taken before and after each cycle of operation were also analyzed for pd and in by icp ms following acid digestion 3 results and discussion 3 1 deposition method influenced loading size uniformity and nanocatalyst dispersion on h2 permeable fibers table 2 shows that the resulting mass of nanocatalysts deposited on the hollow fiber membranes ranged from 7 9 to 96 µg pd cm2 and 1 to 18 µg in cm2 the target overall pd in mass ratio μg μg was 100 1 for the in situ mcfr h2 method and 10 1 for all other methods see justification in target pd in ratio in si the resulting pd in ratios varied significantly from the indicated targets for instance despite both ex situ methods utilizing the same 10 1 mass ratio of pd in pre formed nanocatalysts the resulting pd in ratios deposited to the fibers were 1 6 and 16 the primary reason for the different pd in ratios is the varying efficiency of pd attachment on the membranes demonstrating that achieving complete pd2 and in3 precursor attachment was operationally difficult the rightmost column of table 2 shows the pd attachment efficiency which quantifies pd attached to the hollow fiber surface as a fraction of the total precursor pd2 utilized in the deposition process a low pd attachment efficiency signals a wasteful use of pd during attachment to the fibers all methods except the in situ mcfr h2 attached less than half of the pd applied during deposition perhaps the other methods could have been adjusted to apply additional precursor and achieve the same catalyst mass loading however this would not be practical because losing over half of the applied pd2 would not be economical upon scaling up from lab to pilot scale mcfr an economic impact assessment is provided in table s1 in contrast the in situ mcfr h2 deposition led to the highest proportion of precursor pd attachment 96 to the hollow fibers and was the only method to achieve a pd in mass ratio within a 5 error of what was targeted with nanocatalyst loss having an insignificant economic burden table s1 because the size uniformity and surface distribution of nanocatalysts influence reactivity we evaluated these characteristics for all four deposition methods to evaluate nanocatalyst size and surface distribution energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx during sem detected pd and in within the white light gray areas while the darker gray regions contain only carbon from the hollow fiber and oxygen fig s2 sem images in fig 2 revealed that the nanocatalyst size uniformity and surface distribution varied depending on the deposition method the in situ mcfr h2 method distributed nanocatalysts homogeneously across the fiber surface area fig 2a transmission electron microscopy tem imaging of cross sections of hollow fibers revealed that the in situ mcfr h2 catalyst film was 200 nm thick with individual particles of 5 10 nm in width layered on top of one another fig s3 in contrast the in situ flask synthesis method resulted in non uniform catalyst sizes which is evident in fig 2b where the bottom of the image shows particles ranging from micron to nanometer scale catalysts the ex situ depositions using uniform pre formed 5 to 8 nm nanocatalysts fig s4 agglomerated the nanocatalysts ex situ aida deposition agglomerated these nanocatalysts to form 200 nm to larger particles attached to the fibers fig 2c the ex situ electrostatic had non uniform distribution with fig 2d showing an agglomerated nanocatalyst film in the top half of the image and the absence of any catalysts in the lower half of the image these results show a lack of size uniformity and surface distribution with in situ flask synthesis and both ex situ depositions conversely in situ mcfr h2 deposited uniformly dispersed 5 10 nm nanocatalysts lower magnification sem images show that the surface coverage of nanocatalysts on the hollow fibers differed by deposition method especially in regards to ex situ vs in situ deposition fig s5 a view of 1 mm axial length of in situ mcfr h2 hollow fibers proves that nanocatalysts covered at least 90 of the fiber surface fig s5a spots of bare hollow fiber are infrequent and probably artifacts of handling the hollow fibers during sample preparation the in situ flask synthesis deposition fig s5b also covered a high proportion of the fiber in contrast both ex situ depositions did not uniformly disperse the nanocatalysts ex situ aida deposition had areas that were highly concentrated with nanocatalysts fig s5c while the remainder of the surface remained bare similarly the ex situ electrostatic deposition fig s5d had stripes of pd deposition on the top and middle of the fiber while the remainder of the fiber area remained bare in a comparison of the methods the in situ mcfr h2 deposition covered the largest fraction of the hollow fiber surface with nanocatalysts given the importance of catalyst size and surface area for nitrate adsorption the uniform sizing and high surface coverage of nanocatalysts achieved with in situ mcfr h2 deposition may contribute to its superior ability to degrade nitrate 3 2 nanocatalyst loss from hollow fiber surface over time to evaluate nanocatalyst release and or dissolution pd and in concentrations in the water recirculating through the reactors were quantified following three sequential no3 removal cycles additionally the hollow fibers were removed from the mcfr acid digested and analyzed for pd and in contents fig 3 shows the percentages of initially loaded pd and in that were released from the hollow fibers after three cycles three of the four deposition methods exhibited substantial loss of pd the in situ flask synthesis method released 29 of its initial pd load and both ex situ deposition methods had 38 pd loss over the three no3 removal cycles these observed pd losses lower the availability of active sites for h2 adsorption over time as a result an accompanying decrease in the nitrate reduction activity in subsequent no3 removal cycles can be expected compared to pd in did not release as significantly as pd with a loss of 15 or less of the initial in loading for the three deposition methods the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method overcame the limitations of the other bimetallic deposition methods and minimized catalyst release pd leaching was minimal with 0 05 of initial pd a similarly small proportion 0 05 of in was released during operation based on the results for pd and in release we conclude that the reductant choice was the determining factor for nanocatalysts stability all four deposition methods utilized h2 as the in3 reductant and exhibited low in release for pd three out of four methods in situ flask synthesis ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic utilized either methanol or ascorbic acid to reduce pd2 and the resulting pd losses were 29 the only method to utilize h2 as the reductant for pd2 and in2 in situ mcfr h2 had minimal pd loss 0 05 taken together the metal loss results indicate that using h2 as the reductant led to stable bimetallic pd in nanocatalyst film deposition over three nitrate removal cycles the in situ mcfr h2 method is preferred for nanocatalyst attachment because it allows for continuous hydrogen supply between pd in deposition and nitrate reduction experiments unlike the other three methods which require transport of the nanocatalyst deposited fibers from the synthesizing reactor to the mcfr this method deposits pd in nanocatalysts directly within the mcfr despite attempts to minimize exposure to air during transport exposure to air and water of varying chemistries was unavoidable it may have been possible to improve catalyst stability for the other three methods by adding a stronger reductant prior to or during nitrate reduction but this could adversely impact the process s suitability for drinking water applications by introducing chemicals like borohydrate additionally the presence of chemical reductants in solution could cause pd in nanocatalyst formation in the liquid phase rather than on the hollow fiber surface in contrast the in situ mcfr h2 method utilizes an h2 concentration gradient to maximize the thermodynamic conditions for pd in nanocatalysts to nucleate and grow on the fiber surface overall the operational advantages and negligible catalyst loss make the in situ mcfr h2 method the preferred choice for nanocatalyst attachment 3 3 the nanocatalyst deposition method influenced pd normalized nitrate reduction and byproduct selectivity fig 4 a shows the kinetics of no3 reduction during the first cycle experiments for the different deposition methods along with a control no pd in nanocatalysts on the fiber no no3 removal was observed without nanocatalyst deposition i e control the ex situ aida deposition showed a slight lag followed by continuous removal of no3 this lag likely was a result of the time needed for h2 to re reduce oxidized pd in catalyst formed during exposure to oxygen in the attachment steps the other three deposition methods did not exhibit a lag and degraded no3 at similarly rapid rates during the first cycle 2 mg l no3 n remaining after 200 minutes pd mass normalized degradation rate constants were calculated instead of membrane surface area normalized rates because the fraction of membrane surface area deposited by nanocatalysts μg cm2 varied among the different deposition methods rate constants kpd ranged from 1 1 to 11 min 1gpd 1 despite having the lowest overall rate of no3 removal over time fig 4a ex situ aida deposition had the highest kpd value 11 min 1gpd 1 because its low pd mass loading 7 9 µg cm2 the in situ mcfr h2 and ex situ electrostatic methods had the lowest kpd values 1 1 and 2 0 min 1gpd 1 respectively in part because of their high pd loadings 96 and 88 µg cm2 thus because a higher pd loading did not have a large enough increase in the no3 removal rate to increase kpd maximizing pd loading was not necessarily an effective strategy for increasing the kinetics of no3 reduction fig 4b and c show formations of nh4 and no2 over time in the same first cycle of no3 reduction experiments the presence of nh3 gas was unlikely as the ph of all water samples were below the 9 25 pka of nh3 by more than 1 ph unit the in situ mcfr h2 and ex situ aida depositions achieved 50 conversion of initial no3 to nh4 in contrast the in situ flask synthesis and ex situ electrostatic deposited hollow fibers reduced 30 of the initial no3 to nh4 the high nitrate reduction activity in the first 60 minutes exhibited by the in situ flask synthesis and ex situ electrostatic methods likely allowed for higher adsorbed n concentrations on the catalyst surface leading to increased n n pairing to form n gases zhou et al 2017 formation of n2 gas is generally preferred in water treatment settings due to the toxicity of nh4 and the desire to have total n removal thus means to increase selectivity to n2 will be needed while the first operational cycle successfully removed no3 regardless of the deposition methods the second and third cycles exhibited less no3 removal for three of the four methods fig 5 shows representative results of the sequential cycles the in situ mcfr h2 achieved similar even slightly improved no3 removal for its second and third cycles although the in situ flask synthesis method exhibited complete no3 removal at the end of cycles 2 and 3 the kinetics were slower over the first 60 minutes the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic methods yielded substantially poorer nitrate removal in cycles 2 and 3 although cycle 3 was better than cycle 2 as is explained in the next paragraph two hypotheses may explain the loss in catalytic activity loss of catalyst from the membrane surface fig 3 and catalyst oxidation between cycles changes in the reactor s solution between each cycle involved opening the reactor which likely led to the loss of surface bound h2 on the catalyst exposure to o2 and consequential oxidization of the nanocatalyst surface to further test the catalyst oxidation hypothesis and potentially remedy the problem the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic fibers were submerged in water and exposed to h2 flow during feedwater changes between the second and third no3 reduction cycles fig 5 shows that in both cases the catalytic no3 removal increased between the second and third no3 removal cycles the increase in catalytic activity during the third cycles showed that submerging the catalyst loaded fibers in water with h2 flow between cycles had a positive effect furthermore this observation supports the hypothesis that the catalyst had been partially oxidized prior to the second cycle experiment although the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic fibers exhibited improved catalytic activity in the third cycle neither fully recovered the nitrate removal activity exhibited in the first cycle the inability to recover full no3 reduction reinforces that the loss of pd in catalysts fig 3 was an important contributor to the loss of reactivity although post treatment with h2 could recover some of the reactivity overall in situ mcfr h2 deposition of bimetallic pd in nanocatalyst films clearly was the superior method in terms of homogeneous nanocatalyst loading pd and in loss and sustained no3 removal over three cycles the only category in which the in situ mcfr h2 method was not superior was in its selectivity towards nh4 formation rather than n2 gas where potentially excess h2 was adsorbed to and stored in pd0 excess adsorbed h2 is known to increase the chances of nh4 formation see h2 supply as a predictor for n2 selectivity in si and can be combated by reducing h2 supply zhou et al 2017 in future studies the h2 supply will be regulated to enhance n2 selectivity while utilizing the mcfr for continuous flow nitrate reduction 4 conclusions four methods for depositing pd in nanocatalysts onto h2 permeable hollow fiber membranes were evaluated in terms of catalyst deposition catalyst loss over time and repeatable no3 removal kinetics both in situ methods resulted in more evenly dispersed nanocatalysts with in situ mcfr h2 deposition covering at least 90 of the fiber surface with nanocatalysts although the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic methods initially had pd normalized rate constants similar to those of the in situ methods pd loss and catalyst oxidation between sequential cycles led to a deterioration of no3 reduction overall the in situ mcfr h2 method gave the best performance in terms of efficiency of dissolved pd2 and in3 ion conversion into surface coated nanocatalyst films negligible loss of pd in from the mcfr membrane surface and sustained no3 removal the major challenge is improving its selectivity towards n2 these results have the following take home messages in situ attachment and a continuously supplied h2 reductant were effective tools for nanocatalyst attachment in this application based on these results in situ mcfr h2 deposition is the superior method for future studies to optimize catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate while the initial performance of in situ mcfr h2 deposition was satisfactory future optimization of the method will be needed to provide sustained nitrate removal catalyst attachment and n2 selectivity in the long term once optimized the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method has the potential to scale up the process from laboratory columns 96 cm2 used herein to integrated hollow fiber membrane modules with 10 m2 of fiber surface area thus the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method has advanced the viability of catalytic water treatment technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

common water quality violations in drinking water systems globally allaire et al 2018 pennino et al 2017 picetti et al 2022 ward et al 2018 nitrate is regulated in drinking water because it causes methemoglobinemia in infants however nitrate also may alter thyroid function and has been identified as a possible carcinogen jones et al 2019 ward et al 2018 and it has been suggested the current usepa maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mgno3 n l who limit of 50 mg no3 l or 11 3 mg no3 n l may need to be lowered to at least 5 mgno3 n l to protect against these other health endpoints inoue choi et al 2015 jones et al 2017 consequently many drinking water systems require nitrate treatment most nitrate treatment technologies separate nitrate from water e g ion exchange and reverse osmosis khera et al 2021 creating concentrated brines that are costly to dispose of gayen et al 2018 guo et al 2018 tugaoen et al 2017 an alternative nitrate treatment is catalytic hydrogenation using h2 as the electron donor to reduce no3 to harmless di nitrogen gas n2 individual platinum group metals pgm promote rapid nitrite no2 reduction but are extremely slow or non reactive for reducing no3 to no2 marks et al 2019 one way to overcome the first rate limiting step is to integrate pgm catalysts within biofilms which can reduce no3 to no2 zhou et al 2017 another means to enable no3 reduction to no2 plus subsequent catalysis to n2 or ammonium ion nh4 is bimetallic catalysis guo et al 2018 maia et al 2007 valiyeva et al 2019 among the effective bimetallic catalysts for h2 based catalysis of no3 is palladium plus indium pd in daum and vorlop 1999 prüsse et al 2000 prüsse and vorlop 2001 heterogeneous reduction reactions of no3 to n2 involve adsorption of the n species followed by its reduction on the catalyst surface consuming 2 5 moles h2 mole no3 n species adsorption and reduction are represented by the following equations eq 1 2 n o 3 2 h 2 2 n o 3 p d i n 4 h p d 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o eq 2 2 n o 2 3 h 2 2 n o 2 p d 6 h p d n 2 2 o h 2 h 2 o where brackets i e pd or pd in indicate a mono or bi metallic catalyst site onto which the species are bound respectively the first step eq 1 achieving no3 conversion to no2 occurs on the surface of a pd in bimetallic catalyst i e no3 pd in this step often is rate limiting because after in abstracts an oxygen atom from no3 a neighboring site h pd acts as a redox mediator by reducing the oxidized in to its original elemental state gao and li 2011 ilinich et al 2003 the second step is no2 reduction which occurs on a pd surface i e no2 pd several stepwise mechanisms have been proposed for nitrite reduction pathways to n2 and nh4 ebbesen et al 2008 huo et al 2017 shin et al 2014 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 since consensus has not been reached on the stepwise mechanisms we present overall equations for the production of n2 gas eq 2 and nh4 eq 3 notable is that all the reactions produce hydroxide ion oh which can influence ph in poorly buffered solutions eq 3 2 n o 2 6 h 2 2 n o 2 p d 12 h p d 2 n h 4 4 o h pgm catalysis with h2 can achieve an excess of 90 nitrate removal in batch reactors with the catalyst present in slurry form and h2 bubbling bertoch et al 2017 heck et al 2019 sá and vinek 2005 trawczyński et al 2011 while the use of batch slurry reactors is useful for material discovery or mechanistic studies a major challenge to continuous flow water treatment process scale up is the need to recover the freely dispersed slurry catalyst from the water after denitrification catalyst separation and recycle are possible using magnetic separation or ceramic membranes falinski et al 2020 powell et al 2020 westerhoff et al 2016 but they risk catalyst loss or deactivation during the recycle process a second challenge of batch slurry reactors stems from the low solubility of h2 in water which results in costly bubbling and oversupply of h2 as well as unsafe off gassing of combustible h2 bertoch et al 2017 chen et al 2017 choe et al 2015 to resolve the challenges of batch slurry reactors we utilized the membrane catalyst film reactor mcfr first reported by zhou et al 2017 for mono metallic catalysts the mcfr delivers bubble free h2 by its diffusion through non porous membranes that have catalysts immobilized on the outer surface the membranes retain the catalyst and deliver h2 directly to the catalysts thus far catalyst immobilization in the mcfr has been achieved through autocatalytic reduction i e pd ii to pd 0 using only mono metallic pd catalytic films marks et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 2021 however catalytic nitrate hydrogenation calls for a bimetallic nanocatalyst thus we evaluated methods for synthesizing and attaching the bimetallic pd in nanocatalysts on the membrane surface the goal of this study is to evaluate four methods of synthesis and attachment to determine which method results in nearly irreversible attachment while simultaneously having rapid removal of nitrate the four methods evaluated were 1 in situ mcfr h2 where pd and in were autocatalytically reduced inside the reactor zhou et al 2021 2 in situ flask synthesis where pd and in were reduced directly on the hollow fibers in a flask 3 ex situ aerosol impaction driven assembly aida where pre formed pd in nanocatalysts were spray attached to the hollow fibers atkinson et al 2020 guo et al 2020 and 4 ex situ electrostatic where pre formed pd in nanocatalysts were attached to the hollow fibers electrostatically guo et al 2020 each of the four methods was evaluated in terms of its repeatable activity for reducing no3 and for the stability of the catalyst on the membranes as an outcome of these experiments we identified the superior method that exhibited negligible catalyst loss and consistent no3 removal over three sequential use cycles i e one cycle involves filling the reactor performing nitrate reduction replacing water in the reactor this study identified the superior deposition method for future optimization and scale up studies 2 experimental methods 2 1 four methods to deposit pd in bimetallic nanocatalysts on hollow fiber membranes polymer hollow fiber bundles polypropylene 200 μm od 100 110 μm id wall thickness 50 55 μm length 10 cm teijin ltd japan were prepared before nanocatalyst deposition tang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 zhou et al 2021 fiber bundles were formed by cutting 60 fibers to 25 centimeters in length and gluing the bundle together at both ends zhou et al 2017 2019 2021 table 1 and fig s1 summarize the four methods used to deposit pd in nanocatalysts on the surface of the membranes the quantity of metal on the surface μg cm2 was determined by acid digestion of fibers followed by icp ms analysis see below here we provide background on how catalyst synthesis occurs and the four methods being examined pd in synthesis and deposition involve three distinct steps 1 auto catalytic reduction of pd2 to pd0 2 pd0 catalyzed reduction of in3 to in0 and 3 attachment of pd in catalyst onto the h2 permeable hollow fiber surface we evaluated two general strategies for the pd and in reduction steps in the first strategy the pd in nanocatalysts were reduced and formed in the presence of the h2 delivering hollow fibers we call this in situ formation pd0 nanocatalysts produced in situ form robustly attached films on the hollow fibers marks et al 2020 2019 zhou et al 2021 in the second strategy the pd in nanocatalysts were pre formed before deposition onto the membranes we call this ex situ formation pre formed pd in nanocatalysts are known to be highly active for nitrate removal in a batch slurry reactor guo et al 2018 we evaluated two in situ and two ex situ methods to produce and deposit pd in nanocatalysts described below method 1 in situ mcfr h2 the mcfr method for pd autocatalytic reduction and deposition long et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 2021 was modified to form bimetallic pd in nanocatalysts this method used a 2 mm sodium tetrachloropalladate solution in a 4 mm phosphate buffer having a ph of 7 0 33 ml of this solution was added to a mcfr the same mcfr in which the reaction will take place as depicted in fig 1 and circulated overnight with 15 psig h2 pressure 2 atm absolute in the membranes lumen the pd2 precursor was autocatalytically reduced to pd0 and deposited on the membrane surface zhou et al 2017 following pd0 deposition the medium was removed and an indium coating medium 0 05 mm indium chloride tetrahydrate was added to the reactor to reduce in3 to in0 on the pd0nps again using 15 psig h2 for 24 hours method 2 in situ flask synthesis in the flask synthesis method pd and in reduction and attachment onto membranes were conducted in a round bottom flask with methanol and h2 reductants delivered from the solution similar to a previously published method guo et al 2018 pd in nanocatalysts were reduced and grown directly onto the fiber surface using palladium acetate precursor initially the pd2 precursor methanol reductant and the hollow fiber membranes were contained within a round bottom flask and stirred overnight when pd2 was reduced by methanol oxidation to form pd0 nanocatalysts on the membranes outer surface the in3 precursor was then added to the solution on a 1 10 mass ratio in pd and reduced to in0 on the hollow fiber surface with h2 bubbling for at least 30 minutes for the next two ex situ methods pd in nanocatalysts were prepared using sodium tetrachloropalladate palladium precursor indium chloride tetrahydrate precursor ethoxyethanol ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone by following previously published hydrothermal methods elias et al 2020 guo et al 2020 briefly an aqueous solution of pd2 salt was prepared by dissolving 57 mg of na2pdcl4 in 3 ml of deionized water the solution was added to a flask with 8 ml of an aqueous solution containing 105 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 60 mg of l ascorbic acid the reductant the flask was immersed in an 80 c oil bath for 4 hours with continuous stirring until ascorbic acid oxidation had reduced pd2 to pd0 nanocatalysts the solution was cooled to room temperature and the pd nanocatalysts were separated by centrifugation finally the in3 precursor was added to the pd0 nanocatalysts at a 1 10 mass ratio of in pd the in3 was reduced to in0 by bubbling h2 as the reductant for 30 minutes at room temperature 22 c method 3 ex situ aerosol impaction driven assembly a low pressure chamber and spray attachment called aerosol impaction driven assembly or aida atkinson et al 2020 was used to spray pre formed pd in nanocatalysts guo et al 2020 onto the hollow fibers 1000 mg l of the pre formed pd in catalysts was added to deionized water to form an aerosol spray medium atkinson et al 2020 the aerosol was accelerated through a low pressure chamber towards the hollow fibers which were wrapped around an oscillating plate the chamber was under vacuum 0 03 atm to ensure that the nanocatalysts traveled directly from the exit point of the nozzle to the hollow fibers surface method 4 ex situ electrostatic in the ex situ electrostatic method pre formed pd in nanocatalysts guo et al 2020 were attached to the membranes electrostatically the electrostatic attachment was between the pre formed pd in nanoparticles with a negative charge due to surface reactions with oxygen and the polypropylene fibers which had a positive surface charge li et al 2018 bundles of the polymer fibers were immersed overnight in a water slurry of 1000 mg l of pd in nanocatalyst the hollow fiber bundle was removed and dried for 24 hours at room temperature in a vacuum chamber to minimize oxygen exposure which could re oxidize the pd0 or in0 though xps characterization of the in situ mcfr h2 method indicated partial in oxidation fig s6 prior work by our group successfully demonstrated that the reductants utilized herein were able to reduce metal catalyst precursors to their elemental states this study also found oxidation to in3 was a result of exposure to air during sample preparation guo et al 2018 2 2 chemicals sodium nitrate nano3 99 0 sodium nitrite nano2 97 0 palladium ii

milli q system with resistivity of 18 2 mω cm 2 3 catalytic hydrogenation reactor set up and operation membranes with deposited pd in nanocatalysts were assembled into an mcfr made of a glass tube 27 cm in length and 6 cm in diameter connected with chemical resistant and gas impermeable viton tubing masterflex usa stopcocks and barbed fittings following the methods of zhou zhou et al 2019 2017 2021 the membranes were directly connected to the h2 supply and pressurized to 15 20 psig 2 1 to 2 5 atm absolute in the membranes lumen and h2 diffused through the gas permeable nonporous polypropylene membranes experiments were performed in batch mode with water recirculation 320 ml min 1 via a peristaltic pump masterflex usa as an important safety note working with hydrogen gas can pose a fire hazard proper safety measures should be established and approved by safety authorities before conducting similar experiments reactivity performance of the bimetallic catalysts on the fibers was evaluated by the loss of no3 which gave the rate of catalytic hydrogenation of 100 mg l 1 of no3 23 mg l 1 as n equivalent to 1 6 mm and the formation of n2 and nh4 which defined selectivity the solution ph was set at the start of the batch experiment by bubbling the nitrate medium with co2 gas until it reached a ph of 5 0 the ph rose over the experiments due to base production as shown in eqs 2 and 3 aliquots of 0 5 ml were collected from the sampling port at time intervals and assayed for no3 no2 and nh4 2 4 analytical methods anions were measured by ion

perkinelmer in multielement mode x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of the fibers was carried out using a phi quantera sxm ulvac phi inc with an al source a focused beam of 1 5 kv 25 w to quantify pd and in on the membranes μg cm2 and enable mass balance on the catalyst metals pd in within the reactors fibers were removed from the reactor cut into equal length sections of 8 cm microwave digested in nitric and hydrochloric acids at a 1 1 volumetric ratio and then analyzed for dissolved pd and in fiber samples were examined under a scanning electron microscope sem and scanning transmission electron microscope stem jem arm200f to investigate attachment and distribution of nanocatalysts detailed procedures of sample collection preparation and instrument model and setup followed zhou et al 2014 water samples taken before and after each cycle of operation were also analyzed for pd and in by icp ms following acid digestion 3 results and discussion 3 1 deposition method influenced loading size uniformity and nanocatalyst dispersion on h2 permeable fibers table 2 shows that the resulting mass of nanocatalysts deposited on the hollow fiber membranes ranged from 7 9 to 96 µg pd cm2 and 1 to 18 µg in cm2 the target overall pd in mass ratio μg μg was 100 1 for the in situ mcfr h2 method and 10 1 for all other methods see justification in target pd in ratio in si the resulting pd in ratios varied significantly from the indicated targets for instance despite both ex situ methods utilizing the same 10 1 mass ratio of pd in pre formed nanocatalysts the resulting pd in ratios deposited to the fibers were 1 6 and 16 the primary reason for the different pd in ratios is the varying efficiency of pd attachment on the membranes demonstrating that achieving complete pd2 and in3 precursor attachment was operationally difficult the rightmost column of table 2 shows the pd attachment efficiency which quantifies pd attached to the hollow fiber surface as a fraction of the total precursor pd2 utilized in the deposition process a low pd attachment efficiency signals a wasteful use of pd during attachment to the fibers all methods except the in situ mcfr h2 attached less than half of the pd applied during deposition perhaps the other methods could have been adjusted to apply additional precursor and achieve the same catalyst mass loading however this would not be practical because losing over half of the applied pd2 would not be economical upon scaling up from lab to pilot scale mcfr an economic impact assessment is provided in table s1 in contrast the in situ mcfr h2 deposition led to the highest proportion of precursor pd attachment 96 to the hollow fibers and was the only method to achieve a pd in mass ratio within a 5 error of what was targeted with nanocatalyst loss having an insignificant economic burden table s1 because the size uniformity and surface distribution of nanocatalysts influence reactivity we evaluated these characteristics for all four deposition methods to evaluate nanocatalyst size and surface distribution energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx during sem detected pd and in within the white light gray areas while the darker gray regions contain only carbon from the hollow fiber and oxygen fig s2 sem images in fig 2 revealed that the nanocatalyst size uniformity and surface distribution varied depending on the deposition method the in situ mcfr h2 method distributed nanocatalysts homogeneously across the fiber surface area fig 2a transmission electron microscopy tem imaging of cross sections of hollow fibers revealed that the in situ mcfr h2 catalyst film was 200 nm thick with individual particles of 5 10 nm in width layered on top of one another fig s3 in contrast the in situ flask synthesis method resulted in non uniform catalyst sizes which is evident in fig 2b where the bottom of the image shows particles ranging from micron to nanometer scale catalysts the ex situ depositions using uniform pre formed 5 to 8 nm nanocatalysts fig s4 agglomerated the nanocatalysts ex situ aida deposition agglomerated these nanocatalysts to form 200 nm to larger particles attached to the fibers fig 2c the ex situ electrostatic had non uniform distribution with fig 2d showing an agglomerated nanocatalyst film in the top half of the image and the absence of any catalysts in the lower half of the image these results show a lack of size uniformity and surface distribution with in situ flask synthesis and both ex situ depositions conversely in situ mcfr h2 deposited uniformly dispersed 5 10 nm nanocatalysts lower magnification sem images show that the surface coverage of nanocatalysts on the hollow fibers differed by deposition method especially in regards to ex situ vs in situ deposition fig s5 a view of 1 mm axial length of in situ mcfr h2 hollow fibers proves that nanocatalysts covered at least 90 of the fiber surface fig s5a spots of bare hollow fiber are infrequent and probably artifacts of handling the hollow fibers during sample preparation the in situ flask synthesis deposition fig s5b also covered a high proportion of the fiber in contrast both ex situ depositions did not uniformly disperse the nanocatalysts ex situ aida deposition had areas that were highly concentrated with nanocatalysts fig s5c while the remainder of the surface remained bare similarly the ex situ electrostatic deposition fig s5d had stripes of pd deposition on the top and middle of the fiber while the remainder of the fiber area remained bare in a comparison of the methods the in situ mcfr h2 deposition covered the largest fraction of the hollow fiber surface with nanocatalysts given the importance of catalyst size and surface area for nitrate adsorption the uniform sizing and high surface coverage of nanocatalysts achieved with in situ mcfr h2 deposition may contribute to its superior ability to degrade nitrate 3 2 nanocatalyst loss from hollow fiber surface over time to evaluate nanocatalyst release and or dissolution pd and in concentrations in the water recirculating through the reactors were quantified following three sequential no3 removal cycles additionally the hollow fibers were removed from the mcfr acid digested and analyzed for pd and in contents fig 3 shows the percentages of initially loaded pd and in that were released from the hollow fibers after three cycles three of the four deposition methods exhibited substantial loss of pd the in situ flask synthesis method released 29 of its initial pd load and both ex situ deposition methods had 38 pd loss over the three no3 removal cycles these observed pd losses lower the availability of active sites for h2 adsorption over time as a result an accompanying decrease in the nitrate reduction activity in subsequent no3 removal cycles can be expected compared to pd in did not release as significantly as pd with a loss of 15 or less of the initial in loading for the three deposition methods the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method overcame the limitations of the other bimetallic deposition methods and minimized catalyst release pd leaching was minimal with 0 05 of initial pd a similarly small proportion 0 05 of in was released during operation based on the results for pd and in release we conclude that the reductant choice was the determining factor for nanocatalysts stability all four deposition methods utilized h2 as the in3 reductant and exhibited low in release for pd three out of four methods in situ flask synthesis ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic utilized either methanol or ascorbic acid to reduce pd2 and the resulting pd losses were 29 the only method to utilize h2 as the reductant for pd2 and in2 in situ mcfr h2 had minimal pd loss 0 05 taken together the metal loss results indicate that using h2 as the reductant led to stable bimetallic pd in nanocatalyst film deposition over three nitrate removal cycles the in situ mcfr h2 method is preferred for nanocatalyst attachment because it allows for continuous hydrogen supply between pd in deposition and nitrate reduction experiments unlike the other three methods which require transport of the nanocatalyst deposited fibers from the synthesizing reactor to the mcfr this method deposits pd in nanocatalysts directly within the mcfr despite attempts to minimize exposure to air during transport exposure to air and water of varying chemistries was unavoidable it may have been possible to improve catalyst stability for the other three methods by adding a stronger reductant prior to or during nitrate reduction but this could adversely impact the process s suitability for drinking water applications by introducing chemicals like borohydrate additionally the presence of chemical reductants in solution could cause pd in nanocatalyst formation in the liquid phase rather than on the hollow fiber surface in contrast the in situ mcfr h2 method utilizes an h2 concentration gradient to maximize the thermodynamic conditions for pd in nanocatalysts to nucleate and grow on the fiber surface overall the operational advantages and negligible catalyst loss make the in situ mcfr h2 method the preferred choice for nanocatalyst attachment 3 3 the nanocatalyst deposition method influenced pd normalized nitrate reduction and byproduct selectivity fig 4 a shows the kinetics of no3 reduction during the first cycle experiments for the different deposition methods along with a control no pd in nanocatalysts on the fiber no no3 removal was observed without nanocatalyst deposition i e control the ex situ aida deposition showed a slight lag followed by continuous removal of no3 this lag likely was a result of the time needed for h2 to re reduce oxidized pd in catalyst formed during exposure to oxygen in the attachment steps the other three deposition methods did not exhibit a lag and degraded no3 at similarly rapid rates during the first cycle 2 mg l no3 n remaining after 200 minutes pd mass normalized degradation rate constants were calculated instead of membrane surface area normalized rates because the fraction of membrane surface area deposited by nanocatalysts μg cm2 varied among the different deposition methods rate constants kpd ranged from 1 1 to 11 min 1gpd 1 despite having the lowest overall rate of no3 removal over time fig 4a ex situ aida deposition had the highest kpd value 11 min 1gpd 1 because its low pd mass loading 7 9 µg cm2 the in situ mcfr h2 and ex situ electrostatic methods had the lowest kpd values 1 1 and 2 0 min 1gpd 1 respectively in part because of their high pd loadings 96 and 88 µg cm2 thus because a higher pd loading did not have a large enough increase in the no3 removal rate to increase kpd maximizing pd loading was not necessarily an effective strategy for increasing the kinetics of no3 reduction fig 4b and c show formations of nh4 and no2 over time in the same first cycle of no3 reduction experiments the presence of nh3 gas was unlikely as the ph of all water samples were below the 9 25 pka of nh3 by more than 1 ph unit the in situ mcfr h2 and ex situ aida depositions achieved 50 conversion of initial no3 to nh4 in contrast the in situ flask synthesis and ex situ electrostatic deposited hollow fibers reduced 30 of the initial no3 to nh4 the high nitrate reduction activity in the first 60 minutes exhibited by the in situ flask synthesis and ex situ electrostatic methods likely allowed for higher adsorbed n concentrations on the catalyst surface leading to increased n n pairing to form n gases zhou et al 2017 formation of n2 gas is generally preferred in water treatment settings due to the toxicity of nh4 and the desire to have total n removal thus means to increase selectivity to n2 will be needed while the first operational cycle successfully removed no3 regardless of the deposition methods the second and third cycles exhibited less no3 removal for three of the four methods fig 5 shows representative results of the sequential cycles the in situ mcfr h2 achieved similar even slightly improved no3 removal for its second and third cycles although the in situ flask synthesis method exhibited complete no3 removal at the end of cycles 2 and 3 the kinetics were slower over the first 60 minutes the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic methods yielded substantially poorer nitrate removal in cycles 2 and 3 although cycle 3 was better than cycle 2 as is explained in the next paragraph two hypotheses may explain the loss in catalytic activity loss of catalyst from the membrane surface fig 3 and catalyst oxidation between cycles changes in the reactor s solution between each cycle involved opening the reactor which likely led to the loss of surface bound h2 on the catalyst exposure to o2 and consequential oxidization of the nanocatalyst surface to further test the catalyst oxidation hypothesis and potentially remedy the problem the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic fibers were submerged in water and exposed to h2 flow during feedwater changes between the second and third no3 reduction cycles fig 5 shows that in both cases the catalytic no3 removal increased between the second and third no3 removal cycles the increase in catalytic activity during the third cycles showed that submerging the catalyst loaded fibers in water with h2 flow between cycles had a positive effect furthermore this observation supports the hypothesis that the catalyst had been partially oxidized prior to the second cycle experiment although the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic fibers exhibited improved catalytic activity in the third cycle neither fully recovered the nitrate removal activity exhibited in the first cycle the inability to recover full no3 reduction reinforces that the loss of pd in catalysts fig 3 was an important contributor to the loss of reactivity although post treatment with h2 could recover some of the reactivity overall in situ mcfr h2 deposition of bimetallic pd in nanocatalyst films clearly was the superior method in terms of homogeneous nanocatalyst loading pd and in loss and sustained no3 removal over three cycles the only category in which the in situ mcfr h2 method was not superior was in its selectivity towards nh4 formation rather than n2 gas where potentially excess h2 was adsorbed to and stored in pd0 excess adsorbed h2 is known to increase the chances of nh4 formation see h2 supply as a predictor for n2 selectivity in si and can be combated by reducing h2 supply zhou et al 2017 in future studies the h2 supply will be regulated to enhance n2 selectivity while utilizing the mcfr for continuous flow nitrate reduction 4 conclusions four methods for depositing pd in nanocatalysts onto h2 permeable hollow fiber membranes were evaluated in terms of catalyst deposition catalyst loss over time and repeatable no3 removal kinetics both in situ methods resulted in more evenly dispersed nanocatalysts with in situ mcfr h2 deposition covering at least 90 of the fiber surface with nanocatalysts although the ex situ aida and ex situ electrostatic methods initially had pd normalized rate constants similar to those of the in situ methods pd loss and catalyst oxidation between sequential cycles led to a deterioration of no3 reduction overall the in situ mcfr h2 method gave the best performance in terms of efficiency of dissolved pd2 and in3 ion conversion into surface coated nanocatalyst films negligible loss of pd in from the mcfr membrane surface and sustained no3 removal the major challenge is improving its selectivity towards n2 these results have the following take home messages in situ attachment and a continuously supplied h2 reductant were effective tools for nanocatalyst attachment in this application based on these results in situ mcfr h2 deposition is the superior method for future studies to optimize catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate while the initial performance of in situ mcfr h2 deposition was satisfactory future optimization of the method will be needed to provide sustained nitrate removal catalyst attachment and n2 selectivity in the long term once optimized the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method has the potential to scale up the process from laboratory columns 96 cm2 used herein to integrated hollow fiber membrane modules with 10 m2 of fiber surface area thus the in situ mcfr h2 deposition method has advanced the viability of catalytic water treatment technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

here we demonstrated that singlet oxygen 1o2 was efficiently generated from pms and cl interaction mechanism of 1o2 formation was uniquely verified by the reaction of hso5 and chlorine molecule cl2 and the oxygen atoms in 1o2 deriving from the peroxide group of hso5 were revealed density functional theory calculations determined that the reaction of hso5 and cl2 was thermodynamically favorable and exergonic at 37 8 kcal mol quite intriguingly 1o2 was generated at a higher yield 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 than in the well known reaction of h2o2 with cl2 35 m 1 s 1 besides chlorine 1o2 formed in pms cl interaction dominated the degradation of micropollutants also it substantially enhanced the damage of deoxynucleoside in dna which were beneficial to micropollutant oxidation and pathogen disinfection the contribution of 1o2 for carbamazepine degradation was enhanced at higher cl level and lower ph and reached 96 3 at ph 4 1 and 5 min natural organic matter nom was a sink for chlorine thereby impeding 1o2 formation to retard carbamazepine degradation 1o2 also played important roles 48 3 63 5 on the abatement of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine at ph 4 1 and 10 min in pms cl on the other hand this discovery also alerted the harm of 1o2 for human health as it can be formed during the interaction of residual pms in drinking water swimming pools and the high level cl in human bodies

those with ho and so4 are 1 6 3 3 108 mc 1 s 1 and 2 5 8 1 107 mc 1 s 1 respectively mopper and zhou 1990 cory et al 2009 lee et al 2020 therefore 1o2 can be useful in water treatment scenarios involving complex matrices it was reported that pms self decay under alkaline conditions formed 1o2 spontaneously whose formation rate however is slow eq 1 in table 1 dennis f evans 1985 many studies reported strategies to accelerate the activation of pms to form 1o2 for fast pollutant decontamination ghanbari and moradi 2017 duan et al 2018 some organic compounds containing ketone groups such as cyclohexanone montgomery 1974 and quinones zhou et al 2015 2017 activated pms through the nucleophilic addition of pms to ketone to form dioxirane as an intermediate and then reacted with pms to produce 1o2 carbonaceous materials such as biochar and heteroatom doped carbon also catalyzed pms to produce 1o2 where electron deficient carbon atoms or oxygen containing functional groups similar to quinones were as active sites that facilitate the transformation of pms to 1o2 liang et al 2017 duan et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in these strategies 1o2 formed via an electron transfer pathway in which peroxyl bond of pms was attacked by electron deficient moieties chloride cl ubiquitous in the aquatic environment plays a vital role in the pms chemistry and it also attacks the peroxyl bond of pms for the initiation of reactive species and sequestration of radicals nonetheless knowledge on the formed reactive species during the reaction of pms with cl pms cl is still controversial most studies reported that the reaction of pms and cl generated free chlorine via two electron transfer eq 2 in table 1 in which hypochlorous acid hocl and or chlorine molecule cl2 were responsible for decontamination and disinfection henley 2006 rivas and solís 2018 zhou et al 2018 li et al 2019 wen et al 2019 xu et al 2019 one study reported that radicals and 1o2 were also formed in pms cl and chlorine radicals cl 1o2 and hocl dominated 2 4 dimethyphenol removal for radical formation so4 was proposed to be formed in pms cl at acidic conditions via a single electron transfer mechanism and so4 reacted rapidly with h2o oh and cl to form ho and cl respectively wang and wang 2020 however mechanism of 1o2 formation was only speculated to involve the self decomposition of hocl khan and kasha 1994 or a reaction between pms and hocl wang and wang 2020 without evidences in contrast feng et al 2017 proposed the formation of iodide atoms i in pms iodide i and then they proposed that cl2 dominated the removal of phenol in pms cl by analogizing with the mechanism of pms i overall the formation of reactive species and quantification of their roles for micropollutant degradation are unclear in pms cl to address these major knowledge gaps the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the reactive species in pms cl and to further explore its formation mechanism 2 to investigate the efficacy of cl in pms activation and to differentiate reactive species responsible for micropollutants degradation 3 to assess the potential of pms cl under different conditions i e different ph cl and pms concentrations nom concentrations and real water matrices a typical chemical micropollutant carbamazepine was selected as the target for its wide occurrence in aquatic environment patel et

and discussion 3 1 identification of reactive species in pms cl the formation of reactive species in pms cl was corroborated via epr spectroscopy by using dmpo as a trapping agent a dmpox adduct 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl αn 7 2 g stan and daeschel 2005 was formed which could be responsible for the oxidation of dmpo to dmpox via the formed free chlorine and was verified by using a standard chlorine solution fig s1 in contrast the signals of radicals such as so4 ho and superoxide radical o2 were absent instead temp was used to identify 1o2 formation as 1o2 can oxidize temp to 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radicals tempn αn 16 9 g exhibiting typical three signals at the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 moan and wold 1979 figs 1 a and 1b show that weak tempn signals present in the scenario containing 1 mm pms at ph 4 1 with rising concentrations of cl or pms the intensity of tempn signals remarkably increased due to the increasing amount of 1o2 in pms cl it is worth noting that the generation of 1o2 closely correlates with phs it was demonstrated that tempn signals monotonically decreased as the ph of pms cl rose from 2 1 to 8 1 fig 1c this result indicates that the acidic condition facilitates the formation of 1o2 as 1o2 reacts with dpa to form a stable endoperoxide dpao2 wasserman et al 1972 dpa was utilized as the chemical probe to further confirm the generation of 1o2 in pms cl as expected the chromatographic peak of dpao2 m z 363 14 was identified in pms cl and its yield the ratio of dpao2 formation to dpa loss reached 100 at 120 min figs 1e and s2 therefore both free chlorine and 1o2 were the reactive species in pms cl rather than radical species 3 2 mechanism of 1o2 generation in pms cl in order to uncover the mechanism of 1o2 formation in pms cl the following routes were explored 1 self decomposition of pms 2 transformation from dissolved oxygen 3 reaction of h2o2 and chlorine 4 decomposition of hocl khan and kasha 1994 and 5 reaction of pms and hocl wang and wang 2020 first the negligible degradation of dpa by pms oxidation excluded the formation of 1o2 via pms self decomposition at acidic conditions not shown second the degradation of carbamazepine was primarily attributable to 1o2 by pms cl at ph 4 1 fig 3a while it was slightly changed under dissolved oxygen free condition by continuously purging nitrogen gas fig s3 thereby excluding the source of oxygen atoms in 1o2 from dissolved oxygen third pms can be rapidly transformed to h2o2 at ph 1 ghanbari and moradi 2017 and it is known that h2o2 reacts with chlorine to form 1o2 held et al 1978 tian et al 2012 however h2o2 was undetectable by using titanium iv oxalate colorimetric method sellers 1980 which method was not interfered by coexistence of oxidants pms or chlorine in pms cl not shown this result excluded the role of h2o2 also epr spectra results show that no tempn signal was formed in hocl alone or hocl cl systems fig 1d evidencing the impossibility of hocl decomposition therefore the possibilities of 1 4 were excluded for the route 5 although tempn signal was observed in 1 mm pms 0 1 mm hocl its intensity was approximately 8 times lower than that in 1 mm pms 30 mm cl at ph 4 1 figs 1a and 1d it should be noted that the hocl concentration in pms hocl was tenfold higher than that in pms cl at 5 min fig s4 this result further evidenced the impossibility of route 5 it is well known that the cl catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 in acidic solution is expected to generate 1o2 connick 1947 bender and brauer 1999 the mechanism of the catalysis containing three steps is outlined as follows as shown in eqs 1 3 first the reaction between h2o2 and cl generates hocl slowly second hocl is rapidly converted into dissolved cl2 at acidic conditions and higher cl concentrations yang et al 2023 third cl2 attacks the peroxide bond of h2o2 to form chlorine hydroperoxide hoocl which finally decomposes 1o2 h and cl 1 h2o2 cl h hocl h2o k 1 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 2 hocl cl h cl2 h2o k 4 3 104 m 2 s 1 3 2cl2 h2o2 hoocl 1o2 2cl 2h k 35 m 1 s 1 compared with a much slow reaction rate between h2o2 and cl eq 1 pms reacts much faster with cl to form hocl k 2 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 and hocl is rapidly converted to cl2 at lower ph or higher cl concentrations lente et al 2009 inspired by the asymmetrical structure of pms containing ho and so4 groups pms is more reactive than h2o2 a hypothesis that pms can react much faster with cl2 to generate 1o2 than the analogous h2o2 cl2 reaction was proposed fig 2 a illustrates the proposed mechanisms of 1o2 formation in pms cl in step 1 the nucleophilic attack of cl on the o atom of peroxide bond linking to h in hso5 has been postulated to produce so4 2 and hocl lente et al 2009 then cl efficiently accelerates the conversion from hocl to cl2 at acidic conditions wang and margerum 1994 in step 2 the nonpolar cl2 electrophilically attacks the electronegative o atom of hso5 to form hso5 cl2 and then forms hso5 cl hso5 cl is converted into oocl which finally decomposes to 1o2 mechanistic insights into the thermodynamics of the reaction of hso5 and cl2 in step 2 is corroborated via dft calculation here only the form of hso5 not h2so5 or so5 2 was considered as it is the primary species under the experimental conditions pka1 1 pka2 9 4 for pms han et al 2020 the corresponding free energies of intermediates and the free energy of transition states tss are shown in fig 2b specifically the initial step that a cl atom in cl2 as the electron deficient moiety is attached to the o atom of peroxide bond linked to h in hso5 proceeds to form hso5 cl2 ts1 spontaneously subsequently the cl cl bond of ts1 gradually breaks up after undergoing electron transfer ts1 splits into hso5 cl ts2 and cl by overcoming 15 2 kcal mol of free energy this step is similar to the conversion from ho2cl2 to ho2cl during the reaction of cl2 and basic h2o2 hoo 24 6 kcal mol storch et al 1983 then ts2 reacts with oh to form oocl ts3 h and so4 2 which is an overall 38 2 kcal mol exothermic process oocl is very unstable and once formed will instantly dissociate into 1o2 and cl connick 1947 therefore the ts3 spontaneously decomposes to 1o2 and cl with a reaction energy of 12 4 kcal mol overall the formation of 1o2 via the reaction of hso5 and cl2 is highly exothermic by 37 8 kcal mol evidencing that it is a thermodynamically favorable pathway the reaction mechanism between hso5 and cl2 is similar to that between hoo and cl2 to form 1o2 held et al 1978 storch et al 1983 bender and brauer 1999 tian et al 2012 based on the proposed mechanisms a reaction between hso5 and cl2 to form 1o2 is presented in eq 4 4 c l 2 hso 5 h 2 o k total 1 o 2 so 4 2 2 c l 3 h k total a kinetic model was employed to determine the total rate constant k total of the reaction between hso5 and cl2 table 1 accordingly k total was simulated to be 1 5 0 03 105 m 1 s 1 via the data fitting function of the kintecus model table 1 ianni 2012 based on the time dependent evolution of pms and chlorine concentrations in pms cl at 0 5 1 mm pms 20 30 mm cl and ph 4 1 3 3 roles of 1o2 for micropollutant degradation in pms cl potential of pms cl was assessed for carbamazepine degradation carbamazepine at 2 μm was resistant to direct pms oxidation fig s17a while that was completely degraded in the pms cl scenario within 5 min at ph 4 1 fig 3 a roles of reactive species were differentiated as follows first the roles of free chlorine species were identified in fact free chlorine species in aqueous solutions include cl2 cl2o hocl ocl and h2ocl wang and margerum 1994 which reactivities with carbamazepine were determined to be 6 5 1 1 104 m 1 s 1 5 9 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 1 2 0 2 m 1 s 1 2 1 0 1 10 2 m 1 s 1 and negligible respectively text s4 figs s5 s6 and table s1 the specific role of different free chlorine species for the degradation of carbamazepine was calculated by chlorine exposure 0 t chlorine dt and carbamazepine degradation kinetics at specific conditions in pms cl details shown in text s5 as depicted in fig 3a cl2 was the solely effective chlorine for carbamazepine degradation while the contributions of other chlorine species were unimportant taking the result at 2 min as an example the removal efficiency of carbamazepine was 67 2 in which rcl2 only accounted for 15 3 these results clearly verify that chlorine is not the major reactive species then the contribution of 1o2 was further quantified the k of 1o2 with carbamazepine was determined to be 9 9 0 6 105 m 1 s 1 text s6 fig s7 and table s1 the degradation of carbamazepine by pms cl was remarkably faster in deuterium water solution d2o than in h2o fig 3b inset evidencing the importance of 1o2 in pms cl as 1o2 has a considerably longer lifetime in d2o 50 μs than in h2o 4 μs lindig et al 1980 in addition roles of radicals to carbamazepine degradation were negligible as indicated in the tests using radical scavengers of tba meoh and sod text s7 figs 3b and s8 and table s2 note that nh4 2so4 remarkably inhibited 96 carbamazepine which verified a vital role of chlorine for generating 1o2 as ammonia was highly reactive to chlorine but not pms heeb et al 2017 the contribution of 1o2 can be calculated by subtracting rchlorination from the total removal efficiency of carbamazepine thus the remarkable contribution of 1o2 corresponded to the blank area in fig 3a the formed products during carbamazepine degradation in pms cl further shed light on the importance of 1o2 fig 4 by using an uplc q tof ms analysis nine products of carbamazepine p1 m z 267 11 p2 and p3 m z 253 10 p4 m z 208 03 p5 m z 210 10 p6 m z 271 11 p7 m z 240 10 p8 m z 224 11 and p9 m z 224 07 were observed in pms cl at ph 4 1 figs s9 s11 and table s3 among them the typical endoperoxide p1 m z 267 11 via 1o2 cycloaddition to the olefinic double bond of carbamazepine as the most active site fig s12 was identified the formation of endoperoxide is consistent to previous literatures that electron rich olefins can undergo cycloaddition to yield endoperoxides via 1o2 addition mazur and foote 1970 harding and goddard 1980 keto and hydroxylated carbamazepine p2 and p3 m z 253 10 were formed p2 underwent deacetylation and ring contraction to yield p4 m z 208 03 which was further transformed to p8 m z 224 11 and p9 m z 224 07 through 1o2 attack of the aldehyde group and the benzene ring of p4 respectively p3 was transformed to p5 m z 210 10 p6 m z 271 11 and p7 m z 240 10 via deacetylation hydroxylation and deamidation pathways respectively the typical transformation products of carbamazepine derived from 1o2 p1 4 p6 p8 9 were also observed in visible light irradiated composite metal nanomaterials and zero valent iron citric acid processes xu et al 2016 ding et al 2017 rayaroth et al 2020 note that six products p2 5 p7 8 were also formed in hocl cl at ph 4 1 at a scenario of cl2 figs s13 s14 and table s4 soufan et al 2013 this result indicates that the products formed via 1o2 and cl2 oxidation are partially similar however chlorinated products via cl2 oxidation were not detected in pms cl table s3 also the formation of tocl was negligible in pms cl fig s15 as 1o2 dominated the carbamazepine transformation in pms cl the transformation of carbamazepine in pms cl demonstrated the key role of 1o2 by the reaction pathways of cycloaddition hydroxylation ring contraction deacetylation and deamidation revealed in fig 4 besides effects of cl concentrations on the mineralization rate were evaluated during carbamazepine degradation in pms cl as depicted in fig s16 the toc removal rates were slightly changed with increasing cl from 2 to 5 mm all of which were less than 6 within the margin of error at 50 and 80 removal rates of carbamazepine and ph 4 1 in pms cl this result indicates that 1o2 with a mild oxidation capacity causes negligible mineralization 3 4 factors affecting 1o2 formation in pms cl for pollutant decontamination the formation efficiency of 1o2 in the pms cl scenario was remarkably affected by cl and pms concentrations ph and a water matrix of nom as demonstrated by the significantly different degradation of carbamazepine under these conditions increasing cl concentrations played dual roles to increase hocl formation and to accelerate the conversion from hocl to cl2 simultaneously resulting in accelerating 1o2 formation in pms cl eqs 3 and 4 in table 1 such increasing trends of 1o2 formation resulted in linear increase of the removal efficiency of carbamazepine with increasing cl from 1 mm to 30 mm at a fixed pms dosage of 1 mm and ph 4 1 figs 5 b and s17 also decreasing ph promoted the conversion from hocl to cl2 in pms cl and then significantly accelerated the reaction of pms and cl2 to form 1o2 thus the rapid formation of 1o2 with decreasing ph from 7 7 to 4 1 caused its dominant role responsible for 47 8 96 3 carbamazepine removal at 5 min in pms cl figs 5a and s18 increasing pms dosage unlike the effects of cl and ph only increased hocl formation eq 2 in table 1 the rapid conversion from hocl to cl2 was blocked which further retarded 1o2 formation therefore the yield of 1o2 was not linear to pms dosage the synergetic roles of 1o2 and cl2 only resulted in a fivefold increase of the removal efficiency of carbamazepine as pms dosage rose from 0 05 mm to 1 mm at a fixed 30 mm cl ph 4 1 and 5 min figs 5c and s19 overall this result provides a detailed evidence that cl at fresh water levels of 1 8 mm mullaney et al 2007 can activate pms and efficiently generate 1o2 for decontamination as nom is the predominant sink for chlorine 5 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 rather than pms and 1o2 kim et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the presence of 5 mg l nom caused an around threefold decrease of chlorine concentration in pms cl compared to the absence of nom fig s20 the decreased concentrations of chlorine further impeded 1o2 formation which retarded the degradation of carbamazepine in pms cl as shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency at 5 min remarkably decreased by 75 and 97 at nom concentration of 1 mg l and 5 mg l respectively compared to that in the absence of nom besides cl at seawater level 540 mm significantly accelerated the degradation of carbamazepine specifically carbamazepine was completely removed at 15 min and ph 7 6 in pms cl in which 1o2 plays the dominant role of 60 80 fig 6b the process was also tested in a practical wastewater water parameters shown in table s5 as shown in figs 6c and s18b the degradation of carbamazepine was retarded in practical wastewater compared with that in pure water at ph 6 5 6 7 presumably due to the chlorine consumption by dissolved organic matter dom in the wastewater it should be noted that the carbamazepine removal efficiency of 70 was still reached upon extending the reaction time to 240 min fig 6c 3 5 role of 1o2 for disinfection potential in pms cl pms is widely used for disinfection in drinking water and swimming pools the roles of different reactive species for disinfection is largely unknown in pms cl herein two typical deoxynucleosides in dna including deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine were selected as target compounds to evaluate the disinfection potential by pms cl the reactivities of hocl cl2 and cl2o reacting with deoxyguanosine were determined to be 22 8 m 1 s 1 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 and 1 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and those with deoxythymidine were determined to be 2 1 m 1 s 1 2 7 104 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 104 m 1 s 1 respectively text s8 and fig s21 as shown in fig s22 pms cl substantially enhanced the damage of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine and their removal efficiencies at 10 min were 94 6 and 39 7 respectively at 1 mm pms 30 mm cl and ph 4 1 both cl2 and 1o2 dominated the damage of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine in which the contributions of 1o2 were 48 3 63 5 at 10 min this result indicates that 1o2 formed in pms cl is beneficial to pathogen disinfection 4 conclusions and engineering implications in summary 1o2 is efficiently generated from pms and cl interaction in which the reaction of pms and cl2 is thermodynamically favorable to form 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 105 m 1 s 1 this rate constant is approximately 4 orders of magnitude higher than the reaction of h2o2 and cl2 therefore the pms cl scenario showed better performance on micropollutant removal than the analogous h2o2 cl scenario specifically the removal efficiency of carbamazepine at 5 min in pms cl was 20 2 times higher than that in h2o2 cl at ph 4 1 and 30 mm cl fig s23 also 1o2 generated in pms cl exhibited substantial reactivity toward micropollutants even in complicated water matrices e g wastewater coastal and marine environments notably 1o2 formed in pms cl can be double edged once pms is used for disinfection in drinking water standardization 2000 china 2018 the interaction of waters with residual pms and high levels of cl 105 2 62 4 mm in human bodies jahn et al 2015 may generate 1o2 in vivo especially in stomach with ph ranges of 1 3 in this vein the formed 1o2 could increase the risk to stomach as 1o2 can directly oxidize guanine via the introduction of single strand breaks in the dna structure lafleur et al 1987 khan et al 1992 khan and kasha 1994 additionally pms is commonly used for swimming pools and baths gay 1994 anipsitakis et al 2008 another practical pms cl scenario alerts a concern on the potential of 1o2 to skin cancer and cataracts to human beings di

14904,peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 is a widely used disinfectant and oxidant in environmental remediation it was deemed that pms reacted with chloride cl to form free chlorine during water purification here we demonstrated that singlet oxygen 1o2 was efficiently generated from pms and cl interaction mechanism of 1o2 formation was uniquely verified by the reaction of hso5 and chlorine molecule cl2 and the oxygen atoms in 1o2 deriving from the peroxide group of hso5 were revealed density functional theory calculations determined that the reaction of hso5 and cl2 was thermodynamically favorable and exergonic at 37 8 kcal mol quite intriguingly 1o2 was generated at a higher yield 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 than in the well known reaction of h2o2 with cl2 35 m 1 s 1 besides chlorine 1o2 formed in pms cl interaction dominated the degradation of micropollutants also it substantially enhanced the damage of deoxynucleoside in dna which were beneficial to micropollutant oxidation and pathogen disinfection the contribution of 1o2 for carbamazepine degradation was enhanced at higher cl level and lower ph and reached 96 3 at ph 4 1 and 5 min natural organic matter nom was a sink for chlorine thereby impeding 1o2 formation to retard carbamazepine degradation 1o2 also played important roles 48 3 63 5 on the abatement of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine at ph 4 1 and 10 min in pms cl on the other hand this discovery also alerted the harm of 1o2 for human health as it can be formed during the interaction of residual pms in drinking water swimming pools and the high level cl in human bodies

introduction peroxymonosulfate pms hso5 attracts increasing attention worldwide for environmental remediation kennedy and stock 1960 anipsitakis et al 2008 and synthetic chemistry hussain et al 2013 because it is nontoxic and highly stable to store and transport xu et al 2019 pms is a derivate of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in which one ho group is replaced by a so4 group ghanbari and moradi 2017 compared with h2o2 pms containing the electron withdrawing so4 group is more easily activated to generate reactive species such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical ho and singlet oxygen 1o2 all of

reactivity toward a variety of micropollutants than 1o2 e0 1o2 o2 0 81 vnhe lee et al 2020 on the other hand 1o2 is more selective which is highly selective toward electron rich compounds such as olefins and phenolic anions with rate constants of 107 109 m 1 s 1 foote and peters 1971 lindig et al 1980 tratnyek and hoigne 1991 wilkinson et al 1995 in addition the half life t1 2 4 μs of 1o2 is much longer than ho t1 2 1 μs which makes the transient concentration of 1o2 can be much higher for example the concentration of 1o2 is two orders of magnitude higher than ho upon uv irradiation of surface water vione et al 2010 also 1o2 is less consumed by water matrix components than ho and so4 for example the rate constant of natural organic matter nom reacting with 1o2 is 105 mc 1 s 1 while those with ho and so4 are 1 6 3 3 108 mc 1 s 1 and 2 5 8 1 107 mc 1 s 1 respectively mopper and zhou 1990 cory et al 2009 lee et al 2020 therefore 1o2 can be useful in water treatment scenarios involving complex matrices it was reported that pms self decay under alkaline conditions formed 1o2 spontaneously whose formation rate however is slow eq 1 in table 1 dennis f evans 1985 many studies reported strategies to accelerate the activation of pms to form 1o2 for fast pollutant decontamination ghanbari and moradi 2017 duan et al 2018 some organic compounds containing ketone groups such as cyclohexanone montgomery 1974 and quinones zhou et al 2015 2017 activated pms through the nucleophilic addition of pms to ketone to form dioxirane as an intermediate and then reacted with pms to produce 1o2 carbonaceous materials such as biochar and heteroatom doped carbon also catalyzed pms to produce 1o2 where electron deficient carbon atoms or oxygen containing functional groups similar to quinones were as active sites that facilitate the transformation of pms to 1o2 liang et al 2017 duan et al 2018 gao et al 2020 in these strategies 1o2 formed via an electron transfer pathway in which peroxyl bond of pms was attacked by electron deficient moieties chloride cl ubiquitous in the aquatic environment plays a vital role in the pms chemistry and it also attacks the peroxyl bond of pms for the initiation of reactive species and sequestration of radicals nonetheless knowledge on the formed reactive species during the reaction of pms with cl pms cl is still controversial most studies reported that the reaction of pms and cl generated free chlorine via two electron transfer eq 2 in table 1 in which hypochlorous acid hocl and or chlorine molecule cl2 were responsible for decontamination and disinfection henley 2006 rivas and solís 2018 zhou et al 2018 li et al 2019 wen et al 2019 xu et al 2019 one study reported that radicals and 1o2 were also formed in pms cl and chlorine radicals cl 1o2 and hocl dominated 2 4 dimethyphenol removal for radical formation so4 was proposed to be formed in pms cl at acidic conditions via a single electron transfer mechanism and so4 reacted rapidly with h2o oh and cl to form ho and cl respectively wang and wang 2020 however mechanism of 1o2 formation was only speculated to involve the self decomposition of hocl khan and kasha 1994 or a reaction between pms and hocl wang and wang 2020 without evidences in contrast feng et al 2017 proposed the formation of iodide atoms i in pms iodide i and then they proposed that cl2 dominated the removal of phenol in pms cl by analogizing with the mechanism of pms i overall the formation of reactive species and quantification of their roles for micropollutant degradation are unclear in pms cl to address these major knowledge gaps the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the reactive species in pms cl and to further explore its formation mechanism 2 to investigate the efficacy of cl in pms activation and to differentiate reactive species responsible for micropollutants degradation 3 to assess the potential of pms cl under different conditions i e different ph cl and pms concentrations nom concentrations and real water matrices a typical chemical micropollutant carbamazepine was selected as the target for its wide occurrence in aquatic environment patel et

and discussion 3 1 identification of reactive species in pms cl the formation of reactive species in pms cl was corroborated via epr spectroscopy by using dmpo as a trapping agent a dmpox adduct 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl αn 7 2 g stan and daeschel 2005 was formed which could be responsible for the oxidation of dmpo to dmpox via the formed free chlorine and was verified by using a standard chlorine solution fig s1 in contrast the signals of radicals such as so4 ho and superoxide radical o2 were absent instead temp was used to identify 1o2 formation as 1o2 can oxidize temp to 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radicals tempn αn 16 9 g exhibiting typical three signals at the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 moan and wold 1979 figs 1 a and 1b show that weak tempn signals present in the scenario containing 1 mm pms at ph 4 1 with rising concentrations of cl or pms the intensity of tempn signals remarkably increased due to the increasing amount of 1o2 in pms cl it is worth noting that the generation of 1o2 closely correlates with phs it was demonstrated that tempn signals monotonically decreased as the ph of pms cl rose from 2 1 to 8 1 fig 1c this result indicates that the acidic condition facilitates the formation of 1o2 as 1o2 reacts with dpa to form a stable endoperoxide dpao2 wasserman et al 1972 dpa was utilized as the chemical probe to further confirm the generation of 1o2 in pms cl as expected the chromatographic peak of dpao2 m z 363 14 was identified in pms cl and its yield the ratio of dpao2 formation to dpa loss reached 100 at 120 min figs 1e and s2 therefore both free chlorine and 1o2 were the reactive species in pms cl rather than radical species 3 2 mechanism of 1o2 generation in pms cl in order to uncover the mechanism of 1o2 formation in pms cl the following routes were explored 1 self decomposition of pms 2 transformation from dissolved oxygen 3 reaction of h2o2 and chlorine 4 decomposition of hocl khan and kasha 1994 and 5 reaction of pms and hocl wang and wang 2020 first the negligible degradation of dpa by pms oxidation excluded the formation of 1o2 via pms self decomposition at acidic conditions not shown second the degradation of carbamazepine was primarily attributable to 1o2 by pms cl at ph 4 1 fig 3a while it was slightly changed under dissolved oxygen free condition by continuously purging nitrogen gas fig s3 thereby excluding the source of oxygen atoms in 1o2 from dissolved oxygen third pms can be rapidly transformed to h2o2 at ph 1 ghanbari and moradi 2017 and it is known that h2o2 reacts with chlorine to form 1o2 held et al 1978 tian et al 2012 however h2o2 was undetectable by using titanium iv oxalate colorimetric method sellers 1980 which method was not interfered by coexistence of oxidants pms or chlorine in pms cl not shown this result excluded the role of h2o2 also epr spectra results show that no tempn signal was formed in hocl alone or hocl cl systems fig 1d evidencing the impossibility of hocl decomposition therefore the possibilities of 1 4 were excluded for the route 5 although tempn signal was observed in 1 mm pms 0 1 mm hocl its intensity was approximately 8 times lower than that in 1 mm pms 30 mm cl at ph 4 1 figs 1a and 1d it should be noted that the hocl concentration in pms hocl was tenfold higher than that in pms cl at 5 min fig s4 this result further evidenced the impossibility of route 5 it is well known that the cl catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 in acidic solution is expected to generate 1o2 connick 1947 bender and brauer 1999 the mechanism of the catalysis containing three steps is outlined as follows as shown in eqs 1 3 first the reaction between h2o2 and cl generates hocl slowly second hocl is rapidly converted into dissolved cl2 at acidic conditions and higher cl concentrations yang et al 2023 third cl2 attacks the peroxide bond of h2o2 to form chlorine hydroperoxide hoocl which finally decomposes 1o2 h and cl 1 h2o2 cl h hocl h2o k 1 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 2 hocl cl h cl2 h2o k 4 3 104 m 2 s 1 3 2cl2 h2o2 hoocl 1o2 2cl 2h k 35 m 1 s 1 compared with a much slow reaction rate between h2o2 and cl eq 1 pms reacts much faster with cl to form hocl k 2 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 and hocl is rapidly converted to cl2 at lower ph or higher cl concentrations lente et al 2009 inspired by the asymmetrical structure of pms containing ho and so4 groups pms is more reactive than h2o2 a hypothesis that pms can react much faster with cl2 to generate 1o2 than the analogous h2o2 cl2 reaction was proposed fig 2 a illustrates the proposed mechanisms of 1o2 formation in pms cl in step 1 the nucleophilic attack of cl on the o atom of peroxide bond linking to h in hso5 has been postulated to produce so4 2 and hocl lente et al 2009 then cl efficiently accelerates the conversion from hocl to cl2 at acidic conditions wang and margerum 1994 in step 2 the nonpolar cl2 electrophilically attacks the electronegative o atom of hso5 to form hso5 cl2 and then forms hso5 cl hso5 cl is converted into oocl which finally decomposes to 1o2 mechanistic insights into the thermodynamics of the reaction of hso5 and cl2 in step 2 is corroborated via dft calculation here only the form of hso5 not h2so5 or so5 2 was considered as it is the primary species under the experimental conditions pka1 1 pka2 9 4 for pms han et al 2020 the corresponding free energies of intermediates and the free energy of transition states tss are shown in fig 2b specifically the initial step that a cl atom in cl2 as the electron deficient moiety is attached to the o atom of peroxide bond linked to h in hso5 proceeds to form hso5 cl2 ts1 spontaneously subsequently the cl cl bond of ts1 gradually breaks up after undergoing electron transfer ts1 splits into hso5 cl ts2 and cl by overcoming 15 2 kcal mol of free energy this step is similar to the conversion from ho2cl2 to ho2cl during the reaction of cl2 and basic h2o2 hoo 24 6 kcal mol storch et al 1983 then ts2 reacts with oh to form oocl ts3 h and so4 2 which is an overall 38 2 kcal mol exothermic process oocl is very unstable and once formed will instantly dissociate into 1o2 and cl connick 1947 therefore the ts3 spontaneously decomposes to 1o2 and cl with a reaction energy of 12 4 kcal mol overall the formation of 1o2 via the reaction of hso5 and cl2 is highly exothermic by 37 8 kcal mol evidencing that it is a thermodynamically favorable pathway the reaction mechanism between hso5 and cl2 is similar to that between hoo and cl2 to form 1o2 held et al 1978 storch et al 1983 bender and brauer 1999 tian et al 2012 based on the proposed mechanisms a reaction between hso5 and cl2 to form 1o2 is presented in eq 4 4 c l 2 hso 5 h 2 o k total 1 o 2 so 4 2 2 c l 3 h k total a kinetic model was employed to determine the total rate constant k total of the reaction between hso5 and cl2 table 1 accordingly k total was simulated to be 1 5 0 03 105 m 1 s 1 via the data fitting function of the kintecus model table 1 ianni 2012 based on the time dependent evolution of pms and chlorine concentrations in pms cl at 0 5 1 mm pms 20 30 mm cl and ph 4 1 3 3 roles of 1o2 for micropollutant degradation in pms cl potential of pms cl was assessed for carbamazepine degradation carbamazepine at 2 μm was resistant to direct pms oxidation fig s17a while that was completely degraded in the pms cl scenario within 5 min at ph 4 1 fig 3 a roles of reactive species were differentiated as follows first the roles of free chlorine species were identified in fact free chlorine species in aqueous solutions include cl2 cl2o hocl ocl and h2ocl wang and margerum 1994 which reactivities with carbamazepine were determined to be 6 5 1 1 104 m 1 s 1 5 9 0 2 104 m 1 s 1 1 2 0 2 m 1 s 1 2 1 0 1 10 2 m 1 s 1 and negligible respectively text s4 figs s5 s6 and table s1 the specific role of different free chlorine species for the degradation of carbamazepine was calculated by chlorine exposure 0 t chlorine dt and carbamazepine degradation kinetics at specific conditions in pms cl details shown in text s5 as depicted in fig 3a cl2 was the solely effective chlorine for carbamazepine degradation while the contributions of other chlorine species were unimportant taking the result at 2 min as an example the removal efficiency of carbamazepine was 67 2 in which rcl2 only accounted for 15 3 these results clearly verify that chlorine is not the major reactive species then the contribution of 1o2 was further quantified the k of 1o2 with carbamazepine was determined to be 9 9 0 6 105 m 1 s 1 text s6 fig s7 and table s1 the degradation of carbamazepine by pms cl was remarkably faster in deuterium water solution d2o than in h2o fig 3b inset evidencing the importance of 1o2 in pms cl as 1o2 has a considerably longer lifetime in d2o 50 μs than in h2o 4 μs lindig et al 1980 in addition roles of radicals to carbamazepine degradation were negligible as indicated in the tests using radical scavengers of tba meoh and sod text s7 figs 3b and s8 and table s2 note that nh4 2so4 remarkably inhibited 96 carbamazepine which verified a vital role of chlorine for generating 1o2 as ammonia was highly reactive to chlorine but not pms heeb et al 2017 the contribution of 1o2 can be calculated by subtracting rchlorination from the total removal efficiency of carbamazepine thus the remarkable contribution of 1o2 corresponded to the blank area in fig 3a the formed products during carbamazepine degradation in pms cl further shed light on the importance of 1o2 fig 4 by using an uplc q tof ms analysis nine products of carbamazepine p1 m z 267 11 p2 and p3 m z 253 10 p4 m z 208 03 p5 m z 210 10 p6 m z 271 11 p7 m z 240 10 p8 m z 224 11 and p9 m z 224 07 were observed in pms cl at ph 4 1 figs s9 s11 and table s3 among them the typical endoperoxide p1 m z 267 11 via 1o2 cycloaddition to the olefinic double bond of carbamazepine as the most active site fig s12 was identified the formation of endoperoxide is consistent to previous literatures that electron rich olefins can undergo cycloaddition to yield endoperoxides via 1o2 addition mazur and foote 1970 harding and goddard 1980 keto and hydroxylated carbamazepine p2 and p3 m z 253 10 were formed p2 underwent deacetylation and ring contraction to yield p4 m z 208 03 which was further transformed to p8 m z 224 11 and p9 m z 224 07 through 1o2 attack of the aldehyde group and the benzene ring of p4 respectively p3 was transformed to p5 m z 210 10 p6 m z 271 11 and p7 m z 240 10 via deacetylation hydroxylation and deamidation pathways respectively the typical transformation products of carbamazepine derived from 1o2 p1 4 p6 p8 9 were also observed in visible light irradiated composite metal nanomaterials and zero valent iron citric acid processes xu et al 2016 ding et al 2017 rayaroth et al 2020 note that six products p2 5 p7 8 were also formed in hocl cl at ph 4 1 at a scenario of cl2 figs s13 s14 and table s4 soufan et al 2013 this result indicates that the products formed via 1o2 and cl2 oxidation are partially similar however chlorinated products via cl2 oxidation were not detected in pms cl table s3 also the formation of tocl was negligible in pms cl fig s15 as 1o2 dominated the carbamazepine transformation in pms cl the transformation of carbamazepine in pms cl demonstrated the key role of 1o2 by the reaction pathways of cycloaddition hydroxylation ring contraction deacetylation and deamidation revealed in fig 4 besides effects of cl concentrations on the mineralization rate were evaluated during carbamazepine degradation in pms cl as depicted in fig s16 the toc removal rates were slightly changed with increasing cl from 2 to 5 mm all of which were less than 6 within the margin of error at 50 and 80 removal rates of carbamazepine and ph 4 1 in pms cl this result indicates that 1o2 with a mild oxidation capacity causes negligible mineralization 3 4 factors affecting 1o2 formation in pms cl for pollutant decontamination the formation efficiency of 1o2 in the pms cl scenario was remarkably affected by cl and pms concentrations ph and a water matrix of nom as demonstrated by the significantly different degradation of carbamazepine under these conditions increasing cl concentrations played dual roles to increase hocl formation and to accelerate the conversion from hocl to cl2 simultaneously resulting in accelerating 1o2 formation in pms cl eqs 3 and 4 in table 1 such increasing trends of 1o2 formation resulted in linear increase of the removal efficiency of carbamazepine with increasing cl from 1 mm to 30 mm at a fixed pms dosage of 1 mm and ph 4 1 figs 5 b and s17 also decreasing ph promoted the conversion from hocl to cl2 in pms cl and then significantly accelerated the reaction of pms and cl2 to form 1o2 thus the rapid formation of 1o2 with decreasing ph from 7 7 to 4 1 caused its dominant role responsible for 47 8 96 3 carbamazepine removal at 5 min in pms cl figs 5a and s18 increasing pms dosage unlike the effects of cl and ph only increased hocl formation eq 2 in table 1 the rapid conversion from hocl to cl2 was blocked which further retarded 1o2 formation therefore the yield of 1o2 was not linear to pms dosage the synergetic roles of 1o2 and cl2 only resulted in a fivefold increase of the removal efficiency of carbamazepine as pms dosage rose from 0 05 mm to 1 mm at a fixed 30 mm cl ph 4 1 and 5 min figs 5c and s19 overall this result provides a detailed evidence that cl at fresh water levels of 1 8 mm mullaney et al 2007 can activate pms and efficiently generate 1o2 for decontamination as nom is the predominant sink for chlorine 5 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 rather than pms and 1o2 kim et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the presence of 5 mg l nom caused an around threefold decrease of chlorine concentration in pms cl compared to the absence of nom fig s20 the decreased concentrations of chlorine further impeded 1o2 formation which retarded the degradation of carbamazepine in pms cl as shown in fig 6 a the removal efficiency at 5 min remarkably decreased by 75 and 97 at nom concentration of 1 mg l and 5 mg l respectively compared to that in the absence of nom besides cl at seawater level 540 mm significantly accelerated the degradation of carbamazepine specifically carbamazepine was completely removed at 15 min and ph 7 6 in pms cl in which 1o2 plays the dominant role of 60 80 fig 6b the process was also tested in a practical wastewater water parameters shown in table s5 as shown in figs 6c and s18b the degradation of carbamazepine was retarded in practical wastewater compared with that in pure water at ph 6 5 6 7 presumably due to the chlorine consumption by dissolved organic matter dom in the wastewater it should be noted that the carbamazepine removal efficiency of 70 was still reached upon extending the reaction time to 240 min fig 6c 3 5 role of 1o2 for disinfection potential in pms cl pms is widely used for disinfection in drinking water and swimming pools the roles of different reactive species for disinfection is largely unknown in pms cl herein two typical deoxynucleosides in dna including deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine were selected as target compounds to evaluate the disinfection potential by pms cl the reactivities of hocl cl2 and cl2o reacting with deoxyguanosine were determined to be 22 8 m 1 s 1 3 8 105 m 1 s 1 and 1 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and those with deoxythymidine were determined to be 2 1 m 1 s 1 2 7 104 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 104 m 1 s 1 respectively text s8 and fig s21 as shown in fig s22 pms cl substantially enhanced the damage of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine and their removal efficiencies at 10 min were 94 6 and 39 7 respectively at 1 mm pms 30 mm cl and ph 4 1 both cl2 and 1o2 dominated the damage of deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine in which the contributions of 1o2 were 48 3 63 5 at 10 min this result indicates that 1o2 formed in pms cl is beneficial to pathogen disinfection 4 conclusions and engineering implications in summary 1o2 is efficiently generated from pms and cl interaction in which the reaction of pms and cl2 is thermodynamically favorable to form 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 105 m 1 s 1 this rate constant is approximately 4 orders of magnitude higher than the reaction of h2o2 and cl2 therefore the pms cl scenario showed better performance on micropollutant removal than the analogous h2o2 cl scenario specifically the removal efficiency of carbamazepine at 5 min in pms cl was 20 2 times higher than that in h2o2 cl at ph 4 1 and 30 mm cl fig s23 also 1o2 generated in pms cl exhibited substantial reactivity toward micropollutants even in complicated water matrices e g wastewater coastal and marine environments notably 1o2 formed in pms cl can be double edged once pms is used for disinfection in drinking water standardization 2000 china 2018 the interaction of waters with residual pms and high levels of cl 105 2 62 4 mm in human bodies jahn et al 2015 may generate 1o2 in vivo especially in stomach with ph ranges of 1 3 in this vein the formed 1o2 could increase the risk to stomach as 1o2 can directly oxidize guanine via the introduction of single strand breaks in the dna structure lafleur et al 1987 khan et al 1992 khan and kasha 1994 additionally pms is commonly used for swimming pools and baths gay 1994 anipsitakis et al 2008 another practical pms cl scenario alerts a concern on the potential of 1o2 to skin cancer and cataracts to human beings di
