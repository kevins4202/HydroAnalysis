2205,the flow vegetation interactions and management of floodplain vegetation can be helpful for morphological stability and ecological maintenance of the rivers experiments were conducted in a fluvial hydro ecological laboratory to study the hydrodynamic behavior of the compound meandering channel of low sinuosity with different layouts of flexible vegetation on floodplain the presence of high density of floodplain vegetation resulted in increase of streamwise velocity up to 23 in main channel as compared to other vegetation layouts the floodplain vegetation enhanced the streamwise velocities along the curvature but the magnitude of the increase was dependent on the flow depth the shear layer at the interface of the vegetated floodplain is expanding laterally towards the main channel with varying vegetation density at the channel floodplain interface the velocity gradient in the lateral direction increases with increasing vegetation density generating a strong shear layer at that position the turbulent structures near the channel floodplain interface are observed to increase with increasing vegetation density this resulted in an increase in turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity reynold s shear stresses and turbulent kinetic energy showing its peak near the inner bank the variability of flow angle at apex bend and crossover region is observed to be less dominant in emergent conditions than vegetation configurations in submerged conditions these findings provide insights of the shear layer dynamics and other turbulent structures in a low sinuous channel with the effect of floodplain vegetation keywords low sinuous channel vegetation turbulence open channel flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the riparian vegetation along the river corridor is an essential component of the fluvial system which links various hydro eco morphological processes dufour et al 2019 for maintaining the planform

1998 baptist 2003 kothyari et al 2009 in natural riparian environments the vegetation cover is observed as patches of varying densities and patterns that continuously alter the river flow and sediment transport processes sun and shiono 2009 neary et al 2012 wang et al 2015 the physical evaluation of rivers and their riparian environment are controlled by the vegetation and wood transportation of the rivers bertoldi and ruiz villanueva 2017 reviewed the recent improvements in vegetation and wood modelling with a focus on flow vegetation sediment interactions at the reach scale the vegetation along the river s shoreline interacts with hydraulic and morpho dynamic processes and it may help stabilize the sediments in river similarly the recruitment of vegetation and its growth on non cohesive fluvial deposits is highly influenced by the hydrology of rivers and the ability of roots to anchor effectively and resist erosion by flowing water pasquale et al 2014 carried out an investigation of the above ground and below ground seasonal growth dynamics of salix cuttings in relation to local river flow sediment dynamics additionally riparian vegetation uprooted during floods can alter hydraulics sediment dynamics and bar evolution subsequently calvani et al 2019 developed a conceptual model and a new physical equation that can be used to predict flow and erosion conditions that can lead to plants uprooting it is therefore important to understand the influence of vegetation on river channel behavior for effective planning of vegetation in river restoration schemes previous studies on flow vegetation interactions revealed that vegetation has significantly altered the mean flow and turbulent characteristics nepf 2012 aberle and järvelä 2013 vargas luna et al 2015 box et al 2021 such as changes in shape of the velocity profiles reynolds stresses and roughness characteristics many of the studies were conducted instraight channels with artificial vegetation elements studying the arrangement and patterns of vegetation nezu and sanjou 2008 chen et al 2011 and effects of vegetation density li et al 2014 devi and kumar 2016 on turbulent characteristics however the river processes differ in meandering and straight channels in meandering compound channel the flow processes such as velocity gradient momentum exchange shear layer dynamics and vortex structures are significantly influenced by vegetation cover shiono and knight 1991 tominaga and nezu 1991 yang et al 2007 sun and shiono 2009 proust and nikora 2020 wang et al 2021 the lateral velocity distribution with the effect of flow vegetation interactions at channel floodplain interface were observed to be dominant shan et al 2015 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the secondary circulations and stream wise velocity distribution are strongly dependent on channel geometry both in terms of sinuosity and cross sectional morphology shiono et al 1999 khatua et al 2011

there are limited works focusing on flood plain vegetation in highly sinuous channels with flexible vegetation liu et al 2016 termini 2017 finotello et al 2020 and rigid vegetation farzadkhoo et al 2018 yang et al 2019 hamidifar et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and some on straight compound channels with varying vegetation density perucca et al 2006 van dijk et al 2013 wang et al 2021 vegetation influences the sediment erosion and deposition processes affecting the river morphological behavior gurnell et al 2012 crosato and saleh 2011 found that meandering behavior occurs with increased vegetation density while braiding behavior occurs with low vegetation density vegetation has shown positive feedback in controlling the braiding intensity gran and paola 2001 tal et al 2004 paola and tal 2007 and promoting sand bar and bank accretion processes bertoldi et al 2011 camporeale et al 2013 gurnell 2014 in braided rivers for example vegetation impacts can be investigated at fine scales such as the contribution of root reinforcement to bank cohesion and at coarser scales such as the retention of sediment by vegetation e g gran and paola 2001 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 perona et al 2012 further the riparian vegetation supports to river ecological processes by altering velocity profiles drag and turbulent characteristics sediment and nutrient deposition patterns and increased flow resistance recent investigations have been highlighting the role of aquatic vegetation in improving water quality by removing nutrients and releasing oxygen to the water column wilcock et al 1999 schulz et al 2003 zhu et al 2016 the above literature review provides a good process response based understanding of flow vegetation interactions in terms of turbulent characteristics under different flow conditions however these studies are limited to straight or highly sinuous compound channels and influence of floodplain vegetation on main channel flow characteristics in low sinuous compound channels has not been widely discussed which is the focus of the present work considering the importance of river corridor vegetation both in terms of morphological stability and ecological health the present work aims to investigate the main channel hydraulics in a low sinuous compound channel which is less focussed the objectives of this paper are a to investigate the effect of floodplain vegetation of varying densities on the main channel turbulent structures in low sinuous channel and b to study the variation in turbulent structures with two different flow conditions experimental flow measurements were performed on an emergent and submerged vegetation condition in a low sinuous compound channel with different densities of floodplain vegetation 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 represents the series of experiments conducted at the fluvial hydro ecological laboratory civil engineering department iit guwahati in 18 m long 1 m wide and 0 3 m deep reinforced concrete flume filled with 1 m layer of river sand fig 2 i two 15 hp and one 3hp pumps were used to drive and recirculate the flow between 10 000 l capacity of sump and the channel flow discharge is controlled by 3 pumps with 2 15 hp pumps and 1 3hp pump with a maximum discharge of 35 lit s the flume primarily consists of inlet chamber stream channel outlet chamber and recirculating system a 4 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep collecting chamber with concrete walls and roughness features was built upstream to reduce turbulence and straighten the incoming flow into the channel a low sinuous compound channel of sinuosity 1 1 is created over the flume bed to carry out the experiments bed slope of the flume was maintained 0 001 for all the experiments d50 used for the sand distribution was 0 37 mm the discharge was measured using a v notch at the inlet of the flume and the flow depth was measured using a digital point gauge at a sampling frequency of 100 hz a three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter 4 probe 10 mhz vectrino adv designed by nortek was used to get instantaneous velocity measurements the duration of data acquisition was fixed to 2 min and in total 12 000 samples were collected at each measurement point barman and kumar 2022 the time series velocity data was post processed using an accelerating threshold goring and nikora 2002 to remove the spikes to reduce the effects of upstream entry and downstream exit on the laboratory experiments a 1 2 m long test section was selected at a distance of 10 6 m from the flume entrance 2 2 vegetation arrangement natural vegetation of rice grass oryza sativa young rice plants of bladed type was used in experiments in total 10 experiments among them eight were 4 submerged vegetation and 4 were emergent vegetation condition with different vegetation configurations fig 2 ii and remaining 2 experiments of without floodplain vegetation were performed all the plants were carefully planted in a staggered pattern along the test section without any uprooting during the experiments these natural rice plants were planted at a different densities of 400 200 150 100 plants m2 table 1 shows the geometry of the channel and physical characteristics of the plant used in the study 2 3 flow conditions and measurement locations experiments were carried out in both emergent and submerged vegetation conditions in this study the main channel flow depths for different experiments were kept much lower than incipient motion condition and the bed is subjected to no transport condition devi et al 2016 chembolu et al 2019 table 2 shows the summary of hydraulic parameters maintained in the channel for different flow depths the velocity measurements at different location along the depth were carried to study the influence of vegetation on main channel turbulent characteristics fig 2 iii iv shows the measurement locations in transverse and vertical directions these measurements were carried at three cross sections cs1 cs2 and cs3 i e apex bend and cross over regions respectively in the test section instantaneous velocity components were measured along the flow depth at an increment of 0 5 cm from the near bed thus more than 14 measurement points are collected for each location similarly 10 similar vertical measurements are collected in each cross section from left bank to right bank fig 2 the uncertainty of adv data is measured by collecting 15 pulses of 12 000 samples for 2 min each at a point in the test section table 3 2 4 turbulence term definitions a representative selection of despiked velocities from adv measurements of streamwise u cross stream v and vertical velocity w were used to calculate time averaged components u v and w from which fluctuating components u v a n d w were determined the turbulence intensity ti in a specific direction is calculated as 1 ti x u 2 where u 2 i e root mean square of the time series of stream wise velocity fluctuations reynold s shear stress is calculated as 2 τ xz ρ u w here ρ is the density of water u and w are the fluctuating velocities in x and z direction respectively the turbulent kinetic energy tke was calculated using 3 tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 in order to make comparison between the magnitudes of turbulence intensity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in different experimental scenarios the turbulence intensities eq 1 were normalized by u reynold s shear stress eq 2 and turbulent kinetic energy eq 3 were normalized by u 2 3 results 3 1 impact of flood plain green corridor on flow features 3 1 1 streamwise velocities this section discusses the variability in longitudinal streamwise velocity profiles the velocity measurements were performed using adv at different cross sections cs1 to cs3 along test section fig 3 shows the normalized velocity u u contours at the apex cs1 with floodplain vegetation of different densities for two flow depth scenarios of dr 0 27 and 0 43 in both the depth scenarios the maximum core magnitude is found near the inner bank y h 5 at the apex section for submerged floodplain vegetation dr 0 43 the velocity magnitude increases by 10 16 18 and 23 with increase in vegetation densities from 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 relative to no vegetation case table 4 under emergent conditions dr 0 27 this difference in velocity magnitude was less predominant with increased vegetation densities for dr 0 27 fig 3 i there is no significant difference in velocity contours observed among various densities fig 3 ii shows the increased magnitude of velocity in main channel with increasing vegetation densities under submerged conditions however in the higher floodplain depth the mean velocity in no vegetation condition is less than to the vegetation cases fig 3 shows the demarcated lines to identify the velocity core region and shear layer region for different configurations of vegetation densities in the experimental channel in case of emergent fig 3i and submerged fig 3ii conditions the shear layer is pushed towards the outer bank with increasing in velocity core region and magnitude resulted from increasing vegetation density further the width of shear layer is decreasing with increasing of vegetation density and the closed thick intervals of shear layer is observed in maximum vegetation density for submerged condition fig 3 ii a a strong velocity gradient is observed in the high vegetation density scenario i e 400 plants m2 because of flow diversion from floodplain to the main channel the presence of locations of lower velocity zones at the outer bank and maximum velocity cores at inner bank were observed to be similar for all the cases of floodplain vegetation densities further throughout the channel the large regions of maximum velocity are observed which indicates the flow in a sinuous channel with lower floodplain depth is dominant in the longitudinal direction in both the cases of emergent dr 0 27 and submerged dr 0 43 conditions the increased floodplain resistance is created with increase in vegetation density resulted in higher velocity magnitude in the main channel 3 1 2 secondary velocities fig 4 shows the fluctuating velocity vectors v w of the secondary currents and the background color represents the cross stream velocity v in the experimental channel under submerged conditions dr 0 43 with vegetated and non vegetated flood plain it can be observed that the magnitude of secondary velocity vectors increases with increase in vegetation densities further this magnitude of secondary velocity vector is greater at cross over regions followed by the bend and apex regions for all the vegetation densities in contrast the secondary circulations present a quite different scenario fig 4 in no vegetated floodplain condition fig 4 v because of the free floodplain surface and side bank there was a turbulence anisotropy along the side wall of the main channel that transfers the flow into the main channel and pair of vortices were created at the free surface and bottom of the channel the presence of floodplain vegetation imposes the flow resistance and increases turbulence in the main channel the pattern of secondary flow changed significantly in vegetation condition as compared to non vegetated floodplain case fig 5 shows the secondary flow in dr 0 27 and 0 43 conditions at apex section for different densities in both the scenarios the magnitude of secondary velocity is observed higher at the outer bank for all the vegetation densities however the secondary cell circulations are noticed mostly near the outer bank for high density floodplain vegetation conditions 400 and 200 plants m2 further the experiments were conducted in low sinuous channel that resulted in reduced strength of secondary circulation cells the cross stream v and vertical component w of velocities were smaller compared to streamwise velocities figs 3 4 in comparison to no vegetated conditions the fluctuating component v has increased in emergent vegetation condition fig 5i and at submerged vegetation condition fig 5ii the fluctuated velocities were low in submerged condition dr 0 43 the maximum magnitude of secondary velocity vectors are 22 19 18 16 and 12 of the maximum streamwise velocity for 400 200 150 100 plants m2 and no vegetation respectively thus the magnitude of secondary currents is strengthened as the vegetation density increases in higher floodplain flow depth further the angle of inclination of secondary currents in higher floodplain flow condition are about 2 6 6 5 and 7 3 for 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 respectively the inclination angle of the flexible vegetation increases with the increasing of the density of vegetation the arrangement of vegetation on the floodplain has significant influence on the flow distribution in the channel 3 1 3 turbulent intensity fig 6 shows the contour plot of turbulence intensity ti normalized by the shear velocity u for different vegetation cases of two different relative depths i e dr 0 27 and 0 43 for emergent floodplain vegetation dr 0 27 fig 6 i the high turbulence values were recorded near the bed z h 0 to 0 25 of the channel further with increase in vegetation densities the turbulence intensity is higher and relatively uniform throughout the cross section for all the vegetation densities under emergent condition the turbulence intensity shows peak near the outer bank y h 0 in case of submerged floodplain vegetation dr 0 43 fig 6 ii the turbulence intensity core region is found near the inner bank for all the vegetation densities however for higher density case 400 plants m2 the turbulence core spreads across y h 4 to 5 and observed at z h 0 375 further this core region is deeper in the main channel which may be due to the more surface area occupied by the higher density of vegetation than in other vegetation configurations in other cases 200 150 and 100 plants m2 the turbulence intensity is maximum at the inner bank water surface and then observed to decrease towards the bed which may be due to velocity dip phenomena for submerged condition the percentage increase in turbulence intensity in the main channel by 5 9 11 and 18 with increase in vegetation densities from 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 when compared to no vegetation scenario the maximum ti values are dependent on the density of the vegetation this is due to the turbulence shear production generated near the vegetation interface channel floodplain transition increasing with vegetation density in the submerged condition fig 6 ii 3 1 4 reynold s stresses fig 7 shows the normalized reynold s shear stress distribution u w u 2 in the sinuous channel with the effect of different vegetation densities for dr 0 43 submerged condition the percentage increase of reynold s shear stress is 11 21 27 and 39 for different vegetation densities such as 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 compared to no vegetation scenario for dr 0 27 emergent condition this difference in reynold s shear stress was less predominant with increased vegetation densities for submerged condition fig 7 ii the results reported that the maximum positive reynold s stresses occur at the interface of main channel and floodplain vegetated region in between the range of z h 0 75 to 1 125 h is floodplain depth which indicates that the shear becomes dominant and the maximum along the inner bend apex of the main channel the reynold s stress is found to be zero along the cross section line fig 7 which is observed to vary with different vegetation densities the reynold s stress is negative and positive at the below and above of the zero line this can be anticipated from the lateral gradient of the streamwise mean velocity fig 3 under emergent conditions fig 7 i the zero reynold s stress line is deformed and moved up to the water surface with decreasing vegetation density fig 7 shows that for both dr 0 27 and 0 43 conditions the values were negative below the zero reynold s stress line this is due to the negative reynold s shear stress originates through the momentum transfer from the side wall into the center of the main channel however in a sinuous channel for different cross sections the momentum exchange is relatively different reynold s shear stress provides understanding of the momentum fluxes produced by turbulent variations the findings showed that in the main channel fig 7 ii the maximum floodplain vegetation density 400 plants m2 affects the reynold s shear stresses producing strong shear stresses u w u 2 3 5 at a higher floodplain flow depth in comparison the distribution of the interface shear stresses e g u w u 2 1 2 changed entirely at low flow depth due to the velocity gradient and secondary circulations in the main channel there are higher amount of reynold s shear stresses along the vegetated area in submerged condition fig 7 ii the turbulence dissipation caused by the momentum is significantly related to the exchange thus the floodplain vegetation shifts the flow structure into the main stream creates more turbulence and alters the distribution of velocity profiles 3 1 5 turbulent kinetic energy tke fig 8 shows the normalized turbulent kinetic energy tke u 2 contours in the case of emergent condition dr 0 27 fig 8 i the tke originates at the outer bank and spreads towards the inner bank the maximum tke values were observed at bottom of the outer bank i e y h 0 to 1 in emergent condition this is relatively different in the case of submerged condition where tke originates at the top of the inner bank and migrate towards outer bank further the percentage increase in tke is 12 15 19 and 25 with increase in vegetation densities of 100 150 200 and 400plants m2 as compared to no vegetation condition under higher vegetation densities the maximum tke is formed as waves fig 8 ii created near the floodplain channel transition y h 5 due to the vegetation structure interactions this may be due to discontinuity of the drag at that region resulting a high velocity gradient near the vegetation interface further the distribution of tke is related to the secondary circulation cell produced in the channel in emergent condition fig 5 i the circulation of cells at the apex section for different densities of vegetation associated with the higher values of tke fig 8 i this indicates the development of tke is associated with recirculation cell generated by the local curvature fig 5 ii shows the submerged condition where the minimum turbulent kinetic energy occurs underneath the water surface in the main channel which is associated to the velocity dip phenomena causes due to the secondary currents from the results the higher vegetation density increases in tke values in the main channel as shown in fig 8 ii similar to the reynolds stress the turbulent kinetic energy showed a maximum value near the interface which increases with increase in vegetation density this is due to the turbulence shear production generated near the interface 3 2 flow angle the flow angle can be resolved into components with an angle θ where angle θ is obtained as θ tan 1 v u fig 9 shows the vertical ratio distributions at apex bend and cross over regions in main channel with no vegetation and varying vegetation densities over floodplain 400 plants m2 and 100 plants m2 the results of experimental configurations of no vegetation higher 400 plants m2 and lower 100 plants m2 vegetation densities were presented here the flow angle is calculated within the main channel to understand the variation of velocity gradient in each layer of the flow this velocity gradient at the interface results in shear layer dynamics and its consequence effects were discussed in the above sections it is observed that the maximum flow angle θ 25 is reported for dr 0 27 emergent vegetation condition at cross over region for vegetation density of 100 plants m2 the maximum flow angle is observed at bed level for cross over and bend regions i e θ 25 the variation of flow angle from the bed level to top of the water surface is reduced for bend section θ 25 as compared to cross over region fig 9 thus at the cross section of bend θ 25 and apex region θ 4 relatively lower flow angle is observed further at the apex section the flow angle variability can be observed from near bed to the top surface in comparison to other two sections in the case of dr 0 43 submerged vegetation the maximum flow angle is θ 20 which was observed for vegetation density of 400 plants m2 at cross over region cor and bend region the flow angle also showed a similar response at emergent and submerged conditions like other turbulent parameters in the case of no vegetation condition the effect on flow angle is insignificant as compared to other vegetated conditions 4 discussions in this section the impact of vegetation density on shear layer dynamics and turbulent parameters is discussed the shear layer generated along the edge of the vegetated region is observed to expanding laterally from the inner bank to the outer bank the shear layer is pushed away from the vegetated zone to become a free shear layer with higher turbulence energy in the case of emergent and submerged vegetation conditions the shear layer is pushed towards the outer bank with increasing in velocity core region and magnitude resulted from increasing vegetation density the shear layer at the interface of the vegetated floodplain extends towards the main channel due to additional resistance offered by vegetation mulahasan et al 2015 vojoudi mehrabani et al 2020 yang et al 2007 stated that in a flow through compound channel the flow interaction between the main channel and the floodplain occurs and a shear layer forms as a result of the flow in the main channel moving faster than the flow in the vegetated floodplain in the present study it was observed in case of emergent vegetation condition the shear layer width was extended towards the outer bank as the vegetation density decreases further comparing all vegetation density configurations no such significant variation in streamwise velocities were observed whereas for submerged condition the streamwise velocity increased with increase of vegetation density and the width of shear layer is observed to decrease these findings differed from the study carried in straight compound channel by nezu and onitsuka 2001 highlighting the effect of channel geometry on shear layer characteristics further the experimental studies of nezu and onitsuka 2001 truong and uijttewaal 2019 demonstrates that turbulence anisotropy and shear variability generate a vortex near the water surface that results in secondary flow dispersion at the floodplain vegetation interface the velocity gradient in the crosswise direction increases with increasing vegetation density generating a strong shear layer at that position as vegetation density increases the wavy isovel lines become closer and these lines result from a strong secondary current as the secondary circulation strength increases at the outer bank it is helpful to restrict the wavy isovel lines extended to outer bank in the vegetated condition in such cases the velocity distribution in the channel appears to be uniform in the lateral direction unlike that in the non vegetated zone the water surface gradient increases with the increasing of density of vegetation from the results magnitude of secondary currents is strengthened as the vegetation density increases in higher floodplain flow depth choi and kang 2006 reported the patterns of secondary circulations and mean flow velocities for different vegetation densities and found that the strength of secondary currents are more for higher vegetation densities the formation of secondary currents in a compound meandering channel is governed by complex processes of mass and momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain jahra et al 2010 and pan et al 2019 moncho esteve et al 2018 stated that secondary flow motions are highly influenced by the geometry of waterway both by the sinuosity of the channel and by the cross sectional form the experiments were conducted in the present study in a low sinuous channel that resulted in reduced strength of secondary circulation cells as compared to the high sinuous channel further rozovskii 1961 stated that the fully developed secondary current cell can be observed at bend section having an angle of 220 leading to the fact of rare possibility in the development of secondary flow in a meandering channel muto and ishigaki 1999 reported that the behavior of the secondary circulation structures changes with increasing sinuosity from 1 09 to 1 59 for dr 0 15 in this study the experimental channel is having low sinuosity bend angle of 60 which reduced the strength of secondary circulation cells as compared to the high sinuous channel in high flow condition the maximum positive reynold s stresses occur at the interface of main channel and vegetated zone indicating that the shear becomes dominant and maximum along the inner bend apex of the main channel the reynold s stress obtained is maximum at top of the vegetation due to the shear layer and vertical vortex at the interface of vegetated and non vegetated areas similar observation is reported by afzalimehr et al 2021 the increase of reynold s stress is due to the negative pressure gradient in stream wise direction azevedo et al 2017 reported that the negative reynold s shear stress originates through the momentum transfer from the side wall into the mid of the main channel a study by jahra 2010 observes increase in spanwise reynold s stress with increases in vegetation density in terms of positive and negative along the two inner apex of the meandering wave in the present study for emergent condition dr 0 27 the reynold s shear stress also increase with increase of vegetation density kang and choi 2006 found the reynolds stress is zero along the vertical line and the values were negative and positive at the right hand side and left hand side of the line respectively this can also be expected from the lateral gradient of the mean streamwise velocity with increasing vegetation density the zero reynold s stress line deforms and travels to the right bank in high flow conditions the turbulent shear layer generates high tke values at upper layer of the inner bank whereas in the case of low flow conditions the maximum values of tke are at the outer wall zhang et al 2020 stated that the high value of tke was observed at the top of the vegetation due to the discontinuity of the drag force at that region resulting a high velocity gradient near the vegetation interface in submerged condition the turbulent kinetic energy shows a peak near the inner bank and the maximum value increases as the vegetation density increases note that a minimum tke occurs underneath the water surface in the main channel which is related to the velocity dip produced due to the secondary currents in the present study the interactions between flow and vegetation elements generated different patterns of turbulent structures for varying flow and vegetation densities for example the intensity of secondary circulations in main channel are observed to be lower when floodplain vegetation is under submerged condition this type of flow conditions may favor for fish habitat growth and survival trinci et al 2017 it is also noticed that the main channel tke and other turbulent parameters are relatively lower in channels with low sinuosity the ecologically relevant turbulent flow features are necessary to prevent the turbulence related hazards such as injury dislodgment and mortality of aquatic habitat trinci et al 2017 the orientation of flow structures can play a significant role on the behavior and energetics of fish lacey et al 2012 distinct species have different ecological reactions due to degree of environmental constraints imposed by river bends hydrodynamic and sediment transport patterns and changes in water quality the present study although not highlighted the vegetation sediment interactions but the vegetation has the positive impact in river corridor stabilization by promoting accretion processes further there existing a complex process response feedback mechanisms to seasonal variability in river corridor vegetation cover and its uprooting dynamics 5 conclusions in the present study an analysis of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of emergent and submerged flood plain vegetation on flow characteristics experimental observations of contour velocity distribution shear layer and momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain have been presented for a low sinuous compound channel with varying floodplain vegetation densities and flow conditions the core velocities have been shown to depend on relative depth dr 0 27 and 0 43 and on floodplain vegetation in this paper aims to understand the main channel hydrodynamic structure and ecological health with the variation in flood plain vegetation densities in a low sinuous channel the following conclusions are drawn from the study in the high vegetation density i e 400 plants m2 scenario the flood plain vegetation enhanced the streamwise velocities along the bend apex resulting in a strong velocity gradient at the bend apex due to flow diversion from the floodplain to the main channel which increased main channel velocity by 23 compared to the no vegetation scenario the secondary current in the main channel was composed of an enhanced secondary cell which was aided by centrifugal force and a component from the floodplain upstream the strength of the main channel secondary circulations is less in low sinuous channels with increase in vegetation density however the magnitude of the secondary currents is increased with vegetation density in case of emergent and submerged conditions the shear layer is expanding towards the outer bank with increasing in vegetation density further the width of shear layer is decreasing with increasing of vegetation density and the closed thick intervals of shear layer is observed in maximum vegetation density for submerged condition the turbulence core region is maximum at the inner bank water surface and then observed to decrease towards the bed which may be due to velocity dip phenomena further this core region is deeper in the main channel which may be due to more surface area occupied by the higher density of vegetation compared to other vegetation configurations in the case of emergent condition the tke originates at the outer bank and spreads towards the inner bank the maximum tke values were observed at bottom of the outer bank this scenario is relatively different in submerged condition where tke originates at the top of the inner bank and migrate towards outer bank the findings showed the floodplain vegetation affects the reynold s shear stresses in the main channel producing strong reynold s shear stresses at a higher floodplain flow condition thus the floodplain vegetation shifts the flow structure into the main stream creates the more turbulence and alters the distribution of velocity profiles the present work can be further extended to study the influence of different channel and flood plain sinuosity with heterogeneous vegetation configurations the flow and turbulent processes in rivers will however be better analysed with detailed turbulence measurements at apex bend and cross over regions along the meander length with further improvement in understanding of flow river corridor vegetation interactions the riparian vegetation can be effectively managed in planning of river restoration schemes credit authorship

2205,the flow vegetation interactions and management of floodplain vegetation can be helpful for morphological stability and ecological maintenance of the rivers experiments were conducted in a fluvial hydro ecological laboratory to study the hydrodynamic behavior of the compound meandering channel of low sinuosity with different layouts of flexible vegetation on floodplain the presence of high density of floodplain vegetation resulted in increase of streamwise velocity up to 23 in main channel as compared to other vegetation layouts the floodplain vegetation enhanced the streamwise velocities along the curvature but the magnitude of the increase was dependent on the flow depth the shear layer at the interface of the vegetated floodplain is expanding laterally towards the main channel with varying vegetation density at the channel floodplain interface the velocity gradient in the lateral direction increases with increasing vegetation density generating a strong shear layer at that position the turbulent structures near the channel floodplain interface are observed to increase with increasing vegetation density this resulted in an increase in turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity reynold s shear stresses and turbulent kinetic energy showing its peak near the inner bank the variability of flow angle at apex bend and crossover region is observed to be less dominant in emergent conditions than vegetation configurations in submerged conditions these findings provide insights of the shear layer dynamics and other turbulent structures in a low sinuous

riparian vegetation along the river corridor is an essential component of the fluvial system which links various hydro eco morphological processes dufour et al 2019 for maintaining the planform

the rivers bertoldi and ruiz villanueva 2017 reviewed the recent improvements in vegetation and wood modelling with a focus on flow vegetation sediment interactions at the reach scale the vegetation along the river s shoreline interacts with hydraulic and morpho dynamic processes and it may help stabilize the sediments in river similarly the recruitment of vegetation and its growth on non cohesive fluvial deposits is highly influenced by the hydrology of rivers and the ability of roots to anchor effectively and resist erosion by flowing water pasquale et al 2014 carried out an investigation of the above ground and below ground seasonal growth dynamics of salix cuttings in relation to local river flow sediment dynamics additionally riparian vegetation uprooted during floods can alter hydraulics sediment dynamics and bar evolution subsequently calvani et al 2019 developed a conceptual model and a new physical equation that can be used to predict flow and erosion conditions that can lead to plants uprooting it is therefore important to understand the influence of vegetation on river channel behavior for effective planning of vegetation in river restoration schemes previous studies on flow vegetation interactions revealed that vegetation has significantly altered the mean flow and turbulent characteristics nepf 2012 aberle and järvelä 2013 vargas luna et

characteristics however the river processes differ in meandering and straight channels in meandering compound channel the flow processes such as velocity gradient momentum exchange shear layer

influences the sediment erosion and deposition processes affecting the river morphological behavior gurnell et al 2012 crosato and saleh 2011 found that meandering behavior occurs with increased vegetation density while braiding behavior occurs with low vegetation density vegetation has shown positive feedback in controlling the braiding intensity gran and paola 2001 tal et al 2004 paola and

such as the contribution of root reinforcement to bank cohesion and at coarser scales such as the retention of sediment by vegetation e g gran and paola 2001 nepf and ghisalberti 2008 perona et al 2012 further the riparian vegetation supports to river ecological processes by altering velocity profiles drag and turbulent characteristics sediment and nutrient deposition patterns and increased flow resistance recent investigations have been highlighting the role of aquatic vegetation in improving water quality by removing nutrients and releasing oxygen to the water column wilcock et al 1999 schulz et al 2003 zhu et al 2016 the above literature review provides a good process response based understanding of flow vegetation interactions in terms of turbulent characteristics under different flow conditions however these studies are limited to straight or highly sinuous compound channels and influence of floodplain vegetation on main channel flow characteristics in low sinuous compound channels has not been widely discussed which is the focus of the present work considering the importance of river corridor vegetation both in terms of morphological stability and ecological health the present work aims to investigate the main channel hydraulics in a low sinuous compound channel which is less focussed the objectives of this paper are a to investigate the effect of floodplain vegetation of varying densities on the main channel turbulent structures in low sinuous channel and b to study the variation in turbulent structures with two different flow conditions experimental flow measurements were performed on an emergent and submerged vegetation condition in a low sinuous compound channel with different densities of floodplain vegetation 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 represents the series of experiments conducted at the fluvial hydro ecological laboratory civil engineering department iit guwahati in 18 m long 1 m wide and 0 3 m deep reinforced concrete flume filled with 1 m layer of river sand fig 2 i two 15 hp and one 3hp pumps were used to drive and recirculate the flow between 10 000 l capacity of sump and the channel flow discharge is controlled by 3 pumps with 2 15 hp pumps and 1 3hp pump with a maximum discharge of 35 lit s the flume primarily consists of inlet chamber stream channel outlet chamber and recirculating system a 4 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep collecting chamber with concrete walls and roughness features was built upstream to reduce turbulence and straighten the incoming flow into the channel a low sinuous compound channel of sinuosity 1 1 is created over the flume bed to carry out the experiments bed slope of the flume was maintained 0 001 for all the experiments d50 used for the sand distribution was 0 37 mm the discharge was measured using a v notch at the inlet of the flume and the flow depth was measured using a digital point gauge at a sampling frequency of 100 hz a three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter 4 probe 10 mhz vectrino adv designed by nortek was used to get instantaneous velocity measurements the duration of data acquisition was fixed to 2 min and in total 12 000 samples were collected at each measurement point barman and kumar 2022 the time series velocity data was post processed using an accelerating threshold goring and nikora 2002 to remove the spikes to reduce the effects of upstream entry and downstream exit on the laboratory experiments a 1 2 m long test section was selected at a distance of 10 6 m from the flume entrance 2 2 vegetation arrangement natural vegetation of rice grass oryza sativa young rice plants of bladed type was used in experiments in total 10 experiments among them eight were 4 submerged vegetation and 4 were emergent vegetation condition with different vegetation configurations fig 2 ii and remaining 2 experiments of without floodplain vegetation were performed all the plants were carefully planted in a staggered pattern along the test section without any uprooting during the experiments these natural rice plants were planted at a different densities of 400 200 150 100 plants m2 table 1 shows the geometry of the channel and physical characteristics of the plant used in the study 2 3 flow conditions and measurement locations experiments were carried out in both emergent and submerged vegetation conditions in this study the main channel flow depths for different experiments were kept much lower than incipient motion condition and the bed is subjected to no transport condition devi et al 2016 chembolu et al 2019 table 2 shows the summary of hydraulic parameters maintained in the channel for different flow depths the velocity measurements at different location along the depth were carried to study the influence of vegetation on main channel turbulent characteristics fig 2 iii iv shows the measurement locations in transverse and vertical directions these measurements were carried at three cross sections cs1 cs2 and cs3 i e apex bend and cross over regions respectively in the test section instantaneous velocity components were measured along the flow depth at an increment of 0 5 cm from the near bed thus more than 14 measurement points are collected for each location similarly 10 similar vertical measurements are collected in each cross section from left bank to right bank fig 2 the uncertainty of adv data is measured by collecting 15 pulses of 12 000 samples for 2 min each at a point in the test section table 3 2 4 turbulence term definitions a representative selection of despiked velocities from adv measurements of streamwise u cross stream v and vertical velocity w were used to calculate time averaged components u v and w from which fluctuating components u v a n d w were determined the turbulence intensity ti in a specific direction is calculated as 1 ti x u 2 where u 2 i e root mean square of the time series of stream wise velocity fluctuations reynold s shear stress is calculated as 2 τ xz ρ u w here ρ is the density of water u and w are the fluctuating velocities in x and z direction respectively the turbulent kinetic energy tke was calculated using 3 tke 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 in order to make comparison between the magnitudes of turbulence intensity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in different experimental scenarios the turbulence intensities eq 1 were normalized by u reynold s shear stress eq 2 and turbulent kinetic energy eq 3 were normalized by u 2 3 results 3 1 impact of flood plain green corridor on flow features 3 1 1 streamwise velocities this section discusses the variability in longitudinal streamwise velocity profiles the velocity measurements were performed using adv at different cross sections cs1 to cs3 along test section fig 3 shows the normalized velocity u u contours at the apex cs1 with floodplain vegetation of different densities for two flow depth scenarios of dr 0 27 and 0 43 in both the depth scenarios the maximum core magnitude is found near the inner bank y h 5 at the apex section for submerged floodplain vegetation dr 0 43 the velocity magnitude increases by 10 16 18 and 23 with increase in vegetation densities from 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 relative to no vegetation case table 4 under emergent conditions dr 0 27 this difference in velocity magnitude was less predominant with increased vegetation densities for dr 0 27 fig 3 i there is no significant difference in velocity contours observed among various densities fig 3 ii shows the increased magnitude of velocity in main channel with increasing vegetation densities under submerged conditions however in the higher floodplain depth the mean velocity in no vegetation condition is less than to the vegetation cases fig 3 shows the demarcated lines to identify the velocity core region and shear layer region for different configurations of vegetation densities in the experimental channel in case of emergent fig 3i and submerged fig 3ii conditions the shear layer is pushed towards the outer bank with increasing in velocity core region and magnitude resulted from increasing vegetation density further the width of shear layer is decreasing with increasing of vegetation density and the closed thick intervals of shear layer is observed in maximum vegetation density for submerged condition fig 3 ii a a strong velocity gradient is observed in the high vegetation density scenario i e 400 plants m2 because of flow diversion from floodplain to the main channel the presence of locations of lower velocity zones at the outer bank and maximum velocity cores at inner bank were observed to be similar for all the cases of floodplain vegetation densities further throughout the channel the large regions of maximum velocity are observed which indicates the flow in a sinuous channel with lower floodplain depth is dominant in the longitudinal direction in both the cases of emergent dr 0 27 and submerged dr 0 43 conditions the increased floodplain resistance is created with increase in vegetation density resulted in higher velocity magnitude in the main channel 3 1 2 secondary velocities fig 4 shows the fluctuating velocity vectors v w of the secondary currents and the background color represents the cross stream velocity v in the experimental channel under submerged conditions dr 0 43 with vegetated and non vegetated flood plain it can be observed that the magnitude of secondary velocity vectors increases with increase in vegetation densities further this magnitude of secondary velocity vector is greater at cross over regions followed by the bend and apex regions for all the vegetation densities in contrast the secondary circulations present a quite different scenario fig 4 in no vegetated floodplain condition fig 4 v because of the free floodplain surface and side bank there was a turbulence anisotropy along the side wall of the main channel that transfers the flow into the main channel and pair of vortices were created at the free surface and bottom of the channel the presence of floodplain vegetation imposes the flow resistance and increases turbulence in the main channel the pattern of secondary flow changed significantly in vegetation condition as compared to non vegetated floodplain case fig 5 shows the secondary flow in dr 0 27 and 0 43 conditions at apex section for different densities in both the scenarios the magnitude of secondary velocity is observed higher at the outer bank for all the vegetation densities however the secondary cell circulations are noticed mostly near the outer bank for high density floodplain vegetation conditions 400 and 200 plants m2 further the experiments were conducted in low sinuous channel that resulted in reduced strength of secondary circulation cells the cross stream v and vertical component w of velocities were smaller compared to streamwise velocities figs 3 4 in comparison to no vegetated conditions the fluctuating component v has increased in emergent vegetation condition fig 5i and at submerged vegetation condition fig 5ii the fluctuated velocities were low in submerged condition dr 0 43 the maximum magnitude of secondary velocity vectors are 22 19 18 16 and 12 of the maximum streamwise velocity for 400 200 150 100 plants m2 and no vegetation respectively thus the magnitude of secondary currents is strengthened as the vegetation density increases in higher floodplain flow depth further the angle of inclination of secondary currents in higher floodplain flow condition are about 2 6 6 5 and 7 3 for 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 respectively the inclination angle of the flexible vegetation increases with the increasing of the density of vegetation the arrangement of vegetation on the floodplain has significant influence on the flow distribution in the channel 3 1 3 turbulent intensity fig 6 shows the contour plot of turbulence intensity ti normalized by the shear velocity u for different vegetation cases of two different relative depths i e dr 0 27 and 0 43 for emergent floodplain vegetation dr 0 27 fig 6 i the high turbulence values were recorded near the bed z h 0 to 0 25 of the channel further with increase in vegetation densities the turbulence intensity is higher and relatively uniform throughout the cross section for all the vegetation densities under emergent condition the turbulence intensity shows peak near the outer bank y h 0 in case of submerged floodplain vegetation dr 0 43 fig 6 ii the turbulence intensity core region is found near the inner bank for all the vegetation densities however for higher density case 400 plants m2 the turbulence core spreads across y h 4 to 5 and observed at z h 0 375 further this core region is deeper in the main channel which may be due to the more surface area occupied by the higher density of vegetation than in other vegetation configurations in other cases 200 150 and 100 plants m2 the turbulence intensity is maximum at the inner bank water surface and then observed to decrease towards the bed which may be due to velocity dip phenomena for submerged condition the percentage increase in turbulence intensity in the main channel by 5 9 11 and 18 with increase in vegetation densities from 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 when compared to no vegetation scenario the maximum ti values are dependent on the density of the vegetation this is due to the turbulence shear production generated near the vegetation interface channel floodplain transition increasing with vegetation density in the submerged condition fig 6 ii 3 1 4 reynold s stresses fig 7 shows the normalized reynold s shear stress distribution u w u 2 in the sinuous channel with the effect of different vegetation densities for dr 0 43 submerged condition the percentage increase of reynold s shear stress is 11 21 27 and 39 for different vegetation densities such as 100 150 200 and 400 plants m2 compared to no vegetation scenario for dr 0 27 emergent condition this difference in reynold s shear stress was less predominant with increased vegetation densities for submerged condition fig 7 ii the results reported that the maximum positive reynold s stresses occur at the interface of main channel and floodplain vegetated region in between the range of z h 0 75 to 1 125 h is floodplain depth which indicates that the shear becomes dominant and the maximum along the inner bend apex of the main channel the reynold s stress is found to be zero along the cross section line fig 7 which is observed to vary with different vegetation densities the reynold s stress is negative and positive at the below and above of the zero line this can be anticipated from the lateral gradient of the streamwise mean velocity fig 3 under emergent conditions fig 7 i the zero reynold s stress line is deformed and moved up to the water surface with decreasing vegetation density fig 7 shows that for both dr 0 27 and 0 43 conditions the values were negative below the zero reynold s stress line this is due to the negative reynold s shear stress originates through the momentum transfer from the side wall into the center of the main channel however in a sinuous channel for different cross sections the momentum exchange is relatively different reynold s shear stress provides understanding of the momentum fluxes produced by turbulent variations the findings showed that in the main channel fig 7 ii the maximum floodplain vegetation density 400 plants m2 affects the reynold s shear stresses producing strong shear stresses u w u 2 3 5 at a higher floodplain flow depth in comparison the distribution of the interface shear stresses e g u w u 2 1 2 changed entirely at low flow depth due to the velocity gradient and secondary circulations in the main channel there are higher amount of reynold s shear stresses along the vegetated area in submerged condition fig 7 ii the turbulence dissipation caused by the momentum is significantly related to the exchange thus the floodplain vegetation shifts the flow structure into the main stream creates more turbulence and alters the distribution of velocity profiles 3 1 5 turbulent kinetic energy tke fig 8 shows the normalized turbulent kinetic energy tke u 2 contours in the case of emergent condition dr 0 27 fig 8 i the tke originates at the outer bank and spreads towards the inner bank the maximum tke values were observed at bottom of the outer bank i e y h 0 to 1 in emergent condition this is relatively different in the case of submerged condition where tke originates at the top of the inner bank and migrate towards outer bank further the percentage increase in tke is 12 15 19 and 25 with increase in vegetation densities of 100 150 200 and 400plants m2 as compared to no vegetation condition under higher vegetation densities the maximum tke is formed as waves fig 8 ii created near the floodplain channel transition y h 5 due to the vegetation structure interactions this may be due to discontinuity of the drag at that region resulting a high velocity gradient near the vegetation interface further the distribution of tke is related to the secondary circulation cell produced in the channel in emergent condition fig 5 i the circulation of cells at the apex section for different densities of vegetation associated with the higher values of tke fig 8 i this indicates the development of tke is associated with recirculation cell generated by the local curvature fig 5 ii shows the submerged condition where the minimum turbulent kinetic energy occurs underneath the water surface in the main channel which is associated to the velocity dip phenomena causes due to the secondary currents from the results the higher vegetation density increases in tke values in the main channel as shown in fig 8 ii similar to the reynolds stress the turbulent kinetic energy showed a maximum value near the interface which increases with increase in vegetation density this is due to the turbulence shear production generated near the interface 3 2 flow angle the flow angle can be resolved into components with an angle θ where angle θ is obtained as θ tan 1 v u fig 9 shows the vertical ratio distributions at apex bend and cross over regions in main channel with no vegetation and varying vegetation densities over floodplain 400 plants m2 and 100 plants m2 the results of experimental configurations of no vegetation higher 400 plants m2 and lower 100 plants m2 vegetation densities were presented here the flow angle is calculated within the main channel to understand the variation of velocity gradient in each layer of the flow this velocity gradient at the interface results in shear layer dynamics and its consequence effects were discussed in the above sections it is observed that the maximum flow angle θ 25 is reported for dr 0 27 emergent vegetation condition at cross over region for vegetation density of 100 plants m2 the maximum flow angle is observed at bed level for cross over and bend regions i e θ 25 the variation of flow angle from the bed level to top of the water surface is reduced for bend section θ 25 as compared to cross over region fig 9 thus at the cross section of bend θ 25 and apex region θ 4 relatively lower flow angle is observed further at the apex section the flow angle variability can be observed from near bed to the top surface in comparison to other two sections in the case of dr 0 43 submerged vegetation the maximum flow angle is θ 20 which was observed for vegetation density of 400 plants m2 at cross over region cor and bend region the flow angle also showed a similar response at emergent and submerged conditions like other turbulent parameters in the case of no vegetation condition the effect on flow angle is insignificant as compared to other vegetated conditions 4 discussions in this section the impact of vegetation density on shear layer dynamics and turbulent parameters is discussed the shear layer generated along the edge of the vegetated region is observed to expanding laterally from the inner bank to the outer bank the shear layer is pushed away from the vegetated zone to become a free shear layer with higher turbulence energy in the case of emergent and submerged vegetation conditions the shear layer is pushed towards the outer bank with increasing in velocity core region and magnitude resulted from increasing vegetation density the shear layer at the interface of the vegetated floodplain extends towards the main channel due to additional resistance offered by vegetation mulahasan et al 2015 vojoudi mehrabani et al 2020 yang et al 2007 stated that in a flow through compound channel the flow interaction between the main channel and the floodplain occurs and a shear layer forms as a result of the flow in the main channel moving faster than the flow in the vegetated floodplain in the present study it was observed in case of emergent vegetation condition the shear layer width was extended towards the outer bank as the vegetation density decreases further comparing all vegetation density configurations no such significant variation in streamwise velocities were observed whereas for submerged condition the streamwise velocity increased with increase of vegetation density and the width of shear layer is observed to decrease these findings differed from the study carried in straight compound channel by nezu and onitsuka 2001 highlighting the effect of channel geometry on shear layer characteristics further the experimental studies of nezu and onitsuka 2001 truong and uijttewaal 2019 demonstrates that turbulence anisotropy and shear variability generate a vortex near the water surface that results in secondary flow dispersion at the floodplain vegetation interface the velocity gradient in the crosswise direction increases with increasing vegetation density generating a strong shear layer at that position as vegetation density increases the wavy isovel lines become closer and these lines result from a strong secondary current as the secondary circulation strength increases at the outer bank it is helpful to restrict the wavy isovel lines extended to outer bank in the vegetated condition in such cases the velocity distribution in the channel appears to be uniform in the lateral direction unlike that in the non vegetated zone the water surface gradient increases with the increasing of density of vegetation from the results magnitude of secondary currents is strengthened as the vegetation density increases in higher floodplain flow depth choi and kang 2006 reported the patterns of secondary circulations and mean flow velocities for different vegetation densities and found that the strength of secondary currents are more for higher vegetation densities the formation of secondary currents in a compound meandering channel is governed by complex processes of mass and momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain jahra et al 2010 and pan et al 2019 moncho esteve et al 2018 stated that secondary flow motions are highly influenced by the geometry of waterway both by the sinuosity of the channel and by the cross sectional form the experiments were conducted in the present study in a low sinuous channel that resulted in reduced strength of secondary circulation cells as compared to the high sinuous channel further rozovskii 1961 stated that the fully developed secondary current cell can be observed at bend section having an angle of 220 leading to the fact of rare possibility in the development of secondary flow in a meandering channel muto and ishigaki 1999 reported that the behavior of the secondary circulation structures changes with increasing sinuosity from 1 09 to 1 59 for dr 0 15 in this study the experimental channel is having low sinuosity bend angle of 60 which reduced the strength of secondary circulation cells as compared to the high sinuous channel in high flow condition the maximum positive reynold s stresses occur at the interface of main channel and vegetated zone indicating that the shear becomes dominant and maximum along the inner bend apex of the main channel the reynold s stress obtained is maximum at top of the vegetation due to the shear layer and vertical vortex at the interface of vegetated and non vegetated areas similar observation is reported by afzalimehr et al 2021 the increase of reynold s stress is due to the negative pressure gradient in stream wise direction azevedo et al 2017 reported that the negative reynold s shear stress originates through the momentum transfer from the side wall into the mid of the main channel a study by jahra 2010 observes increase in spanwise reynold s stress with increases in vegetation density in terms of positive and negative along the two inner apex of the meandering wave in the present study for emergent condition dr 0 27 the reynold s shear stress also increase with increase of vegetation density kang and choi 2006 found the reynolds stress is zero along the vertical line and the values were negative and positive at the right hand side and left hand side of the line respectively this can also be expected from the lateral gradient of the mean streamwise velocity with increasing vegetation density the zero reynold s stress line deforms and travels to the right bank in high flow conditions the turbulent shear layer generates high tke values at upper layer of the inner bank whereas in the case of low flow conditions the maximum values of tke are at the outer wall zhang et al 2020 stated that the high value of tke was observed at the top of the vegetation due to the discontinuity of the drag force at that region resulting a high velocity gradient near the vegetation interface in submerged condition the turbulent kinetic energy shows a peak near the inner bank and the maximum value increases as the vegetation density increases note that a minimum tke occurs underneath the water surface in the main channel which is related to the velocity dip produced due to the secondary currents in the present study the interactions between flow and vegetation elements generated different patterns of turbulent structures for varying flow and vegetation densities for example the intensity of secondary circulations in main channel are observed to be lower when floodplain vegetation is under submerged condition this type of flow conditions may favor for fish habitat growth and survival trinci et al 2017 it is also noticed that the main channel tke and other turbulent parameters are relatively lower in channels with low sinuosity the ecologically relevant turbulent flow features are necessary to prevent the turbulence related hazards such as injury dislodgment and mortality of aquatic habitat trinci et al 2017 the orientation of flow structures can play a significant role on the behavior and energetics of fish lacey et al 2012 distinct species have different ecological reactions due to degree of environmental constraints imposed by river bends hydrodynamic and sediment transport patterns and changes in water quality the present study although not highlighted the vegetation sediment interactions but the vegetation has the positive impact in river corridor stabilization by promoting accretion processes further there existing a complex process response feedback mechanisms to seasonal variability in river corridor vegetation cover and its uprooting dynamics 5 conclusions in the present study an analysis of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of emergent and submerged flood plain vegetation on flow characteristics experimental observations of contour velocity distribution shear layer and momentum exchange between the main channel and floodplain have been presented for a low sinuous compound channel with varying floodplain vegetation densities and flow conditions the core velocities have been shown to depend on relative depth dr 0 27 and 0 43 and on floodplain vegetation in this paper aims to understand the main channel hydrodynamic structure and ecological health with the variation in flood plain vegetation densities in a low sinuous channel the following conclusions are drawn from the study in the high vegetation density i e 400 plants m2 scenario the flood plain vegetation enhanced the streamwise velocities along the bend apex resulting in a strong velocity gradient at the bend apex due to flow diversion from the floodplain to the main channel which increased main channel velocity by 23 compared to the no vegetation scenario the secondary current in the main channel was composed of an enhanced secondary cell which was aided by centrifugal force and a component from the floodplain upstream the strength of the main channel secondary circulations is less in low sinuous channels with increase in vegetation density however the magnitude of the secondary currents is increased with vegetation density in case of emergent and submerged conditions the shear layer is expanding towards the outer bank with increasing in vegetation density further the width of shear layer is decreasing with increasing of vegetation density and the closed thick intervals of shear layer is observed in maximum vegetation density for submerged condition the turbulence core region is maximum at the inner bank water surface and then observed to decrease towards the bed which may be due to velocity dip phenomena further this core region is deeper in the main channel which may be due to more surface area occupied by the higher density of vegetation compared to other vegetation configurations in the case of emergent condition the tke originates at the outer bank and spreads towards the inner bank the maximum tke values were observed at bottom of the outer bank this scenario is relatively different in submerged condition where tke originates at the top of the inner bank and migrate towards outer bank the findings showed the floodplain vegetation affects the reynold s shear stresses in the main channel producing strong reynold s shear stresses at a higher floodplain flow condition thus the floodplain vegetation shifts the flow structure into the main stream creates the more turbulence and alters the distribution of velocity profiles the present work can be further extended to study the influence of different channel and flood plain sinuosity with heterogeneous vegetation configurations the flow and turbulent processes in rivers will however be better analysed with detailed turbulence measurements at apex bend and cross over regions along the meander length with further improvement in understanding of flow river corridor vegetation interactions the riparian vegetation can be effectively managed in planning of river restoration schemes credit authorship

2206,fully distributed integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms have seen renewed interest due to availability of better software high performance computing facilities and high resolution spatially extensive data products isshms are valuable as tools for advancing system understanding as they can resolve multiple processes defined on the plot scale including three dimensional interaction of surface water and groundwater here we evaluated the performance of an isshm the advanced terrestrial simulator ats on seven diverse catchments across the continental us using widely available data products to define model inputs without calibration we compare the ats simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with gauge observations and modis derived evapotranspiration respectively using the kling gupta efficiency kge as metric ats with default data products performed reasonably well at 6 of 7 catchments for streamflow however in one of those 6 catchments ats had poor performance on baseflow and ats s overall performance was thus judged to be inadequate despite the acceptable kge ats performance for evapotranspiration was good in all 7 catchments using default data products in the two catchments where ats streamflow performance using default data products was not acceptable the performance was significantly improved by using local information on subsurface properties below the soil we also compare the model simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model a semi distributed model that was calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis uncalibrated ats performance is comparable to the calibrated sac sma model in terms of streamflow while ats performance is similar to or better much better in certain catchments in reproducing modis derived evapotranspiration reasonably good performance of ats without catchment specific calibration provides new confidence in the isshm

interact to control the emergent function of watersheds how climate and land use change impact the hydrological cycles and similar questions that require spatially resolved hydrologic states and fluxes and explicit representation of important surface and subsurface processes a challenging subset of that class of applications is associated with understanding the effects of externally imposed change like climate change wildfire and other disturbances and land use land cover change fleming and gupta 2020 data driven models struggle in extrapolations to future conditions where by definition data for training are not available similarly semi distributed models calibrated in current conditions are also plagued by uncertainties once they are employed outside the calibration range fatichi et al 2016 apart from representing the individual processes modeling feedbacks is crucial as many processes are interrelated and influence each other therefore representations of process feedbacks are necessary for improving our understanding as well as for projections e g ferguson and maxwell 2010 for questions about the effects of exogenous change it is advantageous to have models that take advantage of high fidelity representations of important hydrologic processes and maximize the use of spatially distributed a priori information which presumably reduce the need for calibration a subset of process based models includes the fully distributed models that are often called the integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms sebben et al 2013 paniconi and putti 2015 these models couple surface processes and three dimensional 3d or quasi 3d subsurface flow to address different hydrologic issues from plot to continental scales maxwell et al 2014 a handful of isshms has been developed in recent years such as the advanced terrestrial simulator ats painter et al 2016 coon et al 2019 2020 cast3m weill et al 2009 catchment hydrology cathy bixio et al 2002 camporese et al 2010 dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 geotop rigon et al 2006 endrizzi et al 2014 hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2015 hydrus 3d šimůnek et al 2008 inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 mike she abbott et al 1986

2009 and tribs ivanov et al 2004 2008 they are similar in terms of the surface and subsurface flow processes represented and show similar results in model benchmarking studies based on some simple scenarios but differ in their land surface representations discretization choices and solution strategies maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 the application of isshms had traditionally focused on single catchments e g ivanov et al 2004 maxwell et al 2007 kollet and maxwell 2008 dean et al 2016 mascaro et al 2015 camporese et al 2019 but regional to continental applications are now increasingly seen e g condon and maxwell 2015 maxwell et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 maxwell et al 2016 davison et al 2018 furusho percot et al 2019 ko et al 2019 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2021 the broader use of isshms has been limited by a variety of factors but progress has been made on many of these fronts leading fatichi et al 2016 to anticipate near future feasibility of process based models based only on a priori information isshms due to their high resolution typically have high computational expense clark et al 2017 this has been partially met with the availability of high performance computing resources and efficient and robust parallelization of the models kollet et al 2010 vivoni et al 2011 they have also been criticized for having minimal representation of sub grid variabilities beven and cloke 2012 and for neglecting preferential flow and over emphasizing capillarity beven and germann 1982 2013 however process based models accounting for preferential subsurface flow e g šimůnek et al 2008 are available as are models for the effects of subgrid microtopography on surface flow e g jan et al 2018 isshms have been criticized for being difficult to use emerging workflow tools coon and shuai 2022 that streamline the construction of distributed models offer significant improvements more fundamentally high resolution process based models have been criticized for being over parameterized and prone to parameter equifinality beven 2001 and for producing an unreasonably wide range of simulated responses mcdonnell et al 2007 however process based models are in principle less reliant on calibration when they take good advantage of spatially extensive observed and remote sensing based data products the increasing availability such data products are contributing to the advancement of high resolution hydrological modeling beven 2019 singh 2018 spatially extensive products are derived from indirect information and come with significant uncertainty making it necessary to exercise caution in using global scale or continental scale data products in watershed scale models for example modelled hydraulic head was changed substantially upon a slight change in the global scale global hydrogeology maps glhymps based hydraulic conductivity data reinecke et al 2019 uncertain meteorological forcing data too can lead to simulation errors beven and westerberg 2011 mcmillan et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2013 weiland et al 2015 this raises the fundamental question motivating this work have the process representations in isshms and the quality of spatially explicit high resolution community data products needed to support them reached a point where isshms are capable of making reasonably accurate predictions without calibration here we evaluate the performance of an isshm the advanced terrestrial simulator ats coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 in simulating evapotranspiration and streamflow across a diverse collection of catchments with varying land cover climate and physiography using only community data products without catchment specific calibration ats is a highly parallel spatially resolved integrated surface subsurface flow and transport processes simulator multiple physical processes are included in ats to operate at the high spatial 100 m and temporal resolution sub daily painter et al 2016 coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 various surface groundwater and permafrost hydrology problems are addressed through ats over the years sjöberg et al 2016 2021 jafarov et al 2018 jan et al 2018 2021 coon et al 2020 rathore et al 2021 computational efficiency for high resolution modeling is achieved in ats by using unstructured triangulated irregular network tin based meshes coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 that allow hydrologically important areas streams and neighboring areas to have higher resolution than the other areas although all evaluations are somewhat specific to the simulator and workflow processes used ats has many similarities to other isshms and produces consistent results in community benchmarks that did not consider land surface processes kollet et al 2017 so this evaluation is relevant to the isshm class of models in general to address the fundamental question we select multiple catchments from the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels archives addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 we evaluate the uncalibrated ats model performance against the observed streamflow and modis derived evapotranspiration in catchments that cover semi arid to humid climate snowmelt to rainfall dominated with different elevation gradients and different soil and land cover types in this process we build model inputs using high resolution data on meteorological forcing vegetation land cover topography soil thickness and properties and underlying geology from a variety of sources for the purpose of assessing the potential performance of uncalibrated isshms relative to commonly used calibrated models with simpler process representations we also compare the uncalibrated ats model performance for streamflow and evapotranspiration against the semi distributed sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model which was previously calibrated to streamflow on a catchment by catchment basis newman et al 2015 addor et al 2017 we chose the sac sma model for this comparison because it is broadly representative of semi distributed hydrology models and because in general it outperforms other models in the camels archives previous studies reporting isshm evaluations at a single catchment have focused on streamflow butts et al 2004 ivanov et al 2004 kollet and maxwell 2008 qu and duffy 2007 kollet and maxwell 2008 shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 shi et al 2013 boubacar et al 2020 frey et al 2021 groundwater table depths erler et al 2019 or soil moisture ivanov et al 2008 shi et al 2013 ko et al 2019 with varying degrees of calibration a subcontinental scale study compared streamflow simulated with parflow coupled to the community land model clm to observations from multiple catchments taken together maxwell et al 2015 but did not undertake evaluation against observations on a catchment by catchment basis recently o neill et al 2021 undertook further evaluation of parflow clm against observations from many catchments they extracted results from maxwell et al 2015 and used multiple metrics to evaluate parflow clm performance for streamflow evapotranspiration and other outputs o neill et al 2021 parflow clm configured to most of the conterminous us pfconusv1 performed reasonably well on multiple metrics on large basins that study focused on large basins and used a spatial resolution that was too coarse to provide meaningful evaluations for smaller basins such comparisons are important in that they provide evaluations of the entire model data workflow system including the underlying process representations data inputs and the assumptions and workflows required to convert community data products into model inputs our objectives are broadly similar to the pfconusv1 evaluations of o neill et al 2021 to evaluate the reliability of continental scale data products as inputs to isshms test the assumptions and workflow processes used to convert those data products into model inputs and identify potential gaps in the community data products that must be filled with local information our evaluations and the pfconusv1 evaluations share many but not all of the same data inputs but are for different simulators workflows and modeled resolutions this study is different from o neill et al 2021 in that we focus on smaller catchments that require higher spatial resolution both horizontally and vertically and on exploring potential causes of poor performance when it occurs 2 study area we selected 7 different catchments across the conus fig 1 table 1 in this study the catchments represent diverse physiographical as well as climatological settings fig 1 table 1 for example the climate in taylor river upstream catchment is characterized by cold summers and is dominated by snowmelt while most of the other catchments are characterized as temperate no dry season and hot summer type climate based on köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 annual mean precipitation rates also vary across the catchments with the lowest values in taylor river upstream 696 mm yr and the highest values in little tennessee river panther creek and neversink river headwaters catchments 1700 mm yr as a function of climate evapotranspiration rates also vary across the catchments table 1 in terms of land cover characteristics the catchments also differ taylor upstream and panther creek are mostly evergreen forest little tennessee and mayo river are mixtures of deciduous forest and grassland pastureland and the remaining catchments are mostly deciduous forest supplementary fig 1 table 1 the catchments are also distinct in terms of elevation and topography fig 2 for example the elevation is 3000 m in most of the taylor river upstream catchment and varies significantly from 2844 to 4143 m whereas elevation in the panther creek is 100 m fig 2 the catchments are mostly covered by forests for example deciduous and mixed forests dominate in five of the seven catchments supplementary fig 1 soil thickness varies from 0 to 3 m in the catchments supplementary fig 2 soil porosity and permeability vary across and within the catchments supplementary figs 3 and 4 as does porosity and permeabilities below the soil supplementary figs 5 and 6 the catchments are also diverse in terms of depth to bedrock values supplementary fig 7 the catchments are mostly characterized as the headwater catchments with minimal human influence that includes minimal changes in land cover by human activities and minimal human water withdrawal newman et al 2015 none of the catchments are dominated by agriculture supplementary fig 1 3 data and methods 3 1 model description simulations with the advanced terrestrial simulator ats were carried out solving 3d models of water conservation in the subsurface surface snowpack and canopy in the configuration described in coon et al 2020 and tested in kollet et al 2017 integrated surface subsurface hydrology includes a 3d richards equation solution in the subsurface coupled through continuous pressure and flux conditions to a diffusion wave equation approximating overland flow on the surface in addition simple ordinary differential equation bucket models for snow and canopy water are solved providing sources and sinks as described below these and other evapotranspiration processes are implemented using the arcos multiphysics framework coon et al 2016 in which individual source terms are implemented through composable model evaluators these equations are implemented and solved using the amanzi infrastructure which includes a mesh library for unstructured meshes data structures solvers and discretization schemes moulton et al 2012 and is itself built on a wide variety of third party libraries including the trilinos library heroux et al 2003 for parallel data structures the resulting system of equations are solved in parallel on the national energy research scientific computing center nersc machine cori while the surface and subsurface equations for water conservation are as described in coon et al 2020 ats also implements a simplified aboveground land surface processes model that includes a simple bucket model for snow interception accumulation sublimation and melt canopy processes including interception and transpiration and bare ground evaporation these equations are based on a one layer radiation balance and a priestley taylor model for potential evaporation this model has been based on individual components from several other models including prms markstrom et al 2008 2015 fisher and koven 2020 and the community land model oleson et al 2013 and is described in detail in the appendix the processes modelled here are shown in fig 3 3 2 model input datasets data from different federal and state government agencies are used to set up and validate the model performance in this study table 2 daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation incoming solar radiation vapor pressure snow water equivalent and day length data at 1 1 km2 spatial resolution are retrieved from the daymet repository thornton et al 2020 multiple other datasets used to set up the model are described in table 2 more details on these individual datasets can be found in coon and shuai 2022 preparation of computer readable input files is a challenging task keeping in mind various datasets are used in this approach the watershed workflow tool makes this exercise easy and fast in a semi automated way coon and shuai 2022 it is an open source tool available at https github com environmental modeling workflows watershed workflow it is based on python3 and uses multiple open source libraries to automate model setup starting from data discovery to mesh generation watershed workflow leverages jupyter notebooks to process the data and display the results in an interactive way this enables reproducibility of the workflows for future runs it automatically downloads the required data based on user specified shapefile or the hydrologic unit codes huc the workflow is designed in such a way that user can also customize their requirements and provide their own input data to create the computer readable ats input files watershed boundary and hydrography dataset are retrieved from usgs s watershed boundary dataset wbd and national hydrography dataset nhd plus high resolution nhdplus hr simley and carswell 2009 a variable resolution mesh with higher resolution near the mapped streams is then generated meteorological forcing datasets are also compiled and a final input file is generated in hdf5 format representing the surface and subsurface structures from the available dataset and mapping them to individual pixels in this approach is a challenging task the nrcs based soil survey geographic database ssurgo data was incorporated first to represent the soil layer soil survey staff 2021 data for a geologic layer that extends from the soil layer to the bedrock layer lower boundary was represented using the glhymps data product huscroft et al 2018 the depth to bedrock data from soilgrids was used to determine the thickness of the geologic layer and that marked the boundary between the geologic layer and the bedrock hengl et al 2009 mantel and kempen 2017 all these surface and subsurface data are then mapped to individual computational cells in the generated variable resolution

strategies model evaluation is performed by comparing to both streamflow and total evapotranspiration daily continuous streamflow data are used from 1981 to 2014 from the usgs archive https waterdata usgs gov last accessed on january 5 2022 we used the 8 day averaged gap filled mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration data from the modis archive modis evapotranspiration product is derived through a model following the penman monteith equation using the reanalysis based meteorological data and modis derived albedo biome type and leaf area index data running et al 2019 the total evapotranspiration is a combination of evaporations from soil and wet canopy and transpiration from plant running et al 2019 it is important to note that since the modis evapotranspiration product is model based using it to evaluate performance of an isshm is less stringent than using more direct evapotranspiration observations nevertheless the modis evapotranspiration model has been extensively validated against ground truth data running et al 2019 and ats s evapotranspiration representation is based on a different model so comparison to modis evapotranspiration is still a useful exercise kling gupta efficiency kge is a metric for estimating the model performance gupta et al 2009 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where σ and μ represents standard deviation and mean respectively r is the correlation coefficient based on the equation the kge score becomes 1 2 0 41 when the mean of observation is used as a predictor knoben et al 2019 to simplify the interpretation of the metric we use a modified kge mkge score where the mkge score of 0 has the same explanatory power as the mean value of the observation and a score of 1 indicates a perfect match analogous to the nash sutcliffe negative mkge values indicate the simulation performance is worse than using the mean value of the observation as a predictor variable which can be regarded as a catastrophic failure of a model the mkge score is 2 mkge k g e 2 1 2 3 3 1 sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model to compare the uncalibrated ats output with the calibrated sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model

discussions 4 1 streamflow comparison fig 4 shows the estimated mkge scores for streamflow across the catchments black bars are for ats with default settings and using community data products without modification blue bars are for the sac sma model calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis in general ats simulated streamflow compares well mkge 0 65 with the gauge data at 6 of the 7 studied catchments fig 4 using only the community data products mkge scores are found to be higher than 0 80 indicating excellent model performance in three catchments little tennessee river mayo river and flat brook catchments in fig 4 fig 5 shows the time series and scatter plots of uncalibrated ats simulated and gauge streamflow data for the little tennessee river mayo river and taylor river upstream catchments the scatter plots approximately follow the 1 1 line for the little tennessee river and mayo river catchments and both peak flow and baseflow are matched reasonably well the scatter plot for the taylor river upstream catchment has a slope somewhat less than 1 1 and peak flow is systematically underestimated although not dramatically performance as measured by the mkge was poor in one catchment cossatot river using default values the mkge score was good in the neversink river headwaters but as will be discussed in section 4 3 baseflow performance was poor the cossatot river and neversink river headwaters catchments are discussed in more detail in section 4 3 estimated mkge scores based on the 8 day averaged ats simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration data across the catchments are shown in fig 6 ats simulated evapotranspiration performs well mkge 0 7 on comparing the 8 day average evapotranspiration from modis in all the studied catchments fig 6 the mkge for ats simulated evapotranspiration is 0 8 in 5 of the 7 studied catchments fig 6 the daily time series and the scatter plots show a good agreement between ats simulated 8 day averaged evapotranspiration with the 8 day averaged modis data ats performance was good in different years as it matches both pattern as well as the magnitude figs 7 9 and supplementary fig 9 in taylor upstream catchment a summer time dip in modis evapotranspiration is apparent but not represented by ats fig 7a which causes the top half of the scatter plot to have relatively lower modis evapotranspiration values it is unclear whether this summer time dip in the modis data is real but it is consistent with stomatal closure linked to high vapor pressure deficit during summertime leading to lowering of transpiration in the modis algorithm running et al 2019 in general the trend lines in the scatter plots closely follow the 1 1 lines fig 7d f and supplementary fig 9 4 2 streamflow and evapotranspiration comparisons with the calibrated sac sma model output the sac sma model was calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis for streamflow and the calibration parameters differ across the catchments as a result sac sma streamflow outputs perform well compared with the gage streamflow figs 4 and 5 in terms of evapotranspiration ats s uncalibrated performance is similar to the sac sma calibrated performance for 6 of the 7 catchments figs 6 and 7 moreover ats performs much better than the sac sma in the low precipitation snowmelt dominated catchment taylor river upstream figs 6 and 7a streamflow only calibration of sac sma model simulation resulted in it matching the gage streamflow well however the sac sma evapotranspiration simulation was erratic fig 7a and inconsistent with observed seasonal patterns 4 3 model performance comparison upon using catchment specific input data using catchment specific input data is the initial step for improving model performance this is not the same as calibration as it does not involve adjusting model input to match a particular output but rather the use of catchment specific information on model inputs when that information conflicts with the community conus scale data products here we consider in detail the poor ats performance at the cossatot river catchment when default inputs were used the catchment is in the ouchita mountains and is characterized by thin soils above mostly sedimentary rocks that occasional express in outcrops at the surface miser and purdue 1929 ericksen et al 1983 mast and turk 1999 however the global scale depth to bedrock data product shows a depth estimate in the range of 15 33 m across the catchment supplementary figure 7 unrealistic depth to bedrock data is a potential reason for poor performance on the cossatot river catchment when the community data products are used fig 4 as the additional water storage would attenuate the peak flow and enhance baseflow based on the geologic information available we thus consider an alternative conceptual model with bedrock directly below the soil surface and use that in a new ats run ats adjusted results are compared to the original ats simulations in fig 8 the ats adjusted simulation is flashy and consistent with the gauge data with higher and shorter duration peaks and lower baseflow than the original ats simulation performance of ats is greatly improved in terms of both patterns and magnitude of streamflow with a mkge value of 0 77 figs 4 and 8a c for the ats adjusted case ats performance also improved in terms of evapotranspiration with a mkge value of 0 83 fig 8d f for the neversink river headwaters ats simulated baseflow was low which might be attributed to uncertain geologic layer properties and comparatively shallow depth to bedrock at the streambed channels in this catchment the geologic layer hydrologic properties from global scale glhymps data show similar values to the bedrock properties porosity 5 and permeability 1 10 16 m2 used supplementary figs 5 and 6 as a result the bedrock layer is effectively just below the soil layer based on the glhymps data a new model run was set up by extending the soil hydrologic properties down to the bedrock layer avoiding the geologic layer properties to evaluate changes in model performance we attempted to address the depth to bedrock data issue with the help of the seismology inferred depth to bedrock data from the usgs briggs et al 2020 supplementary fig 10 indicates much lower depth to bedrock occurrence in the southern part of the catchment in the soilgrids data on comparing with the geophysical estimates we modified the depth to bedrock data at the streambed channels by hand using the observed data from usgs supplementary figure 11 precipitation biases can be another data issue that might leading to uncertain model output precipitation biases are particularly prominent in smaller irregular shaped and mountainous catchments to show the water budget closures we computed the percentage deviation of the annual water budget from the precipitation data the evapotranspiration modis and streamflow gage observations data are subtracted from the precipitation data to compute the water budget closures the data show large variations over the years across the catchments supplementary figure 12 although we have not included change in storage in this analysis water budget deviation values 10 or 10 might indicate the precipitation bias related issue water budget closures indicate a median value of 8 5 at neversink river headwaters catchment supplementary figure 12 in the new ats run ats adjusted we used 10 increased precipitation rates the simulated near zero baseflow value in the original run has improved in the ats adjusted run and is comparable to the stream gage observations fig 9a c the mkge value increased from 0 65 in the default run to 0 69 in the ats adjusted run for daily streamflow simulation evapotranspiration time series does not show any significant change in these two runs fig 9d f these examples show that the model performance and simulation statistics depend on the catchment specific data availability that is crucial for improving the model estimates model users need to be cautious while using the regional scale data in modeling approaches and use their own judgement to improve the model performance 4 4 snow water equivalent comparison one of the seven sites taylor upstream is a snow dominated watershed in this watershed ats simulated snow water equivalent swe data is compared with snopack telemetry snotel https www cbrfc noaa gov snow accessed on september 28 2022 data ats performs reasonably well mkge 0 94 comparing the swe data from the single available site upper taylor uptc2 at 38 9830n and 106 7500w within the taylor upstream catchment fig 10 in general ats swe is in good agreement with snotel data in terms of both magnitude and snowmelt timing except for the 2018 water year when ats underpredicts the snowpack size here ats swe output was selected for the single grid cell where the snotel station is located comparisons between the point scale snotel data and the basin scale output of the semi distributed sac swe model are not meaningful but it is useful to compare basin scale swe outputs of ats and sac sma supplementary figure 15 basin scale swe dynamics from sac sma and ats have similar seasonal patterns but the peak swe is much higher for sac sma those large differences in the context of ats s far superior performance on et and good agreement with the point level snotel data provide further evidence that the highly calibrated sac sma model may be arriving at a good streamflow result for the wrong reasons 5 conclusions using only a priori information from community data products to define model inputs we evaluated the performance of a fully distributed integrated surface subsurface hydrological model ats for streamflow and evapotranspiration simulation in seven diverse catchments because ats is generally representative of isshms in terms of the processes represented the results of this study are relevant to fully resolved isshm modeling more broadly in general ats simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration agree reasonably well with observedstreamflow and modis derived evapotranspiration without catchment specific calibration although community data products had to be refined by catchment specific geologic information in 2 of the 7 catchments the sac sma model is representative of the broad class of semi distributed hydrologic models that require catchment specific calibration unsurprisingly the calibrated sac sma shows good performance on the quantity for which it is calibrated namely streamflow however evapotranspiration in that model does not match seasonal patterns and the mkge is negative for the taylor river upstream catchment indicating a catastrophic failure of the sac sma model for evapotranspiration on that catchment this is a good illustration of the dangers of highly calibrated models where parameter calibration in an overly simplified model structure can reach a good answer for the wrong reasons creating significant uncertainty in extrapolation in particular catchment specific calibration can lead to overfitting and caution is warranted in studies that require extrapolation to different climate and land use conditions that catchment specific calibration was not required for good ats performance suggests that spatially explicit representation of overland and subsurface lateral flows and other important hydrologic processes the distinguishing characteristic of isshms has significant potential to reduce the need for calibration of course explicit process representations require sufficiently high spatial resolution for the mesh and data inputs which leads to higher computational cost and significantly greater data demands compared with semi distributed models fortunately spatially extensive data products for most input parameters are now available across the conus and for some parameters globally our results suggest that those products are approaching a level of maturity where they can support more routine deployment of isshms however refinement of subsurface properties using information on local geology was required for two of the studied catchments that result indicates subsurface properties below mapped soil layers that is in deep soils sediments and in weathered fractured bedrock are still uncertain and would be good target for refinement in future community data products in addition workflow tools that make it easier to augment community data with local information would be highly advantageous despite those caveats the results shown here provide new confidence in the physics based isshm class of models and the corresponding collection of community data products as tools for advancing our fundamental understanding of

taken to be 0 25 the lai is the leaf area index m 2 leaf area m 2 land surface area p rain and p snow m s are the rain and snow precipitation respectively θ sat is the total leaf saturated water content which is given as a product of the leaf area index and the specific leaf saturated water content m water m 2 leaf area which is a parameter specific to the vegetation type finally τ s is a timescale describing how quickly excess water drains from the canopy and is frequently chosen to be 864s or 1 100th of a day effectively this is simply chosen to be fast compared to the timescale of interest this portion of the aboveground model is based on that of the community land model v4 5 next potential evaporation and transpiration are prescribed using a variant of the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as described in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms iv markstrom et al 2015 and modified for systems which directly include a canopy as described in fisher and koven 2020 finally appropriate limiters or downregulation terms are based on that of the community land model v4 5 to limit these potential quantities based on water availability the resulting model is described below e canopy f wet α canopy l e δ δ γ e r canopy e snow a snow α snow l s δ δ γ s r snow g snow e ground 1 a snow f ground α soil l e δ δ γ e r ground g ground t pot 1 f wet α

short versus long specific outgoing longwave terms are given via the stefan boltzmann law λ i lw e i σ t i 4 where the emissivity e is dependent upon land cover type and whether the surface is inundated or not σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and t is the temperature of the surface where the canopy leaf temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature and the ground temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature one day prior to the current time as is commonly used in prms iv evapotranspiration downregulation and distribution finally the above terms form a potential evaporation or transpiration these must be limited when there is not water available or because other considerations interfere for instance canopy evaporation and transpiration may only take place on the fraction of leaf area that are wet and dry respectively the fraction of wet leaf area is given by f wet m i n θ canopy θ sat 1 when the ground surface is dry a desiccated zone may form limiting evaporation due to the need to diffuse vapor from the vadose zone through the desiccated zone and out to the open air based on the approach by sakaguchi and zeng 2009 a soil s resistance to evaporation is parameterized through f soil 1 if p o n d e d d e p t h 0 1 1 s r v p d otherwise sr d z e x p s g 5 1 e 1 vpd 2 2 10 5 ϕ 2 1 s res 5 where the soil resistance term sr is written as a function of the dessicated zone thickness dz m and the gas saturation s g and the vapor pressure diffusion term vpd is written as a function of soil porosity ϕ and the residual saturation s res this model ensures that as mafic potential drops and the liquid water saturation approaches residual saturation the evaporative flux approaches zero and the model can converge like evaporation transpiration must be downregulated when there is insufficient water for the plant to move that water to the leaf stomates and distributed from the potential flux calculated in the canopy to the distributed depth based flux in the rooting zone these processes are represented as in clm 4 5 oleson et al 2013 note that units must change to distribute with depth potential transpiration is in units of m s or m 3 h 2 o per m 2 land surface area per s but transpiration is in units of 1 s or m 3 h 2 o per m 3 soil volume per s t z t pot f root f ψ 2 z s f root f ψ d z f root z α r e α r z β r e β r z 2 f ψ ψ z 1 if ψ ψ closed ψ ψ open ψ closed ψ open otherwise 0 if ψ ψ open in this equation transpiration is distributed by the rooting fraction f root which integrates to 1 and describes the fraction of a plant s roots as a function of depth as a sum of two exponentials with land cover type specific parameters α r and β r furthermore the plant takes water wherever it is available as enabled by a limiter based on the mafic potential ψ which is solved for by the subsurface richards equation this limiter is based on two more parameters the mafic potential at which stomates are fully open and fully closed ψ open and ψ closed respectively which may be a function of land cover type snow melt finally it remains to specify quantities using in the snow model including snow covered area and snowmelt to close the water balances described in the above sections the area of snow covered ground is given by a simple linear transition between fully covered and bare a snow max 1 θ snow 0 02 snowmelt is prescribed through an empirical equation provided in prms iv markstrom et al 2015 which acknowledges that snow typically is a few degrees cooler than the air temperature sm max k melt t

2206,fully distributed integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms have seen renewed interest due to availability of better software high performance computing facilities and high resolution spatially extensive data products isshms are valuable as tools for advancing system understanding as they can resolve multiple processes defined on the plot scale including three dimensional interaction of surface water and groundwater here we evaluated the performance of an isshm the advanced terrestrial simulator ats on seven diverse catchments across the continental us using widely available data products to define model inputs without calibration we compare the ats simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with gauge observations and modis derived evapotranspiration respectively using the kling gupta efficiency kge as metric ats with default data products performed reasonably well at 6 of 7 catchments for streamflow however in one of those 6 catchments ats had poor performance on baseflow and ats s overall performance was thus judged to be inadequate despite the acceptable kge ats performance for evapotranspiration was good in all 7 catchments using default data products in the two catchments where ats streamflow performance using default data products was not acceptable the performance was significantly improved by using local information on subsurface properties below the soil we also compare the model simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model a semi distributed model that was calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis uncalibrated ats performance is comparable to the calibrated sac sma model in terms of streamflow while ats performance is similar to or better much better in certain catchments in reproducing modis derived evapotranspiration reasonably good performance of ats without catchment specific calibration provides new confidence in the isshm class of models and community data products as tools for advancing understanding of watershed function in a changing environment keywords integrated hydrological models catchment hydrology model evaluation data availability model inputs and model generated data produced in this study are available online from https data ess dive lbl gov datasets doi 10 15485 1872248 1 introduction hydrologic models span a continuum from purely data driven models to semi distributed models that require catchment scale calibration through to distributed process based models that are as physically based as reasonably achievable e g clark et al 2017 that continuum of process complexity reflects the diversity of applications data driven models based on statistical approaches or machine learning are appealing for short term forecasting of integrated quantities like streamflow fleming and gupta 2020 distributed process based models are conversely naturally suited for numerical experiments that advance our fundamental understanding of the hydrologic system distributed process based models are valuable tools for advancing understanding of how landscape heterogeneity and plot scale processes interact to control the emergent function of watersheds how climate and land use change impact the hydrological cycles and similar questions that require spatially resolved hydrologic states and fluxes and explicit representation of important surface and subsurface processes a challenging subset of that class of applications is associated with understanding the effects of externally imposed change like climate change wildfire and other disturbances and land use land cover change fleming and gupta 2020 data driven models struggle in extrapolations to future conditions where by definition data for training are not available similarly semi distributed models calibrated in current conditions are also plagued by uncertainties once they are employed outside the calibration range fatichi et al 2016 apart from representing the individual processes modeling feedbacks is crucial as many processes are interrelated and influence each other therefore representations of process feedbacks are necessary for improving our understanding as well as for projections e g ferguson and maxwell 2010 for questions about the effects of exogenous change it is advantageous to have models that take advantage of high fidelity representations of important hydrologic processes and maximize the use of spatially distributed a priori information which presumably reduce the need for calibration a subset of process based models includes the fully distributed models that are often called the integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshms sebben et al 2013 paniconi and putti 2015 these models couple surface processes and three dimensional 3d or quasi 3d subsurface flow to address different hydrologic issues from plot to continental scales maxwell et al 2014 a handful of isshms has been developed in recent years such as the advanced terrestrial simulator ats painter et al 2016 coon et al 2019 2020 cast3m weill et al 2009 catchment hydrology cathy bixio et al 2002 camporese et al 2010 dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 geotop rigon et al 2006 endrizzi et al 2014 hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty 2015 hydrus 3d šimůnek et al 2008 inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 mike she abbott et al 1986 butts et al 2004 opengeosys delfs et al 2009 delfs et al 2012 parflow jones and woodward 2001 kollet and maxwell 2006 paws shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 pihm qu and duffy 2007 kumar et al 2009 and tribs ivanov et al 2004 2008 they are similar in terms of the surface and subsurface flow processes represented and show similar results in model benchmarking studies based on some simple scenarios but differ in their land surface representations discretization choices and solution strategies maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 the application of isshms had traditionally focused on single catchments e g ivanov et al 2004 maxwell et al 2007 kollet and maxwell 2008 dean et al 2016 mascaro et al 2015 camporese et al 2019 but regional to continental applications are now increasingly seen e g condon and maxwell 2015 maxwell et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 maxwell et al 2016 davison et al 2018 furusho percot et al 2019 ko et al 2019 chen et al 2020 xu et al 2021 the broader use of isshms has been limited by a variety of factors but progress has been made on many of these fronts leading fatichi et al 2016 to anticipate near future feasibility of process based models based only on a priori information isshms due to their high resolution typically have high computational expense clark et al 2017 this has been partially met with the availability of high performance computing resources and efficient and robust parallelization of the models kollet et al 2010 vivoni et al 2011 they have also been criticized for having minimal representation of sub grid variabilities beven and cloke 2012 and for neglecting preferential flow and over emphasizing capillarity beven and germann 1982 2013 however process based models accounting for preferential subsurface flow e g šimůnek et al 2008 are available as are models for the effects of subgrid microtopography on surface flow e g jan et al 2018 isshms have been criticized for being difficult to use emerging workflow tools coon and shuai 2022 that streamline the construction of distributed models offer significant improvements more fundamentally high resolution process based models have been criticized for being over parameterized and prone to parameter equifinality beven 2001 and for producing an unreasonably wide range of simulated responses mcdonnell et al 2007 however process based models are in principle less reliant on calibration when they take good advantage of spatially extensive observed and remote sensing based data products the increasing availability such data products are contributing to the advancement of high resolution hydrological modeling beven 2019 singh 2018 spatially extensive products are derived from indirect information and come with significant uncertainty making it necessary to exercise caution in using global scale or continental scale data products in watershed scale models for example modelled hydraulic head was changed substantially upon a slight change in the global scale global hydrogeology maps glhymps based hydraulic conductivity data reinecke et al 2019 uncertain meteorological forcing data too can lead to simulation errors beven and westerberg 2011 mcmillan et al 2012 kauffeldt et al 2013 weiland et al 2015 this raises the fundamental question motivating this work have the process representations in isshms and the quality of spatially explicit high resolution community data products needed to support them reached a point where isshms are capable of making reasonably accurate predictions without calibration here we evaluate the performance of an isshm the advanced terrestrial simulator ats coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 in simulating evapotranspiration and streamflow across a diverse collection of catchments with varying land cover climate and physiography using only community data products without catchment specific calibration ats is a highly parallel spatially resolved integrated surface subsurface flow and transport processes simulator multiple physical processes are included in ats to operate at the high spatial 100 m and temporal resolution sub daily painter et al 2016 coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 various surface groundwater and permafrost hydrology problems are addressed through ats over the years sjöberg et al 2016 2021 jafarov et al 2018 jan et al 2018 2021 coon et al 2020 rathore et al 2021 computational efficiency for high resolution modeling is achieved in ats by using unstructured triangulated irregular network tin based meshes coon et al 2019 coon et al 2020 that allow hydrologically important areas streams and neighboring areas to have higher resolution than the other areas although all evaluations are somewhat specific to the simulator and workflow processes used ats has many similarities to other isshms and produces consistent results in community benchmarks that did not consider land surface processes kollet et al 2017 so this evaluation is relevant to the isshm class of models in general to address the fundamental question we select multiple catchments from the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels archives addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 we evaluate the uncalibrated ats model performance against the observed streamflow and modis derived evapotranspiration in catchments that cover semi arid to humid climate snowmelt to rainfall dominated with different elevation gradients and different soil and land cover types in this process we build model inputs using high resolution data on meteorological forcing vegetation land cover topography soil thickness and properties and underlying geology from a variety of sources for the purpose of assessing the potential performance of uncalibrated isshms relative to commonly used calibrated models with simpler process representations we also compare the uncalibrated ats model performance for streamflow and evapotranspiration against the semi distributed sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model which was previously calibrated to streamflow on a catchment by catchment basis newman et al 2015 addor et al 2017 we chose the sac sma model for this comparison because it is broadly representative of semi distributed hydrology models and because in general it outperforms other models in the camels archives previous studies reporting isshm evaluations at a single catchment have focused on streamflow butts et al 2004 ivanov et al 2004 kollet and maxwell 2008 qu and duffy 2007 kollet and maxwell 2008 shen and phanikumar 2010 shen et al 2013 shi et al 2013 boubacar et al 2020 frey et al 2021 groundwater table depths erler et al 2019 or soil moisture ivanov et al 2008 shi et al 2013 ko et al 2019 with varying degrees of calibration a subcontinental scale study compared streamflow simulated with parflow coupled to the community land model clm to observations from multiple catchments taken together maxwell et al 2015 but did not undertake evaluation against observations on a catchment by catchment basis recently o neill et al 2021 undertook further evaluation of parflow clm against observations from many catchments they extracted results from maxwell et al 2015 and used multiple metrics to evaluate parflow clm performance for streamflow evapotranspiration and other outputs o neill et al 2021 parflow clm configured to most of the conterminous us pfconusv1 performed reasonably well on multiple metrics on large basins that study focused on large basins and used a spatial resolution that was too coarse to provide meaningful evaluations for smaller basins such comparisons are important in that they provide evaluations of the entire model data workflow system including the underlying process representations data inputs and the assumptions and workflows required to convert community data products into model inputs our objectives are broadly similar to the pfconusv1 evaluations of o neill et al 2021 to evaluate the reliability of continental scale data products as inputs to isshms test the assumptions and workflow processes used to convert those data products into model inputs and identify potential gaps in the community data products that must be filled with local information our evaluations and the pfconusv1 evaluations share many but not all of the same data inputs but are for different simulators workflows and modeled resolutions this study is different from o neill et al 2021 in that we focus on smaller catchments that require higher spatial resolution both horizontally and vertically and on exploring potential causes of poor performance when it occurs 2 study area we selected 7 different catchments across the conus fig 1 table 1 in this study the catchments represent diverse physiographical as well as climatological settings fig 1 table 1 for example the climate in taylor river upstream catchment is characterized by cold summers and is dominated by snowmelt while most of the other catchments are characterized as temperate no dry season and hot summer type climate based on köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 annual mean precipitation rates also vary across the catchments with the lowest values in taylor river upstream 696 mm yr and the highest values in little tennessee river panther creek and neversink river headwaters catchments 1700 mm yr as a function of climate evapotranspiration rates also vary across the catchments table 1 in terms of land cover characteristics the catchments also differ taylor upstream and panther creek are mostly evergreen forest little tennessee and mayo river are mixtures of deciduous forest and grassland pastureland and the remaining catchments are mostly deciduous forest supplementary fig 1 table 1 the catchments are also distinct in terms of elevation and topography fig 2 for example the elevation is 3000 m in most of the taylor river upstream catchment and varies significantly from 2844 to 4143 m whereas elevation in the panther creek is 100 m fig 2 the catchments are mostly covered by forests for example deciduous and mixed forests dominate in five of the seven catchments supplementary fig 1 soil thickness varies from 0 to 3 m in the catchments supplementary fig 2 soil porosity and permeability vary across and within the catchments supplementary figs 3 and 4 as does porosity and permeabilities below the soil supplementary figs 5 and 6 the catchments are also diverse in terms of depth to bedrock values supplementary fig 7 the catchments are mostly characterized as the headwater catchments with minimal human influence that includes minimal changes in land cover by human activities and minimal human water withdrawal newman et al 2015 none of the catchments are dominated by agriculture supplementary fig 1 3 data and methods 3 1 model description simulations with the advanced terrestrial simulator ats were carried out solving 3d models of water conservation in the subsurface surface snowpack and canopy in the configuration described in coon et al 2020 and tested in kollet et al 2017 integrated surface subsurface hydrology includes a 3d richards equation solution in the subsurface coupled through continuous pressure and flux conditions to a diffusion wave equation approximating overland flow on the surface in addition simple ordinary differential equation bucket models for snow and canopy water are solved providing sources and sinks as described below these and other evapotranspiration processes are implemented using the arcos multiphysics framework coon et al 2016 in which individual source terms are implemented through composable model evaluators these equations are implemented and solved using the amanzi infrastructure which includes a mesh library for unstructured meshes data structures solvers and discretization schemes moulton et al 2012 and is itself built on a wide variety of third party libraries including the trilinos library heroux et al 2003 for parallel data structures the resulting system of equations are solved in parallel on the national energy research scientific computing center nersc machine cori while the surface and subsurface equations for water conservation are as described in coon et al 2020 ats also implements a simplified aboveground land surface processes model that includes a simple bucket model for snow interception accumulation sublimation and melt canopy processes including interception and transpiration and bare ground evaporation these equations are based on a one layer radiation balance and a priestley taylor model for potential evaporation this model has been based on individual components from several other models including prms markstrom et al 2008 2015 fisher and koven 2020 and the community land model oleson et al 2013 and is described in detail in the appendix the processes modelled here are shown in fig 3 3 2 model input datasets data from different federal and state government agencies are used to set up and validate the model performance in this study table 2 daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation incoming solar radiation vapor pressure snow water equivalent

these individual datasets can be found in coon and shuai 2022 preparation of computer readable input files is a challenging task keeping in mind various datasets are used in this approach the watershed workflow tool makes this exercise easy and fast in a semi automated way coon and shuai 2022 it is an open source tool available at https github com environmental modeling workflows watershed workflow it is based on python3 and uses multiple open source libraries to automate model setup starting from data discovery to mesh generation watershed workflow leverages jupyter notebooks to process the data and display the results in an interactive way this enables reproducibility of the workflows for future runs it automatically downloads the required data based on user specified

input files watershed boundary and hydrography dataset are retrieved from usgs s watershed boundary dataset wbd and national hydrography dataset nhd plus high resolution nhdplus hr simley and carswell 2009 a variable resolution mesh with higher resolution near the mapped streams is then generated meteorological forcing datasets are also compiled and a final input file is generated in hdf5 format representing the surface and subsurface structures from the available dataset and mapping them to individual pixels in this approach is a challenging task the nrcs based soil survey geographic database ssurgo data was incorporated first to represent the soil layer soil survey staff 2021 data for a geologic layer that extends from the soil layer to the bedrock layer lower boundary was

the geologic layer and the bedrock hengl et al 2009 mantel and kempen 2017 all these surface and subsurface data are then mapped to individual computational cells in the generated variable resolution

strategies model evaluation is performed by comparing to both streamflow and total evapotranspiration daily continuous streamflow data are used from 1981 to 2014 from the usgs archive https waterdata usgs gov last accessed on january 5 2022 we used the 8 day averaged gap filled mod16a2 version 6 evapotranspiration data from the modis archive modis evapotranspiration product is derived through a model following the penman monteith equation using the reanalysis based meteorological data and modis derived albedo biome type and leaf area index data running et al 2019 the total evapotranspiration is a combination of evaporations from soil and wet canopy and transpiration from plant running et al 2019 it is important to note that since the modis evapotranspiration product is model based using it to evaluate performance of an isshm is less stringent than using more direct evapotranspiration observations nevertheless the modis evapotranspiration model has been extensively validated against ground truth data running et al 2019 and ats s evapotranspiration representation is based on a different model so comparison to modis evapotranspiration is still a useful exercise kling gupta efficiency kge is a metric for estimating the model performance gupta et al 2009 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where σ and μ represents standard deviation and mean respectively r is the correlation coefficient based on the equation the kge score becomes 1 2 0 41 when the mean of observation is used as a predictor knoben et al 2019 to simplify the interpretation of the metric we use a modified kge mkge score where the mkge score of 0 has the same explanatory power as the mean value of the observation and a score of 1 indicates a perfect match analogous to the nash sutcliffe negative mkge values indicate the simulation performance is worse than using the mean value of the observation as a predictor variable which can be regarded as a catastrophic failure of a model the mkge score is 2 mkge k g e 2 1 2 3 3 1 sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model to compare the uncalibrated ats output with the calibrated sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model

discussions 4 1 streamflow comparison fig 4 shows the estimated mkge scores for streamflow across the catchments black bars are for ats with default settings and using community data products without modification blue bars are for the sac sma model calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis in general ats simulated streamflow compares well mkge 0 65 with the gauge data at 6 of the 7 studied catchments fig 4 using only the community data products mkge scores are found to be higher than 0 80 indicating excellent model performance in three catchments little tennessee river mayo river and flat brook catchments in fig 4 fig 5 shows the time series and scatter plots of uncalibrated ats simulated and gauge streamflow data for the little tennessee river mayo river and taylor river upstream catchments the scatter plots approximately follow the 1 1 line for the little tennessee river and mayo river catchments and both peak flow and baseflow are matched reasonably well the scatter plot for the taylor river upstream catchment has a slope somewhat less than 1 1 and peak flow is systematically underestimated although not dramatically performance as measured by the mkge was poor in one catchment cossatot river using default values the mkge score was good in the neversink river headwaters but as will be discussed in section 4 3 baseflow performance was poor the cossatot river and neversink river headwaters catchments are discussed in more detail in section 4 3 estimated mkge scores based on the 8 day averaged ats simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration data across the catchments are shown in fig 6 ats simulated evapotranspiration performs well mkge 0 7 on comparing the 8 day average evapotranspiration from modis in all the studied catchments fig 6 the mkge for ats simulated evapotranspiration is 0 8 in 5 of the 7 studied catchments fig 6 the daily time series and the scatter plots show a good agreement between ats simulated 8 day averaged evapotranspiration with the 8 day averaged modis data ats performance was good in different years as it matches both pattern as well as the magnitude figs 7 9 and supplementary fig 9 in taylor upstream catchment a summer time dip in modis evapotranspiration is apparent but not represented by ats fig 7a which causes the top half of the scatter plot to have relatively lower modis evapotranspiration values it is unclear whether this summer time dip in the modis data is real but it is consistent with stomatal closure linked to high vapor pressure deficit during summertime leading to lowering of transpiration in the modis algorithm running et al 2019 in general the trend lines in the scatter plots closely follow the 1 1 lines fig 7d f and supplementary fig 9 4 2 streamflow and evapotranspiration comparisons with the calibrated sac sma model output the sac sma model was calibrated on a catchment by catchment basis for streamflow and the calibration parameters differ across the catchments as a result sac sma streamflow outputs perform well compared with the gage streamflow figs 4 and 5 in terms of evapotranspiration ats s uncalibrated performance is similar to the sac sma calibrated performance for 6 of the 7 catchments figs 6 and 7 moreover ats performs much better than the sac sma in the low precipitation snowmelt dominated catchment taylor river upstream figs 6 and 7a streamflow only calibration of sac sma model simulation resulted in it matching the gage streamflow well however the sac sma evapotranspiration simulation was erratic fig 7a and inconsistent with observed seasonal patterns 4 3 model performance comparison upon using catchment specific input data using catchment specific input data is the initial step for improving model performance this is not the same as calibration as it does not involve adjusting model input to match a particular output but rather the use of catchment specific information on model inputs when that information conflicts with the community conus scale data products here we consider in detail the poor ats performance at the cossatot river catchment when default inputs were used the catchment is in the ouchita mountains and is characterized by thin soils above mostly sedimentary rocks that occasional express in outcrops at the surface miser and purdue 1929 ericksen et al 1983 mast and turk 1999 however the global scale depth to bedrock data product shows a depth estimate in the range of 15 33 m across the catchment supplementary figure 7 unrealistic depth to bedrock data is a potential reason for poor performance on the cossatot river catchment when the community data products are used fig 4 as the additional water storage would attenuate the peak flow and enhance baseflow based on the geologic information available we thus consider an alternative conceptual model with bedrock directly below the soil surface and use that in a new ats run ats adjusted results are compared to the original ats simulations in fig 8 the ats adjusted simulation is flashy and consistent with the gauge data with higher and shorter duration peaks and lower baseflow than the original ats simulation performance of ats is greatly improved in terms of both patterns and magnitude of streamflow with a mkge value of 0 77 figs 4 and 8a c for the ats adjusted case ats performance also improved in terms of evapotranspiration with a mkge value of 0 83 fig 8d f for the neversink river headwaters ats simulated baseflow was low which might be attributed to uncertain geologic layer properties and comparatively shallow depth to bedrock at the streambed channels in this catchment the geologic layer hydrologic properties from global scale glhymps data show similar values to the bedrock properties porosity 5 and permeability 1 10 16 m2 used supplementary figs 5 and 6 as a result the bedrock layer is effectively just below the soil layer based on the glhymps data a new model run was set up by extending the soil hydrologic properties down to the bedrock layer avoiding the geologic layer properties to evaluate changes in model performance we attempted to address the depth to bedrock data issue with the help of the seismology inferred depth to bedrock data from the usgs briggs et al 2020 supplementary fig 10 indicates much lower depth to bedrock occurrence in the southern part of the catchment in the soilgrids data on comparing with the geophysical estimates we modified the depth to bedrock data at the streambed channels by hand using the observed data from usgs supplementary figure 11 precipitation biases can be another data issue that might leading to uncertain model output precipitation biases are particularly prominent in smaller irregular shaped and mountainous catchments to show the water budget closures we computed the percentage deviation of the annual water budget from the precipitation data the evapotranspiration modis and streamflow gage observations data are subtracted from the precipitation data to compute the water budget closures the data show large variations over the years across the catchments supplementary figure 12 although we have not included change in storage in this analysis water budget deviation values 10 or 10 might indicate the precipitation bias related issue water budget closures indicate a median value of 8 5 at neversink river headwaters catchment supplementary figure 12 in the new ats run ats adjusted we used 10 increased precipitation rates the simulated near zero baseflow value in the original run has improved in the ats adjusted run and is comparable to the stream gage observations fig 9a c the mkge value increased from 0 65 in the default run to 0 69 in the ats adjusted run for daily streamflow simulation evapotranspiration time series does not show any significant change in these two runs fig 9d f these examples show that the model performance and simulation statistics depend on the catchment specific data availability that is crucial for improving the model estimates model users need to be cautious while using the regional scale data in modeling approaches and use their own judgement to improve the model performance 4 4 snow water equivalent comparison one of the seven sites taylor upstream is a snow dominated watershed in this watershed ats simulated snow water equivalent swe data is compared with snopack telemetry snotel https www cbrfc noaa gov snow accessed on september 28 2022 data ats performs reasonably well mkge 0 94 comparing the swe data from the single available site upper taylor uptc2 at 38 9830n and 106 7500w within the taylor upstream catchment fig 10 in general ats swe is in good agreement with snotel data in terms of both magnitude and snowmelt timing except for the 2018 water year when ats underpredicts the snowpack size here ats swe output was selected for the single grid cell where the snotel station is located comparisons between the point scale snotel data and the basin scale output of the semi distributed sac swe model are not meaningful but it is useful to compare basin scale swe outputs of ats and sac sma supplementary figure 15 basin scale swe dynamics from sac sma and ats have similar seasonal patterns but the peak swe is much higher for sac sma those large differences in the context of ats s far superior performance on et and good agreement with the point level snotel data provide further evidence that the highly calibrated sac sma model may be arriving at a good streamflow result for the wrong reasons 5 conclusions using only a priori information from community data products to define model inputs we evaluated the performance of a fully distributed integrated surface subsurface hydrological model ats for streamflow and evapotranspiration simulation in seven diverse catchments because ats is generally representative of isshms in terms of the processes represented the results of this study are relevant to fully resolved isshm modeling more broadly in general ats simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration agree reasonably well with observedstreamflow and modis derived evapotranspiration without catchment specific calibration although community data products had to be refined by catchment specific geologic information in 2 of the 7 catchments the sac sma model is representative of the broad class of semi distributed hydrologic models that require catchment specific calibration unsurprisingly the calibrated sac sma shows good performance on the quantity for which it is calibrated namely streamflow however evapotranspiration in that model does not match seasonal patterns and the mkge is negative for the taylor river upstream catchment indicating a catastrophic failure of the sac sma model for evapotranspiration on that catchment this is a good illustration of the dangers of highly calibrated models where parameter calibration in an overly simplified model structure can reach a good answer for the wrong reasons creating significant uncertainty in extrapolation in particular catchment specific calibration can lead to overfitting and caution is warranted in studies that require extrapolation to different climate and land use conditions that catchment specific calibration was not required for good ats performance suggests that spatially explicit representation of overland and subsurface lateral flows and other important hydrologic processes the distinguishing characteristic of isshms has significant potential to reduce the need for calibration of course explicit process representations require sufficiently high spatial resolution for the mesh and data inputs which leads to higher computational cost and significantly greater data demands compared with semi distributed models fortunately spatially extensive data products for most input parameters are now available across the conus and for some parameters globally our results suggest that those products are approaching a level of maturity where they can support more routine deployment of isshms however refinement of subsurface properties using information on local geology was required for two of the studied catchments that result indicates subsurface properties below mapped soil layers that is in deep soils sediments and in weathered fractured bedrock are still uncertain and would be good target for refinement in future community data products in addition workflow tools that make it easier to augment community data with local information would be highly advantageous despite those caveats the results shown here provide new confidence in the physics based isshm class of models and the corresponding collection of community data products as tools for advancing our fundamental understanding of

the ats processes simulated in this work are as described in coon et al 2020 the surface balance equations used to determine evapotranspiration given meteorological data land cover data and lai and water state are described below for completeness this model is depicted graphically in fig 3 and consists of modeling components taken from several existing codes and approaches in the literature note that all parameters including those that vary with land cover type are documented in a spreadsheet in the data supplement water balance the goal of this model is to provide sources and sinks of water to the surface and subsurface water balance these sources and sinks are described in fig 3 and units of all sources and sinks are in m s sources and sinks to the surface water balance are given by q s s m d rain t h rain e where sm is snowmelt d rain is the drainage of liquid water from the canopy t h rain is the throughfall of rain and e is evaporation from bare soil similarly in the subsurface volume transpiration t provides a sink of water noting that infiltration exfiltration flux of water between the surface and subsurface runoff and subsurface flow of water are treated as in coon et al 2020 conservation of water in the snowpack is given by d θ s n o w dt t h snow d snow s m where θ snow is the snow water equivalent m th snow the throughfall of snow and d snow the drainage of snow from the canopy similarly conservation of water in the canopy is given by d θ canopy dt i d snow d rain e canopy where θ canopy is the canopy water storage m i is the canopy interception and e canopy is the evaporation of canopy water note that both canopy and snow water equivalent are solved for and therefore require appropriate initial conditions frequently zero given these water balance equations each of the component terms must be specified interception and throughfall are partitioned based on leaf area and drainage or dripping from the canopy to the land surface is given by a simple exponential decay in which canopy storage decays back to a target maximum storage which is also a function of leaf area i β 1 e 0 5 l a i p rain p snow t h i 1 β 1 e 0 5 l a i p i i r a i n s n

taken to be 0 25 the lai is the leaf area index m 2 leaf area m 2 land surface area p rain and p snow m s are the rain and snow precipitation respectively θ sat is the total leaf saturated water content which is given as a product of the leaf area index and the specific leaf saturated water content m water m 2 leaf area which is a parameter specific to the vegetation type finally τ s is a timescale describing how quickly excess water drains from the canopy and is frequently chosen to be 864s or 1 100th of a day effectively this is simply chosen to be fast compared to the timescale of interest this portion of the aboveground model is based on that of the community land model v4 5 next potential evaporation and transpiration are prescribed using a variant of the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as described in the precipitation runoff modeling system prms iv markstrom et al 2015 and modified for systems which directly include a canopy as described in fisher and koven 2020 finally appropriate limiters or downregulation terms are based on that of the community land model v4 5 to limit these potential quantities based on water availability the resulting model is described below e canopy f wet α canopy l e δ δ γ e r canopy e snow a snow α snow l s δ δ γ s r snow g snow e ground 1 a snow f ground α soil l e δ δ γ e r ground g ground t pot 1 f wet α canopy l e δ δ γ e r canopy each evaporative flux in units of m s are described by the priestley taylor equation which includes a coefficient α i which may be land cover type specific limiters f i

as input data albedos a i are input parameters given by the land cover type except for the albedo of the ground surface which may be that of water when inundated or of soil when dry radiation transmitted through the canopy layer with a trans subscript are described by beer s law for radiation attenuation λ trans λ in e k l a i where the extinction coefficient k is land cover type and band short versus long specific outgoing longwave terms are given via the stefan boltzmann law λ i lw e i σ t i 4 where the emissivity e is dependent upon land cover type and whether the surface is inundated or not σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and t is the temperature of the surface where the canopy leaf temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature and the ground temperature is assumed to be equal to the air temperature one day prior to the current time as is commonly used in prms iv evapotranspiration downregulation and distribution finally the above terms form a potential evaporation or transpiration these must be limited when there is not water available or because other considerations interfere for instance canopy evaporation and transpiration may only take place on the fraction of leaf area that are wet and dry respectively the fraction of wet leaf area is given by f wet m i n θ canopy θ sat 1 when the ground surface is dry a desiccated zone may form limiting evaporation due to the need to diffuse vapor from the vadose zone through the desiccated zone and out to the open air based on the approach by sakaguchi and zeng 2009 a soil s resistance to evaporation is parameterized through f soil 1 if p o n d e d d e p t h 0 1 1 s r v p d otherwise sr d z e x p s g 5 1 e 1 vpd 2 2 10 5 ϕ 2 1 s res 5 where the soil resistance term sr is written as a function of the dessicated zone thickness dz m and the gas saturation s g and the vapor pressure diffusion term vpd is written as a function of soil porosity ϕ and the residual saturation s res this model ensures that as mafic potential drops and the liquid water saturation approaches residual saturation the evaporative flux approaches zero and the model can converge like evaporation transpiration must be downregulated when there is insufficient water for the plant to move that water to the leaf stomates and distributed from the potential flux calculated in the canopy to the distributed depth based flux in the rooting zone these processes are represented as in clm 4 5 oleson et al 2013 note that units must change to distribute with depth potential transpiration is in units of m s or m 3 h 2 o per m 2 land surface area per s but transpiration is in units of 1 s or m 3 h 2 o per m 3 soil volume per s t z t pot f root f ψ 2 z s f root f ψ d z f root z α r e α r z β r e β r z 2 f ψ ψ z 1 if ψ ψ closed ψ ψ open ψ closed ψ open otherwise 0 if ψ ψ open in this equation transpiration is distributed by the rooting fraction f root which integrates to 1 and describes the fraction of a plant s roots as a function of depth as a sum of two exponentials with land cover type specific parameters α r and β r furthermore the plant takes water wherever it is available as enabled by a limiter based on the mafic potential ψ which is solved for by the subsurface richards equation this limiter is based on two more parameters the mafic potential at which stomates are fully open and fully closed ψ open and ψ closed respectively which may be a function of land cover type snow melt finally it remains to specify quantities using in the snow model including snow covered area and snowmelt to close the water balances described in the above sections the area of snow covered ground is given by a simple linear transition between fully covered and bare a snow max 1 θ snow 0 02 snowmelt is prescribed through an empirical equation provided in prms iv markstrom et al 2015 which acknowledges that snow typically is a few degrees cooler than the air temperature sm max k melt t air t melt 0 where kmelt is the snow degree melt rate m s and t melt c is the temperature of the air at melting appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at

2207,infiltration process controls how rainfall is stored in soil and subsequently used by plants thus plays a critical role in eco hydrological processes however the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning within a soil profile and the factors that control it remain poorly understood especially in data scarce mountainous areas based on a large scale long term soil moisture sm network in the qilian mountains northwest china we explored infiltration partitioning and its control factors using a new metric percentage of soil water storage increment in each layer to the soil profile during a rainfall infiltration event psti we found that both vegetations with deep roots and wet sm conditions facilitated infiltration into the deeper soil although meadow favored infiltration within the surface layer hillslope stations showed a higher degree of infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers than the flatland stations due to the influence of topography on soil properties meanwhile the increasing slope gradient will reduce the partition of infiltration at the subsurface layers among the soil properties sand content soil organic carbon α parameter of soil retention curve and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity promoted infiltration into greater depth while clay content and bulk density had the opposite effect the major factors controlling the pattern of infiltration partitioning were n parameter of soil retention curve for 0 10 cm depth α for 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths and sm for psti below 30 cm this quantitative analysis method for the infiltration partitioning improves our understanding of infiltration regimes and supports water resources management in dryland mountains keywords infiltration soil moisture control factors high and cold mountainous area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction infiltration is a key process in the hydrological cycle how water enters and partitions within a soil profile affects the exchange of water and energy between soil and atmosphere good et al 2015 as well as the hydrological processes including soil water availability yang et al 2022 streamflow generation and flooding vereecken et al 2022 and groundwater recharge good et al 2015 therefore knowledge about infiltration and how it partitions with depth is of significant importance to many scientific disciplines however infiltration partitioning within soil profile is difficult to quantify and has complex relationship with environmental factors especially at the large scale vereecken et al 2019 miguez macho and fan 2021 in recent years great efforts have been made toward quantifying the infiltration processes based on high temporal resolutions soil moisture sm dynamics in various environments e g bhark and small 2003 moran et al 2010 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2020 guo and lin 2018 however due to the lack of appropriate measures to analyze the infiltration partitioning most previous studies treated the soil profile as a single component and only explored how total infiltration varied under different conditions e g bhark and small 2003 jin et al 2018 niu et al 2021 only a small number of works have studied vertical differences in water partitioning within a soil profile which provides critical insight into the infiltration regimes moran et al 2010 li et al 2013a moran et al 2010 quantified the partitions of rainfall on different soil layers under and between shrubs li et al 2013a further proved that preferential flow under shrub tends to transport water into deep soil layer those studies focused on the influence of shrubs on infiltration at point scales and the combined influence of environmental factors on the infiltration partitioning at large scale is still unknown infiltration processes are controlled by a combination of environmental factors including vegetation soil properties soil moisture state and terrain characteristics laio et al 2001 vereecken et al 2019 soil properties can affect infiltration processes in different ways by controlling the movement and storage of water within a soil profile lin et al 2006 vereecken et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc for example can facilitate infiltration through increasing hydraulic conductivity ruehlmann and körschens 2009 or impede infiltration by increasing the water holding capacity dai et al 2020 bulk density has an opposite effect on infiltration from the soil organic carbon ruehlmann and körschens 2009 vegetation can facilitate e g lozano parra et al 2015 jin et al 2018 or inhibit e g wang et al 2008 li et al 2013b infiltration by introducing complex interactions between roots and soil topography can influence infiltration patterns in different ways such as generating surface runoff or lateral flow huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 soil moisture state also has a variable effect on infiltration capacity singh et al 2021 kang et al 2022 additionally the interactions among environmental factors further complicate the relationship between environmental factors and infiltration lin et al 2006 e g the control of topography on vegetation and soil properties fan et al 2019 and the effect of vegetation on soil properties tian et al 2017 however limited by the lack of large scale observations and research methods most of the previous studies were conducted at the point he et al 2012 lozano parra et al 2015 and slope scales huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 meanwhile the effect of single environmental factor on the infiltration has been well explored e g lozano parra et al 2015 while the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on infiltration are hardly reported research has shown that the major control factors of infiltration vary from soil properties at point scale such as soil organic carbon franzluebbers 2002 to slope position at hillslope scale green and erskine 2011 zhu et al 2014 thus the results from the small scale can t be used for the large scale meanwhile the spatial pattern and control mechanisms of infiltration at large scale are still unclear vereecken et al 2019 fan et al 2019 large scale mountainous ranges are ideal to analyze the relationships between environmental factors and infiltration process due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of topography vegetation and soil properties in the mountainous areas jin et al 2015 osenga et al 2019 however the control mechanisms of infiltration processes are still poorly understood in mountainous areas due to the difficulties of installing and maintaining large scale and long term profile soil moisture monitoring networks rahmati et al 2018 in a recent review by dorigo et al 2021 among the established long term soil moisture monitoring networks only 5 out of 69 large scale networks are located in high and cold mountainous areas su et al 2011 yang et al 2013 osenga et al 2019 out of those networks only few have focused on the infiltration process they explored the effect of vegetation on infiltration process at point or slope scale in high and cold mountain areas he et al 2012 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2017 dai et al 2019 niu et al 2021 they concluded that the infiltration capacity decreased with the vegetation degradation e g degrading from the forest or scrubland to grassland sun et al 2015 yang et al 2017 kang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 however studies have reported that meadow has lower dai et al 2019 niu et al 2021 or similar he et al 2012 infiltration capacity compared with grassland the lack of large scale in situ observations together with the high heterogeneity of infiltration processes in topographically complex mountainous areas makes the transfer of small scale information to larger scales very challenging clark et al 2015 vereecken et al 2019 limiting the accurate representation of infiltration in large scale modeling in mountainous areas within this context this study focuses on the infiltration processes in the qilian mountains which is a typical arid mountainous area in northwest china he et al 2018 based on profile sm data from a large scale long term 7 years observation network our objectives are 1 to quantify the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning at the large scale arid mountainous area 2 to analyze the relationship between infiltration partitioning with environmental factors including land cover topography soil properties and soil moisture and 3 to identify the major control factors for the infiltration partitioning in this arid topographically complex alpine region the findings can shed new light on soil hydrological processes and provide important information for supporting water resource management in alpine mountains 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study area is the upstream of the heihe river basin which is a typical terminal lake basin in an arid region and is located on the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau it covers an area of approximately 2 7 104 km2 and has a range in elevation of approximately 2000 5600 m the region has an annual precipitation of 200 700 mm luo et al 2016 an annual potential evapotranspiration of 700 2000 mm and an annual mean temperature that ranges from 3 1 c to 7 c during 1960 2012 he et al 2018 substantial differences in climate and topography lead to strong variations in the spatial characteristics of the landscape in mountainous areas jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the study area mainly comprises grassland forestland and sparsely vegetated land zhou et al 2016 and the main soil types are silt loam sandy loam and silt usda classification and the loam and sandy loam soils are mainly located in the upper mountainous areas while the silt soils are mainly located in the river valleys lu et al 2017 mountain runoff provides almost all of the water supply for the entire watershed which sustains a population of over 1 2 million people irrigates 2 4 105 ha of farmland and supports a fragile ecological system in the watershed li et al 2015 2 2 soil moisture observation network a large scale sm monitoring network was established in july 2013 in the upstream of the heihe river basin to study soil hydrological processes the network is composed of 32 sm stations based on the representation of land use land cover soil topography and climate conditions in the study area fig 1 specifically we divided the study area into 32 homogeneous zones based on the following main factors 1 adequate representation of the main types of land use land cover soil and topography of the study area 2 relatively large homogeneous zones of the lulc soil and topography dem and 3 constraints of project budget and personnel in carrying out the field work the pictures of the environments of each station are shown in figs s1 s2 each station produced an sm profile from 0 cm to 70 cm depth which was measured at 30 min intervals by sm probes ech2o 5te decagon group inc usa installed at depths of 5 cm to monitor the depth range 0 10 cm 15 cm 10 20 cm 25 cm 20 30 cm 40 cm 30 50 cm and 60 cm 50 70 cm below the soil surface soil specific sensor calibrations were performed using a direct calibration method cobos and chambers 2010 zhang et al 2017 with soil samples taken from each stations due to the influence of soil freezing in winter all measured sm time series were limited to the growing season may to october tian et al 2019 between 2014 and 2020 data quality management was performed according to the data quality control method dorigo et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 1 excluding sm data during the seasonal freezing periods based on the soil temperature and sm dynamics during the freeze thaw cycles dorigo et al 2013 yang et al 2017 2 removing outliers e g values outside the 1 90 vol range wiekenkamp et al 2016 and unreasonable fluctuations tian et al 2019 3 excluding unreliable data due to instrumentation problems e g insufficient battery power by visual data inspection and 4 retaining only the periods when all five layers of sm meet quality control according to the requirement of the calculation of the infiltration partitioning time coverage of the available sm data for each station was shown in fig s3 environmental factors such as position slope gradient aspect and land cover properties were also measured at each station soil cores were collected to measure soil properties at each stations such as soil particle composition sand clay and silt soil organic carbon content soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s cm day soil dry bulk density bulk g cm3 and the soil water retention

properties of the 32 sm stations are shown in table s1 the stations that meet the data quality control include the vegetation of scrubland scrub 3 stations alpine meadow meadow 3 stations high coverage grassland hcg 10 stations medium coverage grassland mcg 5 stations and barren land barren 5 stations respectively details of the sm network and the procedures involved in measuring soil properties can be found in tian et al 2019 tian et al 2022 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a product downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https doi org 10 11888 terre tpdc 272681 the dataset was generated through the fusion of modis 250 m and landsat 30 m ndvi time series data using the gap filling and savitzky golay gf sg fusion method which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 30 m and 8 days chen et al 2021 cao et al 2022 the multi year average of annual maximum ndvi during 2014 2020 for each station was calculated as the average ndvi values of each stations 2 3 data analysis methods 2 3 1 determining the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning water is assumed to reach a certain depth within a soil profile when the sm content begins to increase after a rainfall pulse wang et al 2008 laio et al 2001 accordingly we adopt the concept of soil wetting event swe which is defined by a significant increase of sm due to rainfall infiltration into a soil column fig 2 detailed descriptions are in tian et al 2019 specifically the starting and ending times of infiltration events were determined for each station as follows fig 2 1 selecting the time series of continuous increase in soil moisture defining the time of the start of the soil moisture increase as the start time of the infiltration event and the time of the end of the soil moisture increase as the end of the infiltration event 2 combining infiltration events that occurred within 6 hours into the same event the rainfall infiltration process within soil profile was determined by using increases in sm at depths of 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 60 cm within the soil profile specifically for each swe after rainfall pulse the absolute accumulated increase in sm at each measurement depth was defined as follows mccoll et al 2017 tian et al 2019 1 asw i j t s t et δ θ t j with 2 δ θ t j δ θ t j δ θ t j 0 0 δ θ t j 0 and 3 δ θ t j θ t δ t j θ t j where θt j is the sm vol at the time t of the j th swe δt is the measurement interval 30 min st and et are the start and end time of the j th swe respectively and aswij is the accumulated soil water increment for the j th swe vol aswi was calculated for each depth at all sm stations and for all swes during growing seasons during the period 2014 2020 the amount of infiltration at each soil layer following a rainfall driven swe which is also described as the equivalent depth of water that enters the specific soil thickness during each swe was calculated based on aswi as follows bhark and small 2003 wang et al 2008 moran et al 2010 li et al 2013a 4 i i a s w i i d i here ii is the amount of infiltration also called soil storage increment at the i th soil layer for each swe aswii is the accumulated soil water increment for the i th soil layer for each swe and d i is the corresponding soil thickness for the i th layer we considered five layers i e i 1 5 that had corresponding sequential thicknesses of 10 cm d 1 0 10 cm 10 cm d 2 10 20 cm 10 cm d 3 20 30 cm 20 cm d 4 30 50 cm and 20 cm d 5 50 70 cm finally based on the calculated infiltration soil storage increment for each layer under the same swe infiltration partitioning at different layers within the soil profile was expressed using the percentage of soil storage increment in each layer compared to the whole soil profile psti for each rainfall driven swe the psti was calculated as follows 5 pst i i 100 i i i 1 5 i i where i 1 5 represents layers 1 to 5 psti values were also used to calculate the accumulated psti apsti between layers 2 and 4 as follows 6 apst i m i 1 m pst i i where m 2 4 represents the percentage of infiltration within the uppermost m layers compared to the whole soil profile the apsti of layer 1 is equal to the psti of layer 1 the apsti of layer 5 is equal to 100 and the apsti of layer 4 is equal to the difference between 100 and the psti of layer 5 2 3 2 random forest random forest rf is a collection of un pruned cart classification and regression tree since individual trees are randomly perturbed the forest benefits from a more extensive exploration of the space of all possible tree predictors which always results in better predictive performance therneau et al 2015 the importance calculation and the selection of variables in this study were implemented through the vsurf package in r genuer et al 2015 the steps are as follows 1 ranking and preliminary elimination ranking the variables by decreasing importance and eliminating the variables with low importance 2 selecting variables for interpretation starting with the model with only the most important variables and ending with the model involving all the previously selected important variables the average of the out of bag error oob error for these models is calculated and finally the model variables that lead to the lowest oob error are selected the oob error and variable importance vi were calculated as follows 7 ooberror 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 8 vi x j 1 q k 1 q ooberror k ooberror k where n is the number of samples y is the response variable y is the corresponding predicted value x is the explanatory variables q is the number of trees constructed ooberror k is the oob error of trees k ooberror k is the error of the trees k after perturbation of x j randomly permuting the values of variable x j 2 3 3 statistical analysis boxplots were used to show the degree of scatter within each dataset differences between the data in different groups were assessed using one way analysis of variance anova with a post hoc bonferroni test applied when the normality and homogeneity of variance of the datasets were satisfied the kruskal wallis anova with a post hoc dunn s test was used when these conditions were not satisfied derrac et al 2011 the significance level for acceptance was 0 05 for all statistical tests statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 results 3 1 infiltration under different land covers each swe and associated psti identified in each land cover type during the 2014 2020 growing seasons are summarized in table 1 and shown in fig 3 we observed total 2775 events in the first layer and the number of swe frequency decreased with depth in average 555 459 367 270 and 199 events were recorded for the first second third fourth and fifth layers respectively in all stations meanwhile psti also decreased significantly p 0 001 from the first layer mean psti 60 8 to the second layer mean psti 18 5 third layer mean psti 8 8 fourth layer mean and median psti of 7 8 and 0 respectively and fifth layer mean and median psti of 4 1 and 0 respectively notably the apsti at the second and third layers reached 78 4 median value 82 7 and 87 5 median value 100 respectively which indicates that infiltration into the first layer i e a depth of 0 10 cm comprised 60 standard deviation 26 of the total infiltration within the 70 cm deep soil profile meanwhile accumulated infiltration reached 78 standard deviation 21 and 88 standard deviation 15 for the upper two layers i e depths of 0 20 cm and three layers i e depths of 0 30 cm of the soil profile respectively the distribution of psti at each layer under different land cover types is shown in fig 3 among all land cover types scrub scrubland showed a significantly low psti mean value 50 within the first layer although deeper soil layers exhibited a significantly high psti with mean values of 12 6 11 8 and 8 3 for layers 3 4 and 5 respectively by contrast meadow had the highest psti mean value 74 5 within the first soil layer but the lowest psti in deep layers with mean values of 5 3 2 5 and 1 5 for layers 3 4 and 5 respectively among other land cover types barren barren land had the highest psti mean value 62 6 in the first layer medium coverage grassland mcg had the highest psti in both the second layer mean value 22 7 and third layer mean value 10 4 and high coverage grassland hcg had the highest psti in the fourth layer mean value 9 6 fig 3 shows that meadows had the significantly highest apsti values between layers 2 and 4 with mean values of 90 7 96 1 and 98 5 for layers 2 3 and 4 respectively by contrast scrub had the significantly lowest apsti values in these layers with mean values of 67 3 79 9 and 91 7 for layers 2 3 and 4 respectively differences in apsti values between hcg mcg and barren land cover types were not significant 3 2 infiltration under different soil moisture conditions based on the initial sm and psti at different layers of swe identified from all sm stations we analyzed the variations of psti with sm condition and conducted the scatterplot between psti of different layers and sm and the linear fitting relationships between them fig 4 results showed that the psti of layer 1 and layer 2 decreased significantly with the increase of sm the slopes of the linear fitting curve are 0 66 and 0 12 for layer 1 and layer 2 respectively the psti of layer 3 to layer 5 increased significantly with the increase of sm the slopes of linear fitting curve are 0 18 0 40 and 0 20 for the layer 3 layer 4 and layer 5 respectively furthermore we explored the variation of psti with sm for each sm stations results showed that the above relationships between psti and sm are valid for all the stations meanwhile only 3 sm stations showed different relationships between psti and sm that sm is positively correlated with psti at the first layer while negatively correlated with psti at the subsurface layers 3 3 infiltration under different topographic conditions we explored the influence of topography on psti by analyzing the variation of psti profiles beneath grassland in different types of terrain both hcg and mcg were included here as they recorded an insignificant difference in apsti the studied terrain conditions included seven hillslope stations and eight flatland stations as road access is limited in the mountainous areas stations on hillslopes are usually located on the lower or middle parts of the hillslope the psti results for the grassland hillslope and flatland conditions are shown in fig 5 a the flatland stations mean 65 1 had significantly higher psti values than the hillslope stations mean 56 1 in the first soil layer however the hillslope stations showed significantly higher psti values than the flatland stations in subsurface layers especially between layers 3 and 5 i e 20 70 cm depth specifically the flatland stations recorded mean psti values of 19 1 7 0 6 7 and 2 1 for layers 2 3 4 and 5 respectively whereas the hillslope stations recorded mean psti values of 20 0 10 1 9 5 and 4 4 for these layers respectively the median psti values at layer 4 were 0 for the flatland stations and 6 9 for the hillslope stations our results indicate that the hillslopes experienced a greater degree of infiltration partitioning at deeper layers than the flatland stations we also explored the influence of slope gradient on the psti distribution within different soil layers at the seven hillslope sm stations mentioned previously fig 5 b these stations were divided into three groups according to their slope gradient gentle slope 20 two sm stations moderate slope 20 30 three sm stations and steep slope 30 two sm stations the mean psti value in layer 1 significantly increased from gentle slope stations 48 to moderate slope stations 53 and again to steep slope stations 59 meanwhile psti in deep soil layers decreased significantly as slope gradient increased especially for layers 3 and 4 specifically the mean psti values in layer 3 for gentle moderate and steep slope stations were 12 7 11 3 and 10 5 respectively and were 14 2 9 1 6 1 for layer 4 respectively we classified the swe into four sm conditions through dividing by the 25th percentile 10 vol median 17 vol and 75th percentile 23 vol of initial sm these categories were 1 dry condition initial sm 10 vol 2 medium dry condition initial sm 10 17 vol 3 medium wet condition initial sm 17 23 vol and 4 wet condition initial sm 23 vol thus we explored the influence of topography on the psti values within soil layers at different sm conditions fig 6 results indicate that topography has a very similar influence on the psti patterns regardless of the sm conditions specifically the flatland regions have significantly higher psti values than the hillslope regions in layer 1 for example the mean psti values were 71 9 flatland and 60 hillslope under the dry sm conditions and 60 0 flatland and 50 1 hillslope under the wet sm conditions additionally the flatland stations had significantly lower psti values than the hillslope stations in the subsurface layers for the dry sm conditions with the mean psti values at layer 5 of 1 0 flatland and 2 9 hillslope respectively and mean psti values of 4 1 flatland and 6 3 hillslope for the wet sm conditions respectively 3 4 infiltration under different soil hydraulic properties variations in psti profiles according to soil hydraulic properties shp including soil texture i e proportion of sand and clay bulk soc and soil hydraulic properties n α θ s θ r and k s were analyzed to explore their influence on infiltration partitioning within soil profiles each soil property was divided into three groups according to the 25th and 75th percentiles of each range small the shp was smaller than the 25th percentile medium the shp was between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile and large the shp was greater than the 75th percentile as topography influences the psti we explored how psti varied according to different shp groups at the same topographic condition in flatland regions results are shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that sand soc α and k s had a similar effect on the psti distribution within different layers as the above mentioned shps increased the psti decreased in the surface layer and increased in the subsurface layers meanwhile clay and bulk had a similar effect on the distribution of psti along each soil profile which is opposite the effects of sand soc α and k s for example in the case of sand content the mean psti values in layer 1 were 55 9 and 66 8 for large and small group the psti value for the large sand group had the mean values of 19 8 10 5 8 8 and 4 9 for layers 2 3 4 and 5 respectively whereas the small sand group had the mean psti values of 18 6 5 9 5 8 and 2 9 respectively for the same layers for soc the apsti decreased with the increasing soc within the first two layers i e 0 20 cm whereas the psti value increased significantly with the increasing soc in the subsurface layers i e 20 70 cm the psti value increased significantly with the increasing bulk in the first two layers with the mean psti values of 48 and 61 for the small and large bulk in layer 1 respectively however this psti value decreased significantly in subsurface layers i e 20 70 cm with the mean psti values of 7 4 and 1 6 for the small and large bulk in layer 5 respectively notably no other shps n θ s and θ r showed a clear relationship with infiltration partitioning 3 5 dominant factors that control infiltration partitioning the relative importance of environmental factors that control psti and apsti is shown in fig 8 overall the most influential factors that affect psti within a soil profile are sm α n soc clay and slope although the importance of these factors varies between layers the most important factor for layer 1 is n with an incmse increase in mean squared error the larger the value the more important the variable of 24 5 although α is most important for layers 2 and 3 with incmse values of 3 0 and 1 2 respectively other key controlling factors include α and sm for layer 1 slope soc and n for layer 2 and slope clay content and sm for layer 3 sm was the most important factor that controlled psti in layers 4 and 5 and apsti in layers 2 4 as the sum of apsti in layer 4 plus psti in layer 5 is necessarily 100 the apsti value in layer 4 was the same as the psti value in layer 5 in summary sm α n soc clay content and slope angle are important factors that control psti values along the soil profiles sm was the most important factor that affected psti at great depths i e 30 70 cm and apsti of all layers while α and n were the most important factors that controlled psti from layers 1 to 3 i e 0 30 cm 4 discussion 4 1 influence of vegetation on infiltration vegetation with deep roots has been argued to either favor infiltration by changing soil properties e g lozano parra et al 2015 jin et al 2018 or impede infiltration into deeper layers through root water uptake e g wang et al 2008 li et al 2013a liu et al 2016 in arid semi arid areas our results showed that scrub has the best capacity to deliver water into deep soil layers especially below 30 cm depth among the other land covers hcg had the highest psti values in layer 4 mcg had the highest psti values in layers 3 and 2 and meadow had the highest psti value in layer 1 these data show that the distribution of the highest psti values in different layers coincided with the root depths for different land cover types which field surveys have shown decreases sequentially between scrub hcg mcg meadow and barren tian et al 2017 tian et al 2019 previous studies also have shown that land cover types can influence soil properties for example k s and soc decreased from scrub to grassland and to barren in the study area while bulk has an opposite trend tian et al 2017 thus our results indicated that stations with more vegetation and longer roots have a greater capacity for allowing infiltration into the deeper layers of a soil column our results also indicated that meadows have the lowest capacity for infiltration into deep layers of a soil profile especially at depths 30 cm meadows retained most infiltrated water in the upper soil layer i e 95 retention within 0 20 cm depth due to the influence of mattic epipedon that forms by long term interactions between abundant roots and soil lowering the soil s hydraulic conductivity zeng et al 2013 tian et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 thus we interpret that meadows favor retaining water at the mattic epipedon layer and block its infiltration into deeper soil layers which is consistent with previous studies e g dai et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 niu et al 2021 thus the special influence of mattic epipedon should be considered when representing the hydrological processes for meadow biomes 4 2 impact of topography on infiltration hillslope has been reported to affect vertical patterns of infiltration partitioning via the generation of 1 lateral subsurface flow which increases infiltration partitioning for subsurface layer svoray et al 2021 2 surface runoff which reduces the infiltration into deep soil layers wang and chen 2021 or 3 by influencing soil properties keesstra et al 2018 we found that the hillslope stations have greater infiltration partitioning within subsurface soil layers fig 5 a which implies the possible influence of lateral flow at the hillslope stations furthermore fig 6 indicates that infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers was always greater on the hillslope stations than on the flatland stations in both dry i e initial sm 11 nearly 20 of θ s saturated sm and wet sm conditions i e initial sm 21 nearly 40 of θ s however hillslope lateral flow occurs only when the initial sm reaches a threshold e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a moran et al 2010 previous studies have identified this threshold as being close to the saturated sm θ s in alpine grassland penna et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 therefore it is difficult to generate subsurface lateral flow under dry sm conditions lower than 20 of θ s as soil properties influence infiltration partitioning patterns we explored the influence of topography on soil properties fig 9 our results showed that the hillslope stations had significantly higher k s and lower clay contents than the flatland stations while there were no significant differences between other soil properties previous results have also shown that lower k s and higher clay contents occur at the toe of a hillslope compared to those on a hillslope itself archer et al 2013 papanicolaou et al 2015 higher k s and lower clay contents both favor infiltration to greater depths within a soil profile fig 6 thus we infer that the effect of hillslope on infiltration partitioning was mainly due to the influence of the hillslope on soil properties our results also indicated that the decreased infiltration partitioning at deep soil layers correlated with the increasing slope gradients fig 5 b this can be caused by the increasing slope gradients that converted more rainfall into surface runoff and thus reduced overall infiltration e g huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 4 3 influence of soil properties on infiltration we found that sand content soc α and k s all enhanced the infiltration of surface water into deep depths while the soil s clay content and bulk density had the opposite effect here k s represents the ability to transmit water along with soil gupta et al 2021 thus allowing infiltration to greater depths sand has been reported to facilitate water transmission along soil profiles reynolds et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 gupta et al 2021 and reduce the water holding capacity of the soil khlosi et al 2013 thus facilitating infiltration into deep depth by contrast clay and bulk density impede water transmission which in turn impedes infiltration higher soc has been reported to impede infiltration into deep soil due to its high water holding capacity yang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 dai et al 2020 but also to facilitate the infiltration process through soil aggregation and improving soil structure ruehlmann and körschens 2009 fatichi et al 2020 our results showed that soc promoted infiltration to great depths in the study area fig 6 in addition α represents the reciprocal of the air entry value assouline 2021 and was positively correlated with k s in the study area pearson s r 0 29 p 0 01 tian et al 2022 showing that it facilitated infiltration 4 4 major factors that control infiltration partitioning the coevolution and inherent interactions of those environmental factors complicate the influence of environmental factors on infiltration processes lin et al 2006 vereecken et al 2016 such complexity has been reported for influence of soil texture and soc on bulk ruehlmann and körschens 2009 ramcharan et al 2017 and soil hydraulic parameters i e k s and parameters related to the soil retention curve zhang et al 2018 gupta et al 2021 in addition topography can influence environmental factors such as vegetation sm and soil properties tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fan et al 2019 while vegetation will influence soil properties through interactions between roots and the soil itself vereecken et al 2016 fatichi et al 2020 interactions between environmental factors lead to variable major control factors and patterns of the infiltration process depending on the environment and scale ma et al 2017 vereecken et al 2019 vereecken et al 2022 our work has indicated that the pattern of infiltration partitioning along a soil profile is influenced by a combination of environmental factors such as vegetation cover soil properties soil hydration state and topography in addition the major factors in controlling pattern of infiltration partitioning are n for layer 1 α for layers 2 3 and sm for the psti value of the other layers and apsti for all layers topographic slope soc and clay content also have an important influence furthermore our results indicate the water conditions control the infiltration partitioning at deep layers which is potential for groundwater recharge previous studies focused on the total amount of infiltration within a soil profile initial sm was determined to be the major control on infiltration logsdon 2015 dai et al 2019 which matches our results of accumulated psti along the soil profile notably rainfall has also been reported to significantly influence the infiltration process e g laio et al 2001 he et al 2012 yang et al 2017 which is not analyzed in our study this is due to the lack of in situ rainfall observations and the current reanalysis datasets e g china meteorological forcing dataset are not effective in estimating rainfall in mountainous areas lai et al 2022 4 5 assessing the quantification of infiltration partitioning patterns we used soil wetting events tian et al 2019 to determine infiltration partitioning at different depths within a soil profile by calculating psti and apsti indices this allowed us to quantify the amount of water received by each soil layer during the infiltration process these results extend those of previous studies which either described infiltration qualitatively or determined the infiltration pattern for an entire soil profile critically our infiltration partitioning data for the deepest soil layer 50 70 cm provides a reference for inferring groundwater recharge schaffitel et al 2021 maihemuti et al 2021 infiltration partitioning data for the depth range where plant roots occur provides a reference for converting rainfall into plant available water laio et al 2001 in addition it can intuitively reflect the capacity of infiltration to deliver water to greater depths within soil under different conditions the influence of environmental factors on the partition pattern of infiltration varied at different depths in this study the soil profile of 0 70 cm was divided into 5 layers based on the depths of the 5 soil sensors tian et al 2019 the soil sensors at depths of 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 60 cm represent sm at soil ranges of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm and 50 70 cm respectively however the actual measurement range of the 5te soil sensor is around 5 cm above and below the soil sensor cobos and chambers 2010 which may cause uncertainty in the calculation of soil storage increment for the fourth and fifth layers furthermore the calculation of psti involves soil thickness which should be calibrated with the rock fragment percentage to reflect real soil volume and get the real psti van wesemael et al 2000 however due to the absence of rock fragment measurement at each station we didn t calibrate the soil thickness using rock fragment percentage which can lead to some uncertainty about the psti 5 conclusion we performed a seven year series of in situ sm observations over a large scale arid mountainous area to quantitatively analyze the infiltration process the patterns and control factors of infiltration partitioning along soil profiles were quantified by calculating the psti which is the proportion by which soil water storage increases in each layer of the soil profile during infiltration the main findings are outlined below 1 stations with more vegetation and deeper roots have a higher capacity for infiltration penetrating into the deep soil layers the capacity decreases in scrub high coverage grassland medium coverage grassland and barren land respectively meadows containing mattic epipedon had the lowest capacity for infiltration into the deep soil layers with water being preferentially retained at the surface layers 2 infiltration into the lower layers of a soil profile was more effective under a wet sm condition than under a dry sm condition 3 hillslope stations had greater infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers than flatland stations as the hillslope stations contained soil with higher k s values and lower clay contents in addition the capacity for infiltration reaching greater soil depths decreased with the increasing slope 4 sand soc α and k s all facilitated infiltration to greater depths whereas clay and bulk density had the opposite effect 5 major factors controlling the pattern of infiltration partitioning at various depths included n for 0 10 cm depth α for 10 30 cm depth and sm for 30 70 cm additionally the accumulated psti along soil profile was mainly controlled by sm for all depths the above described indices allowed for quantitative investigation of the vertical partitioning of water infiltration based on a profile s sm time series more importantly our data and analysis provide new insights into infiltration regimes under different environmental conditions and could be used to support ecosystem restoration and water resources management in arid mountainous

2207,infiltration process controls how rainfall is stored in soil and subsequently used by plants thus plays a critical role in eco hydrological processes however the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning within a soil profile and the factors that control it remain poorly understood especially in data scarce mountainous areas based on a large scale long term soil moisture sm network in the qilian mountains northwest china we explored infiltration partitioning and its control factors using a new metric percentage of soil water storage increment in each layer to the soil profile during a rainfall infiltration event psti we found that both vegetations with deep roots and wet sm conditions facilitated infiltration into the deeper soil although meadow favored infiltration within the surface layer hillslope stations showed a higher degree of infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers than the flatland stations due to the influence of topography on soil properties meanwhile the increasing slope gradient will reduce the partition of infiltration at the subsurface layers among the soil properties sand content soil organic carbon α parameter of soil retention curve and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity promoted infiltration into greater depth while clay content and bulk density had the opposite effect the major factors controlling the pattern of infiltration partitioning were n parameter of soil retention curve for 0 10 cm depth α for 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm depths and sm for psti below 30 cm this quantitative analysis method for the infiltration partitioning improves our understanding of infiltration regimes and supports water resources management in dryland mountains keywords infiltration soil moisture control factors high and cold mountainous area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction infiltration is a key process in the hydrological cycle how water enters and partitions within a soil profile affects the exchange of water and energy between soil and atmosphere good et al 2015 as well as the hydrological processes including soil water availability yang et al 2022 streamflow generation and flooding vereecken et al 2022 and groundwater recharge good et al 2015 therefore knowledge about infiltration and how it partitions with depth is of significant importance to many scientific disciplines however infiltration partitioning within soil profile is difficult to quantify and has complex relationship with environmental factors especially at the large scale vereecken et al 2019 miguez macho and fan 2021 in recent years great efforts have been made toward quantifying the infiltration processes based on high temporal resolutions soil moisture sm dynamics in various environments e g bhark and small 2003 moran et al 2010 wang et al 2013 liu et al 2020 guo and lin 2018 however due to the lack of appropriate measures to analyze the infiltration partitioning most previous studies treated the soil profile as a single component and only explored how total infiltration varied under different conditions e g bhark and small 2003 jin et al 2018 niu et al 2021 only a small number of works have studied vertical differences in water partitioning within a soil profile which provides critical insight into the infiltration regimes moran et al 2010 li et al 2013a moran et al 2010 quantified the partitions of rainfall on different soil layers under and between shrubs li et al 2013a further proved that preferential flow under shrub tends to transport water into deep soil layer those studies focused on the influence of shrubs on infiltration at point scales and the combined influence of environmental factors on the infiltration partitioning at large scale is still unknown infiltration processes are controlled by a combination of environmental factors including vegetation soil properties soil moisture state and terrain characteristics laio et al 2001 vereecken et al 2019 soil properties can affect infiltration processes in different ways by controlling the movement and storage of water within a soil profile lin et al 2006 vereecken et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc for example can facilitate infiltration through increasing hydraulic conductivity ruehlmann and körschens 2009 or impede infiltration by increasing the water holding capacity dai et al 2020 bulk density has an opposite effect on infiltration from the soil organic carbon ruehlmann and körschens 2009 vegetation can facilitate e g lozano parra et al 2015 jin et al 2018 or inhibit e g wang et al 2008 li et al 2013b infiltration by introducing complex interactions between roots and soil topography can influence infiltration patterns in different ways such as generating surface runoff or lateral flow huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 soil moisture state also has a variable effect on infiltration capacity singh et al 2021 kang et al 2022 additionally the interactions among environmental factors further complicate the relationship between environmental factors and infiltration lin et al 2006 e g the control of topography on vegetation and soil properties fan et al 2019 and the effect of vegetation on soil properties tian et al 2017 however limited by the lack of large scale observations and research methods most of the previous studies were conducted at the point he et al 2012 lozano parra et al 2015 and slope scales huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 meanwhile the effect of single environmental factor on the infiltration has been well explored e g lozano parra et al 2015 while the comprehensive effects of environmental factors on infiltration are hardly reported research has shown that the major control factors of infiltration vary from soil properties at point scale such as soil organic carbon franzluebbers 2002 to slope position at hillslope scale green and erskine 2011 zhu et al 2014 thus the results from the small scale can t be used for the large scale meanwhile the spatial pattern and control mechanisms of infiltration at large scale are still unclear vereecken et al 2019 fan et al 2019 large scale mountainous ranges are ideal to analyze the relationships between environmental factors and infiltration process due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of topography vegetation and soil properties in the mountainous areas jin et al 2015 osenga et al 2019 however the control mechanisms of infiltration processes are still poorly understood in mountainous areas due to the difficulties of installing and maintaining large scale and long term profile soil moisture monitoring networks rahmati et al 2018 in a recent review by dorigo et al 2021 among the established long term soil moisture monitoring networks only 5 out of 69 large scale networks are located in high and cold mountainous areas su et al 2011 yang et al 2013 osenga et al 2019 out of those networks only few have focused on the infiltration process they explored the effect of vegetation on infiltration process at point or slope scale in high and cold mountain areas he et al 2012 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2017 dai et al 2019 niu et al 2021 they concluded that the infiltration capacity decreased with the vegetation degradation e g degrading from the forest or scrubland to grassland sun et al 2015 yang et al 2017 kang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 however studies have reported that meadow has lower dai et al 2019 niu et al 2021 or similar he et al 2012 infiltration capacity compared with grassland the lack of large scale in situ observations together with the high heterogeneity of infiltration processes in topographically complex mountainous areas makes the transfer of small scale information to larger scales very challenging clark et al 2015 vereecken et al 2019 limiting the accurate representation of infiltration in large scale modeling in mountainous areas within this context this study focuses on the infiltration processes in the qilian mountains which is a typical arid mountainous area in northwest china he et al 2018 based on profile sm data from a large scale long term 7 years observation network our objectives are 1 to quantify the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning at the large scale arid mountainous area 2 to analyze the relationship between infiltration partitioning with environmental factors including land cover topography soil properties and soil moisture and 3 to identify the major control factors for the infiltration partitioning in this arid topographically complex alpine region the findings can shed new light on soil hydrological processes and provide important information for supporting water resource management in alpine mountains 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study area is the upstream of the heihe river basin which is a typical terminal lake basin in an arid region and is located on the northeastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau it covers an area of approximately 2 7 104 km2 and has a range in elevation of approximately 2000 5600 m the region has an annual precipitation of 200 700 mm luo et al 2016 an annual potential evapotranspiration of 700 2000 mm and an annual mean temperature that ranges from 3 1 c to 7 c during 1960 2012 he et al 2018 substantial differences in climate and topography lead to strong variations in the spatial characteristics of the landscape in mountainous areas jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the study area mainly comprises grassland forestland and sparsely vegetated land zhou et al 2016 and the main soil types are silt loam sandy loam and silt usda classification and the loam and sandy loam soils are mainly located in the upper mountainous areas while the silt soils are mainly located in the river valleys lu et al 2017 mountain runoff provides almost all of the water supply for the entire watershed which sustains a population of over 1 2 million people irrigates 2 4 105 ha of farmland and supports a fragile ecological system in the watershed li et al 2015 2 2 soil moisture observation network a large scale sm monitoring network was established in july 2013 in the upstream of the heihe river basin to study soil hydrological processes the network is composed of 32 sm stations based on the representation of land use land cover soil topography and climate conditions in the study area fig 1 specifically we divided the study

tian et al 2019 between 2014 and 2020 data quality management was performed according to the data quality control method dorigo et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 1 excluding sm data during the seasonal

properties can be found in tian et al 2019 tian et al 2022 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is a product downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center https doi org 10 11888 terre tpdc 272681 the dataset was generated through the fusion of modis 250 m and landsat 30 m ndvi time series data using the gap filling and savitzky golay gf sg fusion method which has a spatial and temporal resolution of 30 m and 8 days chen et al 2021 cao et al 2022 the multi year average of annual maximum ndvi during 2014 2020 for each station was calculated as the average ndvi values of each stations 2 3 data analysis methods 2 3 1 determining the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning water is assumed to reach a certain depth within a soil profile when the sm content begins to increase after a rainfall pulse wang et al 2008 laio et al 2001 accordingly we adopt the concept of soil wetting event swe which is defined by a significant increase of sm due to rainfall infiltration into a soil column fig 2 detailed descriptions are in tian et al 2019 specifically the starting and ending times of infiltration events were determined for each station as follows fig 2 1 selecting the time series of continuous increase in soil moisture defining the time of the start of the soil moisture increase as the start time of the infiltration event and the time of the end of the soil moisture increase as the end of the infiltration event 2 combining infiltration events that occurred within 6 hours into the same event the rainfall infiltration process within soil profile was determined by using increases in sm at depths of 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 60 cm within the soil profile specifically for each swe after rainfall pulse the absolute accumulated increase in sm at each measurement depth was defined as follows mccoll et al 2017 tian et al 2019 1 asw i j t s t et δ θ t j with 2 δ θ t j δ θ t j δ θ t j 0 0 δ θ t j 0 and 3 δ θ t j θ t δ t j θ t j where θt j is the sm vol at the time t of the j th swe δt is the measurement interval 30 min st and et are the start and end time of the j th swe respectively and aswij is the accumulated soil water increment for the j th swe vol aswi was calculated for each depth at all sm stations and for all swes during growing seasons during the period 2014 2020 the amount of infiltration at each soil layer following a rainfall driven swe which is also described as the equivalent depth of water that enters the specific soil thickness during each swe was calculated based on aswi as follows bhark and small 2003 wang et al 2008 moran et al 2010 li et al 2013a 4 i i a s w i i d i here ii is the amount of infiltration also called soil storage increment at the i th soil layer for each swe aswii is the accumulated soil water increment for the i th soil layer for each swe and d i is the corresponding soil thickness for the i th layer we considered five layers i e i 1 5 that had corresponding sequential thicknesses of 10 cm d 1 0 10 cm 10 cm d 2 10 20 cm 10 cm d 3 20 30 cm 20 cm d 4 30 50 cm and 20 cm d 5 50 70 cm finally based on the calculated infiltration soil storage increment for each layer under the same swe infiltration partitioning at different layers within the soil profile was expressed using the percentage of soil storage increment in each layer compared to the whole soil profile psti for each rainfall driven swe the psti was calculated as follows 5 pst i i 100 i i i 1 5 i i where i 1 5 represents layers 1 to 5 psti values were also used to calculate the accumulated psti apsti between layers 2 and 4 as follows 6 apst i m i 1 m pst i i where m 2 4 represents the percentage of infiltration within the uppermost m layers compared to the whole soil profile the apsti of layer 1 is equal to the psti of layer 1 the apsti of layer 5 is equal to 100 and the apsti of layer 4 is equal to the difference between 100 and the psti of layer 5 2 3 2 random forest random forest rf is a collection of un pruned cart classification and regression tree since individual trees are randomly perturbed the forest benefits from a more extensive exploration of the space of all possible tree predictors which always results in better predictive performance therneau et al 2015 the importance calculation and the selection of variables in this study were implemented through the vsurf package in r genuer et al 2015 the steps are as follows 1 ranking and preliminary elimination ranking the variables by decreasing importance and eliminating the variables with low importance 2 selecting variables for interpretation starting with the model with only the most important variables and ending with the model involving all the previously selected important variables the average of the out of bag error oob error for these models is calculated and finally the model variables that lead to the lowest oob error are selected the oob error and variable importance vi were calculated as follows 7 ooberror 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 8 vi x j 1 q k 1 q ooberror k ooberror k where n is the number of samples y is the response variable y is the corresponding predicted value x is the explanatory

3 statistical analysis boxplots were used to show the degree of scatter within each dataset differences between the data in different groups were assessed using one way analysis of variance anova with a post hoc bonferroni test applied when the normality and homogeneity of variance of the datasets were satisfied the kruskal wallis anova with a post hoc dunn s test was used when these conditions were not satisfied derrac et al 2011 the significance level for acceptance was 0 05 for all statistical tests statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 results 3 1 infiltration under different land covers each swe and associated psti identified in each land cover type during the 2014 2020 growing seasons are summarized in table 1 and shown in fig 3 we observed total 2775 events in the first layer and the number of swe frequency decreased with depth in average 555 459 367 270 and 199 events were recorded for the first second third fourth and fifth layers respectively in all stations meanwhile psti also decreased significantly p 0 001 from the first layer mean psti 60 8 to the second layer mean psti 18 5 third layer mean psti 8 8 fourth layer mean and median psti of 7 8 and 0 respectively and fifth layer mean and median psti of 4 1 and 0 respectively notably the apsti at the second and third layers reached 78 4 median value 82 7 and 87 5 median value 100 respectively which indicates that infiltration into the first layer i e a depth of 0 10 cm comprised 60 standard deviation 26 of the total infiltration within the 70 cm deep soil profile meanwhile accumulated infiltration reached 78 standard deviation 21 and 88 standard deviation 15 for the upper two layers i e depths of 0 20 cm and three layers i e depths of 0 30 cm of the soil profile respectively the distribution of psti at each layer under different land cover types is shown in fig 3 among all land cover types scrub scrubland showed a significantly low psti mean value 50 within the first layer although deeper soil layers exhibited a significantly high psti with mean values of 12 6 11 8 and 8 3 for layers 3 4 and 5 respectively by contrast meadow had the highest psti mean value 74 5 within the first soil layer but the lowest psti in deep layers with mean values of 5 3 2 5 and 1 5 for layers 3 4 and 5 respectively among other land cover types barren barren land had the highest psti mean value 62 6 in the first layer medium coverage grassland mcg had the highest psti in both the second layer mean value 22 7 and third layer mean value 10 4 and high coverage grassland hcg had the highest psti in the fourth layer mean value 9 6 fig 3 shows that meadows had the significantly highest apsti values between layers 2 and 4 with mean values of 90 7 96 1 and 98 5 for layers 2 3 and 4 respectively by contrast scrub had the significantly lowest apsti values in these layers with mean values of 67 3 79 9 and 91 7 for layers 2 3 and 4 respectively differences in apsti values between hcg mcg and barren land cover types were not significant 3 2 infiltration under different soil moisture conditions based on the initial sm and psti at different layers of swe identified from all sm stations we analyzed the variations of psti with sm condition and conducted the scatterplot between psti of different layers and sm and the linear fitting relationships between them fig 4 results showed that the psti of layer 1 and layer 2 decreased significantly with the increase of sm the slopes of the linear fitting curve are 0 66 and 0 12 for layer 1 and layer 2 respectively the psti of layer 3 to layer 5 increased significantly with the increase of sm the slopes of linear fitting curve are 0 18 0 40 and 0 20 for the layer 3 layer 4 and layer 5 respectively furthermore we explored the variation of psti with sm for each sm stations results showed that the above relationships between psti and sm are valid for all the stations meanwhile only 3 sm stations showed different relationships between psti and sm that sm is positively correlated with psti at the first layer while negatively correlated with psti at the subsurface layers 3 3 infiltration under different topographic conditions we explored the influence of topography on psti by analyzing the variation of psti profiles beneath grassland in different types of terrain both hcg and mcg were included here as they recorded an insignificant difference in apsti the studied terrain conditions included seven hillslope stations and eight flatland stations as road access is limited in the mountainous areas stations on hillslopes are usually located on the lower or middle parts of the hillslope the psti results for the grassland hillslope and flatland conditions are shown in fig 5 a the flatland stations mean 65 1 had significantly higher psti values than the hillslope stations mean 56 1 in the first soil layer however the hillslope stations showed significantly higher psti values than the flatland stations in subsurface layers especially between layers 3 and 5 i e 20 70 cm depth specifically the flatland stations recorded mean psti values of 19 1 7 0 6 7 and 2 1 for layers 2 3 4 and 5 respectively whereas the hillslope stations recorded mean psti values of 20 0 10 1 9 5 and 4 4 for these layers respectively the median psti values at layer 4 were 0 for the flatland stations and 6 9 for the hillslope stations our results indicate that the hillslopes experienced a greater degree of infiltration partitioning at deeper layers than the flatland stations we also explored the influence of slope gradient on the psti distribution within different soil layers at the seven hillslope sm stations mentioned previously fig 5 b these stations were divided into three groups according to their slope gradient gentle slope 20 two sm stations moderate slope 20 30 three sm stations and steep slope 30 two sm stations the mean psti value in layer 1 significantly increased from gentle slope stations 48 to moderate slope stations 53 and again to steep slope stations 59 meanwhile psti in deep soil layers decreased significantly as slope gradient increased especially for layers 3 and 4 specifically the mean psti values in layer 3 for gentle moderate and steep slope stations were 12 7 11 3 and 10 5 respectively and were 14 2 9 1 6 1 for layer 4 respectively we classified the swe into four sm conditions through dividing by the 25th percentile 10 vol median 17 vol and 75th percentile 23 vol of initial sm these categories were 1 dry condition initial sm 10 vol 2 medium dry condition initial sm 10 17 vol 3 medium wet condition initial sm 17 23 vol and 4 wet condition initial sm 23 vol thus we explored the influence of topography on the psti values within soil layers at different sm conditions fig 6 results indicate that topography has a very similar influence on the psti patterns regardless of the sm conditions specifically the flatland regions have significantly higher psti values than the hillslope regions in layer 1 for example the mean psti values were 71 9 flatland and 60 hillslope under the dry sm conditions and 60 0 flatland and 50 1 hillslope under the wet sm conditions additionally the flatland stations had significantly lower psti values than the hillslope stations in the subsurface layers for the dry sm conditions with the mean psti values at layer 5 of 1 0 flatland and 2 9 hillslope respectively and mean psti values of 4 1 flatland and 6 3 hillslope for the wet sm conditions respectively 3 4 infiltration under different soil hydraulic properties variations in psti profiles according to soil hydraulic properties shp including soil texture i e proportion of sand and clay bulk soc and soil hydraulic properties n α θ s θ r and k s were analyzed to explore their influence on infiltration partitioning within soil profiles each soil property was divided into three groups according to the 25th and 75th percentiles of each range small the shp was smaller than the 25th percentile medium the shp was between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile and large the shp was greater than the 75th percentile as topography influences the psti we explored how psti varied according to different shp groups at the same topographic condition in flatland regions results are shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows that sand soc α and k s had a similar effect on the psti distribution within different layers as the above mentioned shps increased the psti decreased in the surface layer and increased in the subsurface layers meanwhile clay and bulk had a similar effect on the distribution of psti along each soil profile which is opposite the effects of sand soc α and k s for example in the case of sand content the mean psti values in layer 1 were 55 9 and 66 8 for large and small group the psti value for the large sand group had the mean values of 19 8 10 5 8 8 and 4 9 for layers 2 3 4 and 5 respectively whereas the small sand group had the mean psti values of 18 6 5 9 5 8 and 2 9 respectively for the same layers for soc the apsti decreased with the increasing soc within the first two layers i e 0 20 cm whereas the psti value increased significantly with the increasing soc in the subsurface layers i e 20 70 cm the psti value increased significantly with the increasing bulk in the first two layers with the mean psti values of 48 and 61 for the small and large bulk in layer 1 respectively however this psti value decreased significantly in subsurface layers i e 20 70 cm with the mean psti values of 7 4 and 1 6 for the small and large bulk in layer 5 respectively notably no other shps n θ s and θ r showed a clear relationship with infiltration partitioning 3 5 dominant factors that control infiltration partitioning the relative importance of environmental factors that control psti and apsti is shown in fig 8 overall the most influential factors that affect psti within a soil profile are sm α n soc clay and slope although the importance of these factors varies between layers the most important factor for layer 1 is n with an incmse increase in mean squared error the larger the value the more important the variable of 24 5 although α is most important for layers 2 and 3 with incmse values of 3 0 and 1 2 respectively other key controlling factors include α and sm for layer 1 slope soc and n for layer 2 and slope clay content and sm for layer 3 sm was the most important factor that controlled psti in layers 4 and 5 and apsti in layers 2 4 as the sum of apsti in layer 4 plus psti in layer 5 is necessarily 100 the apsti value in layer 4 was the same as the psti value in layer 5 in summary sm α n soc clay content and slope angle are important factors that control psti values along the soil profiles sm was the most important factor that affected psti at great depths i e 30 70 cm and apsti of all layers while α and n were the most important factors that controlled psti from layers 1 to 3 i e 0 30 cm 4 discussion 4 1 influence of vegetation on infiltration vegetation with deep roots has been argued to either favor infiltration by changing soil properties e g lozano parra et al 2015 jin et al 2018 or impede infiltration into deeper layers through root water uptake e g wang et al 2008 li et al 2013a liu et al 2016 in arid semi arid areas our results showed that scrub has the best capacity to deliver water into deep soil layers especially below 30 cm depth among the other land covers hcg had the highest psti values in layer 4 mcg had the highest psti values in layers 3 and 2 and meadow had the highest psti value in layer 1 these data show that the distribution of the highest psti values in different layers coincided with the root depths for different land cover types which field surveys have shown decreases sequentially between scrub hcg mcg meadow and barren tian et al 2017 tian et al 2019 previous studies also have shown that land cover types can influence soil properties for example k s and soc decreased from scrub to grassland and to barren in the study area while bulk has an opposite trend tian et al 2017 thus our results indicated that stations with more vegetation and longer roots have a greater capacity for allowing infiltration into the deeper layers of a soil column our results also indicated that meadows have the lowest capacity for infiltration into deep layers of a soil profile especially at depths 30 cm meadows retained most infiltrated water in the upper soil layer i e 95 retention within 0 20 cm depth due to the influence of mattic epipedon that forms by long term interactions between abundant roots and soil lowering the soil s hydraulic conductivity zeng et al 2013 tian et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 thus we interpret that meadows favor retaining water at the mattic epipedon layer and block its infiltration into deeper soil layers which is consistent with previous studies e g dai et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 niu et al 2021 thus the special influence of mattic epipedon should be considered when representing the hydrological processes for meadow biomes 4 2 impact of topography on infiltration hillslope has been reported to affect vertical patterns of infiltration partitioning via the generation of 1 lateral subsurface flow which increases infiltration partitioning for subsurface layer svoray et al 2021 2 surface runoff which reduces the infiltration into deep soil layers wang and chen 2021 or 3 by influencing soil properties keesstra et al 2018 we found that the hillslope stations have greater infiltration partitioning within subsurface soil layers fig 5 a which implies the possible influence of lateral flow at the hillslope stations furthermore fig 6 indicates that infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers was always greater on the hillslope stations than on the flatland stations in both dry i e initial sm 11 nearly 20 of θ s saturated sm and wet sm conditions i e initial sm 21 nearly 40 of θ s however hillslope lateral flow occurs only when the initial sm reaches a threshold e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006a moran et al 2010 previous studies have identified this threshold as being close to the saturated sm θ s in alpine grassland penna et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 therefore it is difficult to generate subsurface lateral flow under dry sm conditions lower than 20 of θ s as soil properties influence infiltration partitioning patterns we explored the influence of topography on soil properties fig 9 our results showed that the hillslope stations had significantly higher k s and lower clay contents than the flatland stations while there were no significant differences between other soil properties previous results have also shown that lower k s and higher clay contents occur at the toe of a hillslope compared to those on a hillslope itself archer et al 2013 papanicolaou et al 2015 higher k s and lower clay contents both favor infiltration to greater depths within a soil profile fig 6 thus we infer that the effect of hillslope on infiltration partitioning was mainly due to the influence of the hillslope on soil properties our results also indicated that the decreased infiltration partitioning at deep soil layers correlated with the increasing slope gradients fig 5 b this can be caused by the increasing slope gradients that converted more rainfall into surface runoff and thus reduced overall infiltration e g huang et al 2013 wang and chen 2021 4 3 influence of soil properties on infiltration we found that sand content soc α and k s all enhanced the infiltration of surface water into deep depths while the soil s clay content and bulk density had the opposite effect here k s represents the ability to transmit water along with soil gupta et al 2021 thus allowing infiltration to greater depths sand has been reported to facilitate water transmission along soil profiles reynolds et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 gupta et al 2021 and reduce the water holding capacity of the soil khlosi et al 2013 thus facilitating infiltration into deep depth by contrast clay and bulk density impede water transmission which in turn impedes infiltration higher soc has been reported to impede infiltration into deep soil due to its high water holding capacity yang et al 2014 yu et al 2017 dai et al 2020 but also to facilitate the infiltration process through soil aggregation and improving soil structure ruehlmann and körschens 2009 fatichi et al 2020 our results showed that soc promoted infiltration to great depths in the study area fig 6 in addition α represents the reciprocal of the air entry value assouline 2021 and was positively correlated with k s in the study area pearson s r 0 29 p 0 01 tian et al 2022 showing that it facilitated infiltration 4 4 major factors that control infiltration partitioning the coevolution and inherent interactions of those environmental factors complicate the influence of environmental factors on infiltration processes lin et al 2006 vereecken et al 2016 such complexity has been reported for influence of soil texture and soc on bulk ruehlmann and körschens 2009 ramcharan et al 2017 and soil hydraulic parameters i e k s and parameters related to the soil retention curve zhang et al 2018 gupta et al 2021 in addition topography can influence environmental factors such as vegetation sm and soil properties tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fan et al 2019 while vegetation will influence soil properties through interactions between roots and the soil itself vereecken et al 2016 fatichi et al 2020 interactions between environmental factors lead to variable major control factors and patterns of the infiltration process depending on the environment and scale ma et al 2017 vereecken et al 2019 vereecken et al 2022 our work has indicated that the pattern of infiltration partitioning along a soil profile is influenced by a combination of environmental factors such as vegetation cover soil properties soil hydration state and topography in addition the major factors in controlling pattern of infiltration partitioning are n for layer 1 α for layers 2 3 and sm for the psti value of the other layers and apsti for all layers topographic slope soc and clay content also have an important influence furthermore our results indicate the water conditions control the infiltration partitioning at deep layers which is potential for groundwater recharge previous studies focused on the total amount of infiltration within a soil profile initial sm was determined to be the major control on infiltration logsdon 2015 dai et al 2019 which matches our results of accumulated psti along the soil profile notably rainfall has also been reported to significantly influence the infiltration process e g laio et al 2001 he et al 2012 yang et al 2017 which is not analyzed in our study this is due to the lack of in situ rainfall observations and the current reanalysis datasets e g china meteorological forcing dataset are not effective in estimating rainfall in mountainous areas lai et al 2022 4 5 assessing the quantification of infiltration partitioning patterns we used soil wetting events tian et al 2019 to determine infiltration partitioning at different depths within a soil profile by calculating psti and apsti indices this allowed us to quantify the amount of water received by each soil layer during the infiltration process these results extend those of previous studies which either described infiltration qualitatively or determined the infiltration pattern for an entire soil profile critically our infiltration partitioning data for the deepest soil layer 50 70 cm provides a reference for inferring groundwater recharge schaffitel et al 2021 maihemuti et al 2021 infiltration partitioning data for the depth range where plant roots occur provides a reference for converting rainfall into plant available water laio et al 2001 in addition it can intuitively reflect the capacity of infiltration to deliver water to greater depths within soil under different conditions the influence of environmental factors on the partition pattern of infiltration varied at different depths in this study the soil profile of 0 70 cm was divided into 5 layers based on the depths of the 5 soil sensors tian et al 2019 the soil sensors at depths of 5 cm 15 cm 25 cm 40 cm and 60 cm represent sm at soil ranges of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm and 50 70 cm respectively however the actual measurement range of the 5te soil sensor is around 5 cm above and below the soil sensor cobos and chambers 2010 which may cause uncertainty in the calculation of soil storage increment for the fourth and fifth layers furthermore the calculation of psti involves soil thickness which should be calibrated with the rock fragment percentage to reflect real soil volume and get the real psti van wesemael et al 2000 however due to the absence of rock fragment measurement at each station we didn t calibrate the soil thickness using rock fragment percentage which can lead to some uncertainty about the psti 5 conclusion we performed a seven year series of in situ sm observations over a large scale arid mountainous area to quantitatively analyze the infiltration process the patterns and control factors of infiltration partitioning along soil profiles were quantified by calculating the psti which is the proportion by which soil water storage increases in each layer of the soil profile during infiltration the main findings are outlined below 1 stations with more vegetation and deeper roots have a higher capacity for infiltration penetrating into the deep soil layers the capacity decreases in scrub high coverage grassland medium coverage grassland and barren land respectively meadows containing mattic epipedon had the lowest capacity for infiltration into the deep soil layers with water being preferentially retained at the surface layers 2 infiltration into the lower layers of a soil profile was more effective under a wet sm condition than under a dry sm condition 3 hillslope stations had greater infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers than flatland stations as the hillslope stations contained soil with higher k s values and lower clay contents in addition the capacity for infiltration reaching greater soil depths decreased with the increasing slope 4 sand soc α and k s all facilitated infiltration to greater depths whereas clay and bulk density had the opposite effect 5 major factors controlling the pattern of infiltration partitioning at various depths included n for 0 10 cm depth α for 10 30 cm depth and sm for 30 70 cm additionally the accumulated psti along soil profile was mainly controlled by sm for all depths the above described indices allowed for quantitative investigation of the vertical partitioning of water infiltration based on a profile s sm time series more importantly our data and analysis provide new insights into infiltration regimes under different environmental conditions and could be used to support ecosystem restoration and water resources management in arid mountainous

on parameter sensitivity were compared using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results showed that the accuracy of the three pps were ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr on the watershed average scale hrlt would underestimate the extreme precipitation and persiann cdr would overestimate the annual precipitation on the grid to point scale persiann cdr was found to be the most stable

2022a water resource management duan et al 2021 refsgaard and abbott 1990 and water pollution control fan et al 2022 iavorivska et al 2021 however in many regions the density of rain gauges is sparse with most being established in recent years which makes the existing precipitation records not meeting the demand for relevant studies in these regions ma et al 2019 as many types of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products have been developed to be the succedaneum of gauge precipitation gp this problem has been gradually resolved in recent years an increasing number of studies have evaluated the performance and accuracy of various precipitation products pps liu et al 2022 musie et al 2019 pang et al 2020 the most extensively used satellite and reanalysis pps are precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr hsu et al 1997 the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc global precipitation dataset xie et al 2007 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation dataset huffman et al 2007 many scholars have verified the accuracy of these pps by comparing them with gp for example hur et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of trmm in singapore by comparing it with the gp during 2000 2010 and results showed that trmm underestimated the high intensity precipitation and overestimated the low intensity precipitation gao et al 2018 analyzed the accuracy of ncep cfsr trmm and persiann cdr using gp during 1987 2013 at eight precipitation stations within xiang river basin of china and results showed that persiann cdr was unable to detect the geographical distribution of rainfall events and ncep cfsr showed higher accuracy than persiann cdr and trmm and sun et al 2021 analyzed the ability of persiann cdr in distinguishing extreme precipitation comparing gp during 1983 2012 within the huai river basin and results showed that persiann cdr exhibited significant limitation in embodying the extreme precipitation variations in addition to assessing the accuracy of satellite and reanalysis of pps more studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of various pps in forcing hydrological models over the past decades many studies have been conducted to test and evaluate the performance of diverse latest or long term satellite or reanalysis pps in forcing hydrological models liu et al 2022 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2018 ma et al 2019 analyzed the performance of ncep cfsr persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 for streamflow q and sediment yield sy simulations using the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the lancang mekong river basin and the results indicated that these pps could perform well in simulating q and sy musie et al 2019 analyzed the ability of cfsr chirps persiann cdr and trmm in daily q simulation within the lake ziway basin of ethiopia and the results indicated that the performance of these pps on q simulation was average with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 5 0 6 according to sun et al 2018 the performance of tmpa cmorph bld cmorph cma and gsmap gauge on q simulation for the vic model were comparable with a nse range of 0 62 0 80 0 39 0 51 during the calibration validation period the performance of various pps in forcing a hydrological model varied in different regions and most of these simulations were performed over a short period the short term simulation made it difficult to verify whether these pps could stably force these hydrological models gillner et al 2013 liu et al 2017 in addition most studies selected q as the simulation variable seldom concentrating on other variables such as sy and nutrients sedimentation is an important ecological process that can be simulated by an eco hydrological model such as swat wei et al 2022a simulating the sediment process properly could benefit the determination of the prone area for soil erosion prevention work yu et al 2021 which greatly help in controlling soil erosion if the various pps could perform well in sediment simulation however relevant studies related to these are still scarce huaihe river basin hrb is a paramount food production base located in the mid eastern part of china and it suffers from severe soil erosion as revealed by cai et al 2012 the upper hrb uhrb which is controlled by the wangjiaba hydrological station contributed 68 4 of the sy of the total hrb the uhrb occupies only 11 of the total hrb area thus it is important to conduct relevant studies to support soil erosion prevention in the uhrb however most studies relevant to long term historical spatial temporal simulations of q and sy within the hrb have mainly concentrated on a period of less than 20a due to the lack of long term observed precipitation this has created difficulties in revealing the long term variation in soil erosion within the critical regions of the hrb the appearance of long term high resolution satellites and reanalysis of the pps offer an opportunity for long term hydrological simulation within the uhrb to date some studies have verified the performance of various pps in q simulations within the hrb jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however no study has been conducted to examine if these products can perform well in sy simulation in addition the high resolution daily gridded precipitation dataset for china hrlt developed by rongzhu et al 2022 at lanzhou university and first published in 2022 covered the years 1961 2019 with a spatial resolution of 1 km however no study has yet confirmed its ability to be used in forcing a hydrological model the characteristic of long term periods and high resolution makes it a good choice for precipitation input for multiple hydrological models in china as well as for environmental analyses the uhrb was selected as the research location for this study and the accuracy and performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc in the hydrological simulation were evaluated by comparing with gp and the hydrological data for the period of 2000 2019 the main purposes of the study were 1 to evaluate the accuracy of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc during 2000 2019 by comparing them with the gp records at multiple spatial temporal scales 2 to reveal the effects of different pps on the sensitivity of q parameters in swat 3 to evaluate the performance of these pps in long term q and sy simulations in swat using two calibration scenarios and 4 to evaluate the spatial simulation performance of these products in runoff and sediment generation 2 study area the hrb is situated between 111 55 121 20 e and 30 55 36 20 n covering an area of 2 7 105 km2 the huaihe river originates from the tongbai and dabie mountains passes through five provinces anhui henan hubei shandong and jiangsu and finally converges towards the yellow sea as the hrb is a transitional area between the eastern china s sub tropical and temperate climates the spatial temporal variation of climatic factors is obvious and complicated wei et al 2022b the wangjiaba wjb hydrological station is a demarcation point of the upper hrb uhrb and middle hrb mhrb with a drainage area of 3 02 104 km2 fig 1

is intensive in the uhrb 3 data and methodologies the overall technical flow of our study is displayed in fig 2 3 1 data 3 1 1 pps basic information on the three pps is presented in table 1 in this study the three pps during 1998 2019 were used to test their accuracy and performance in long term hydrological simulations 1 hrlt precipitation dataset a high resolution daily gridded precipitation

km spatial resolution from 1961 to 2019 which is the highest spatial resolution among the existing pps the hrlt dataset was interpolated based on a 0 5 0 5 grid dataset obtained from the china

weather generator parameters for the swat model 3 2 pps evaluation methods to assess the accuracy of the selected pps hrlt persiann cdr and cpc within the uhrb they were compared with the gp for the period of 2000 2019 at multiple spatiotemporal scales on a temporal scale the pps were contrasted with the gp at daily monthly and annual scales on a spatial scale the pps were contrasted with the gp at the watershed average scale first subsequently comparison at a grid scale was conducted when evaluating the pps at the watershed average scale as the hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were grid pps and rain gauges were uniformly distributed within the uhrb fig 1 four average precipitation series from different sources rain gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were calculated using the arithmetic average method based on the precipitation series of the grids or gauge stations within the uhrb afterwards the evaluation indicators were calculated for the three pps and gauge series at daily monthly and annual scales when evaluating the pps at a grid scale for each grid of all the pps the precipitation series of the rain gauge stations in the grid was selected to evaluate the accuracy of the pps of that grid the evaluation indicators used for assessing the accuracy of the pps were mainly divided into two categories continuous and detection indicators in this study four continuous indicators correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse relative bias bias and nse and five detection indicators probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi frequency bias index fbi and equitable threat score ets were chosen as evaluation indicators to assess the accuracy of these pps which have been extensively used in existing studies ma et al 2019 musie et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 cc rmse bias and nse indicate the consistency medial error relative systematic errors and residual variance between the pps and gp respectively musie et al 2019 pod far csi fbi and ets reveal the accuracy of rainfall event prediction for these pps zeng et al 2018 the definitions and calculation methods of the nine indicators are shown in table s1 3 3 swat model the swat model one of the most popular semi distributed hydrological models was designed by the agricultural research center of the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 the swat splits the watershed into multiple sub watersheds based on the dem and the sub watersheds are further divided into several hydrologic response units hrus based on a special combination of land use soil type and slope belt based on its structural characteristics it has been widely used in many ecological and environmental fields such as hydrology dash et al 2021 gull and shah 2022 ecology aznarez et al 2021 lin et al 2022 and watershed management wei et al 2022a yu et al 2021 the water balance equation equation 1 is the basis of the water circulation simulation in the swat 1 s w t s w

the base flow on the day i mm in swat the q simulation is separated into two sections runoff generation and flow routing in this study the two processes were calculated using the scs curve number boughton 1989 and characteristic river length method williams 1969 respectively the sy simulation in swat is separated into sediment generation and channel transport the modified universal soil loss equation musle was used to simulate the sediment generation process the simplified bagnold equation was adopted to simulate the sediment channel transport in this study the musle equation is as

flow direction calculation and the 125 sub watersheds were subdivided into 1018 hrus based on the unique combination of land use soil and slope belt four swat models were established based on four precipitation inputs gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc all of which were consistent except that the precipitation input changed 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation swat cup 2019 abbaspour 2013 was selected as a tool to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters and calibrate the sensitive parameters the t and p values calculated using the global sensitivity analysis method koo et al 2020 song et al 2015 integrated into the swat cup were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters for 1998 2019 parameters with a higher t and lower p values indicated higher sensitivity with a higher impact on the target variable abbaspour 2013 in this study all parameters were included in the sensitivity analysis with 2000 runs for an iteration and the parameters with a p value lower than 0 1 were selected to be calibrated for the target variable dos santos et al 2021 the sufi 2 algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters and has been widely used in related studies narsimlu et al 2015 shivhare et al 2018 singh and jha 2021 in this study the calibration strategy introduced by ranjan and mishra 2022 was used for each precipitation input the sensitive parameters were calibrated for 2000 runs per iteration and the best parameter set was selected for conducting a single simulation for validation the warm up calibration and validation periods were 1998 1999 2000 2011 and 2012 2019 respectively kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 a comprehensive indicator that reflects the accuracy of the consistency and volume of the simulation results compared to the measured dataset was selected as the objective function during the calibration process in addition the coefficient of determination r2 nse and percent bias pbias were also selected to evaluate the performance of swat forced by four precipitation sources the calculation methods of kge r2 nse and pbias are shown in table s2 the performance rating standard proposed by moriasi et al 2007 was employed to determine the performance rank of swat forced by the four precipitation sources the rating standards are presented in table s3 3 5 hydrological simulation scenarios the performance of different pps on forcing the swat model was analyzed under two scenarios s1 gp was used as the precipitation input and the fittest parameter set was obtained after parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration afterwards the fittest parameter set was used for simulating q and sy in the swat model forced by different pps the results simulated by different pps were compared at both temporal and spatial scales s2 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were performed for the swat model forced by different pps separately and afterward the differences in the results of sensitive parameters and performance indicators were analyzed 4 results 4 1 accuracy evaluation of different pps 4 1 1 evaluation of continuous indicators 1 comparison on a watershed scale the average precipitation series for the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc are shown in fig 3 the average daily precipitations of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 2 47 2 62 2 89 and 2 68 mm respectively the average monthly precipitation of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 75 12 79 88 88 10 and 81 42 mm respectively and the average annual precipitation of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 901 5 958 59 1057 21 and 977 09 mm respectively at a daily scale almost all pps showed poor performance for the extremely highest precipitation and the extreme precipitation of the cpc was found to be the highest than other pps in most years at a monthly scale the precipitation series of hrlt and cpc were significantly consistent with those of the gauges for almost the entire period and that of the persiann cdr were found to be evidently higher than the other pps in most cases at an annual scale the hrlt precipitation series were significantly consistent with the gp series during 2000 2014 but it evidently overestimated for the period of 2015 2016 persiann cdr overestimated the annual precipitation over almost the entire period and cpc was highly consistent with the gp series with a slight overestimation during the evaluation periods the statistics of the continuous indicators of the three pps at multiple temporal scales are presented in table 2 the cc of cpc was highest at all temporal scales and cc of hrlt and persiann cdr were similar at all temporal scales and lower than that of cpc the ccs of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 63 0 97 and 0 92 0 67 0 93 and 0 93 and 0 94 0 98 and 0 98 respectively at a daily monthly and annual scale the daily rmse was ranked as cpc 2 46 mm persiann cdr 5 59 mm hrlt 6 22 mm while the monthly and annual rmse were ranked as cpc 17 73 and 86 76 mm hrlt 20 59 and 106 35 mm persiann cdr 31 09 and 175 51 mm respectively the rmse of persiann cdr was significantly higher at the monthly and annual scales compared to the other pps in addition the differences between the rmse of different pps increased when the temporal scale increased for bias the value for each pp was kept the same at daily monthly and annual scales with the value of 6 22 16 69 and 8 38 for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc respectively this indicated that the deviation of hrlt was the lowest and that of persiann cdr was the highest and persiann cdr overestimates overall precipitation more than hrlt and cpc the nse values of cpc were the highest at all temporal scales with the value range of 0 84 0 95 and the nses of hrlt and persiann cdr were highest at the monthly scale 0 93 and 0 84 followed by the annual 0 77 and 0 37 and daily scale 0 28 and 0 42 respectively comprehensively the continuous accuracy of the three pps at the watershed average scale was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr 2 direct comparison grid to point cc rmse bias and nse were calculated for all paired grids of the pps hrlt persiann cdr and cpc and rain gauge stations for 2000 2019 and the results are displayed in table 3 similar to the results at the watershed average scale for comparing these pps grid to point the cc rmse and nse were kept different at different temporal scales while the bias was kept the same overall the accuracy of each pp decreased when the grid to point was compared with that at the watershed average scale cc was found to be higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scales for all the pps the rank ordering of cc was cpc persiann cdr hrlt at all temporal scales the rmses of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 9 43 47 87 and 224 4 8 35 47 12 and 240 05 and 5 78 37 41 and 161 33 mm respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the rmse values for all the pps were higher than those for the watershed average scale for bias the values for all the pps were the same as those for the watershed average scale the nse was evidently higher at the monthly scale compared to that at daily and annual scales for all the pps and the nse of cpc was higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr when evaluating these precipitation products grid to point based on the continuous indicators the comprehensive accuracy was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr in addition for hrlt gauge persiann cdr gauge and cpc gauge a total of 65 41 and 16 pairs of precipitation series were collected respectively for each pair a gauge was located in the grid of each pp the evaluation indicators for all the paired precipitation series were calculated and are shown in fig 4 the ranges for cc for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 30 0 59 0 74 0 94 and 0 54 0 93 0 23 0 59 0 75 0 92 and 0 57 0 92 and 0 38 0 88 0 75 0 95 and 0 73 0 96 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the ranges for rmse for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 7 62 11 19 27 29 65 28 and 96 68 439 43 7 36 10 23 39 89 68 75 and 111 93 482 53 and 4 36 9 65 26 56 65 89 and 83 46 304 46 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the bias values for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were consistent at all temporal scales ranging from 30 06 64 52 7 49 71 31 and 9 08 48 13 respectively the ranges for nse for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 26 0 33 0 49 0 87 and 3 3 0 86 0 09 0 35 0 50 0 80 and 2 92 0 73 and 0 02 0 77 0 55 0 89 and 0 69 0 86 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the continuous accuracies of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were all higher in the middle and southern uhrb and lower in the northwestern uhrb at all temporal scales figure s1 s3 and all the pps overestimated the precipitation amount at most locations at all temporal scales within the uhrb among all the pps cpc was the most accurate and stable followed by hrlt which has the optimal bias 4 1 2 evaluation of detection indicators as shown in table 4 the detection indicators of the three pps were different at both watershed and grid to point scales for all chosen detection indicators the performance of the three pps was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr at the watershed scale the pod and csi of cpc were higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr indicating that cpc performed well in detecting the rainfall events far of cpc was the lowest followed by hrlt and persiann cdr which indicated that the possibility of the false alarm was rank as cpc hrlt persiann cdr fbi for all the pps were higher than 1 which indicated that all the pps overestimated the rainfall events with different degrees and ets of the three pps was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr indicating that the cpc was more efficient in detecting rainfall events compared to hrlt and persiann cdr the selected detection indicators of the three pps were slightly worse at the grid to point scale compared to those at the watershed scale the variations in different detection indicators were diverse for all the pps fig 5 cpc performed well for all detection indicators showing high accuracy the ranges for pod far csi and ets for perisann cdr were smaller than those for hrlt and cpc indicating that persiann cdr was more stable in detecting rainfall events at different locations for most detection indicators persiann cdr and cpc had some stations with significantly lower accuracy than the other stations but the phenomenon seldom appeared for hrlt the decrease in detection indicators at a grid to point scale compared to that at the watershed scale might have been caused by these stations which had extremely lower accuracy figure s4 shows the spatial distribution of the detection indicators for different pps the hrlt performed well in detecting the rainfall events in the middle and southwestern uhrb the persiann cdr performed worse in detecting the rainfall events in the central and edge of the uhrb and the cpc performed well for most points with only three points having slightly lower accuracy 4 2 performances of swat forcing by different pps 4 2 1 comparison of model performances under s1 under s1 the overall performance of the swat forced by different pps are presented in table 5 for q simulation r2 nse pbias and kge for the gp were 0 91 0 81 0 89 0 81 4 5 0 3 and 0 88 0 83 respectively during the calibration validation period for sy simulation r2 nse pbias and kge for the gp were 0 62 0 79 0 59 0 74 0 7 10 2 and 0 80 0 63 respectively during the calibration validation period this suggests that the gp could obtain vg vg and s g performance in the q and sy simulation respectively during the calibration validation period when the precipitation input changed into other pps the performance of swat in the q and sy simulations declined cpc performed best among all the pps in simulating q and sy followed by persiann cdr and hrlt all the pps overestimated q compared to gp during both the calibration and validation periods the performance of cpc on the q and sy simulations was closest to that of gp and only overestimated q during the validation period hrlt performed well in consistency compared to the other pps with a high value of r2 close to that of the gp the lower nse of hrlt might have been caused by the high value of overestimation which was shown by the high value of pbias as shown in fig 4 the daily rmse of hrlt was evidently higher than that of persiann cdr and cpc persiann cdr showed an s and us performance on q simulation during the calibration and validation periods and showed a us performance on sy simulation during both the calibration and validation periods with regards to pbias perisiann cdr showed a g vg performance in the sy simulation fig 6 shows a comparison of the measured and simulated q and sy series simulated forced by different pps under s1 fig 6 clearly shows that the volumes of q and sy during the calibration period were higher than those during the validation period this may have accounted for the difference in the performance of swat during the calibration and validation periods the q series simulated forced by gp and cpc were comparable the q series simulated forced by persiann cdr was higher than the measured q most times the q series simulated forced by hrlt was the highest among all series especially when the peak value appeared which might have been the reason for the low nse for the q simulation forced by hrlt these results suggested that cpc was the best succedaneum for gp in the q simulation whereas hrlt and persiann cdr performed worse than cpc the sy series exhibited a trend similar to that of the corresponding q series the sy during the flood season was significantly higher than those of other periods within a year for most peak values the simulated sy was higher than the measured value among all the pps the simulated sy series forced by cpc was the most similar to that forced by gp which indicated that cpc was probably the most suitable alternative for gp in the sy simulation except for cpc persiann cdr overestimated sy for most years but for many years it simulated the sy series well the hrlt overestimated sy during the entire period especially for the peak value these differences in performance for different years might have been caused by the accuracy of different pps in those years which further proved that the accuracy of precipitation input is significantly important for proper hydrological process simulations in a hydrological model 4 2 2 differences in spatial simulation forced by different pps under s1 the subwatershed precipitation water yields wy and sy at the annual and flood season scales were collected according to the output file of the calibrated swat model forced by each pp under s1 and were compared to those forced by gp the results are shown in fig 8 and fig 10 the spatial distribution of precipitation wy and sy at the annual and flood season scales are shown in fig 7 and fig 9 1 comparison on an annual scale the ccs of the sub watershed precipitation between gp and hrlt persiann cdr and cpc precipitation were 0 57 0 53 and 0 57 respectively in most sub watersheds the precipitation of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc was higher than that of gp this phenomenon was more evident for persiann cdr and hrlt as shown in fig 7 p1 gp varied within uhrb with high heterogeneity which did not show an obvious distribution characteristic however for the pps the precipitation showed an obvious gradient which gradually increased from northwest to southeast and the spatial variation of hrlt and cpc was more obvious than that of persiann cdr the cc of the sub watershed wy between the simulation results forced by gp and those forced by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 66 0 60 and 0 72 respectively this indicated that cpc performed well in the wy spatial simulation compared to other pps hrlt overestimated wy in almost all sub watersheds and persiann cdr overestimated wy in most sub watersheds as shown in fig 7 p1 and w1 the spatial distribution of precipitation and wy were similar and the sub watersheds were higher in wy where precipitation was higher however this phenomenon has not been discovered for any other pps as sub watersheds with higher precipitation do not generate more wy compared to the sub watersheds with lower precipitation wy simulated forced by hrlt was higher in almost the whole watershed compared with that simulated forced by gp wys simulated forced by persiann cdr and cpc were similar to those simulated forced by gp with less spatial variability the ccs of the sub watershed sy between the simulation results forced by gp and those forced by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were the same with a value of 0 93 fig 8 overall this indicated that all the pps could simulate sy well at the sub watershed scale the results shown in fig 8 do not include the extreme values occurring in the sub watersheds located in the southeastern uhrb fig 7 these sub watersheds were mainly dominated by agricultural land with a high slope where would generate more sediment than other regions compared to the sub watershed sy simulated forced by gp the sub watershed sy simulated forced by cpc was closest while that simulated forced by hrlt and persiann cdr was overestimated and underestimated respectively the value of sy simulated forced by gp ranged from 0 to 52 36 t ha and gradually decreased from southwest to northeast fig 7 and a similar trend was found for the simulation results forced by all the pps but the high sy in the sub watersheds located in the southeastern uhrb were underestimated with the highest values of 30 64 21 85 and 32 94 t ha for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc respectively 2 comparison during flood season as shown in fig 10 during the flood season the ccs of sub watershed precipitation wy and sy between gp and hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 73 0 69 and 0 96 0 66 0 59 and 0 95 and 0 78 0 70 and 0 97 respectively the cc of sub watershed precipitation was higher during the flood season than for the entire year no obvious differences were observed between wy and sy this indicated that the annual wy and sy within the uhrb might have mainly depended on the flood season during the flood season hrlt underestimated the precipitation and overestimate wy persiann cdr overestimated wy and sy and cpc underestimates sy fig 8 and fig 10 show that the variations in the flood season precipitation and wy were smaller than those at the annual scale for all pps this indicated that the difference between gp and pps could mainly exist in the non flood season fig 7 and fig 9 show that the spatial distribution characteristic of wy and sy were similar during both the flood season and entire year but the spatial distribution characteristic of precipitation during the flood season showed less variation than that during the entire year this phenomenon also indicated that wy and sy mainly occurred during the flood season in the uhrb especially sy the average sy during the flood season and entire year simulated by gp were 39 50 and 52 36 t ha respectively while those simulated by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 20 28 16 19 and 23 16 and 30 64 21 85 and 32 94 t ha respectively this suggested that the pps underestimated the spatial sy during the non flood season further underestimating the sy at the annual scale in general all the pps could simulate the sy spatial distribution well and cpc and hrlt performed well in simulating the wy spatial distribution 4 3 effects of different pps on parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration to understand the effect of different pps on parameter sensitivity and calibration in the swat model parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted four times for the swat model forced by different pps s2 to reduce the parameter uncertainty of the q simulation a parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted for the parameters relevant to the q process and the sensitive q parameters were calibrated and validated for swat for the sy parameters the amount was not significantly high hence all of them were taken considered for calibration and validation 4 3 1 differences in q parameter sensitivity analysis the q parameter analysis and parameter calibration results are presented in table s4 and it can be seen that the q parameter sensitivity changed when the swat was driven by different pps the most sensitive parameters for the q simulation were esco alpha bnk sol z and cn2 esco represents the soil evaporation compensation factor and is relevant for soil water and evaporation processes alpha bnk represents the baseflow alpha factor for bank storage and is relevant for the baseflow recharge process sol z represents the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer which is relevant for the water infiltration and soil water processes cn2 represents the scs streamflow curve number ⅱ which varied in different hrus during the simulation affecting the runoff generation when swat was forced by gp gwqmn gw revap revapmn and ch n2 were identified as the sensitive parameters gw revap and revapmn were related to the evapotranspiration process gwqmn was related to the groundwater recharge process and ch n2 was related to the flow concentration process when swat was forced by hrlt gwqmn gw revap revapmn sol awc gw delay ch k2 rchrg dp epco alpha bf canmx smfmn and sol k were also identified as the sensitive parameters rchrg dp gw delay and alpha bf were related to the groundwater process canmx and epco were related to the evapotranspiration process sol awc and sol k were related to the soil water process ch k2 was related to the channel flow process and smfmn was related to the snowmelt process when swat was forced by persiann cdr gwqmn gw revap revapmn ch n2 gw delay rchrg dp and alpha bf were also identified as the sensitive parameters when swat was forced by cpc the gwqmn gw revap revapmn ch n2 ch k2 alpha bf and sol k were also identified as the sensitive parameters in general the amount of q sensitive parameters for swat when forced by gp hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 9 15 10 and 10 respectively the sensitive parameters for gp were averagely distributed for almost all the processes and the sensitive parameters for hrlt mainly controlled the evapotranspiration five parameters soil water four parameters and groundwater four parameters process while the sensitive parameters for persiann cdr mainly controlled the evapotranspiration two parameters and groundwater five parameters processes and the sensitive parameters for cpc mainly controlled the groundwater four parameters processes these results may indicated that the precipitation inputs could influence the sensitivity of the parameters during hydrological simulation in swat this effect might have been caused by the spatial resolution of different precipitation inputs bárdossy and das 2008 huang et al 2018 and the equifinality of different parameters in the distributed hydrological models in our study the amount of rain gauges used in swat was 60 and the virtual stations of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc used were 123 54 and 19 respectively 4 3 2 comparison between the model performances under s2 the overall performance of swat forced by different pps under s2 table 6 was better than that observed under s1 table 5 under s2 the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr in the q and sy simulations have evidently improved after parameter calibration the performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc on q simulation were ranked as vg us s s and vg vg respectively during the calibration validation period the performances of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc on sy simulation were ranked as us s us us and s g respectively during the calibration validation period the performance of cpc on the q and sy simulations were the closest to that of gp during calibration and validation as shown in fig 11 the q and sy values simulated by cpc were very consistent with the measured values compared to those simulated by other pps hrlt performed well in the q and sy simulations during the calibration period similar to that of gp and cpc but did not perform well during the validation period we found that the main cause of this poor performance was the precipitation input in 2016 the precipitation of hrlt during 2016 was higher than the measured precipitation which resulted in the high values of q and sy further resulting in a low nse disregarding the simulation results for 2016 the nse of q and sy during the validation period increased to 0 74 indicating a good performance for q and sy simulation persiann cdr did not perform well in q and sy simulations even after parameter calibration 5 discussion persiann cdr and cpc were both long term pps covering over 20 years persiann cdr has been widely evaluated in many studies alijanian et al 2017 gao et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 cpc has been used as a benchmark in some studies nguyen et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2019 indicating that the accuracy of cpc has been accepted in many regions in our study the accuracy of cpc was the highest among the selected pps at all temporal scales for persiann cdr the average cc was 0 52 0 84 and 0 75 at the daily monthly and annual scales respectively which showed good performance this result was consistent with that of sun et al 2019 who reported that the r values between gp and persiann cdr ranged from 0 48 to 0 59 within the hrb with a mean value of 0 54 in addition persiann cdr performed poorly in capturing the spatial distribution of the precipitation which was consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 but different from the result obtained by sun et al 2019 and alijanian et al 2017 this difference may have been caused by the watershed scales as the study area selected by sun et al 2019 was 10 times the uhrb the accuracy of persiann cdr has also been evaluated for other regions for example the cc of gp and persiann cdr was 0 43 at a daily scale in iran and the performance of persiann cdr varied in different climatic regimes alijanian et al 2017 cc of the gp and persiann cdr ranged from 0 65 to 0 93 0 28 0 49 at a monthly daily scale in the xiang river basin of china gao et al 2018 persiann cdr and cpc overestimated the precipitation a similar result was also found by tan and santo 2018 for malaysia the accuracy of each pp was different in various regions which may have been influenced by climate conditions and topography hamza et al 2020 more similar research needs to be conducted to assess the accuracy of different pps in the zones with special climatic and topographical conditions in this study the accuracy of hrlt was first evaluated in a climatic transitional zone of the subtropical and temperate climate of eastern china which showed better accuracy than persiann cdr compared to the continuous indicators the results of the detection indicators were more consistent for all the chosen detection indicators the performance of different pps was ranked as cpc hrlt pesiann cdr at both watershed and grid to point scales this indicates that the cpc performs best in detecting a rainfall event and the persiann cdr performs worst the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event was also bad within the xiang river basin of china which is worse than cmads trmm 3b42v7 and ncep cfsr gao et al 2018 but in iran the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event was better compared to cmorph persiann trmm and mswep precipitation products alijanian et al 2017 these differences in the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event in varied regions further show there exist regional disparity in the accuracy of different pps in addition the effect of these pps on the sensitivity of q parameters as well as their performance in forcing the swat in q and sy simulation were also evaluated the sensitivity of the parameters relevant to the q of swat changed when the precipitation input changed this indicated that the parameter values for a hydrological model were highly likely dependent on the precipitation input and that the value of the parameter might be altered to correspond to the observed q when the precipitation input changed liu et al 2017 in our study the number of the q sensitive parameters for swat increased when the number of precipitation stations inputted into swat increased more parameters could be needed to reflect the spatial variation in the precipitation for a reasonable simulation result for all the pps most of the q sensitive parameters were relevant to the groundwater and evapotranspiration process which indicated that more details about the groundwater and evapotranspiration might need to be adjusted when swat is forced by various pps furthermore hydrological processes other than the groundwater process may not be properly simulated more future studies should be conducted to evaluate the capability of various pps to simulate the hydrological components properly not only concentrating on the q of the watershed outlet when evaluating the performance of the pps on the q and sy simulations under s1 the performance of cpc was found to be the best which was the closest to that of gp and the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr was found to be worse than that of cpc the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr was significantly different though their accuracy was similarly based on the results shown in tables 2 4 this difference may cause by the spatial accuracy of these two pps and the mechanism of swat on allocating rain gauges to different sub watershed in swat the rain gauge which is nearest to the centre of the sub watershed would be allocated to that sub watershed hence different sub watershed may be allocated the same rain gauge and some rain gauges imported to the swat would not be used during the rain gauge allocation process in addition the spatial accuracy of hrlt and persiann cdr varied in different regions of the uhrb figures s1 s4 which may result in the accuracy difference of hrlt and persiann cdr used by the swat further resulted in the difference in the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr in simulating q and sy using the swat after calibrating the q and sy parameters for each precipitation product the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulations was found to have improved but the performance of persiann cdr and cpc on q and sy simulations was not this result may be caused by the standard on sensitive parameter selection in our study a parameter with a p value lower than 0 1 was selected as a sensitive parameter and then calibrated the threshold of p value to identify the sensitive parameters varied from 0 05 to 0 5 in the previous works dos santos et al 2021 leng et al 2020 phiri et al 2021 zare et al 2022 some sensitive parameters would be missed when the p value was lower which resulted in the false simulation of some hydrological processes further resulting in unsatisfied simulation results the performance of persiann cdr has not improved even after re calibrating the sensitive parameters which may indicate the threshold of p value for the q parameters should be higher than the value of 0 1 the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulation reached the gp and cpc standards after the parameter calibration the performance of pps in the q simulation was closely related to their accuracy but this phenomenon was not observed in the sy simulation tables s5 and s6 show that the accuracies of all the pps during the calibration period were higher than those during the validation period this also demonstrated that evaluating the performance of the pps on q simulation could test their accuracy in another way the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulations was first evaluated as it was published in april 2022 and its performance was found to be excellent disregarding the simulation results obtained during 2016 for the persiann cdr though it performed worse than hrlt compared to the nse it could simulate the q and sy volumes better than hrlt overall persiann cdr overestimated q which is analogous to the existing research zhang et al 2022b in some previous studies sirisena et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2016 persiann cdr was found to have underestimated q which is different from the result obtained in this study this difference in the performance of persiann cdr in the q simulation not only occurred in different basins but also in different regions within the same basin sirisena et al 2018 the spatial simulation performance of persiann cdr on q and sy was also evaluated in our study and the performance was found to vary across different sub watersheds persiann cdr performed well in sub watersheds with high precipitation and overestimated q in the sub watersheds with relatively low precipitation fig 8 the performance of these pps on the spatial distribution of sy generation was found to be better than that of the watershed outlet this may be because the sediment process within swat was separated into two sub processes namely sediment generation and sediment channel transportation ma et al 2019 though sediment generation was simulated well the difference in sediment channel transportation also resulted in a difference in the final simulation results antecedent soil moisture is an important variable in hydrological simulation cea and fraga 2018 which is significantly influenced by continuous drought days cdd zhu et al 2021 cdd and continuous wet days cwd of gp and pps are shown in fig 12 the cwd of gp was lower than that of the pps and that of persiann cdr was the highest followed by cpc and hrlt in addition the cdd of gp was significantly higher than that of the pps the ranking of the cdd for the pps was cpc persiann cdr hrlt cdd mainly occurred in the non flood period and a lower cdd led to a higher value of soil moisture which further resulted in a lower runoff generation this might have been the reason for the pps overestimating q during the non flood period in most of the years fig 6 the evaluation period of this study was 20a and q during the calibration periods was higher than that during the validation periods this might have been a possible reason for the relatively poor performance of these pps in the hydrological simulations tables s5 and s6 liu et al 2017 also found that the performance of pps would be limited when precipitation used for calibration did not cover both the flood and drought period and zhang et al 2020 suggests that the performance of pps in forcing a hydrological model varied under different flow level hrlt is a high resolution precipitation both temporally and spatially and it was found to have acceptable performance in hydrological simulations both in q and sy for most of the years the main limitation of hrlt is that it cannot capture extremely high precipitation in a year this may be because hrlt was interpreted from the gp and reanalysis precipitation rongzhu et al 2022 currently an increasing number of studies are being conducted to correct or merge various pps ma et al 2021 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 it is necessary to correct or merge it with other pp to obtain better performance based on its high spatial resolution for many other pps the resolution is relatively coarse or has less time span compared to the hrlt hence hrlt can be used in long term hydrological simulations in some ungauged periods or a precipitation series expansion in some places where rain gauges have been established in recent years more studies should be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of hrlt in other climate zones of china 6 conclusion in this study we evaluated the accuracy and performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc in a hydrological simulation by comparing them with gp and the hydrological data for the period of 2000 2019 the key findings were as follows 1 at the watershed scale the cc of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 63 0 97 and 0 92 0 67 0 93 and 0 93 and 0 94 0 98 and 0 98 respectively at a daily monthly and annual scale for rmse and nse cpc performed the best at all the temporal scales followed by hrlt and persiann cdr the bias was kept the same at all the temporal scales for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc with the values of 6 22 16 69 and 8 38 respectively hrlt underestimated extreme precipitation and persiann cdr and cpc overestimated the annual precipitation comprehensively the accuracy of the three pps at the watershed average scale was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr cpc was found to be more efficient in detecting the rainfall events compared to hrlt and persiann cdr 2 when comparing the pps with the gp grid to point for all the paired precipitation series the accuracy of each pp decreased cc and rmse were found to be higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scales for all the pps the rank of cc observed was cpc persiann cdr hrlt at all the temporal scales the nse value was found to be evidently higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scale for all the pps and the nse of cpc was higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr cpc was found to be the most stable among the three pps with high accuracy compared to the separate points 3 the sensitivity of the q parameters in swat changed when the precipitation input changed the most sensitive parameters for the q simulation within the uhrb were esco alpha bnk sol z and cn2 for all precipitation inputs in addition the sensitive parameters for gp were averagely distributed for almost all the processes while the sensitive parameters for pps mainly controlled the groundwater and evapotranspiration processes 4 cpc is the best succedaneum for gp in hydrological simulation and has good adaptability for the parameter set calibrated by gp for most years hrlt could simulate q and sy well after parameter calibration all the pps simulated the spatial distribution of sediment generation better than the runoff generation generally hrlt can be introduced in long term hydrological simulations in spatial regions based on its high spatial resolution persiann cdr can be used in wy and sy simulations and the cpc could perform excellently in q and sy simulations in large scale watersheds owing to its low spatial resolution credit authorship contribution statement chong wei conceptualization methodology software writing original draft visualization

2208,precipitation is an important component of water circulation and an essential input for various hydrological models a high quality high spatial resolution and long term precipitation dataset would benefit hydrological investigations particularly for regions having insufficient precipitation records the upper huaihe river basin uhrb was selected as the research location in this study and the accuracies of three precipitation products pps a high resolution daily gridded precipitation dataset for china hrlt precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center global cpc precipitation dataset were assessed at multiple spatio temporal scales comparing with the gauge precipitation gp for 2000 2019 subsequently the applicability of the three pps on streamflow q and sediment yield sy simulations as well as the impact on parameter sensitivity were compared using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results showed that the accuracy of the three pps were ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr on the watershed average scale hrlt would underestimate the extreme precipitation and persiann cdr would overestimate the annual precipitation on the grid to point scale persiann cdr was found to be the most stable with high accuracy followed by cpc and hrlt on all temporal scales the ability of these pps to detect rainfall events was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr the sensitivity of the q parameters changed with the variation in the precipitation input the sensitive parameters for gp were distributed on average for almost all processes while the sensitive parameters for pps mainly controlled the groundwater and evapotranspiration processes among all the pps the performance of cpc in the q and sy simulations was found to be the best followed by hrlt and persiann cdr and all the pps could simulate sy better than q in spatial distribution hrlt has the potential to be used in long term hydrological simulations in ungauged or small watersheds based on its high spatial resolution compared

introduction precipitation plays an essential role in water circulation and influences the environment sun and ao 2013 agriculture zhang et al 2022a and human activities li et al 2019 generally precipitation is the main source of replenishment of freshwater making it an important variable for hydrological and pollution transportation simulations khatakho et al 2021 yin et al 2021 long term and accurate precipitation data guarantee successful hydrological simulation usman et al 2022 further helping to conduct various studies such as hydrological response under land use change wei et al 2022a water resource management duan et al 2021 refsgaard and abbott 1990 and water pollution control fan et al 2022 iavorivska et al 2021 however in many regions the density of rain gauges is sparse with most being established in recent years which makes the existing precipitation records not meeting the demand for relevant studies in these regions ma et al 2019 as many types of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products have been developed to be the succedaneum of gauge precipitation gp this problem has been gradually resolved in recent years an increasing number of studies have evaluated the performance and accuracy of various precipitation products pps liu et al 2022 musie et al 2019 pang et al 2020 the most extensively used satellite and reanalysis pps are precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr hsu et al 1997 the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc global precipitation dataset xie et al 2007 and the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation dataset huffman et al 2007 many scholars have verified the accuracy of these pps by comparing them with gp for example hur et al 2016 evaluated the accuracy of trmm in singapore by comparing it with the gp during 2000 2010 and results showed that trmm underestimated the high intensity precipitation and overestimated the low intensity precipitation gao et al 2018 analyzed the accuracy of ncep cfsr trmm and persiann cdr using gp during 1987 2013 at eight precipitation stations within xiang river basin of china and results showed that persiann cdr was unable to detect the geographical distribution of rainfall events and ncep cfsr showed higher accuracy than persiann cdr and trmm and sun et al 2021 analyzed the ability of persiann cdr in distinguishing extreme precipitation comparing gp during 1983 2012 within the huai river basin and results showed that persiann cdr exhibited significant limitation in embodying the extreme precipitation variations in addition to assessing the accuracy of satellite and reanalysis of pps more studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of various pps in forcing hydrological models over the past decades many studies have been conducted to test and evaluate the performance of diverse latest or long term satellite or reanalysis pps in forcing hydrological models liu et al 2022 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2018 ma et al 2019 analyzed the performance of ncep cfsr persiann cdr and tmpa 3b42v7 for streamflow q and sediment yield sy simulations using the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the lancang mekong river basin and the results indicated that these pps could perform well in simulating q and sy musie et al 2019 analyzed the ability of cfsr chirps persiann cdr and trmm in daily q simulation within the lake ziway basin of ethiopia and the results indicated that the performance of these pps on q simulation was average with a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 5 0 6 according to sun et al 2018 the performance of tmpa cmorph bld cmorph cma and gsmap gauge on q simulation for the vic model were comparable with a nse range of 0 62 0 80 0 39 0 51 during the calibration validation period the performance of various pps in forcing a hydrological model varied in different regions and most of these simulations were performed over a short period the short term simulation made it difficult to verify whether these pps could stably force these hydrological models gillner et al 2013 liu et al 2017 in addition most studies selected q as the simulation variable seldom concentrating on other variables such as sy and nutrients sedimentation is an important ecological process that can be simulated by an eco hydrological model such as swat wei et al 2022a simulating the sediment process properly could benefit the determination of the prone area for soil erosion prevention work yu et al 2021 which greatly help in controlling soil erosion if the various pps could perform well in sediment simulation however relevant studies related to these are still scarce huaihe river basin hrb is a paramount food production base located in the mid eastern part of china and it suffers from severe soil erosion as revealed by cai et al 2012 the upper hrb uhrb which is controlled by the wangjiaba hydrological station contributed 68 4 of the sy of the total hrb the uhrb occupies only 11 of the total hrb area thus it is important to conduct relevant studies to support soil erosion prevention in the uhrb however most studies relevant to long term historical spatial temporal simulations of q and sy within the hrb have mainly concentrated on a period of less than 20a due to the lack of long term observed precipitation this has created difficulties in revealing the long term variation in soil erosion within the critical regions of the hrb the appearance of long term high resolution satellites and reanalysis of the pps offer an opportunity for long term hydrological simulation within the uhrb to date some studies have verified the performance of various pps in q simulations within the hrb jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2016 wu et al 2018 however no study has been conducted to examine if these products can perform well in sy simulation in addition the high resolution daily gridded precipitation dataset for china hrlt developed by rongzhu et al 2022 at lanzhou university and first published in 2022 covered the years 1961 2019 with a spatial resolution of 1 km however no study has yet confirmed its ability to be used in forcing a hydrological model the characteristic of long term periods and high resolution makes it a good choice for precipitation input for multiple hydrological models in china as well as for environmental analyses the uhrb was selected as the research location for this study and the accuracy and performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc in the hydrological simulation were evaluated by comparing with gp and the hydrological data for the period of 2000 2019 the main purposes of the study were 1 to evaluate the accuracy of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc during 2000 2019 by comparing them with the gp records at multiple spatial temporal scales 2 to reveal the effects of different pps on the sensitivity of q parameters in swat 3 to evaluate the performance of these pps in long term q and sy simulations in swat using two calibration scenarios and 4 to evaluate the spatial simulation performance of these products in runoff and sediment generation 2 study area the hrb is situated between 111 55 121 20 e and 30 55 36 20 n covering an area of 2 7 105 km2 the huaihe river originates from the tongbai and dabie mountains passes through five provinces anhui henan hubei shandong and jiangsu and finally converges towards the yellow sea as the hrb is a transitional area between the eastern china s sub tropical and temperate climates the spatial temporal variation of climatic factors is obvious and complicated wei et al 2022b the wangjiaba wjb hydrological station is a demarcation point of the upper hrb uhrb and middle hrb mhrb with a drainage area of 3 02 104 km2 fig 1 and was selected as the investigation zone for this study the uhrb is predominately composed of a plain terrain in the central and eastern areas with the lowest elevation of 21 masl and hilly terrain in the western and southern sections with the highest elevation of 1110 masl within the uhrb the annual average temperature is 15 c annual average precipitation ranges from 800 to 1400 mm and more than 60 of the annual precipitation occurs during the flood season june september the main land use type in the uhrb is agricultural land covering 68 of the total region indicating that human activity is intensive in the uhrb 3 data and methodologies the overall technical flow of our study is displayed in fig 2 3 1 data 3 1 1 pps basic information on the three pps is presented in table 1 in this study the three pps during 1998 2019 were used to test their accuracy and performance in long term hydrological simulations 1 hrlt precipitation dataset a high resolution daily gridded precipitation dataset for china hrlt was developed by qin and zhang at lanzhou university and was first published in 2022 rongzhu et al 2022 the hrlt dataset could provide long term precipitation records with a 1 km spatial resolution from 1961 to 2019 which is the highest spatial resolution among the existing pps the hrlt dataset was interpolated based on a 0 5 0 5 grid dataset obtained from the china meteorological administration cma elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index longitude and latitude using the best combination of six algorithms the hrlt dataset is available at https doi pangaea de https doi org 10 1594 pangaea 941329 format html download specific information on the hrlt dataset was obtained from rongzhu et al 2022 2 persiann cdr precipitation dataset the persiann cdr

weather generator parameters for the swat model 3 2 pps evaluation methods to assess the accuracy of the selected pps hrlt persiann cdr and cpc within the uhrb they were compared with the gp for the period of 2000 2019 at multiple spatiotemporal scales on a temporal scale the pps were contrasted with the gp at daily monthly and annual scales on a spatial scale the pps were contrasted with the gp at the watershed average scale first subsequently comparison at a grid scale was conducted when evaluating the pps at the watershed average scale as the hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were grid pps and rain gauges were uniformly distributed within the uhrb fig 1 four average precipitation series from different sources rain gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were calculated using the arithmetic average method based on the precipitation series of the grids or gauge stations within the uhrb afterwards the evaluation indicators were calculated for the three pps and gauge series at daily monthly and annual scales when evaluating the pps at a grid scale for each grid of all the pps the precipitation series of the rain gauge stations in the grid was selected to evaluate the accuracy of the pps of that grid the evaluation indicators used for assessing the accuracy of the pps were mainly divided into two categories continuous and detection indicators in this study four continuous indicators correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse relative bias bias and nse and five detection indicators probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far critical success index csi frequency bias index fbi and equitable threat score ets were chosen as evaluation indicators to assess the accuracy of these pps which have been extensively used in existing studies ma et al 2019 musie et al 2019 sun et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 cc rmse bias and nse indicate the consistency medial error relative systematic errors and residual variance between the pps and gp respectively musie et al 2019 pod far csi fbi and ets reveal the accuracy of rainfall event prediction for these pps zeng et al 2018 the definitions and calculation methods of the nine indicators are shown in table s1 3 3 swat model the swat model one of the most popular semi distributed hydrological models was designed by the agricultural research center of the united states department of agriculture usda arnold et al 1998 the swat splits the watershed into multiple sub watersheds based on the dem and the sub watersheds are further divided into several hydrologic response units hrus based on a special combination of land use soil type and slope belt based on its structural characteristics it has been widely used in many ecological and environmental fields such as hydrology dash et al 2021 gull and shah 2022 ecology aznarez et al 2021 lin et al 2022 and watershed management wei et al 2022a yu et al 2021 the water balance equation equation 1 is the basis of the water circulation simulation in the swat 1 s w t s w

the base flow on the day i mm in swat the q simulation is separated into two sections runoff generation and flow routing in this study the two processes were calculated using the scs curve number boughton 1989 and characteristic river length method williams 1969 respectively the sy simulation in swat is separated into sediment generation and channel transport the modified universal soil loss equation musle was used to simulate the sediment generation process the simplified bagnold equation was adopted to simulate the sediment channel transport in this study the musle equation is as

flow direction calculation and the 125 sub watersheds were subdivided into 1018 hrus based on the unique combination of land use soil and slope belt four swat models were established based on four precipitation inputs gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc all of which were consistent except that the precipitation input changed 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation swat cup 2019 abbaspour 2013 was selected as a tool to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters and calibrate the sensitive parameters the t and p values calculated using the global sensitivity analysis method koo et al 2020 song et al 2015 integrated into the swat cup were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the parameters for 1998 2019 parameters with a higher t and lower p values indicated higher sensitivity with a higher impact on the target variable abbaspour 2013 in this study all parameters were included in the sensitivity analysis with 2000 runs for an iteration and the parameters with a p value lower than 0 1 were selected to be calibrated for the target variable dos santos et al 2021 the sufi 2 algorithm was adopted to calibrate the parameters and has been widely used in related studies narsimlu et al 2015 shivhare et al 2018 singh and jha 2021 in this study the calibration strategy introduced by ranjan and mishra 2022 was used for each precipitation input the sensitive parameters were calibrated for 2000 runs per iteration and the best parameter set was selected for conducting a single simulation for validation the warm up calibration and validation periods were 1998 1999 2000 2011 and 2012 2019 respectively kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 a comprehensive indicator that reflects the accuracy of the consistency and volume of the simulation results compared to the measured dataset was selected as the objective function during the calibration process in addition the coefficient of determination r2 nse and percent bias pbias were also selected to evaluate the performance of swat forced by four precipitation sources the calculation methods of kge r2 nse and pbias are shown in table s2 the performance rating standard proposed by moriasi et al 2007 was employed to determine the performance rank of swat forced by the four precipitation sources the rating standards are presented in table s3 3 5 hydrological simulation scenarios the performance of different pps on forcing the swat model was analyzed under two scenarios s1 gp was used as the precipitation input and the fittest parameter set was obtained after parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration afterwards the fittest parameter set was used for simulating q and sy in the swat model forced by different pps the results simulated by different pps were compared at both temporal and spatial scales s2 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were performed for the swat model forced by different pps separately and afterward the differences in the results of sensitive parameters and performance indicators were analyzed 4 results 4 1 accuracy evaluation of different pps 4 1 1 evaluation of continuous indicators 1 comparison on a watershed scale the average precipitation series for the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc are shown in fig 3 the average daily precipitations of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 2 47 2 62 2 89 and 2 68 mm respectively the average monthly precipitation of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 75 12 79 88 88 10 and 81 42 mm respectively and the average annual precipitation of the gauge hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 901 5 958 59 1057 21 and 977 09 mm respectively at a daily scale almost all pps showed poor performance for the extremely highest precipitation and the extreme precipitation of the cpc was found to be the highest than other pps in most years at a monthly scale the precipitation series of hrlt and cpc were significantly consistent with those of the gauges for almost the entire period and that of the persiann cdr were found to be evidently higher than the other pps in most cases at an annual scale the hrlt precipitation series were significantly consistent with the gp series during 2000 2014 but it evidently overestimated for the period of 2015 2016 persiann cdr overestimated the annual precipitation over almost the entire period and cpc was highly consistent with the gp series with a slight overestimation during the evaluation periods the statistics of the continuous indicators of the three pps at multiple temporal scales are presented in table 2 the cc of cpc was highest at all temporal scales and cc of hrlt and persiann cdr were similar at all temporal scales and lower than that of cpc the ccs of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 63 0 97 and 0 92 0 67 0 93 and 0 93 and 0 94 0 98 and 0 98 respectively at a daily monthly and annual scale the daily rmse was ranked as cpc 2 46 mm persiann cdr 5 59 mm hrlt 6 22 mm while the monthly and annual rmse were ranked as cpc 17 73 and 86 76 mm hrlt 20 59 and 106 35 mm persiann cdr 31 09 and 175 51 mm respectively the rmse of persiann cdr was significantly higher at the monthly and annual scales compared to the other pps in addition the differences between the rmse of different pps increased when the temporal scale increased for bias the value for each pp was kept the same at daily monthly and annual scales with the value of 6 22 16 69 and 8 38 for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc respectively this indicated that the deviation of hrlt was the lowest and that of persiann cdr was the highest and persiann cdr overestimates overall precipitation more than hrlt and cpc the nse values of cpc were the highest at all temporal scales with the value range of 0 84 0 95 and the nses of hrlt and persiann cdr were highest at the monthly scale 0 93 and 0 84 followed by the annual 0 77 and 0 37 and daily scale 0 28 and 0 42 respectively comprehensively the continuous accuracy of the three pps at the watershed average scale was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr 2 direct comparison grid to point cc rmse bias and nse were calculated for all paired grids of the pps hrlt persiann cdr and cpc and rain gauge stations for 2000 2019 and the results are displayed in table 3 similar to the results at the watershed average scale for comparing these pps grid to point the cc rmse and nse were kept different at different temporal scales while the bias was kept the same overall the accuracy of each pp decreased when the grid to point was compared with that at the watershed average scale cc was found to be higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scales for all the pps the rank ordering of cc was cpc persiann cdr hrlt at all temporal scales the rmses of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 9 43 47 87 and 224 4 8 35 47 12 and 240 05 and 5 78 37 41 and 161 33 mm respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the rmse values for all the pps were higher than those for the watershed average scale for bias the values for all the pps were the same as those for the watershed average scale the nse was evidently higher at the monthly scale compared to that at daily and annual scales for all the pps and the nse of cpc was higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr when evaluating these precipitation products grid to point based on the continuous indicators the comprehensive accuracy was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr in addition for hrlt gauge persiann cdr gauge and cpc gauge a total of 65 41 and 16 pairs of precipitation series were collected respectively for each pair a gauge was located in the grid of each pp the evaluation indicators for all the paired precipitation series were calculated and are shown in fig 4 the ranges for cc for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 30 0 59 0 74 0 94 and 0 54 0 93 0 23 0 59 0 75 0 92 and 0 57 0 92 and 0 38 0 88 0 75 0 95 and 0 73 0 96 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the ranges for rmse for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 7 62 11 19 27 29 65 28 and 96 68 439 43 7 36 10 23 39 89 68 75 and 111 93 482 53 and 4 36 9 65 26 56 65 89 and 83 46 304 46 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the bias values for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were consistent at all temporal scales ranging from 30 06 64 52 7 49 71 31 and 9 08 48 13 respectively the ranges for nse for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 26 0 33 0 49 0 87 and 3 3 0 86 0 09 0 35 0 50 0 80 and 2 92 0 73 and 0 02 0 77 0 55 0 89 and 0 69 0 86 respectively at the daily monthly and annual scale the continuous accuracies of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were all higher in the middle and southern uhrb and lower in the northwestern uhrb at all temporal scales figure s1 s3 and all the pps overestimated the precipitation amount at most locations at all temporal scales within the uhrb among all the pps cpc was the most accurate and stable followed by hrlt which has the optimal bias 4 1 2 evaluation of detection indicators as shown in table 4 the detection indicators of the three pps were different at both watershed and grid to point scales for all chosen detection indicators the performance of the three pps was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr at the watershed scale the pod and csi of cpc were higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr indicating that cpc performed well in detecting the rainfall events far of cpc was the lowest followed by hrlt and persiann cdr which indicated that the possibility of the false alarm was rank as cpc hrlt persiann cdr fbi for all the pps were higher than 1 which indicated that all the pps overestimated the rainfall events with different degrees and ets of the three pps was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr indicating that the cpc was more efficient in detecting rainfall events compared to hrlt and persiann cdr the selected detection indicators of the three pps were slightly worse at the grid to point scale compared to those at the watershed scale the variations in different detection indicators were diverse for all the pps fig 5 cpc performed well for all detection indicators showing high accuracy the ranges for pod far csi and ets for perisann cdr were smaller than those for hrlt and cpc indicating that persiann cdr was more stable in detecting rainfall events at different locations for most detection indicators persiann cdr and cpc had some stations with significantly lower accuracy than the other stations but the phenomenon seldom appeared for hrlt the decrease in detection indicators at a grid to point scale compared to that at the watershed scale might have been caused by these stations which had extremely lower accuracy figure s4 shows the spatial distribution of the detection indicators for different pps the hrlt performed well in detecting the rainfall events in the middle and southwestern uhrb the persiann cdr performed worse in detecting the rainfall events in the central and edge of the uhrb and the cpc performed well for most points with only three points having slightly lower accuracy 4 2 performances of swat forcing by different pps 4 2 1 comparison of model performances under s1 under s1 the overall performance of the swat forced by different pps are presented in table 5 for q simulation r2 nse pbias and kge for the gp were 0 91 0 81 0 89 0 81 4 5 0 3 and 0 88 0 83 respectively during the calibration validation period for sy simulation r2 nse pbias and kge for the gp were 0 62 0 79 0 59 0 74 0 7 10 2 and 0 80 0 63 respectively during the calibration validation period this suggests that the gp could obtain vg vg and s g performance in the q and sy simulation respectively during the calibration validation period when the precipitation input changed into other pps the performance of swat in the q and sy simulations declined cpc performed best among all the pps in simulating q and sy followed by persiann cdr and hrlt all the pps overestimated q compared to gp during both the calibration and validation periods the performance of cpc on the q and sy simulations was closest to that of gp and only overestimated q during the validation period hrlt performed well in consistency compared to the other pps with a high value of r2 close to that of the gp the lower nse of hrlt might have been caused by the high value of overestimation which was shown by the high value of pbias as shown in fig 4 the daily rmse of hrlt was evidently higher than that of persiann cdr and cpc persiann cdr showed an s and us performance on q simulation during the calibration and validation periods and showed a us performance on sy simulation during both the calibration and validation periods with regards to pbias perisiann cdr showed a g vg performance in the sy simulation fig 6 shows a comparison of the measured and simulated q and sy series simulated forced by different pps under s1 fig 6 clearly shows that the volumes of q and sy during the calibration period were higher than those during the validation period this may have accounted for the difference in the performance of swat during the calibration and validation periods the q series simulated forced by gp and cpc were comparable the q series simulated forced by persiann cdr was higher than the measured q most times the q series simulated forced by hrlt was the highest among all series especially when the peak value appeared which might have been the reason for the low nse for the q simulation forced by hrlt these results suggested that cpc was the best succedaneum for gp in the q simulation whereas hrlt and persiann cdr performed worse than cpc the sy series exhibited a trend similar to that of the corresponding q series the sy during the flood season was significantly higher than those of other periods within a year for most peak values the simulated sy was higher than the measured value among all the pps the simulated sy series forced by cpc was the most similar to that forced by gp which indicated that cpc was probably the most suitable alternative for gp in the sy simulation except for cpc persiann cdr overestimated sy for most years but for many years it simulated the sy series well the hrlt overestimated sy during the entire period especially for the peak value these differences in performance for different years might have been caused by the accuracy of different pps in those years which further proved that the accuracy of precipitation input is significantly important for proper hydrological process simulations in a hydrological model 4 2 2 differences in spatial simulation forced by different pps under s1 the subwatershed precipitation water yields wy and sy at the annual and flood season scales were collected according to the output file of the calibrated swat model forced by each pp under s1 and were compared to those forced by gp the results are shown in fig 8 and fig 10 the spatial distribution of precipitation wy and sy at the annual and flood season scales are shown in fig 7 and fig 9 1 comparison on an annual scale the ccs of the sub watershed precipitation between gp and hrlt persiann cdr and cpc precipitation were 0 57 0 53 and 0 57 respectively in most sub watersheds the precipitation of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc was higher than that of gp this phenomenon was more evident for persiann cdr and hrlt as shown in fig 7 p1 gp varied within uhrb with high heterogeneity which did not show an obvious distribution characteristic however for the pps the precipitation showed an obvious gradient which gradually increased from northwest to southeast and the spatial variation of hrlt and cpc was more obvious than that of persiann cdr the cc of the sub watershed wy between the simulation results forced by gp and those forced by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 66 0 60 and 0 72 respectively this indicated that cpc performed well in the wy spatial simulation compared to other pps hrlt overestimated wy in almost all sub watersheds and persiann cdr overestimated wy in most sub watersheds as shown in fig 7 p1 and w1 the spatial distribution of precipitation and wy were similar and the sub watersheds were higher in wy where precipitation was higher however this phenomenon has not been discovered for any other pps as sub watersheds with higher precipitation do not generate more wy compared to the sub watersheds with lower precipitation wy simulated forced by hrlt was higher in almost the whole watershed compared with that simulated forced by gp wys simulated forced by persiann cdr and cpc were similar to those simulated forced by gp with less spatial variability the ccs of the sub watershed sy between the simulation results forced by gp and those forced by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were the same with a value of 0 93 fig 8 overall this indicated that all the pps could simulate sy well at the sub watershed scale the results shown in fig 8 do not include the extreme values occurring in the sub watersheds located in the southeastern uhrb fig 7 these sub watersheds were mainly dominated by agricultural land with a high slope where would generate more sediment than other regions compared to the sub watershed sy simulated forced by gp the sub watershed sy simulated forced by cpc was closest while that simulated forced by hrlt and persiann cdr was overestimated and underestimated respectively the value of sy simulated forced by gp ranged from 0 to 52 36 t ha and gradually decreased from southwest to northeast fig 7 and a similar trend was found for the simulation results forced by all the pps but the high sy in the sub watersheds located in the southeastern uhrb were underestimated with the highest values of 30 64 21 85 and 32 94 t ha for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc respectively 2 comparison during flood season as shown in fig 10 during the flood season the ccs of sub watershed precipitation wy and sy between gp and hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 73 0 69 and 0 96 0 66 0 59 and 0 95 and 0 78 0 70 and 0 97 respectively the cc of sub watershed precipitation was higher during the flood season than for the entire year no obvious differences were observed between wy and sy this indicated that the annual wy and sy within the uhrb might have mainly depended on the flood season during the flood season hrlt underestimated the precipitation and overestimate wy persiann cdr overestimated wy and sy and cpc underestimates sy fig 8 and fig 10 show that the variations in the flood season precipitation and wy were smaller than those at the annual scale for all pps this indicated that the difference between gp and pps could mainly exist in the non flood season fig 7 and fig 9 show that the spatial distribution characteristic of wy and sy were similar during both the flood season and entire year but the spatial distribution characteristic of precipitation during the flood season showed less variation than that during the entire year this phenomenon also indicated that wy and sy mainly occurred during the flood season in the uhrb especially sy the average sy during the flood season and entire year simulated by gp were 39 50 and 52 36 t ha respectively while those simulated by hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 20 28 16 19 and 23 16 and 30 64 21 85 and 32 94 t ha respectively this suggested that the pps underestimated the spatial sy during the non flood season further underestimating the sy at the annual scale in general all the pps could simulate the sy spatial distribution well and cpc and hrlt performed well in simulating the wy spatial distribution 4 3 effects of different pps on parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration to understand the effect of different pps on parameter sensitivity and calibration in the swat model parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted four times for the swat model forced by different pps s2 to reduce the parameter uncertainty of the q simulation a parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted for the parameters relevant to the q process and the sensitive q parameters were calibrated and validated for swat for the sy parameters the amount was not significantly high hence all of them were taken considered for calibration and validation 4 3 1 differences in q parameter sensitivity analysis the q parameter analysis and parameter calibration results are presented in table s4 and it can be seen that the q parameter sensitivity changed when the swat was driven by different pps the most sensitive parameters for the q simulation were esco alpha bnk sol z and cn2 esco represents the soil evaporation compensation factor and is relevant for soil water and evaporation processes alpha bnk represents the baseflow alpha factor for bank storage and is relevant for the baseflow recharge process sol z represents the depth from the soil surface to the bottom of the layer which is relevant for the water infiltration and soil water processes cn2 represents the scs streamflow curve number ⅱ which varied in different hrus during the simulation affecting the runoff generation when swat was forced by gp gwqmn gw revap revapmn and ch n2 were identified as the sensitive parameters gw revap and revapmn were related to the evapotranspiration process gwqmn was related to the groundwater recharge process and ch n2 was related to the flow concentration process when swat was forced by hrlt gwqmn gw revap revapmn sol awc gw delay ch k2 rchrg dp epco alpha bf canmx smfmn and sol k were also identified as the sensitive parameters rchrg dp gw delay and alpha bf were related to the groundwater process canmx and epco were related to the evapotranspiration process sol awc and sol k were related to the soil water process ch k2 was related to the channel flow process and smfmn was related to the snowmelt process when swat was forced by persiann cdr gwqmn gw revap revapmn ch n2 gw delay rchrg dp and alpha bf were also identified as the sensitive parameters when swat was forced by cpc the gwqmn gw revap revapmn ch n2 ch k2 alpha bf and sol k were also identified as the sensitive parameters in general the amount of q sensitive parameters for swat when forced by gp hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 9 15 10 and 10 respectively the sensitive parameters for gp were averagely distributed for almost all the processes and the sensitive parameters for hrlt mainly controlled the evapotranspiration five parameters soil water four parameters and groundwater four parameters process while the sensitive parameters for persiann cdr mainly controlled the evapotranspiration two parameters and groundwater five parameters processes and the sensitive parameters for cpc mainly controlled the groundwater four parameters processes these results may indicated that the precipitation inputs could influence the sensitivity of the parameters during hydrological simulation in swat this effect might have been caused by the spatial resolution of different precipitation inputs bárdossy and das 2008 huang et al 2018 and the equifinality of different parameters in the distributed hydrological models in our study the amount of rain gauges used in swat was 60 and the virtual stations of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc used were 123 54 and 19 respectively 4 3 2 comparison between the model performances under s2 the overall performance of swat forced by different pps under s2 table 6 was better than that observed under s1 table 5 under s2 the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr in the q and sy simulations have evidently improved after parameter calibration the performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc on q simulation were ranked as vg us s s and vg vg respectively during the calibration validation period the performances of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc on sy simulation were ranked as us s us us and s g respectively during the calibration validation period the performance of cpc on the q and sy simulations were the closest to that of gp during calibration and validation as shown in fig 11 the q and sy values simulated by cpc were very consistent with the measured values compared to those simulated by other pps hrlt performed well in the q and sy simulations during the calibration period similar to that of gp and cpc but did not perform well during the validation period we found that the main cause of this poor performance was the precipitation input in 2016 the precipitation of hrlt during 2016 was higher than the measured precipitation which resulted in the high values of q and sy further resulting in a low nse disregarding the simulation results for 2016 the nse of q and sy during the validation period increased to 0 74 indicating a good performance for q and sy simulation persiann cdr did not perform well in q and sy simulations even after parameter calibration 5 discussion persiann cdr and cpc were both long term pps covering over 20 years persiann cdr has been widely evaluated in many studies alijanian et al 2017 gao et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 cpc has been used as a benchmark in some studies nguyen et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2019 indicating that the accuracy of cpc has been accepted in many regions in our study the accuracy of cpc was the highest among the selected pps at all temporal scales for persiann cdr the average cc was 0 52 0 84 and 0 75 at the daily monthly and annual scales respectively which showed good performance this result was consistent with that of sun et al 2019 who reported that the r values between gp and persiann cdr ranged from 0 48 to 0 59 within the hrb with a mean value of 0 54 in addition persiann cdr performed poorly in capturing the spatial distribution of the precipitation which was consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 but different from the result obtained by sun et al 2019 and alijanian et al 2017 this difference may have been caused by the watershed scales as the study area selected by sun et al 2019 was 10 times the uhrb the accuracy of persiann cdr has also been evaluated for other regions for example the cc of gp and persiann cdr was 0 43 at a daily scale in iran and the performance of persiann cdr varied in different climatic regimes alijanian et al 2017 cc of the gp and persiann cdr ranged from 0 65 to 0 93 0 28 0 49 at a monthly daily scale in the xiang river basin of china gao et al 2018 persiann cdr and cpc overestimated the precipitation a similar result was also found by tan and santo 2018 for malaysia the accuracy of each pp was different in various regions which may have been influenced by climate conditions and topography hamza et al 2020 more similar research needs to be conducted to assess the accuracy of different pps in the zones with special climatic and topographical conditions in this study the accuracy of hrlt was first evaluated in a climatic transitional zone of the subtropical and temperate climate of eastern china which showed better accuracy than persiann cdr compared to the continuous indicators the results of the detection indicators were more consistent for all the chosen detection indicators the performance of different pps was ranked as cpc hrlt pesiann cdr at both watershed and grid to point scales this indicates that the cpc performs best in detecting a rainfall event and the persiann cdr performs worst the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event was also bad within the xiang river basin of china which is worse than cmads trmm 3b42v7 and ncep cfsr gao et al 2018 but in iran the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event was better compared to cmorph persiann trmm and mswep precipitation products alijanian et al 2017 these differences in the performance of persiann cdr in detecting a rainfall event in varied regions further show there exist regional disparity in the accuracy of different pps in addition the effect of these pps on the sensitivity of q parameters as well as their performance in forcing the swat in q and sy simulation were also evaluated the sensitivity of the parameters relevant to the q of swat changed when the precipitation input changed this indicated that the parameter values for a hydrological model were highly likely dependent on the precipitation input and that the value of the parameter might be altered to correspond to the observed q when the precipitation input changed liu et al 2017 in our study the number of the q sensitive parameters for swat increased when the number of precipitation stations inputted into swat increased more parameters could be needed to reflect the spatial variation in the precipitation for a reasonable simulation result for all the pps most of the q sensitive parameters were relevant to the groundwater and evapotranspiration process which indicated that more details about the groundwater and evapotranspiration might need to be adjusted when swat is forced by various pps furthermore hydrological processes other than the groundwater process may not be properly simulated more future studies should be conducted to evaluate the capability of various pps to simulate the hydrological components properly not only concentrating on the q of the watershed outlet when evaluating the performance of the pps on the q and sy simulations under s1 the performance of cpc was found to be the best which was the closest to that of gp and the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr was found to be worse than that of cpc the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr was significantly different though their accuracy was similarly based on the results shown in tables 2 4 this difference may cause by the spatial accuracy of these two pps and the mechanism of swat on allocating rain gauges to different sub watershed in swat the rain gauge which is nearest to the centre of the sub watershed would be allocated to that sub watershed hence different sub watershed may be allocated the same rain gauge and some rain gauges imported to the swat would not be used during the rain gauge allocation process in addition the spatial accuracy of hrlt and persiann cdr varied in different regions of the uhrb figures s1 s4 which may result in the accuracy difference of hrlt and persiann cdr used by the swat further resulted in the difference in the performance of hrlt and persiann cdr in simulating q and sy using the swat after calibrating the q and sy parameters for each precipitation product the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulations was found to have improved but the performance of persiann cdr and cpc on q and sy simulations was not this result may be caused by the standard on sensitive parameter selection in our study a parameter with a p value lower than 0 1 was selected as a sensitive parameter and then calibrated the threshold of p value to identify the sensitive parameters varied from 0 05 to 0 5 in the previous works dos santos et al 2021 leng et al 2020 phiri et al 2021 zare et al 2022 some sensitive parameters would be missed when the p value was lower which resulted in the false simulation of some hydrological processes further resulting in unsatisfied simulation results the performance of persiann cdr has not improved even after re calibrating the sensitive parameters which may indicate the threshold of p value for the q parameters should be higher than the value of 0 1 the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulation reached the gp and cpc standards after the parameter calibration the performance of pps in the q simulation was closely related to their accuracy but this phenomenon was not observed in the sy simulation tables s5 and s6 show that the accuracies of all the pps during the calibration period were higher than those during the validation period this also demonstrated that evaluating the performance of the pps on q simulation could test their accuracy in another way the performance of hrlt on q and sy simulations was first evaluated as it was published in april 2022 and its performance was found to be excellent disregarding the simulation results obtained during 2016 for the persiann cdr though it performed worse than hrlt compared to the nse it could simulate the q and sy volumes better than hrlt overall persiann cdr overestimated q which is analogous to the existing research zhang et al 2022b in some previous studies sirisena et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2016 persiann cdr was found to have underestimated q which is different from the result obtained in this study this difference in the performance of persiann cdr in the q simulation not only occurred in different basins but also in different regions within the same basin sirisena et al 2018 the spatial simulation performance of persiann cdr on q and sy was also evaluated in our study and the performance was found to vary across different sub watersheds persiann cdr performed well in sub watersheds with high precipitation and overestimated q in the sub watersheds with relatively low precipitation fig 8 the performance of these pps on the spatial distribution of sy generation was found to be better than that of the watershed outlet this may be because the sediment process within swat was separated into two sub processes namely sediment generation and sediment channel transportation ma et al 2019 though sediment generation was simulated well the difference in sediment channel transportation also resulted in a difference in the final simulation results antecedent soil moisture is an important variable in hydrological simulation cea and fraga 2018 which is significantly influenced by continuous drought days cdd zhu et al 2021 cdd and continuous wet days cwd of gp and pps are shown in fig 12 the cwd of gp was lower than that of the pps and that of persiann cdr was the highest followed by cpc and hrlt in addition the cdd of gp was significantly higher than that of the pps the ranking of the cdd for the pps was cpc persiann cdr hrlt cdd mainly occurred in the non flood period and a lower cdd led to a higher value of soil moisture which further resulted in a lower runoff generation this might have been the reason for the pps overestimating q during the non flood period in most of the years fig 6 the evaluation period of this study was 20a and q during the calibration periods was higher than that during the validation periods this might have been a possible reason for the relatively poor performance of these pps in the hydrological simulations tables s5 and s6 liu et al 2017 also found that the performance of pps would be limited when precipitation used for calibration did not cover both the flood and drought period and zhang et al 2020 suggests that the performance of pps in forcing a hydrological model varied under different flow level hrlt is a high resolution precipitation both temporally and spatially and it was found to have acceptable performance in hydrological simulations both in q and sy for most of the years the main limitation of hrlt is that it cannot capture extremely high precipitation in a year this may be because hrlt was interpreted from the gp and reanalysis precipitation rongzhu et al 2022 currently an increasing number of studies are being conducted to correct or merge various pps ma et al 2021 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2022 it is necessary to correct or merge it with other pp to obtain better performance based on its high spatial resolution for many other pps the resolution is relatively coarse or has less time span compared to the hrlt hence hrlt can be used in long term hydrological simulations in some ungauged periods or a precipitation series expansion in some places where rain gauges have been established in recent years more studies should be conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of hrlt in other climate zones of china 6 conclusion in this study we evaluated the accuracy and performance of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc in a hydrological simulation by comparing them with gp and the hydrological data for the period of 2000 2019 the key findings were as follows 1 at the watershed scale the cc of hrlt persiann cdr and cpc were 0 63 0 97 and 0 92 0 67 0 93 and 0 93 and 0 94 0 98 and 0 98 respectively at a daily monthly and annual scale for rmse and nse cpc performed the best at all the temporal scales followed by hrlt and persiann cdr the bias was kept the same at all the temporal scales for hrlt persiann cdr and cpc with the values of 6 22 16 69 and 8 38 respectively hrlt underestimated extreme precipitation and persiann cdr and cpc overestimated the annual precipitation comprehensively the accuracy of the three pps at the watershed average scale was ranked as cpc hrlt persiann cdr cpc was found to be more efficient in detecting the rainfall events compared to hrlt and persiann cdr 2 when comparing the pps with the gp grid to point for all the paired precipitation series the accuracy of each pp decreased cc and rmse were found to be higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scales for all the pps the rank of cc observed was cpc persiann cdr hrlt at all the temporal scales the nse value was found to be evidently higher at the monthly scale compared to that at the daily and annual scale for all the pps and the nse of cpc was higher than that of hrlt and persiann cdr cpc was found to be the most stable among the three pps with high accuracy compared to the separate points 3 the sensitivity of the q parameters in swat changed when the precipitation input changed the most sensitive parameters for the q simulation within the uhrb were esco alpha bnk sol z and cn2 for all precipitation inputs in addition the sensitive parameters for gp were averagely distributed for almost all the processes while the sensitive parameters for pps mainly controlled the groundwater and evapotranspiration processes 4 cpc is the best succedaneum for gp in hydrological simulation and has good adaptability for the parameter set calibrated by gp for most years hrlt could simulate q and sy well after parameter calibration all the pps simulated the spatial distribution of sediment generation better than the runoff generation generally hrlt can be introduced in long term hydrological simulations in spatial regions based on its high spatial resolution persiann cdr can be used in wy and sy simulations and the cpc could perform excellently in q and sy simulations in large scale watersheds owing to its low spatial resolution credit authorship contribution statement chong wei conceptualization methodology software writing original draft visualization

2209,stable isotopes in water oxygen 18 and deuterium are hydrologic tracers which have been embedded into both analytical mass balance and physically based continuous simulation models improving hydrologic process partitioning and regional source identification resulting in early climate change detection recent advances in the field of isotope hydrology have improved coordinated investment in global monitoring networks invested in integrated modelling tools to support prediction and model evaluation and expanded the scale of analyses possible this review focuses on the applications of isotope tracers to large scale hydrologic modelling its inception and evolution and future directions for advancing this field with emphasis on the utility of isotope tracers for operational water resources prediction the hydrologic community has begun to steer toward alternative hydrologic data due to the coinciding realities of limited data records and urgent data needs water resources infrastructure and management requires projections of water supply beyond the 50 to 100 year design life with the general rule of flow frequency necessitating a 100 to 200 year assessment however there exist few data networks globally with records sufficient to support this kind of long term assessment and climate change is increasing the frequency of these extreme events historically large scale and long time series simulation has meant less attention on process function model fidelity due to computational constraints however we argue that this may no longer be adequate under increasingly complex climate hydrologic feedbacks and integrated system models that incorporate human decisions environmental health and socio economic pressures to expand the uptake of isotope tracers in practice we emphasize their value for extreme quantile prediction under future projections and call for the community of practice to support data networks and accessibility support peer review of large domain less data intensive applications and employ the fair findable accessible interoperable reusable scientific principles though still an emerging scientific field isotope hydrology has considerable value to the practitioner community with the proper education and training necessary to build confidence underpinned by well developed and accessible tools for deployment keywords surface water hydrology hydrologic modelling isotope tracers tracer aided models data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 role of large scale hydrologic modelling for decades the hydrologic community has focused on advancing knowledge of hydrologic processes and connectivity to better understand and predict streamflow generation multitudes of hillslope and intensively monitored research watershed sites have been established globally all with the same goal to better understand the rainfall to runoff or snowmelt to runoff evolution runoff generation processes and hydrologic pathways klaus mcdonnell 2013 it can be argued though that this has come at the expense of a research focus on larger scales i e where individual processes are less discernable which are more suitable to operational prediction and decision making in water resources klemeš 1986 and what is now needed is a stronger focus on prediction at regional and continental domains traditionally scaling in hydrology has referred to the study of hydrologic function and processes in intensively monitored hillslope or catchment scale 100 km2 studies that require extrapolation of findings up to larger systems tetzlaff et al 2015 the assumptions underpinning scaling are problematic for several reasons including that hydrological interactions are known to be highly non linear and do not behave interact or connect proportionately at different scales specifically pertaining to modelling processes important at the hillslope scale are often not even seen by model performance criteria evaluated at streamflow gauging stations as being influential to downstream streamflow generation or for larger watershed scale dynamics fig 1 transferability and scalability also inherently assume stationarity in time and space namely that the same relative contributions from hydrologic compartments exist across seasons or from upstream to downstream respectively holmes et al 2022a demonstrate this is in fact not the case and that hydrological non stationarity space and non transferability time exist for simulated hydrological processes and performance metric sensitivities their study highlights that stationarity does not and should not necessarily be assumed and that traditional foundational assumptions in hydrologic modelling could be challengeable moreover the study suggests that isotope tracers aid hydrologic models in seeing more processes across all scales independent of the performance metric selected for model evaluation fig 1 offers a glimpse of the impacts of non stationarity for model evaluation and consequently model fidelity by extrapolating the findings of the holmes et al 2022b study the average process based hydrologic sensitivities across the entire watershed 160 000 km2 top right inset when a model adopted from the holmes et al 2022b is evaluated at all gauges can in fact be substantially different from those within individual subbasins assessed at each flow gauge this is a function of different travel times and physiographic controls e g mountainous headwaters versus low lying downstream wetlands within the subbasins and also as a function of size of the basin influencing basin heterogeneity represented by the size of the pie chart catchment and hillslope studies therefore cannot simply be scaled up and assumed to be representative of scenarios at operational scales 1000 km2 or more typically underpinning flood frequency analysis forecasting or the design of bridge piers reservoirs and large dams the reality is that many hydrologists are faced with making decisions impacting public safety health and environments on long time scales with an absence of data monitoring networks validated model outputs and knowledge of hydrologic system behaviour reliable predictions at an operational scale are required to inform practitioners of continental changes in water supply as well as regional hydrological process controls rokaya pietroniro 2022 complex hydrologic interactions those in high latitude environments or less populated developed regions remain particularly poorly monitored and understood due to sparse data networks for example in canada the majority of basins are ungauged or monitored below world meteorological organization standards coulibaly et al 2013 and with 60 of canadian rivers draining northward stadnyk déry 2021 the reliability of high latitude hydrologic predictions becomes problematic this phenomenon is not exclusive to canada however with the majority of the african continent being under studied and under monitored for surface water resources papa et al 2022 and this trend generally extending throughout much of the global south dorigo et al 2021 in the lower and mid latitude watersheds basins are often heavily regulated and fragmented déry et al 2021 grill et al 2019 resulting in significantly different hydrologic behaviour than the natural idealized rainfall runoff responses understood from catchment scale studies though the obvious solution is to improve monitoring networks it will take time to establish long enough records to support statistically robust trend and frequency analyses in the meantime long term large scale hydrologic modelling is relied on to fill the information gap for operational assessment despite limited and gap prone hydrometric records for model evaluation this introduces a second issue in regions of data scarcity the presumed accuracy and fidelity of models applied within these data poor regions there is little point in relying on models for operational and hazard assessment if the models cannot be deemed accurate or if accuracy cannot be adequately determined traditional means of evaluating hydrologic model performance relies on forcing a model with meteorologic inputs e g precipitation and temperature and evaluating model output i e streamflow against observed hydrometric data in data sparse regions there are often hundreds or thousands of kilometers between hydrometeorological stations necessitating reanalysis products for model input berg et al 2017 reanalyses and remotely sensed data are often used in place of observations but are in fact modelled background fields that are nudged or corrected by point scale field measurements tarek et al 2020 this adds another level of bias or uncertainty that must be accounted for when interpreting model output for design and operational assessment to overcome these biases a simultaneous investment in both observation monitoring networks and reanalyses products is needed hydrometric records in developed countries are ubiquitous in well populated regions at river confluences or in watersheds that have been significantly altered hence necessitating the monitoring alteration or regulation i e dams diversions withdrawals etc within a watershed disrupts the natural rainfall to runoff or snowmelt to runoff pathway adding an additional element of storage flow removal or input from adjacent watersheds decouples the normal climate hydrologic transfer function e g rainfall to runoff production inherited from catchment scale process studies these natural and artificial processes must be adequately identified and well represented within a modelling chain for a model to accurately and faithfully represent historic and future hydrologic responses clark 2020 clark et al 2015 early warning prediction systems often focus on the accurate simulation of peak streamflow volume and timing using observed and updated system state variables e g rainfall snowpack depth soil moisture etc weerts et al 2010 yucel et al 2015 the importance of internal hydrologic model structure and process partitioning for accuracy in short term prediction is often overlooked as irrelevant with emphasis placed instead on matching peak flow volume and timing in the near term errors in the internal state variables of a model may persist throughout the simulation but are less influential overall due to the shorter time scale of forecasting i e weeks to months and can be diminished through the updating nudging of variables via data assimilation resulting in more data driven forecasts dechant moradkhani 2012 thalli mani et al 2022 contrary to this long term hydrologic impact assessment exists on the order of decades to hundreds of years and relies heavily on accurate process partitioning of hydrologic storages and fluxes to get the water in the right place kirchner 2006 such that the correct amounts of water stored and lost are simulated over the long term small annual errors in water storage loss can rapidly accumulate over decades resulting in significant simulation bias numerically initial system states become redundant after a few months of continuous hydrologic simulation therefore the model s internal processes and parameterized structure is most influential for simulating long term hydrologic loss evapotranspiration and retention soil storage and therefore for runoff and streamflow production data are needed to support model evaluation over the long term and at large scales to inform the model and modellers of correct hydrologic partitions and runoff generation contributions 2 tracer aided modelling a little over three decades ago tracer aided modelling using water isotopes 18o 2h was introduced into the hydrologic community of practice beginning in the early 1960s the international atomic energy agency iaea began monitoring stable isotopes in precipitation around the world and hydrologists concurrently began compiling similar data for streamflow and discharge craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 some of the earliest hydrograph separation studies emerged shortly thereafter dinçer et al 1970 hubert et al 1969 studies examining the linkages between groundwater and surface water were some of the earliest hydrologic process studies e g sklash farvolden 1979 gradually progressing to runoff and surface water groundwater connectivity mcdonnell et al 1991 sklash et al 1986 uhlenbrook et al 2002 isotope hydrology studies have evolved to include soil water evaporation water loss residence time and broader ecohydrology applications tetzlaff et al 2015 todini 2007 yoshimura 2015 from a modelling context the earliest studies focused on hydrograph separation or end member mixing models emma aimed at separating old ground and new surface water components carey quinton 2004 elsenbeer et al 1995 genereux et al 1993 katsuyama et al 2001 laudon et al 2002 mulholland 1993 soulsby et al 2000 uhlenbrook hoeg 2003 more complex mass balance methods or simplified hydrologic models separating two or more components contributing to runoff generation at any given point in time emerged st amour et al 2005 in an effort to account for seasonality in hydrology analyses remained largely event based and at the catchment scale until the 2000s klaus mcdonnell 2013 tetzlaff et al 2015 at which point several landmark studies embedded isotope tracers directly into continuous simulation hydrologic models birkel et al 2010 dunn et al 2008 soulsby et al 2004 stadnyk falcone 2008 vaché mcdonnell 2006 the earliest studies focused on small catchments in data rich environments many studies focused on tropical or rainfall dominated regions with reduced seasonal complexity owing to the added computational cost and modelling uncertainty involved in simulating isotopic fractionation for both solid and liquid precipitation where regional or continental scale isotope monitoring networks had been established modelling slowly progressed to larger scale implementations of isotope tracers in hydrologic models birkel soulsby 2015 a good example is fekete et al 2006 that used the united states isotope monitoring network established by kendall and coplen 2001 to simulate isotopes in streamflow for the continental united states another is the iwbmiso model developed by belachew et al 2016 and the international atomic energy agency iaea that utilizes monthly data from global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip and global network for isotopes in large rivers gnir networks to drive a simulation of isotopes the iwbmiso model has been successfully applied within the data sparse global south to improve hydrological information on source water partitioning trinh et al 2017 though not continentally since its inception generally speaking the larger the modelling domain the coarser the time resolution of the model typically days up to months or years which can be visualized by the generalized trend lines for both lumped and distributed models inferred from a literature survey of tracer aided modelling fig 2 based on the studies reported in table s 1 this has undoubtedly been influenced by computing performance limitations in the early days of tracer aided modelling to simulate larger domains lumped conceptual models were developed to increase computational efficiency with the inherent trade off of neglecting spatial heterogeneity at the process level dunn et al 2008 or by using stream weighted average outputs from upper and lower reservoirs in a model structure birkel et al 2010 van huijgevoort et al 2016 storages have also been sub divided based on land cover units in addition to soil depth and saturation but over coarser spatial subbasin units or for larger time step units smith et al 2016 there are two notable exceptions to this trend land surface models lsms designed to run globally at small timesteps consistent with meteorological physics at much coarser grid resolutions and the isowatflood model black diamonds on fig 2 stadnyk et al 2013 a distributed hydrological model designed for efficient large domain simulation the climate modelling community was among the first to recognize the power of simulating isotope tracers at the large scale to aid in process verification integrating them into lsms accompanying global and regional climate models gcms rcms which facilitated global and continental simulation of isotopes brown squares on fig 2 hoffmann et al 1998 joussaume et al 1984 jouzel et al 1987 yoshimura 2015 though these were among the earliest and largest domain studies their spatial resolution remains too coarse to resolve accurate process based information or responses from individual landcover units which is required for operational prediction isowatflood is a process based hydrological model that produces spatially distributed hourly simulations of both routed streamflow and water isotope tracers along with the capability to account for operational regulation e g dams diversion irrigation kouwen 2020 with the recently introduced wasa model he et al 2019 similarly using hourly timesteps these advancements do however add computationally complexity and require smaller domains and computational units or longer simulation times distributed process based models simulate tracer and water mass for every water storage compartment associated with spatially discretized units originating from some combination of topography soils and landcover in these models isotope mixing occurs in every storage unit of the model in each time step and fluxes are passed from one compartment to the next using the isotope volumetric mass concentration of the originating compartment he et al 2019 nan et al 2021a stadnyk holmes 2020 tracer aided simulation typically assumes uniform tracer concentration and complete mixing over a timestep and within each storage unit advances in isotope mass balance mixing have introduced partial mixing to remove the requirement for uniform and complete mixing in storage compartments fenicia et al 2008 the emergence of isotope tracers to facilitate model evaluation is relatively recent in the literature with several studies highlighting their utility for benchmarking model performance birkel soulsby 2015 holmes et al 2020 holmes et al 2022a stevenson et al 2021 tunaley et al 2017 stadnyk et al 2022 summarize the history and advancement of canadian isotope tracer modelling demonstrating that an increasing number of models are developing isotope enabled versions in recent years with beria popp et al in preparation recently beginning a global review that specifically targets the progression of tracer aided mixing models and isotope aided model calibration another advancement in the field has been the emergence of artificial intelligence ai or machine learning models ml data driven approaches which could offer some promise for tracer aided modelling in specific regions vystavna et al 2022 one major limitation of this technology for isotope aided modelling is the availability of adequate data for model training calibration and limitations in ml process based accuracy fleming et al 2021 fleming gupta 2020 hindering both the development and application of tracer aided models therefore has been the availability of isotope data underpinning the modelling holmes et al 2021 point to isotope enabled climate data time series forcing as a significant limitation with a lack of isotope in precipitation observations available globally at temporal resolutions high enough to be meaningful on a hydrologic event time scale some gcms rcms integrate isotope tracers and provide a frequency of three to six hour output for isotope in precipitation time series however their spatial resolution remains too coarse to be meaningful for process based discretized modelling henderson sellers 2006 similarly event based streamflow sampling is needed to benchmark isotope enabled model output wang et al 2019 however across larger domains monthly or bi monthly sampling resolution are typically the best available data limited datasets along with the scarcity and paucity of existing records challenges the reliability and accuracy of event based isotope enabled hydrologic model simulation and their acceptance within the peer reviewed literature 3 the value of isotope tracer networks large domain networks such as those within north america gibson et al 2020b henderson sellers 2006 the swiss network schuerch et al 2004 or the iaea s global isotope monitoring network are designed to provide limited information content over large regions these networks support decision making across large domains under limited budgets as discussed by wang et al 2019 globally isotope monitoring networks are not novel and were the impetus for the integration of isotope tracer data into lsms the iaea headquartered in vienna at started gnip to understand and define the flux weighted average of all meteoric waters since 1961 schotterer et al 1996 in 2005 the global network for isotopes in large rivers gnir project was launched as a coordinated research effort to map and understand the evolution of water isotopes in large river systems and watersheds globally halder et al 2015 vitvar et al 2007 these two networks combined afford analyses of the input to output climate hydrologic transfer function for stable water isotope composition estimating large scale watershed residence times nan et al 2019 several coordinated research projects have been launched by the iaea isotope hydrology section to elucidate functionality and utility of water isotopes and to establish standard methods for the implementation of isotope tracers in hydrologic studies iaea 2022 most investigations focus on process scale understanding within watershed units however they take advantage of regionalized approaches by bringing together investigators from different nations in 2018 a unique project to understand and define the benefits of isotope aided global water balance estimation was launched to recommend standard methods for implementing and benchmarking tracer aided modelling iaea 2018 this study focused on data needed to underpin isotope aided modelling development of isotope enabled models and application of these models to global case studies isotope data networks are particularly useful when developed concomitant with hydrometric networks such that both a flow quantity volume per unit time and isotope concentration are available which is a recommendation made by the iaea vystavna et al 2022 the hydrologic information content available from isotope tracer monitoring networks is a function of scale of the basin being sampled in the same way that dominance of hydrological processes is a function of scale of the watershed fig 3 provides a theoretical probability density function of hydrometric stream gauge networks in developed nations based on data collected by the world bank grimes et al 2022 which guides the information content available from a codeveloped isotope monitoring network since hydrometric networks are designed for operational purposes the focus resides on regional scale hydrology with most gauges being at or 1000 km2 in drainage area the majority of established research based networks focus on domains 100 km2 klaus mcdonnell 2013 with national and regional networks typically including basin areas that span the 500 to 10 000 km2 range depending on the size of the nation or continent networks required for operational applications tend to focus on larger basin areas i e 1000 km2 grimes et al 2022 but also require knowledge of local and regional water management practices and operations operating at the watershed scale the disadvantage of larger scale sampling networks is their operational cost as noted by the world meteorological organization as a consideration of importance in network design world meteorological organization 1966 namely more time and person and travel cost to sample across larger spatial domains which can often be reflected in a lower temporal density of observations i e fewer field visits grimes et al 2022 as an example of a codeveloped isotope hydrometric monitoring network the canadian isotope monitoring network targets watersheds over 500 km2 with a median basin size of 13 000 km2 gibson et al 2020a which was adopted based on similar guidelines as the american monitoring network kendall coplen 2001 at this scale the focus is on regional watershed or hydrologic based assessment however in smaller basins it becomes possible to capture process behaviour in headwater catchments that are largely unregulated the latter speaks largely to the literature evolving around isotope hydrograph separation ihs studies emma studies and runoff generation processes gibson et al 2021 and the need for smaller scale research studies to fill the small basin 100 km2 gap from the regional monitoring networks as cumulative scale of a network increases decreasing resolution the focus of network design and suitability of data for hydrologic analyses shifts toward regional flood and drought frequency estimation forecasting applications and prediction of regional water supply dixon et al 2020 mishra coulibaly 2009 this shifts the information content of these data from capturing process behaviour to the more lumped behaviour of processes combining to generate runoff and streamflow consequently more emphasis is placed on combined process response than on individual processes at large operational scales emphasizing the drainage network rather than individual runoff units this introduces spatial heterogeneity and complexity along the flow path and necessitates consideration of regional water management rules capturing seasonality and long term trends in hydrometric data necessitates longer term monitoring and establishing priority stations within a network that have dedicated financial and logistical support studies have demonstrated that higher frequency monitoring e g minutes to hours is important for capturing fine scale features in process behaviour and mixing controls in smaller domains berman et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2017 sprenger et al 2019 called for more research into the temporal resolution of isotope sample collection due to the high cost of high frequency sampling and to determine the uncertainties inherent in tracer aided modelling a recent book published by the world bank however reports that successful operation of a flow gauge station depends on four to 10 site visits a year on average depending on site stability complexity of the rating accessibility and field costs grimes et al 2022 which would mean only four to 10 isotope samples a year for concomitant networks some studies have examined optimal sample collection frequency and timing for isotope monitoring networks demonstrating that low frequency sampling can be of value to modelling when careful consideration is given to the timing of sample collection stevenson et al 2021 wang et al 2019 particularly if sampling targets highly non linear periods such as streamflow recession and drier periods though critical zone science and flow path connectivity is important studies are now suggesting there is value in using isotopes to understand and improve large scale connectivity via routing and land surface storage processes in models bowen et al 2019 4 pushing boundaries new frontiers in tracer aided modelling a recent publication in nature highlighted the decline of disruptive science that nudges fields in new innovative directions and that some element of discord is needed to generate such shifts lin et al 2022 park et al 2023 the most significant advances in the sciences tend to evolve at the fringes of topical research fields where multiple disciplines e g the social and natural sciences intersect which tend to take more time investment to evolve the field of isotope enabled hydrologic modelling can be viewed as a disruptive science in many ways as it combines geochemistry hydrology and computer science to gain insight into internal process based hydrologic function at continental and global scales though decreasing process based information is resolvable moving from regional to continental or even the global scale evidence suggests enough information is preserved to guide large domain model calibration more effectively than streamflow alone holmes et al 2022a nan et al 2022 stevenson et al 2021 this becomes particularly relevant for regions with complex hydrologic process interactions changing seasonality dynamic hydrologic storage and or regions of poor streamflow observation density in data poor regions of the world isotope hydrology provides the opportunity to supplement gap prone or sparse hydrometric measurement with a lower cost than additional hydrometric monitoring data network that can be partially or wholly supported by the iaea depending on the country such approaches are used within developing nations in africa or to supplement information in south america and asia banda et al 2021 oiro et al 2018 soto et al 2020 tran et al 2019 modelling efforts leveraging these data can then be supported by well developed well funded modelling groups using high performance computing this is an example of international collaboration governed under the united nations iaea isotope hydrology programme and coordinated research project crp mandate the next wave of tracer aided modelling studies has the potential to support global predictions and operational hydrologic modelling by 1 developing isotope monitoring networks for early climate change detection 2 advancing use of isotope enabled calibration 3 continental to global scale prediction of climate induced change and 4 development of fully integrated prediction systems for future impact assessment each of these frontiers in tracer aided research are discussed below 4 1 early climate change detection networks total mean annual streamflow may at times show little to no response to climate change in recent records e g when rapid glacial melt may be offset by increased downstream evaporative loss alkama et al 2013 this should not however be mistaken for climate change having little impact on the hydrologic cycle largely because of significant non linearities and continental scaling effects labat et al 2004 water isotopes collected from even coarse resolution networks can detect changing hydrologic partitioning halder et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 2016 vystavna et al 2021 and therefore offer the opportunity for an earlier than from streamflow alone detection of climate driven impacts at the regional or continental scale for data poor regions even short term i e five to 10 years isotope monitoring when coupled with tracer aided modelling can provide significant insight into catchment process climate vulnerability and runoff generation potential birkel et al 2021 nan et al 2021b smith et al 2015 though isotopes are not a replacement for hydrologic or hydrometric measurement they are relatively cheap and easy to collect as complimentary data to supplement sparse hydrometric observation and they are readily deployed at operational scales for example the average cost of a hydrometric station installation and operation is estimated by the world bank to be around 10 000 usd grimes et al 2022 which would be roughly compare cost wise to 500 isotope samples at 20 usd sample assuming sampling is conducted on a bi monthly basis 6 samples per year that equates to a possible 83 year record of isotopes in streamflow at one location or assuming a distributed 10 sampling stations within a watershed roughly 8 years of distributed records this is not to suggest that isotope sampling is a replacement for hydrometrics but some locations are simply not conducive to implementing or maintaining additional hydrometric monitoring or due to proximity and poor transportation infrastructure are too infrequently visited and here isotopes offer a viable source of hydrologic information to address data quantity and quality gaps implementation of citizen science collection programs should be considered not unlike the cocoras network used by the meteorological monitoring community reges et al 2016 isotope sample collection is in theory even easier than weather and precipitation observations for citizen involvement as it is less prone to error only a small well sealed sample is needed not a volume reading or exact timing of the event or contamination evaporation only requirements include a bucket to capture rain snowfall or streamflow and expeditious sample collection during or immediately following a storm event to prevent evaporation samples can be sealed and stored for reasonable periods of time prior to laboratory analysis the single biggest barriers to successful launch of regional or global citizen science isotope monitoring network are accessibility and submission to analytical facilities and a lack of coordinated intergovernmental interjurisdictional programs to support funding for such networks water is not confined to the geographic borders decided by governments but by its nature is highly transboundary funding or cost share agreements similar to hydrometric monitoring programs grimes et al 2022 are necessary to ensure the longevity and consistency of sample collection and analyses laboratory analyses of course are an additional consideration over meteorological data for isotope sample collection however the network of global isotope hydrology laboratories currently connected with the iaea offers significant potential here users could collect samples and submit to a designated laboratory that is funded for a set number of analyses per year potential barriers to this concept include current laboratory capacity to facilitate timely results and coordinating a data repository across jurisdictions to ensure accessibility to these data laboratory capacity would need to be increased to support the submission of large volumes of samples which would require funding stimulus across multiple jurisdictions a coordinated database to house these data would also need to be provided and made publicly accessible similar to the iaea s gnip or gnir repositories challenges aside establishing a citizen led network of isotopes in precipitation and streamflow is possible in a similar way to north america s community collaborative rain hail and snow colorado climate centre 2022 network an isococorahs on a global scale as use and uptake of isotope data become more prominent in the hydrologic community justification to run such a network becomes easier 4 2 isotope enabled model calibration the hydrologic community has collectively recognized the process based information content embedded in tracer aided approaches as noted within the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 of paramount importance to the community is understanding climate change induced variability in space and time impacting hydrologic fluxes variability in extremes and process interactions at hydrologic interfaces isotope tracers can assist with these issues surrounding uncertainty particularly when dealing with parameterization and calibration of more complex process based models used to tackle these challenges holmes et al 2020 guse et al 2021 argue that additional data sources are required to address gaps in knowledge and accuracy in process based modelling and model evaluation isotopes can enhance hydrologic model calibration over long simulation periods by improving the hydrologic partitioning within models i e putting the water in the right place stadnyk holmes 2020 vystavna et al 2022 this often has little if any statistically significant impact on overall model performance during calibration assessed by flow performance metrics but can result in statistically meaningful improvements during validation stadnyk holmes 2020 wang et al 2019 this is an aspect of the concept of equifinality coined in the hydrologic context by keith beven beven 2006 that there are multiple statistically equal outcomes for a model resulting from different combinations of parameters through bayesian theory we can directly derive that adding additional data will reduce the parameter hence model uncertainty and assist with the equifinality problem if the intended application of the model is for long term assessment e g under future climates or for the prediction of extremes outside the observational record then incorporating isotope tracers into model calibration can have distinct and measurable advantages stadnyk holmes 2020 the trade off is that in adding something new to the model i e isotopes we may need to add additional parameters or processes to effectively simulate both water and isotope data in doing so we can inadvertently increase equifinality therefore isotopes do not necessarily increase parameter identifiability but they can reduce model uncertainty holmes et al 2020 this reduction in uncertainty is a direct result of more consistent flow path and storage simulation identified through the addition of isotope tracers that constrain the model calibration reducing the number of plausible solutions in the decision space relative to streamflow only calibration possibilities this is particularly true for process based models having significant parameter complexity and parameter process interaction where computational problems are ill posed and streamflow alone is inadequate to properly constrain the mathematical problem 4 3 continental and global scale prediction though climate change acts on a global scale it is experienced by local and community levels realized through flood drought forest fire species migration changing seasonality or ice on off periods etc climate change impact assessment therefore necessitates a global and continental approach labat et al 2004 particularly for watershed hydrology that transcends human political and geographical jurisdiction local impact or mitigation assessment is often the ultimate end goal however analysis domains must encompass the full extent of upstream contributing areas that can potentially influence or drive downstream change the next generation of models needs to reflect the full continuum of upstream to downstream impacts resulting from climate and anthropogenic changes for example climate driven changes to streamflow quantity can and will alter riverine temperature which in turn alters ecosystem viability through species habitat and survival reproduction rates and ultimately biological and social systems at the community level stadnyk et al 2021 van vliet et al 2011 large domain integrated model development is needed to support the next generation of social and environmental policy for sustainable climate change mitigation though system based analysis must be examined from a global perspective it must also include the resolution to ascertain local socio economic ecohydrological and community level impacts to offer an example changes in arctic sea ice formation decay and breakup due to high latitude warming in the arctic basin have distinct and measurable local impacts on species habitat barbedo et al 2020 affecting migratory patterns which impact traditional hunting and sustenance practice for northern and indigenous communities huntington et al 2017 as well as winter transportation and accessibility in the north porfiriev et al 2019 such wicked problems streefland krozer 2018 are far too big in scope to be tackled by any one model modeller or scientific team and require far broader networks of researchers communities institutions and policy makers to address to tackle these so called wicked problems is to develop the multi disciplinary tools and computational infrastructure necessary to analyse broad cumulative system impacts 4 4 integrated modelling systems in its recent sixth assessment report the intergovernmental panel for climate change recognized the interdependence of climate biodiversity and people and the need for integrated natural social and economic science based solutions to address climate risks eyring et al 2016 the next generation of models being developed by the hydrologic community will necessitate better research integration across disciplines hydrologic change underpins ecosystem and socio economic adaptation and therefore indirectly the model s supporting policy and operational decisions in turn regulatory and operational decisions must be re integrated back into hydrology models such that they remain representative of water supply under water managed regimes into the future some attempts at such modelling on regional scales have been undertaken e g barthel et al 2008 gober wheater 2014 hassanzadeh et al 2014 but the inherently global nature of climate change impacts and mitigation now demands we expand this scope to continental or global scales integrated approaches to modelling have typically been described under the nexus concept highlighting the transdisciplinary nature and scope of the water resources challenges we now face globally impacting ecology and environment animal and human health social structures and communities economics local and international policy security and sovereignty of nations and ultimately environmental and geopolitics ait kadi 2016 di baldassarre et al 2019 the united nations have recognized a water centric vision of the sustainable development goals sdgs vision 2030 essex et al 2020 with water underpinning all sdgs from human health and welfare to climate well being education security and even gender equality i e the idea that if women do not have seek water for family sustenance that they can more readily contribute to their education careers the economy and societal advancement isotope tracers represent only one type of data integration possible for environmental models and modelling frameworks they are a beginning step of what is achievable with the recent advances in computational power data collection and data integration from our previous example in simulating changing freshwater contributions to the arctic ocean isotopes can be useful tracers of freshwater volume but so too are temperature and dissolved oxygen that directly link to aquatic biology and ecological health and unlike isotope tracers temperature is a required input for marine system models as a driver of thermohaline circulation that in turn predict impacts on future climate farmer et al 2021 haskins et al 2020 timmermans marshall 2020 historically land surface or hydrologic models have not been interfaced with marine system models despite the fact that freshwater discharge to the arctic ocean can have a discernable impact on thermohaline circulation ridenour et al 2019 stadnyk et al 2021 transdisciplinary wicked problems require innovative solutions and with the current advances in high performance computing platforms the time is right for scientific community to unite their respective efforts in assessing global geospatial change this of course is the focus of the digital earth twin initiative designed to advance long term climate impact assessment and flood prediction capabilities globally bauer et al 2021 huang et al 2022 5 advancing operational prediction the future of operational prediction necessitates large domain model prediction at sufficiently fine time steps and large spatial domains to adequately inform operational decision making rokaya pietroniro 2022 though daily time steps provide a reasonable estimate of daily average streamflow they frequently under estimate peak flow due to the averaging of instantaneous flow values across a 24 hour period chen et al 2017 this can be problematic for flood frequency estimation particularly when used for infrastructure design e g sizing of dams culverts bridge piers and floodplain mapping many regulatory bodies e g engineers canada have specified that engineers must account for climate change but have offered little to no specific guidance on how to do this e g engineers canada 2016 some guidance exists in some jurisdictions but there remains a lack of ubiquitous and consistent technical specifications on dealing with non stationarity resulting from climate change csa group 2019 to support the prediction of maximum peak flow and flood frequency estimation under climate change hydrologic models driven by a range of climate scenarios are required though this is a well established practice model performance or fit for purpose is typically evaluated based on a model s capability to match simulated output to observed streamflow records in a historic period clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 requiring little information on how that is achieved or the internal process partitioning within the model kirchner 2006 klemeš 1986 it is well established within the climate modelling literature that bias correction is important for accurate long term projection shrestha et al 2017 in a similar way hydrologic models poorly representing process partitioning can also yield erroneous flow quantile predictions comparing flow only to tracer aided model simulations in the literature has demonstrated that this lack of process accuracy can underestimate extreme flow quantiles q100 holmes et al 2020 and it is more likely than not that such under estimations become even more severe under future climates such artefacts in the prediction of upper quantiles flows likely occur due to the high flow thresholds being under represented in observed historic records that are used for model calibration resulting in extrapolation error when estimating the processes and process partitioning controlling the extreme runoff response e g fig 4 under future climates models are explicitly required to simulate conditions outside the period of calibration i e historical record where extremes and durations of interannual wet dry cycles can be more intense and variable extreme flood events in recent years are increasingly complex and severe resulting from a combination of critical conditions being met such as extreme rainfall on high antecedent wetness and a lack of storage availability within the upstream basin it is now well established that evaluating model performance against both streamflow and isotope tracers results in improved flow path and storage simulation over the historical period of record a strong argument can therefore be made that under future climate extremes more accurate hydrologic partitioning and simulation of water storage is critical to the prediction of upper quantile extreme flows though there is no way to validate projected increases to extreme flow in the present day i e because these flows have yet to occur these changes should be considered in the so called factor of safety and design principles more specifically it needs to be acknowledged that the range of observed historic streamflow is likely too narrow to capture the full range of flow variability expected under future climates and that upper decile flows are likely inadequately represented in historic time series due to their low frequency of occurrence and the tendency for gauge washout under extreme flow conditions this is demonstrated on fig 4 that follows from holmes et al 2020 where the observed high flow of record occurred in 2017 post modelling study the more extreme higher quantile flows projected into future periods by the calibrated tracer aided model are not in fact outside the range of possible and reach magnitudes up to and exceeding the 2017 event whereas the flow only model significantly under estimates magnitudes corresponding to the 2017 event in the historic period and results in a lower upper quantile estimation under future climates it is important for the design community to ensure the models used for prediction are adequately calibrated to capture and reproduce extreme events more common place under future climates this is not to say that hydrologists and engineers need to or even should become isotope hydrologists or isotope experts isotope tracers are however proving to be a valuable tool that warrants more use and consideration within the practitioner community it is incumbent on researchers to find ways to make isotope enabled models and modelling tools more accessible to the community at large klemeš 1986 there are several ways to increase the uptake of isotope hydrology within the practitioner community including but not limited to increasing 1 data availability and accessibility 2 peer and community support 3 fair findable accessible interoperable reusable practices for tracer aided model development 4 tools for the hydrologic community that assimilate isotope data behind the scenes and 5 short courses education and outreach these points are discussed below in detail 5 1 data availability and accessibility improved data availability and accessibility including models and processing scripts is likely to increase the uptake and use of isotope tracers for hydrological assessment vystavna et al 2022 one disadvantage the isotope hydrology community has faced is a lack of data availability data consistency and or general accessibility as more global isotope networks emerge new and innovative applications evolve to assess global and continental scale hydrology vystavna et al 2021 one distinct advantage isotope tracers have are a global regulated by the iaea standard that affords intercomparison of sites allowing for translation of hydrologic information across continents and scales i e the delta notation increasing data availability however will require interjurisdictional coordination financial and logistical support for monitoring networks 5 2 peer support peer support and a common community of practice will facilitate the development publication and critical evaluation of studies employing operational large domain prediction systems evolving from regional monitoring networks such studies will not necessarily rely on a priori or in situ isotope sampling and cannot by nature of their domain be under pinned by extensive suites of high resolution isotope measurements this is a shift from the current literature which heavily focuses on hillslope or catchment scales extensively monitored through both time and space see fig 2 that should be viewed as disruptive science park et al 2023 this is not to suggest that rigorous peer review or scrutiny of large domain models and data are not required or that smaller scale studies should cease rather large domain studies should be encouraged by the community and their development and testing supported within the peer review system applied research aims to bridge the gap between academia and engineering practice and despite perhaps lacking high resolution data and complete process level understanding does not offer less value the significance of such work is often in learning what processes are currently not well represented within a large domain model adequately but that are perhaps important for such model outcomes 5 3 fair principles it is critical for modelling practitioners to be more transparent in their methods requiring model codes equations and benchmarking studies to be reproducible in order to manage operational liabilities stagge et al 2019 point out that only 0 6 to 6 8 of 1 989 articles reviewed in the peer reviewed literature might be reproducible with adequate details methods and scripts available to recreate the scientific findings for research to transcend academic only use consistent workflows that provide access to model and study independent codes and scripts i e toolboxes that aid in pre and post processing model input output are needed that means both codes and methodological application i e setup calibration testing and validation need to be well documented and ideally employ standardized community workflows knoben et al 2021 the gold standard as both knoben et al 2021 and rigon et al 2022 point out is to eliminate much of the common work of model setup and standardize the process across a multitude of model structures and domains that is they are non specific to a particular type of model lumped vs distributed or model forcing dem landcover data or data format future tracer aided model developments should endeavour to follow the fair findable accessible interoperable and reusable wilkinson et al 2016 principles to increase model and code accessibility for operational use and testing 5 4 open access scripts and codes following from the fair principles of model development the hydrologic and practitioner communities can be better supported through the development of open access scripts and workflows that aid in the tedious but necessary preparation of model inputs interpretation and analysis of model outputs hall et al 2022 knoben et al 2021 forbes 2016 recently reported that 60 of scientific research involved data cleansing which is a set of entirely repeatable steps that in fact does not need to be redone for each model or study particularly needed are model workflows or guidance from a known documented standard within the climate change or large scale hydrologic communities to ensure consistency and accuracy this is a critical gap underpinning public safety and the design of global infrastructure that can result in catastrophic failure under extreme events it is in such workflows or guidance documents that the utility of isotope tracers could be highlighted as an additional source of data that the community might consider when examining extreme events though it is unrealistic to assume all hydrologic practitioners will become isotope hydrology experts this does not mean isotope aided analyses need to be inaccessible to the community of practice the development of for example r programming language functions and packages that support real time watershed based geographical information system gis analyses of isotope water balance assessment could facilitate broader uptake isotope informed hydrologic assessment this in turn aids in the justification of long term isotope monitoring networks potentially opening up additional funding and interjurisdictional support in canada development of the isohydrology package is underway as part of the hydrology package supported by the canadian society for hydrological sciences cshs which is an operational package designed to support canadian hydrologists anderson et al 2019 the canadian isotope monitoring network dataset will be made accessible through a series of r functions along with codes that support isotope enabled water balance calculations users will be able to compute water yield runoff evaporation to inflow ratios evapotranspiration partitioning transpiration relative to evapotranspiration and residence times for basins of interest having both hydrometric and isotope time series this can have operational significance both on a local watershed scale but also through cross comparison of regional or canada wide results that classify dominant water loss mechanisms through isotope enabled water balance gibson et al 2021 the long term vision is to take this package and its functionality global similar to the global water isotopes database widb developed for isotopes in precipitation and water sources putman bowen 2019 but with enhanced computational functionality 5 5 education training some of the issues raised by klemeš 1986 decades ago still persist with barriers in education and training and the lack of a professional internationally recognized designation for hydrologists in the united states the american institute for hydrologists does in fact have a professional hydrologist p hydro designation but there have been issues with membership uptake and recognition outside american jurisdictions internationally most hydrologists are registered engineers or geoscientists however this often means very diverse backgrounds and training that remove or dilute the focus specifically on water based curricula in canada a p hydro designation was explored by the canadian society for hydrological sciences cshs however was not pursued due to a lack of perceived membership and the complexity of regulating across provincial jurisdiction there is a need for an international p hydro designation that affords hydrologists the opportunity to develop a strong international community of practice and where formal education and training standards can be determined with a set of minimum training criteria for the profession such criteria could then be used by local or regional regulatory bodies to affirm the credentials of individuals certified to practice this additionally offers the opportunity to coalesce training in specialized topical areas such as isotope hydrology offering a means of bridging the science to practice gap on complex or emerging topics in hydrology this is particularly crucial to support the highly trans disciplinary nature of the field of practice in the face of increasing hydrologic complexity for realistic uptake and deployment of isotope hydrology among practitioners education and training needs to be accessible among the non academic community of particular interest to practitioners are certificate type short courses several days to one week in duration that offer eligibility for continuing professional development and that can be counted towards professional accreditation several such courses exist globally however are often dominated by either academics students or professionals but not both course may also be inaccessible to professionals because of cost timing conflicting with operational duties and or time requirements ideally training courses would blend practitioner and academic requirements be flexible in their timing and reinforce networking and meaningful training interactions for all indirectly the mix of academics and professionals supports hands on technology transfer via students academics to professionals a good example is the university of saskatchewan s canada environmental science 898 course isotope tracers in catchment hydrology global institute for water security 2022 offered by jeffrey mcdonnell that offers both in person and virtual synchronized classrooms to foster an environment of interaction among students and professionals offering both university credit and a professional certificate in the years since its inception it has become a go to training course on isotope tracers for hydrometric professionals collecting these samples across canada and the united states 6 summary the isotope hydrology community of practice must commit to supporting the use of isotopes for integrated modelling and operational prediction by improving the establishment of monitoring networks and accessibility of observed data and through peer review processes that recognize and support the value in large domain studies and isotope assessments just as data intense monitoring sites and catchment scale studies influenced knowledge of process based interactions large domain studies can influence our knowledge of system storage and river routing networks these larger conveyance systems in hydrology are of paramount importance for river forecasting flood quantile estimation and the design of infrastructure there is growing support for integrating isotope tracers into large domain hydrological models to support operational prediction by ensuring accurate process partitioning and model evaluation historically it has been a lack of large scale regional continental and global isotope monitoring networks with adequate data resolution and limited data accessibility that has hindered developments within the community a renewed commitment to international cooperation and the deployment of isotope monitoring networks concomitant with hydrometric monitoring programs and the promise of future citizen led networks offers new opportunities for large scale modelling what is needed now is inter governmental interjurisdictional support for isotope data and dedicated funding to support isotope analyses here too citizen science and the incorporation of research specific networks into data repositories has a role and should be promoted within the community simultaneously with the development of large scale data networks advances in computational efficiency and equity have led to the creation of higher resolution models capable of hourly event based simulation across continental domains that integrate isotopes and other environmental tracers integrating isotope tracers into large domain models directly supports model calibration by reducing simulation uncertainty by improving parameter and process visibility within model evaluation metrics and the calibration process these advances support model evaluation and prediction across large domains and long time periods where there are sparse or discontinuous observations financial or accessibility barriers to expanding hydrometric measurement or the need to evaluate integrated and cumulative system impacts water isotopes have been implemented and deployed in hillslope and catchment scale studies for decades because of their ability to see the underlying process based hydrological controls and changes driving runoff generation this offers an opportunity for practitioners to improve simulation of extreme events improved estimation of soil antecedent wetness or evaporative loss can significantly alter future projections of extreme flow quantiles which has a direct implication for public safety this is increasingly more relevant as the extreme events needed for design are no longer represented in historic records or hydrologic conditions meaning our models are increasingly pushed beyond their training conditions increasing the accessibility of isotope enable prediction tools and data are best achieved by adopting the fair scientific principles such that new codes and scripts are archived and findable and accessible and that they are interoperable and can be used interchangeably among different studies standardized workflows for tracer aided modelling can be used as guidelines for new practitioners and can upload the community to a set standard of practice for model evaluation to increase confidence in our products following this a concerted effort to invest in education outreach and training is needed by the community to increase the uptake of isotope hydrology and the general knowledge of their benefits for hydrologic prediction large scale hydrologic and isotope modelling when coupled with computational advances offers a glimpse into the power and utility of integrated modelling techniques which can be further expanded to examine ecohydrologic and socio economic feedbacks on the natural system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

2209,stable isotopes in water oxygen 18 and deuterium are hydrologic tracers which have been embedded into both analytical mass balance and physically based continuous simulation models improving hydrologic process partitioning and regional source identification resulting in early climate change detection recent advances in the field of isotope hydrology have improved coordinated investment in global monitoring networks invested in integrated modelling tools to support prediction and model evaluation and expanded the scale of analyses possible this review focuses on the applications of isotope tracers to large scale hydrologic modelling its inception and evolution and future directions for advancing this field with emphasis on the utility of isotope tracers for operational water resources prediction the hydrologic community has begun to steer toward alternative hydrologic data due to the coinciding realities of limited data records and urgent data needs water resources infrastructure and management requires projections of water supply beyond the 50 to 100 year design life with the general rule of flow frequency necessitating a 100 to 200 year assessment however there exist few data networks globally with records sufficient to support this kind of long term assessment and climate change is increasing the frequency of these extreme events historically large scale and long time series simulation has meant less attention on process function model fidelity due to computational constraints however we argue that this may no longer be adequate under increasingly complex climate hydrologic feedbacks and integrated system models that incorporate human decisions environmental health and socio economic pressures to expand the uptake of isotope tracers in practice we emphasize their value for extreme quantile prediction under future projections and call for the community of practice to support data networks and accessibility support peer review of large domain less data intensive applications and employ the fair findable accessible interoperable reusable scientific principles though still an emerging scientific field isotope hydrology has considerable value to the practitioner community with the proper education and training necessary to build confidence underpinned by well developed and accessible tools for deployment keywords surface water hydrology hydrologic modelling isotope tracers tracer aided models data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 role of large scale hydrologic modelling for decades the hydrologic community has focused on advancing knowledge of hydrologic processes and connectivity to better understand and predict streamflow generation multitudes of hillslope and intensively monitored research watershed sites have been established globally all with the same goal to better understand the rainfall to runoff or snowmelt to runoff evolution runoff generation processes and hydrologic pathways klaus mcdonnell 2013 it can be argued though that this has come at the expense of a research focus on larger scales i e where individual processes are less discernable which are more suitable to operational prediction and decision making in water resources klemeš 1986 and what is now needed is a stronger focus on prediction at regional and continental domains traditionally scaling in hydrology has referred to the study of hydrologic function and processes in intensively monitored hillslope or catchment scale 100 km2 studies that require extrapolation of findings up to larger systems tetzlaff et al 2015 the assumptions underpinning scaling are problematic for several reasons including that hydrological interactions are known to be highly non linear and do not behave interact or connect proportionately at different scales specifically pertaining to modelling processes important at the hillslope scale are often not even seen by model performance criteria evaluated at streamflow gauging stations as being influential to downstream streamflow generation or for larger watershed scale dynamics fig 1 transferability and scalability also inherently assume stationarity in time and space namely that the same relative contributions from hydrologic compartments exist across seasons or from upstream to downstream respectively holmes et al 2022a demonstrate this is in fact not the case and that hydrological non stationarity space and non transferability time exist for simulated hydrological processes and performance metric sensitivities their study highlights that stationarity does not and should not necessarily be assumed and that traditional foundational assumptions in hydrologic modelling could be challengeable moreover the study suggests that isotope tracers aid hydrologic models in seeing more processes across all scales independent of the performance metric selected for model evaluation fig 1 offers a glimpse of the impacts of non stationarity for model evaluation and consequently model fidelity by extrapolating the findings of the holmes et al 2022b study the average process based hydrologic sensitivities across the entire watershed 160 000 km2 top right inset when a model adopted from the holmes et al 2022b is evaluated at all gauges can in fact be substantially different from those within individual subbasins assessed at each flow gauge this is a function of different travel times and physiographic controls e g mountainous headwaters versus low lying downstream wetlands within the subbasins and also as a function of size of the basin influencing basin heterogeneity represented by the size of the pie chart catchment and hillslope studies therefore cannot simply be scaled up and assumed to be representative of scenarios at operational scales 1000 km2 or more typically underpinning flood frequency analysis forecasting or the design of bridge piers reservoirs and large dams the reality is that many hydrologists are faced with making decisions impacting public safety health and environments on long time scales with an absence of data monitoring networks validated model outputs and knowledge of hydrologic system behaviour reliable predictions at an operational scale are required to inform practitioners of continental changes in water supply as well as regional hydrological process controls rokaya pietroniro 2022 complex hydrologic interactions those in high latitude environments or less populated developed regions remain particularly poorly monitored and understood due to sparse data networks for example in canada the majority of basins are ungauged or monitored below world meteorological organization standards coulibaly et al 2013 and with 60 of canadian rivers draining northward stadnyk déry 2021 the reliability of high latitude hydrologic predictions becomes problematic this phenomenon is not exclusive to canada however with the majority of the african continent being under studied and under monitored for surface water resources papa et al 2022 and this trend generally extending throughout much of the global south dorigo et al 2021 in the lower and mid latitude watersheds basins are often heavily regulated and fragmented déry et al 2021 grill et al 2019 resulting in significantly different hydrologic behaviour than the natural idealized rainfall runoff responses understood from catchment scale studies though the obvious solution is to improve monitoring networks it will take time to establish long enough records to support statistically robust trend and frequency analyses in the meantime long term large scale hydrologic modelling is relied on to fill the information gap for operational assessment despite limited and gap prone hydrometric records for model evaluation this introduces a second issue in regions of data scarcity the presumed accuracy and fidelity of models applied within these data poor regions there is little point in relying on models for operational and hazard assessment if the models cannot be deemed accurate or if accuracy cannot be adequately determined traditional means of evaluating hydrologic model performance relies on forcing a model with meteorologic inputs e g precipitation and temperature and evaluating model output i e streamflow against observed hydrometric data in data sparse regions there are often hundreds or thousands of kilometers between hydrometeorological stations necessitating reanalysis products for model input berg et al 2017 reanalyses and remotely sensed data are often used in place of observations but are in fact modelled background fields that are nudged or corrected by point scale field measurements tarek et al 2020 this adds another level of bias or uncertainty that must be accounted for when interpreting model output for design and operational assessment to overcome these biases a simultaneous investment in both observation monitoring networks and reanalyses products is needed hydrometric records in developed countries are ubiquitous in well populated regions at river confluences or in watersheds that have been significantly altered hence necessitating the monitoring alteration or regulation i e dams diversions withdrawals etc within a watershed disrupts the natural rainfall to runoff or snowmelt to runoff pathway adding an additional element of storage flow removal or input from adjacent watersheds decouples the normal climate hydrologic transfer function e g rainfall to runoff production inherited from catchment scale process studies these natural and artificial processes must be adequately identified and well represented within a modelling chain for a model to accurately and faithfully represent historic and future hydrologic responses clark 2020 clark et al 2015 early warning prediction systems often focus on the accurate simulation of peak streamflow volume and timing using observed and updated system state variables e g rainfall snowpack depth soil moisture etc weerts et al 2010 yucel et al 2015 the importance of internal hydrologic model structure and process partitioning for accuracy in short term prediction is often overlooked as irrelevant with emphasis placed instead on matching peak flow volume and timing in the near term errors in the internal state variables of a model may persist throughout the simulation but are less influential overall due to the shorter time scale of forecasting i e weeks to months and can be diminished through the updating nudging of variables via data assimilation resulting in more data driven forecasts dechant moradkhani 2012 thalli mani et al 2022 contrary to this long term hydrologic impact assessment exists on the order of decades to hundreds of years and relies heavily on accurate process partitioning of hydrologic storages and fluxes to get the water in the right place kirchner 2006 such that the correct amounts of water stored and lost are simulated over the long term small annual errors in water storage loss can rapidly accumulate over decades resulting in significant simulation bias numerically initial system states become redundant after a few months of continuous hydrologic simulation therefore the model s internal processes and parameterized structure is most influential for simulating long term hydrologic loss evapotranspiration and retention soil storage and therefore for runoff and streamflow production data are needed to support model evaluation over the long term and at large scales to inform the model and modellers of correct hydrologic partitions and runoff generation contributions 2 tracer aided modelling a little over three decades ago tracer aided modelling using water isotopes 18o 2h was introduced into the hydrologic community of practice beginning in the early 1960s the international atomic energy agency iaea began monitoring stable isotopes in precipitation around the world and hydrologists concurrently began compiling similar data for streamflow and discharge craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 some of the earliest hydrograph separation studies emerged shortly thereafter dinçer et al 1970 hubert et al 1969 studies examining the linkages between groundwater and surface water were some of the earliest hydrologic process studies e g sklash farvolden 1979 gradually progressing to runoff and surface water groundwater connectivity mcdonnell et al 1991 sklash et al 1986 uhlenbrook et al 2002 isotope hydrology studies have evolved to include soil water evaporation water loss residence time and broader ecohydrology applications tetzlaff et al 2015 todini 2007 yoshimura 2015 from a modelling context the earliest studies focused on hydrograph separation or end member mixing models emma aimed at separating old ground and new surface water components carey quinton 2004 elsenbeer et al 1995 genereux et al 1993 katsuyama et al 2001 laudon et al 2002 mulholland 1993 soulsby et al 2000 uhlenbrook hoeg 2003 more complex mass balance methods or simplified hydrologic models separating two or more components contributing to runoff generation at any given point in time emerged st amour et al 2005 in an effort to account for seasonality in hydrology analyses remained largely event based and at the catchment scale until the 2000s klaus mcdonnell 2013 tetzlaff et al 2015 at which point several landmark studies embedded isotope tracers directly into continuous simulation hydrologic models birkel et al 2010 dunn et al 2008 soulsby et al 2004 stadnyk falcone 2008 vaché mcdonnell 2006 the earliest studies focused on small catchments in data rich environments many studies focused on tropical or rainfall dominated regions with reduced seasonal complexity owing to the added computational cost and modelling uncertainty involved in simulating isotopic fractionation for both solid and liquid precipitation where regional or continental scale isotope monitoring networks had been established modelling slowly progressed to larger scale implementations of isotope tracers in hydrologic models birkel soulsby 2015 a good example is fekete et al 2006 that used the united states isotope monitoring network established by kendall and coplen 2001 to simulate isotopes in streamflow for the continental united states another is the iwbmiso model developed by belachew et al 2016 and the international atomic energy agency iaea that utilizes monthly data from global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip and global network for isotopes in large rivers gnir networks to drive a simulation of isotopes the iwbmiso model has been successfully applied within the data sparse global south to improve hydrological information on source water partitioning trinh et al 2017 though not continentally since its inception generally speaking the larger the modelling domain the coarser the time resolution of the model typically days up to months or years which can be visualized by the generalized trend lines for both lumped and distributed models inferred from a literature survey of tracer aided modelling fig 2 based on the studies reported in table s 1 this has undoubtedly been influenced by computing performance limitations in the early days of tracer aided modelling to simulate larger domains lumped conceptual models were developed to increase computational efficiency with the inherent trade off of neglecting spatial heterogeneity at the process level dunn et al 2008 or by using stream weighted average outputs from upper and lower reservoirs in a model structure birkel et al 2010 van huijgevoort et al 2016 storages have also been sub divided based on land cover units in addition to soil depth and saturation but over coarser spatial subbasin units or for larger time step units smith et al 2016 there are two notable exceptions to this trend land surface models lsms designed to run globally at small timesteps consistent with meteorological physics at much coarser grid resolutions and the isowatflood model black diamonds on fig 2 stadnyk et al 2013 a distributed hydrological model designed for efficient large domain simulation the climate modelling community was among the first to recognize the power of simulating isotope tracers at the large scale to aid in process verification integrating them into lsms accompanying global and regional climate models gcms rcms which facilitated global and continental simulation of isotopes brown squares on fig 2 hoffmann et al 1998 joussaume et al 1984 jouzel et al 1987 yoshimura 2015 though these were among the earliest and largest domain studies their spatial resolution remains too coarse to resolve accurate process based information or responses from individual landcover units which is required for operational prediction isowatflood is a process based hydrological model that produces spatially distributed hourly simulations of both routed streamflow and water isotope tracers along with the capability to account for operational regulation e g dams diversion irrigation kouwen 2020 with the recently introduced wasa model he et al 2019 similarly using hourly timesteps these advancements do however add computationally complexity and require smaller domains and computational units or longer simulation times distributed process based models simulate tracer and water mass for every water storage compartment associated with spatially discretized units originating from some combination of topography soils and landcover in these models isotope mixing occurs in every storage unit of the model in each time step and fluxes are passed from one compartment to the next using the isotope volumetric mass concentration of the originating compartment he et al 2019 nan et al 2021a stadnyk holmes 2020 tracer aided simulation typically assumes uniform tracer concentration and complete mixing over a timestep and within each storage unit advances in isotope mass balance mixing have introduced partial mixing to remove the requirement for uniform and complete mixing in storage compartments fenicia et al 2008 the emergence of isotope tracers to facilitate model evaluation is relatively recent in the literature with several studies highlighting their utility for benchmarking model performance birkel soulsby 2015 holmes et al 2020 holmes et al 2022a stevenson et al 2021 tunaley et al 2017 stadnyk et al 2022 summarize the history and advancement of canadian isotope tracer modelling demonstrating that an increasing number of models are developing isotope enabled versions in recent years with beria popp et al in preparation recently beginning a global review that specifically targets the progression of tracer aided mixing models and isotope aided model calibration another advancement in the field has been the emergence of artificial intelligence ai or machine learning models ml data driven approaches which could offer some promise for tracer aided modelling in specific regions vystavna et al 2022 one major limitation of this technology for isotope aided modelling is the availability of adequate data for model training calibration and limitations in ml process based accuracy fleming et al 2021 fleming gupta 2020 hindering both the development and application of tracer aided models therefore has been the availability of isotope data underpinning the modelling holmes et al 2021 point to isotope enabled climate data time series forcing as a significant limitation with a lack of isotope in precipitation observations available globally at temporal resolutions high enough to be meaningful on a hydrologic event time scale some gcms rcms integrate isotope tracers and provide a frequency of three to six hour output for isotope in precipitation time series however their spatial resolution remains too coarse to be meaningful for process based discretized modelling henderson sellers 2006 similarly event based streamflow sampling is needed to benchmark isotope enabled model output wang et al 2019 however across larger domains monthly or bi monthly sampling resolution are typically the best available data limited datasets along with the scarcity and paucity of existing records challenges the reliability and accuracy of event based isotope enabled hydrologic model simulation and their acceptance within the peer reviewed literature 3 the value of isotope tracer networks large domain networks such as those within north america gibson et al 2020b henderson sellers 2006 the swiss network schuerch et al 2004 or the iaea s global isotope monitoring network are designed to provide limited information content over large regions these networks support decision making across large domains under limited budgets as discussed by wang et al 2019 globally isotope monitoring networks are not novel and were the impetus for the integration of isotope tracer data into lsms the iaea headquartered in vienna at started gnip to understand and define the flux weighted average of all meteoric waters since 1961 schotterer et al 1996 in 2005 the global network for isotopes in large rivers gnir project was launched as a coordinated research effort to map and understand the evolution of water isotopes in large river systems and watersheds globally halder et al 2015 vitvar et al 2007 these two networks combined afford analyses of the input to output climate hydrologic transfer function for stable water isotope composition estimating large scale watershed residence times nan et al 2019 several coordinated research projects have been launched by the iaea isotope hydrology section to elucidate functionality and utility of water isotopes and to establish standard methods for the implementation of isotope tracers in hydrologic studies iaea 2022 most investigations focus on process scale understanding within watershed units however they take advantage of regionalized approaches by bringing together investigators from different nations in 2018 a unique project to understand and define the benefits of isotope aided global water balance estimation was launched to recommend standard methods for implementing and benchmarking tracer aided modelling iaea 2018 this study focused on data needed to underpin isotope aided modelling development of isotope enabled models and application of these models to global case studies isotope data networks are particularly useful when developed concomitant with hydrometric networks such that both a flow quantity volume per unit time and isotope concentration are available which is a recommendation made by the iaea vystavna et al 2022 the hydrologic information content available from isotope tracer monitoring networks is a function of scale of the basin being sampled in the same way that dominance of hydrological processes is a function of scale of the watershed fig 3 provides a theoretical probability density function of hydrometric stream gauge networks in developed nations based on data collected by the world bank grimes et al 2022 which guides the information content available from a codeveloped isotope monitoring network since hydrometric networks are designed for operational purposes the focus resides on regional scale hydrology with most gauges being at or 1000 km2 in drainage area the majority of established research based networks focus on domains 100 km2 klaus mcdonnell 2013 with national and regional networks typically including basin areas that span the 500 to 10 000 km2 range depending on the size of the nation or continent networks required for operational applications tend to focus on larger basin areas i e 1000 km2 grimes et al 2022 but also require knowledge of local and regional water management practices and operations operating at the watershed scale the disadvantage of larger scale sampling networks is their operational cost as noted by the world meteorological organization as a consideration of importance in network design world meteorological organization 1966 namely more time and person and travel cost to sample across larger spatial domains which can often be reflected in a lower temporal density of observations i e fewer field visits grimes et al 2022 as an example of a codeveloped isotope hydrometric monitoring network the canadian isotope monitoring network targets watersheds over 500 km2 with a median basin size of 13 000 km2 gibson et al 2020a which was adopted based on similar guidelines as the american monitoring network kendall coplen 2001 at this scale the focus is on regional watershed or hydrologic based assessment however in smaller basins it becomes possible to capture process behaviour in headwater catchments that are largely unregulated the latter speaks largely to the literature evolving around isotope hydrograph separation ihs studies emma studies and runoff generation processes gibson et al 2021 and the need for smaller scale research studies to fill the small basin 100 km2 gap from the regional monitoring networks as cumulative scale of a network increases decreasing resolution the focus of network design and suitability of data for hydrologic analyses shifts toward regional flood and drought frequency estimation forecasting applications and prediction of regional water supply dixon et al 2020 mishra coulibaly 2009 this shifts the information content of these data from capturing process behaviour to the more lumped behaviour of processes combining to generate runoff and streamflow consequently more emphasis is placed on combined process response than on individual processes at large operational scales emphasizing the drainage network rather than individual runoff units this introduces spatial heterogeneity and complexity along the flow path and necessitates consideration of regional water management rules capturing seasonality and long term trends in hydrometric data necessitates longer term monitoring and establishing priority stations within a network that have dedicated financial and logistical support studies have demonstrated that higher frequency monitoring e g minutes to hours is important for capturing fine scale features in process behaviour and mixing controls in smaller domains berman et al 2009 von freyberg et al 2017 sprenger et al 2019 called for more research into the temporal resolution of isotope sample collection due to the high cost of high frequency sampling and to determine the uncertainties inherent in tracer aided modelling a recent book published by the world bank however reports that successful operation of a flow gauge station depends on four to 10 site visits a year on average depending on site stability complexity of the rating accessibility and field costs grimes et al 2022 which would mean only four to 10 isotope samples a year for concomitant networks some studies have examined optimal sample collection frequency and timing for isotope monitoring networks demonstrating that low frequency sampling can be of value to modelling when careful consideration is given to the timing of sample collection stevenson et al 2021 wang et al 2019 particularly if sampling targets highly non linear periods such as streamflow recession and drier periods though critical zone science and flow path connectivity is important studies are now suggesting there is value in using isotopes to understand and improve large scale connectivity via routing and land surface storage processes in models bowen et al 2019 4 pushing boundaries new frontiers in tracer aided modelling a recent publication in nature highlighted the decline of disruptive science that nudges fields in new innovative directions and that some element of discord is needed to generate such shifts lin et al 2022 park et al 2023 the most significant advances in the sciences tend to evolve at the fringes of topical research fields where multiple disciplines e g the social and natural sciences intersect which tend to take more time investment to evolve the field of isotope enabled hydrologic modelling can be viewed as a disruptive science in many ways as it combines geochemistry hydrology and computer science to gain insight into internal process based hydrologic function at continental and global scales though decreasing process based information is resolvable moving from regional to continental or even the global scale evidence suggests enough information is preserved to guide large domain model calibration more effectively than streamflow alone holmes et al 2022a nan et al 2022 stevenson et al 2021 this becomes particularly relevant for regions with complex hydrologic process interactions changing seasonality dynamic hydrologic storage and or regions of poor streamflow observation density in data poor regions of the world isotope hydrology provides the opportunity to supplement gap prone or sparse hydrometric measurement with a lower cost than additional hydrometric monitoring data network that can be partially or wholly supported by the iaea depending on the country such approaches are used within developing nations in africa or to supplement information in south america and asia banda et al 2021 oiro et al 2018 soto et al 2020 tran et al 2019 modelling efforts leveraging these data can then be supported by well developed well funded modelling groups using high performance computing this is an example of international collaboration governed under the united nations iaea isotope hydrology programme and coordinated research project crp mandate the next wave of tracer aided modelling studies has the potential to support global predictions and operational hydrologic modelling by 1 developing isotope monitoring networks for early climate change detection 2 advancing use of isotope enabled calibration 3 continental to global scale prediction of climate induced change and 4 development of fully integrated prediction systems for future impact assessment each of these frontiers in tracer aided research are discussed below 4 1 early climate change detection networks total mean annual streamflow may at times show little to no response to climate change in recent records e g when rapid glacial melt may be offset by increased downstream evaporative loss alkama et al 2013 this should not however be mistaken for climate change having little impact on the hydrologic cycle largely because of significant non linearities and continental scaling effects labat et al 2004 water isotopes collected from even coarse resolution networks can detect changing hydrologic partitioning halder et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 2016 vystavna et al 2021 and therefore offer the opportunity for an earlier than from streamflow alone detection of climate driven impacts at the regional or continental scale for data poor regions even short term i e five to 10 years isotope monitoring when coupled with tracer aided modelling can provide significant insight into catchment process climate vulnerability and runoff generation potential birkel et al 2021 nan et al 2021b smith et al 2015 though isotopes are not a replacement for hydrologic or hydrometric measurement they are relatively cheap and easy to collect as complimentary data to supplement sparse hydrometric observation and they are readily deployed at operational scales for example the average cost of a hydrometric station installation and operation is estimated by the world bank to be around 10 000 usd grimes et al 2022 which would be roughly compare cost wise to 500 isotope samples at 20 usd sample assuming sampling is conducted on a bi monthly basis 6 samples per year that equates to a possible 83 year record of isotopes in streamflow at one location or assuming a distributed 10 sampling stations within a watershed roughly 8 years of distributed records this is not to suggest that isotope sampling is a replacement for hydrometrics but some locations are simply not conducive to implementing or maintaining additional hydrometric monitoring or due to proximity and poor transportation infrastructure are too infrequently visited and here isotopes offer a viable source of hydrologic information to address data quantity and quality gaps implementation of citizen science collection programs should be considered not unlike the cocoras network used by the meteorological monitoring community reges et al 2016 isotope sample collection is in theory even easier than weather and precipitation observations for citizen involvement as it is less prone to error only a small well sealed sample is needed not a volume reading or exact timing of the event or contamination evaporation only requirements include a bucket to capture rain snowfall or streamflow and expeditious sample collection during or immediately following a storm event to prevent evaporation samples can be sealed and stored for reasonable periods of time prior to laboratory analysis the single biggest barriers to successful launch of regional or global citizen science isotope monitoring network are accessibility and submission to analytical facilities and a lack of coordinated intergovernmental interjurisdictional programs to support funding for such networks water is not confined to the geographic borders decided by governments but by its nature is highly transboundary funding or cost share agreements similar to hydrometric monitoring programs grimes et al 2022 are necessary to ensure the longevity and consistency of sample collection and analyses laboratory analyses of course are an additional consideration over meteorological data for isotope sample collection however the network of global isotope hydrology laboratories currently connected with the iaea offers significant potential here users could collect samples and submit to a designated laboratory that is funded for a set number of analyses per year potential barriers to this concept include current laboratory capacity to facilitate timely results and coordinating a data repository across jurisdictions to ensure accessibility to these data laboratory capacity would need to be increased to support the submission of large volumes of samples which would require funding stimulus across multiple jurisdictions a coordinated database to house these data would also need to be provided and made publicly accessible similar to the iaea s gnip or gnir repositories challenges aside establishing a citizen led network of isotopes in precipitation and streamflow is possible in a similar way to north america s community collaborative rain hail and snow colorado climate centre 2022 network an isococorahs on a global scale as use and uptake of isotope data become more prominent in the hydrologic community justification to run such a network becomes easier 4 2 isotope enabled model calibration the hydrologic community has collectively recognized the process based information content embedded in tracer aided approaches as noted within the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 of paramount importance to the community is understanding climate change induced variability in space and time impacting hydrologic fluxes variability in extremes and process interactions at hydrologic interfaces isotope tracers can assist with these issues surrounding uncertainty particularly when dealing with parameterization and calibration of more complex process based models used to tackle these challenges holmes et al 2020 guse et al 2021 argue that additional data sources are required to address gaps in knowledge and accuracy in process based modelling and model evaluation isotopes can enhance hydrologic model calibration over long simulation periods by improving the hydrologic partitioning within models i e putting the water in the right place stadnyk holmes 2020 vystavna et al 2022 this often has little if any statistically significant impact on overall model performance during calibration assessed by flow performance metrics but can result in statistically meaningful improvements during validation stadnyk holmes 2020 wang et al 2019 this is an aspect of the concept of equifinality coined in the hydrologic context by keith beven beven 2006 that there are multiple statistically equal outcomes for a model resulting from different combinations of parameters through bayesian theory we can directly derive that adding additional data will reduce the parameter hence model uncertainty and assist with the equifinality problem if the intended application of the model is for long term assessment e g under future climates or for the prediction of extremes outside the observational record then incorporating isotope tracers into model calibration can have distinct and measurable advantages stadnyk holmes 2020 the trade off is that in adding something new to the model i e isotopes we may need to add additional parameters or processes to effectively simulate both water and isotope data in doing so we can inadvertently increase equifinality therefore isotopes do not necessarily increase parameter identifiability but they can reduce model uncertainty holmes et al 2020 this reduction in uncertainty is a direct result of more consistent flow path and storage simulation identified through the addition of isotope tracers that constrain the model calibration reducing the number of plausible solutions in the decision space relative to streamflow only calibration possibilities this is particularly true for process based models having significant parameter complexity and parameter process interaction where computational problems are ill posed and streamflow alone is inadequate to properly constrain the mathematical problem 4 3 continental and global scale prediction though climate change acts on a global scale it is experienced by local and community levels realized through flood drought forest fire species migration changing seasonality or ice on off periods etc climate change impact assessment therefore necessitates a global and continental approach labat et al 2004 particularly for watershed hydrology that transcends human political and geographical jurisdiction local impact or mitigation assessment is often the ultimate end goal however analysis domains must encompass the full extent of upstream contributing areas that can potentially influence or drive downstream change the next generation of models needs to reflect the full continuum of upstream to downstream impacts resulting from climate and anthropogenic changes for example climate driven changes to streamflow quantity can and will alter riverine temperature which in turn alters ecosystem viability through species habitat and survival reproduction rates and ultimately biological and social systems at the community level stadnyk et al 2021 van vliet et al 2011 large domain integrated model development is needed to support the next generation of social and environmental policy for sustainable climate change mitigation though system based analysis must be examined from a global perspective it must also include the resolution to ascertain local socio economic ecohydrological and community level impacts to offer an example changes in arctic sea ice formation decay and breakup due to high latitude warming in the arctic basin have distinct and measurable local impacts on species habitat barbedo et al 2020 affecting migratory patterns which impact traditional hunting and sustenance practice for northern and indigenous communities huntington et al 2017 as well as winter transportation and accessibility in the north porfiriev et al 2019 such wicked problems streefland krozer 2018 are far too big in scope to be tackled by any one model modeller or scientific team and require far broader networks of researchers communities institutions and policy makers to address to tackle these so called wicked problems is to develop the multi disciplinary tools and computational infrastructure necessary to analyse broad cumulative system impacts 4 4 integrated modelling systems in its recent sixth assessment report the intergovernmental panel for climate change recognized the interdependence of climate biodiversity and people and the need for integrated natural social and economic science based solutions to address climate risks eyring et al 2016 the next generation of models being developed by the hydrologic community will necessitate better research integration across disciplines hydrologic change underpins ecosystem and socio economic adaptation and therefore indirectly the model s supporting policy and operational decisions in turn regulatory and operational decisions must be re integrated back into hydrology models such that they remain representative of water supply under water managed regimes into the future some attempts at such modelling on regional scales have been undertaken e g barthel et al 2008 gober wheater 2014 hassanzadeh et al 2014 but the inherently global nature of climate change impacts and mitigation now demands we expand this scope to continental or global scales integrated approaches to modelling have typically been described under the nexus concept highlighting the transdisciplinary nature and scope of the water resources challenges we now face globally impacting ecology and environment animal and human health social structures and communities economics local and international policy security and sovereignty of nations and ultimately environmental and geopolitics ait kadi 2016 di baldassarre et al 2019 the united nations have recognized a water centric vision of the sustainable development goals sdgs vision 2030 essex et al 2020 with water underpinning all sdgs from human health and welfare to climate well being education security and even gender equality i e the idea that if women do not have seek water for family sustenance that they can more readily contribute to their education careers the economy and societal advancement isotope tracers represent only one type of data integration possible for environmental models and modelling frameworks they are a beginning step of what is achievable with the recent advances in computational power data collection and data integration from our previous example in simulating changing freshwater contributions to the arctic ocean isotopes can be useful tracers of freshwater volume but so too are temperature and dissolved oxygen that directly link to aquatic biology and ecological health and unlike isotope tracers temperature is a required input for marine system models as a driver of thermohaline circulation that in turn predict impacts on future climate farmer et al 2021 haskins et al 2020 timmermans marshall 2020 historically land surface or hydrologic models have not been interfaced with marine system models despite the fact that freshwater discharge to the arctic ocean can have a discernable impact on thermohaline circulation ridenour et al 2019 stadnyk et al 2021 transdisciplinary wicked problems require innovative solutions and with the current advances in high performance computing platforms the time is right for scientific community to unite their respective efforts in assessing global geospatial change this of course is the focus of the digital earth twin initiative designed to advance long term climate impact assessment and flood prediction capabilities globally bauer et al 2021 huang et al 2022 5 advancing operational prediction the future of operational prediction necessitates large domain model prediction at sufficiently fine time steps and large spatial domains to adequately inform operational decision making rokaya pietroniro 2022 though daily time steps provide a reasonable estimate of daily average streamflow they frequently under estimate peak flow due to the averaging of instantaneous flow values across a 24 hour period chen et al 2017 this can be problematic for flood frequency estimation particularly when used for infrastructure design e g sizing of dams culverts bridge piers and floodplain mapping many regulatory bodies e g engineers canada have specified that engineers must account for climate change but have offered little to no specific guidance on how to do this e g engineers canada 2016 some guidance exists in some jurisdictions but there remains a lack of ubiquitous and consistent technical specifications on dealing with non stationarity resulting from climate change csa group 2019 to support the prediction of maximum peak flow and flood frequency estimation under climate change hydrologic models driven by a range of climate scenarios are required though this is a well established practice model performance or fit for purpose is typically evaluated based on a model s capability to match simulated output to observed streamflow records in a historic period clark et al 2021 knoben et al 2019 requiring little information on how that is achieved or the internal process partitioning within the model kirchner 2006 klemeš 1986 it is well established within the climate modelling literature that bias correction is important for accurate long term projection shrestha et al 2017 in a similar way hydrologic models poorly representing process partitioning can also yield erroneous flow quantile predictions comparing flow only to tracer aided model simulations in the literature has demonstrated that this lack of process accuracy can underestimate extreme flow quantiles q100 holmes et al 2020 and it is more likely than not that such under estimations become even more severe under future climates such artefacts in the prediction of upper quantiles flows likely occur due to the high flow thresholds being under represented in observed historic records that are used for model calibration resulting in extrapolation error when estimating the processes and process partitioning controlling the extreme runoff response e g fig 4 under future climates models are explicitly required to simulate conditions outside the period of calibration i e historical record where extremes and durations of interannual wet dry cycles can be more intense and variable extreme flood events in recent years are increasingly complex and severe resulting from a combination of critical conditions being met such as extreme rainfall on high antecedent wetness and a lack of storage availability within the upstream basin it is now well established that evaluating model performance against both streamflow and isotope tracers results in improved flow path and storage simulation over the historical period of record a strong argument can therefore be made that under future climate extremes more accurate hydrologic partitioning and simulation of water storage is critical to the prediction of upper quantile extreme flows though there is no way to validate projected increases to extreme flow in the present day i e because these flows have yet to occur these changes should be considered in the so called factor of safety and design principles more specifically it needs to be acknowledged that the range of observed historic streamflow is likely too narrow to capture the full range of flow variability expected under future climates and that upper decile flows are likely inadequately represented in historic time series due to their low frequency of occurrence and the tendency for gauge washout under extreme flow conditions this is demonstrated on fig 4 that follows from holmes et al 2020 where the observed high flow of record occurred in 2017 post modelling study the more extreme higher quantile flows projected into future periods by the calibrated tracer aided model are not in fact outside the range of possible and reach magnitudes up to and exceeding the 2017 event whereas the flow only model significantly under estimates magnitudes corresponding to the 2017 event in the historic period and results in a lower upper quantile estimation under future climates it is important for the design community to ensure the models used for prediction are adequately calibrated to capture and reproduce extreme events more common place under future climates this is not to say that hydrologists and engineers need to or even should become isotope hydrologists or isotope experts isotope tracers are however proving to be a valuable tool that warrants more use and consideration within the practitioner community it is incumbent on researchers to find ways to make isotope enabled models and modelling tools more accessible to the community at large klemeš 1986 there are several ways to increase the uptake of isotope hydrology within the practitioner community including but not limited to increasing 1 data availability and accessibility 2 peer and community support 3 fair findable accessible interoperable reusable practices for tracer aided model development 4 tools for the hydrologic community that assimilate isotope data behind the scenes and 5 short courses education and outreach these points are discussed below in detail 5 1 data availability and accessibility improved data availability and accessibility including models and processing scripts is likely to increase the uptake and use of isotope tracers for hydrological assessment vystavna et al 2022 one disadvantage the isotope hydrology community has faced is a lack of data availability data consistency and or general accessibility as more global isotope networks emerge new and innovative applications evolve to assess global and continental scale hydrology vystavna et al 2021 one distinct advantage isotope tracers have are a global regulated by the iaea standard that affords intercomparison of sites allowing for translation of hydrologic information across continents and scales i e the delta notation increasing data availability however will require interjurisdictional coordination financial and logistical support for monitoring networks 5 2 peer support peer support and a common community of practice will facilitate the development publication and critical evaluation of studies employing operational large domain prediction systems evolving from regional monitoring networks such studies will not necessarily rely on a priori or in situ isotope sampling and cannot by nature of their domain be under pinned by extensive suites of high resolution isotope measurements this is a shift from the current literature which heavily focuses on hillslope or catchment scales extensively monitored through both time and space see fig 2 that should be viewed as disruptive science park et al 2023 this is not to suggest that rigorous peer review or scrutiny of large domain models and data are not required or that smaller scale studies should cease rather large domain studies should be encouraged by the community and their development and testing supported within the peer review system applied research aims to bridge the gap between academia and engineering practice and despite perhaps lacking high resolution data and complete process level understanding does not offer less value the significance of such work is often in learning what processes are currently not well represented within a large domain model adequately but that are perhaps important for such model outcomes 5 3 fair principles it is critical for modelling practitioners to be more transparent in their methods requiring model codes equations and benchmarking studies to be reproducible in order to manage operational liabilities stagge et al 2019 point out that only 0 6 to 6 8 of 1 989 articles reviewed in the peer reviewed literature might be reproducible with adequate details methods and scripts available to recreate the scientific findings for research to transcend academic only use consistent workflows that provide access to model and study independent codes and scripts i e toolboxes that aid in pre and post processing model input output are needed that means both codes and methodological application i e setup calibration testing and validation need to be well documented and ideally employ standardized community workflows knoben et al 2021 the gold standard as both knoben et al 2021 and rigon et al 2022 point out is to eliminate much of the common work of model setup and standardize the process across a multitude of model structures and domains that is they are non specific to a particular type of model lumped vs distributed or model forcing dem landcover data or data format future tracer aided model developments should endeavour to follow the fair findable accessible interoperable and reusable wilkinson et al 2016 principles to increase model and code accessibility for operational use and testing 5 4 open access scripts and codes following from the fair principles of model development the hydrologic and practitioner communities can be better supported through the development of open access scripts and workflows that aid in the tedious but necessary preparation of model inputs interpretation and analysis of model outputs hall et al 2022 knoben et al 2021 forbes 2016 recently reported that 60 of scientific research involved data cleansing which is a set of entirely repeatable steps that in fact does not need to be redone for each model or study particularly needed are model workflows or guidance from a known documented standard within the climate change or large scale hydrologic communities to ensure consistency and accuracy this is a critical gap underpinning public safety and the design of global infrastructure that can result in catastrophic failure under extreme events it is in such workflows or guidance documents that the utility of isotope tracers could be highlighted as an additional source of data that the community might consider when examining extreme events though it is unrealistic to assume all hydrologic practitioners will become isotope hydrology experts this does not mean isotope aided analyses need to be inaccessible to the community of practice the development of for example r programming language functions and packages that support real time watershed based geographical information system gis analyses of isotope water balance assessment could facilitate broader uptake isotope informed hydrologic assessment this in turn aids in the justification of long term isotope monitoring networks potentially opening up additional funding and interjurisdictional support in canada development of the isohydrology package is underway as part of the hydrology package supported by the canadian society for hydrological sciences cshs which is an operational package designed to support canadian hydrologists anderson et al 2019 the canadian isotope monitoring network dataset will be made accessible through a series of r functions along with codes that support isotope enabled water balance calculations users will be able to compute water yield runoff evaporation to inflow ratios evapotranspiration partitioning transpiration relative to evapotranspiration and residence times for basins of interest having both hydrometric and isotope time series this can have operational significance both on a local watershed scale but also through cross comparison of regional or canada wide results that classify dominant water loss mechanisms through isotope enabled water balance gibson et al 2021 the long term vision is to take this package and its functionality global similar to the global water isotopes database widb developed for isotopes in precipitation and water sources putman bowen 2019 but with enhanced computational functionality 5 5 education training some of the issues raised by klemeš 1986 decades ago still persist with barriers in education and training and the lack of a professional internationally recognized designation for hydrologists in the united states the american institute for hydrologists does in fact have a professional hydrologist p hydro designation but there have been issues with membership uptake and recognition outside american jurisdictions internationally most hydrologists are registered engineers or geoscientists however this often means very diverse backgrounds and training that remove or dilute the focus specifically on water based curricula in canada a p hydro designation was explored by the canadian society for hydrological sciences cshs however was not pursued due to a lack of perceived membership and the complexity of regulating across provincial jurisdiction there is a need for an international p hydro designation that affords hydrologists the opportunity to develop a strong international community of practice and where formal education and training standards can be determined with a set of minimum training criteria for the profession such criteria could then be used by local or regional regulatory bodies to affirm the credentials of individuals certified to practice this additionally offers the opportunity to coalesce training in specialized topical areas such as isotope hydrology offering a means of bridging the science to practice gap on complex or emerging topics in hydrology this is particularly crucial to support the highly trans disciplinary nature of the field of practice in the face of increasing hydrologic complexity for realistic uptake and deployment of isotope hydrology among practitioners education and training needs to be accessible among the non academic community of particular interest to practitioners are certificate type short courses several days to one week in duration that offer eligibility for continuing professional development and that can be counted towards professional accreditation several such courses exist globally however are often dominated by either academics students or professionals but not both course may also be inaccessible to professionals because of cost timing conflicting with operational duties and or time requirements ideally training courses would blend practitioner and academic requirements be flexible in their timing and reinforce networking and meaningful training interactions for all indirectly the mix of academics and professionals supports hands on technology transfer via students academics to professionals a good example is the university of saskatchewan s canada environmental science 898 course isotope tracers in catchment hydrology global institute for water security 2022 offered by jeffrey mcdonnell that offers both in person and virtual synchronized classrooms to foster an environment of interaction among students and professionals offering both university credit and a professional certificate in the years since its inception it has become a go to training course on isotope tracers for hydrometric professionals collecting these samples across canada and the united states 6 summary the isotope hydrology community of practice must commit to supporting the use of isotopes for integrated modelling and operational prediction by improving the establishment of monitoring networks and accessibility of observed data and through peer review processes that recognize and support the value in large domain studies and isotope assessments just as data intense monitoring sites and catchment scale studies influenced knowledge of process based interactions large domain studies can influence our knowledge of system storage and river routing networks these larger conveyance systems in hydrology are of paramount importance for river forecasting flood quantile estimation and the design of infrastructure there is growing support for integrating isotope tracers into large domain hydrological models to support operational prediction by ensuring accurate process partitioning and model evaluation historically it has been a lack of large scale regional continental and global isotope monitoring networks with adequate data resolution and limited data accessibility that has hindered developments within the community a renewed commitment to international cooperation and the deployment of isotope monitoring networks concomitant with hydrometric monitoring programs and the promise of future citizen led networks offers new opportunities for large scale modelling what is needed now is inter governmental interjurisdictional support for isotope data and dedicated funding to support isotope analyses here too citizen science and the incorporation of research specific networks into data repositories has a role and should be promoted within the community simultaneously with the development of large scale data networks advances in computational efficiency and equity have led to the creation of higher resolution models capable of hourly event based simulation across continental domains that integrate isotopes and other environmental tracers integrating isotope tracers into large domain models directly supports model calibration by reducing simulation uncertainty by improving parameter and process visibility within model evaluation metrics and the calibration process these advances support model evaluation and prediction across large domains and long time periods where there are sparse or discontinuous observations financial or accessibility barriers to expanding hydrometric measurement or the need to evaluate integrated and cumulative system impacts water isotopes have been implemented and deployed in hillslope and catchment scale studies for decades because of their ability to see the underlying process based hydrological controls and changes driving runoff generation this offers an opportunity for practitioners to improve simulation of extreme events improved estimation of soil antecedent wetness or evaporative loss can significantly alter future projections of extreme flow quantiles which has a direct implication for public safety this is increasingly more relevant as the extreme events needed for design are no longer represented in historic records or hydrologic conditions meaning our models are increasingly pushed beyond their training conditions increasing the accessibility of isotope enable prediction tools and data are best achieved by adopting the fair scientific principles such that new codes and scripts are archived and findable and accessible and that they are interoperable and can be used interchangeably among different studies standardized workflows for tracer aided modelling can be used as guidelines for new practitioners and can upload the community to a set standard of practice for model evaluation to increase confidence in our products following this a concerted effort to invest in education outreach and training is needed by the community to increase the uptake of isotope hydrology and the general knowledge of their benefits for hydrologic prediction large scale hydrologic and isotope modelling when coupled with computational advances offers a glimpse into the power and utility of integrated modelling techniques which can be further expanded to examine ecohydrologic and socio economic feedbacks on the natural system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
