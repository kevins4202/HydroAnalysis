microbial biomass carbon mbc and nitrogen mbn dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don crop yield and water use efficiency under winter wheat tricicum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l double cropping system conditions using the following three cultural practices i traditional plough with no mulching ck ii traditional plough with plastic film mulching pm and iii traditional plough with straw mulching sm soil water contents were measured by the gravimetric method soc was determined using the dichromate oxidation method tn was analyzed by the kjeldahl method mbc and mbn were determined using the chloroform fumigation extraction method doc and tdn were determined following jones procedures proposed by jones and willett 2006 the results showed that soil water was higher under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment and mainly changed in the upper 60 cm soil layer compared with the ck treatment the concentrations of soc and tn under the sm treatment were increased by 16 9 and 7 7 at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively and the pm treatment had the similar soc and tn concentrations compared with the ck treatment soil c n ratio was increased under the sm treatment by 6 2 p 0 05 and that under the pm treatment was decreased by 5 2 p 0 05 after three years the concentrations of mbc under the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 42 0 and 24 1 respectively and mbn under the pm treatment was significantly increased by 5 6 at 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season compared with the ck treatment doc was significantly increased by 21 0 under the sm treatment and decreased by 13 1 under the pm treatment and don was significantly increased by 10 5 under the sm treatment and decreased by 4 3 under the pm treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season relative changes of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were more sensitive than that of soc and tn the relative decline or increase of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions was on average almost 13 6 for the mulching practices compared with the ck treatment the average maize yields under the pm and sm treatments were increased by 26 4 and 9 8 and the average wheat yields under the pm and sm treatments were increased by 21 3 and 7 4 respectively the average water use efficiencies under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively our results suggested that plastic film mulching could be used as an effective practice to improve low soil quality with adequate nitrogen and increase crop yield and water use efficiency in the loess plateau china keywords straw mulching plastic film mulching soil organic carbon labile soil organic carbon labile soil organic nitrogen water use efficiency 1 introduction different cultural practices may have different effects on the soil water and soil quality and these effects may vary with soil type and climatic conditions lal 2004 huo et al 2017 in the loess plateau of northwest china maize and wheat are both one of the most common grain crops li et al 2004 bu et al 2013 however soil degradation inefficient water use poor soil quality and low temperature stresses are the major constraints on crop production in this region fan and zhang 2000 bai et al 2009 liu et al 2009 liang et al 2010 gao et al 2016 2018 therefore a number of techniques including straw mulching plastic film mulching and rainwater harvesting have been widely used in this region to improve soil quality and crop growth environments thereby increasing crop yields li et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2010 bu et al 2013 li et al 2013a b in recent years the practice of returning crop straw to the field has been widespread in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in northwest china this is mainly due to the increased use of machinery that leaves the crop straw on the land in response to a ban on straw burning made by the chinese government a lot of crop straw is burned directly and this has caused serious environmental pollution in the last decade xiao 2012 straw mulching is one practice for effective disposal that can decrease air pollution and provide soil organic matter soon and lupwayi 2012 meanwhile straw mulching can reduce evaporation loss from the soil surface protect the surface from direct strike of raindrops enhance soil aggregation and promote biological activity salinas garcia et al 2001 blanco canqui and lal 2007 chen et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 sharma et al 2011 straw mulching can keep the soil warmer in winter and cooler in summer as well as reduce soil temperature oscillation chen et al 2007 however some researches present that low soil temperature caused by straw mulching froze wheat seedlings and roots during the winter thereby negatively influenced germination and tillering gao et al 2009 therefore straw mulching has not always been shown to increase but decrease yields bonfil et al 1999 wang et al 2002 taa et al 2004 currently plastic film mulching is widely used to increase soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation in vegetable and crop production in northwest china it is becoming a well evolved technique for agriculture in arid semiarid and sub humid areas especially where irrigation is not available and spring temperature is low dong et al 2009 plastic film mulching can increase topsoil temperature and prolong the reproductive growth period which in turn enhances grain yield wang et al 2009 li et al 2013a b however the increases in both soil water and temperature can change the soil biological characteristics and may negatively impact on soil quality and sustainability li et al 2004 it is known that the release of soil nutrients through decomposition of soil organic matter by microbes plays an important role in soil quality li et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to critically examine the effects of straw mulching and plastic film mulching on soil organic matter to assess the changes in soil quality soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn play a crucial role in the soil quality and fertility bauer and black 1994 monaco et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 because it significantly affects soil physical chemical and biological properties which can affect crop productivity and agro ecosystems sainju et al 2008 maintenance of satisfactory level of soc and tn are necessary for crop productivity and sustainable agro ecosystems however it is difficult to detect the changes of soc and tn in response to management practices in the short term haynes 2005 gong et al 2009 in contrast labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions i e mbc doc mbn and don that turn over quickly can respond more rapidly to soil management than soc and tn haynes 2005 schimel et al 2007 plaza bonilla et al 2014 therefore soc tn mbc mbn doc and don can be used to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on soil quality bremer et al 1994 gregorich et al 1994 dong et al 2009 plaza bonilla et al 2014 mulching practices may affect soil organic matter through decomposition and soil moisture preservation youkhana and idol 2009 however little is yet known about the effects of different mulching practices on soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions and crop yields in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in this study we assumed that soil water soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions as well as crop yields would be affected by different mulching practices in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system therefore the overall objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effects of straw mulching and plastic film mulching practices on crop productivity in the loess plateau of northwest china 2 quantify soc tn and labile soil organic c and n contents after 3 year field experiment to assess different mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments using a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system were conducted from june 2013 to june 2016 at the irrigation experimental station of the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering sponsored by the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 04 e 506 m asl in yangling shaanxi china the experimental site is located in the southern region of the loess plateau and belongs to a typical dry semi humid area in northwest china the average annual precipitation is 638 mm with nearly 60 falling between july and october the average annual sunshine hour is 2196 h and the average annual air temperature is 13 c the precipitation distribution and daily mean air temperature were recorded throughout the year over the whole period of experiments fig 1 the experimental soil was a silt clay loam with a mean bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 and contained 11 17 g kg 1 total carbon and 0 95 g kg 1 total nitrogen in the 0 100 cm soil layer the groundwater level was approximately 50 m 2 2 experimental design the experimental field was cultivated with a winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system for 20 years prior to the establishment of this experiment this experiment had three treatments i traditional plough with no mulching ck ii traditional plough with plastic film mulching pm and iii traditional plough with straw mulching sm the ck treatment comprised a flat non mulched plot winter wheat straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at the rates of 4 0 t ha 1 in the summer maize plot and summer maize straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at the rates of 4 0 t ha 1 in the winter wheat plot after the seeds were sown in the sm treatment plastic film 0 005 mm thick 1 7 m wide was mulched in the winter wheat and summer maize plots by hand after the seeds were sown in the pm treatment the three treatments were arranged into a randomized complete block design with three replications each plot was 5 m long and 4 m wide the chemical fertilizers consisted of 120 kg n ha 1 as co nh2 2 and 54 kg p ha 1 as ca h2po4 2 for maize and wheat respectively and were applied to the upper soil layer 0 20 cm by rotary tillage for three treatments in order to facilitate tillage the roots for each plot were removed when the crop was harvested maize seeds cv qinlong 11 were sown at a density of 50 000 plants ha 1 on june 9 2013 june 20 2014 and june 15 2015 after a rotary tillage and the crops were harvested on september 28 2013 october 12 2014 and october 7 2015 three treatments involved alternating wide and narrow row spacing of 60 cm and 30 cm the plots were irrigated with 80 mm water in 2013 due to low precipitation and not irrigated in 2014 and 2015 wheat seeds cv xiaoyan 22 were sown at a density of 150 kg ha 1 on october 16 2013 october 18 2014 and october 19 2015 using a rotary tillage and the crops were harvested on june 8 2014 june 6 2015 and june 5 2016 winter wheat was planted with 25 cm wide row space the plots were irrigated with 60 mm water during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons due to drought stress and not irrigated during the 2015 2016 growing season 2 3 soil sampling 2 3 1 soil water during each summer maize or winter wheat growing season soil water content was measured gravimetrically at 20 cm intervals within the 0 100 cm profile in each plot at seeding stage jointing stage filling stage maturity stage and harvest time the soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layer in each plot was then calculated as the average soil water content in the three experimental seasons actual crop evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the soil water balance equation 1 e t a i p e r q δ w where i is the irrigation depth mm pe is effective rainfall mm r is runoff loss from ground surface mm q is vertical soil water exchange at the depth of 100 cm positive downward negative upward mm and δw is the difference in soil water storage in the 100 cm soil layer between the two soil water measurements at begin and end seasons mm in this experiment the groundwater table remains at the depth of about 50 m below the surface and irrigation and rainfall amounts were low so the upward flow and downward flow into the root were negligible surface runoff is omitted due to the deep groundwater table and the experimental field being relatively flat 2 3 2 soil sample collection and analysis soil samples were collected at 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layer after the maize harvest in october 7 2015 and the wheat harvest in june 6 2013 and june 5 2016 in each plot five soil cores each 2 5 cm diameter were excavated randomly and mixed to form a composite sample all fresh samples were divided into two parts one part was air dried and sieved through a 0 25 mm screen to determine soc and tn the other part from 2015 and 2016 growing seasons was immediately transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until the samples were measured for mbc mbn doc and don soc was determined by the dichromate oxidation method mebius 1960 tn was analyzed using the kjeldahl method liu et al 1996 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were determined colorimetrically by the salicylate nitroprusside method on a flow injection autoanalyzer fia lachat instruments usa samples of 5 g fresh homogenized soil without roots were soaked with 50 ml kcl of 2 mol l 1 and shook for 1 h and then analyzed with the fia lachat instruments usa to determine the concentrations of extractable no3 n and nh4 n mbc and mbn were determined by the chloroform fumigation extraction method wu et al 1996 briefly fresh soil samples equivalent to 20 g air dried soil were fumigated at 25 c for 24 h after removing the chcl3 c and n were extracted from the fumigated and non fumigated samples with 0 5 mol l 1 k2so4 soil solution ratio of 1 4 w v for 1 h the filtered extracts were analyzed using a multi 3100 n c toc analyzer analytik jena germany a k ec value of 0 45 and a k en value of 0 54 were used to calculate the c and n content of the microbial biomass concentrations of doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were determined following jones procedures jones and willett 2006 specifically the field moist soil samples equivalent to 10 g oven dried weight were extracted with 50 ml k2so4 of 0 5 mol l 1 soil to solution ratio of 1 5 w v in the polypropylene bottles by shaking for 30 min at a speed of 200 rpm the supernatant was then filtered through 0 45 μm filters into separate vials for doc and tdn analysis by using a shimadzu toc tn analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan don was calculated as the difference between the tdn concentration and the combined nh4 n and no3 n concentration 2 4 yield measurements summer maize yield was determined by hand harvesting the two adjacent center rows 60 cm wide and 500 cm long in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 8 10 days and weighed after threshing the grain yield of summer maize was calculated when the water content in sun dried grain was about 12 measured by oven drying method winter wheat yield was determined by hand harvesting four rows of wheat 100 cm wide and 100 cm long in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 6 8 days and weighed after threshing the grain yield of winter wheat was calculated considering 12 water content in the sun dried grain water use efficiency wue can be expressed as 2 w u e y e t a where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and eta is the corresponding actual crop evapotranspiration mm 2 5 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using the anova procedure and statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using least significant difference lsd method in all analyses p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 soil water the dynamics of soil water content in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm layers of all experimental plots in 2013 2015 summer maize growing seasons are shown in fig 2 soil water under the pm treatment was higher than that under the sm treatment and mainly changed at the 0 60 cm soil depth in 2013 the soil water content for three treatments declined until 93 days after the sowing of summer maize dasm and increased from 93 to 112 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to about 55 mm of accumulation precipitation amount between 102 and 107 dasm and basically declined during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of lm pm and ck before 60 dasm and increased with the order of pm ck and lm after 60 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth and declined with the order of ck lm and pm during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth fig 2a and b in 2014 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 85 dasm and declined from 85 to 115 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation amount before 88 dasm and low precipitation amount after 90 dasm and increased during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of pm ck and lm at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths during the total summer maize growing season fig 2c and d in 2015 the soil water content for three treatments increased at the 0 60 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of pm ck and lm at the 0 60 cm soil depth and basically declined with the order of ck lm and pm at the 60 100 cm soil depth during the total summer maize growing season fig 2e and f the dynamics of soil water content in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm layers of all experimental plots in 2013 2016 winter wheat growing seasons are shown in fig 3 in 2013 2014 the soil water content for three treatments basically increased until 194 days after the sowing of winter wheat dasw and declined from 194 to 236 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to three large precipitation events between 170 and 194 dasw and the similar seasonal trend appeared at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of lm pm and ck before 194 dasw and increased with the order of lm ck and pm after 194 dasw at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths fig 3a and b in 2014 2015 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 161 dasw and declined from 161 to 232 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation amount between 160 and 190 dasw and decreased during the total growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of ck pm and lm at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths during the total winter wheat growing season fig 3c and d in 2015 2016 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 75 dasw declined from 75 to 210 dasw and increased after 210 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation before 75 dasw and low precipitation after 75 dasw and the similar seasonal trend appeared at the 60 100 cm soil depth except for the soil water content after 210 dasw the soil water content declined before 100 dasw with the order of pm ck and lm and after 100 dasw with the order of ck pm and lm at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 3e the soil water content was basically higher in the ck treatment than in the pm and lm treatments at the 60 100 cm soil depth during the total summer maize growing season fig 3f 3 2 soil organic carbon and total nitrogen soc at the 0 10 cm soil depth was affected by mulching cultivation with three years table 1 soc was higher at the 0 10 cm soil depth than at the 10 20 cm soil depth compared with the ck treatment soc under the sm treatment was increased by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth whereas the pm treatment had the similar soc level at the 10 20 cm soil depth there was no difference in soc between the pm and ck treatments after three years of winter wheat summer maize rotation which was consistent with tian et al 2013 after mulching cultivation with three years tn was increased by 7 7 at the 0 10 cm soil depth under the sm treatment and increased by 9 0 at the 10 20 cm soil depth under the pm treatment respectively compared with the ck treatment table 1 from 2013 to 2016 tn at the 0 10 cm soil depth was increased by 11 1 under the ck treatment by 5 7 under the pm treatment and by 15 2 under the sm treatment however the difference of tn at the 10 20 cm soil depth was not significant table 1 compared with the ck treatment soil c n ratio was increased by 6 22 p 0 05 under the sm treatment but decreased by 5 17 p 0 05 under the pm treatment after three years 3 3 labile soc fractions under different mulching cultivations 3 3 1 soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen mbc and mbn concentrations were significantly affected by different mulching practices at the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil depths respectively whether in summer maize season or in winter wheat season fig 4 compared with the ck treatment mbc concentrations under the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 42 0 and 24 1 respectively mbn concentration under the pm treatment was significantly increased by 5 6 and the difference of mbn between the sm treatment and the ck treatment was not significant at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season fig 4a and b however mbc and mbn concentrations followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth mbc and mbn concentrations under the three treatments after the wheat season followed the same changing trend as that after the maize season fig 4c and d mbc after the wheat season was significantly increased by 23 8 4 8 and 18 2 than after maize season for the ck pm and sm treatments at 0 10 cm soil depth respectively meanwhile mbn concentration was higher for three treatments after the wheat season than that after the maize season 3 3 2 soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen doc and don concentrations under the sm treatment were significantly higher than that under the other treatments at the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil depths fig 5 compared with the ck treatment doc was significantly increased by 21 0 under the sm treatment and decreased by 13 1 under the pm treatment whereas don was significantly increased by 10 5 under the sm treatment and decreased by 4 3 under the pm treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season fig 5a and b in addition doc and don followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth doc and don concentrations under the three treatments after the winter wheat season followed the same changing trend as that after the summer maize season fig 5c and d doc concentrations under the ck pm and sm treatments after the winter wheat season were 3 1 3 2 2 8 times higher respectively than that after the summer maize season meanwhile don concentration was higher for three treatments after the winter wheat season than that after the summer maize season 3 4 relative sensitivity of carbon and nitrogen fractions changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were differed between the pm and sm treatments and the ck treatment after the summer maize fig 6 a and b and winter wheat seasons fig 6c and d in general relative changes of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were more sensitive than that of soc and tn compared with a small decline or increase of soc and tn the relative decline or increase of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions was on average almost 13 6 for the mulching treatments in particular the average relative increases of the mbc fractions from the pm treatment and the sm treatment were almost 33 1 after the maize season 19 5 after the wheat season at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively in addition the relative changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth 3 5 grain yields and water use efficiency the grain yields of summer maize and winter wheat were significantly affected by the different mulching treatments over the three years table 2 the summer maize yield was highest in 2013 and the lowest in 2014 the three year mean maize yields for each of the treatments were ranked as follows pm sm ck compared with the ck treatment the mean maize yields with the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 26 4 and 9 8 respectively similarly the three year mean wheat grain yield with the pm treatment was highest and lowest with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the mean wheat yields with the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 21 3 and 7 4 respectively the wue represents the relationship between water consumption and the grain yield compared with the ck treatment the pm and sm treatments significantly increased wue in three summer maize winter wheat growing seasons except for the 2013 and 2014 summer maize growing seasons table 1 the average wue under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively in addition the pm treatment obtained a higher grain yield using less water 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching practices on soil water with a lack of timely precipitation under arid or semi arid conditions surface mulching practices e g straw mulching and plastic film mulching can reduce unproductive water losses from the soil surface and improve soil water and thermal status which play an important role in crop management and growth kouwenhoven et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 straw mulching can increase water infiltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water in the soil profile li et al 2013a b compared with the ck treatment the sm treatment consistently increased soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer during the summer maize growing season of 2013 and winter wheat growing season of 2013 2014 figs 2a and 3a this was because that the rate of water vapor flux through mulched straw was generally slow compared with the rate of water loss from a moist soil surface li et al 2013a b however a lower soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed for the sm treatment during the summer maize growing season of 2014 and 2015 fig 2c and e and the winter wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3c and e this was mainly because the mulched straw promoted summer maize and winter wheat development and thus the greater consumption of soil water led to low soil water content zhang et al 2011 and the effectiveness of straw mulching in reducing evaporation weakened with natural decomposition in addition there was low rainfall and increased plant growth led to high transpiration rates further accounting for the reduced soil water content during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 currently plastic film mulching has been widely used in china for increasing yield zhang and yang 2001 and water use efficiency ma 1999 in the loess plateau with serious water deficit for agricultural production plastic film mulching has been utilized in cultivating corn spring and winter wheat zhang et al 2013 wu et al 2015 compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment resulted in an increase in soil water at the 0 60 cm soil depth during the summer maize growing seasons before 60 dasm in 2013 and of 2014 2015 fig 2a c and e and the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 fig 3a this was mainly because that high precipitation appeared in the above mentioned growing seasons and mulched plastic film blocked the water vapor movement pathway from the soil surface to the air and greatly reduced evaporation which could help to solve the low temperature phenomenon induced by straw mulching however a lower soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed for the pm treatment during the summer maize growing season after 60 dasm in 2013 fig 2a and the winter wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3c and e this was mainly because that the pm treatment increased crop growth and higher crop transpiration rates during the crop growing seasons led to low soil water content li et al 2013a b and reduced soil water by intercepting rainwater and preventing rainwater from penetrating the soil when frequent but small rainfall appeared during the crop growing seasons döring et al 2005 in addition soil water content at the 0 60 cm soil depth was higher in pm than in sm during the summer maize growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 fig 2c and e and the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3a c and e this was similar to the results found by li et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2013 in the same region the increase in soil water could be attributed to better water retention as pm could reduced more soil evaporation and thus conserve more soil water than sm did except for the summer maize growing season of 2013 which had the lower rainfall than the other summer maize growing seasons 4 2 effect of mulching practices on soil organic matter fractions plastic film mulching could lead to a decrease in the soc and decline in soil quality through increased soc mineralization and microbial activity li et al 2004 zhou et al 2012 indicating that plastic film mulching may not be a long term solution in managing the soil in contrast some other studies reported that plastic film mulching practice contributed to the positive balances of soc due to the increase in root biomass and root deposition of crops returned back to the soil fan et al 2012 gao et al 2014 in our study compared with the ck treatment mulching practices leaded to a similar pm or increase sm soc concentration at the 0 20 cm soil depths after three years of winter wheat summer maize rotation table 1 compared with the initial soc concentration the soc concentration under the pm treatment had a comparatively more decrease tendency at the 0 10 cm soil depth which was inconsistent with fan et al 2012 this was probably because the roots for each plot were removed when the crop was harvested in order to facilitate tillage which decreased the carbon input as crop roots biomass compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment was not conductive to the accumulation of the soc concentration despite the insignificant decrease tendency whereas the sm treatment increased the soc concentration relative increase by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the 3 year of winter maize summer wheat rotation tn was an important indicator of soil health in our study little changes in tn were found from 2013 to 2016 in three treatments table 1 soil ran short of nitrogen when tn content was less than 2 g kg 1 zhou et al 2012 in our study tn in three treatments ranged from 0 89 to 1 33 g kg 1 which indicated that the soil at the experiment site was very poor in tn a positive feedback loop between soc and c n was observed when the c n ratio ranged from 5 6 to 11 3 in a similar agro ecosystem characterized by mulching practices in a typical loess soil zhou et al 2012 the low ration of soc to tn under the pm treatment table 1 could mean an acceleration of soil organic matter decomposition jia et al 2006 a high input of organic matter could increase labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions graham et al 2002 however the increase in production of high yield and in soil water and topsoil temperature would result in consistent year on year decreases in the soc concentration mbc and mbn were recognized as important indicators of soil quality that respond rapidly to soil management practices chen et al 2009 although they only had a small proportion of soc and tn mclauchlan and hobbie 2004 powlson et al 1987 the mbc only took about 1 5 of soc and the mbn only accounted for 2 6 of tn but they had an important influence on the rate of nutrient cycling in agricultural ecosystems brookes et al 1985 powlson et al 1987 mbn was regarded as the most labile soil organic nitrogen fraction because of the rapid generation rate of soil microbial biomass and represented both a source and sink of mineral nitrogen luo et al 2015 in our study the significantly higher mbc and mbn concentrations in the mulching practices pm and sm versus the ck treatment in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers were observed fig 4 it supported the previous observation that mulching practices increased mbc and mbn in the topsoil compared with the ck treatment and the higher topsoil moisture and temperature conditions played an important role in the changes of mbc and mbn in the semiarid area li et al 2004 liu et al 2013 meanwhile it indicated that mulching practices would improve soil biochemical properties and increase soil microbial activity zhou et al 2012 as reported by smith et al 1992 and li et al 2004 mbc was significantly improved because of the increased topsoil temperature from plastic film mulching and had a high positive correlation with soil moisture in our study mbc and mbn were higher under the pm treatment than that under the ck treatment which was largely due to the increase of soil water availability and temperature during the crop growing seasons as reported by our team previously chen et al 2017 doc represented the main source of energy rich carbon substrate for microorganisms and microbial metabolites constituted an important proportion of doc montano et al 2007 kamble et al 2014 don represented a labile nitrogen source for soil microorganisms jones and kielland 2002 in contrast to mbc and mbn the pm treatment showed a lower doc and don concentration after both summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons compared with the ck treatment this probably reflected a lower microbial use and microbial production of doc and don the increases in soil water and temperature due to plastic film mulching could change the biological characteristics song et al 2002 which could stimulate microbial activity and increases doc and don consumption neff and asner 2001 thereby decreasing the doc concentration fig 5a and c this indicated that the pm treatment can be an effective practice in soils with adequate n low soil water and temperature the sm treatment showed a higher doc and don concentration after both summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons compared with the ck treatment this was mainly because that crop straw decomposition could release a substantial amount of doc increased labile organic c and n and alleviated nutrient limitation of the microbes chan et al 2002 chen et al 2009 li et al 2016 xie et al 2017 this indicated that the sm treatment can be applied in soils with low quality in addition soil microorganisms consumed soc for energy loveland and webb 2003 therefore soc was much important for maintaining the pool of soil nutrients and improving nutrient availability zhao et al 2009 in our study mbc mbn doc and don were higher under the sm treatment than under the ck treatment in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layer fig 6 this was mainly because that straw mulching increased soc concentration thereby stimulating microorganisms and producing more mbc mbn doc and don which was consistent with li et al 2016 4 3 effect of mulching practices on grain yields the effects of mulching practices on crop yields depend on the climate condition crop type and soil texture pituello et al 2016 in our study compared with the ck treatment the mean maize and wheat grain yields under the sm treatment were increased by 9 8 and 7 4 respectively and the mean maize and wheat yields under the pm treatment were increased by 26 4 and 21 3 respectively table 2 this was because that the sm and pm treatments reduced soil evaporation increased the proportion of plant transpiration and provided the higher soil mbc and mbn than the ck treatment did correlation analysis revealed that maize and wheat grain yields were significantly correlated with soil mbc mbn doc and don concentrations under the sm treatment p 0 05 and with soil mbc and mbn under the pm treatment p 0 05 these results suggested that adequate available c and n should be supplied to achieve high crop yields in soils n was the most yield limiting and difficult to manage nutrient in crop systems and n dynamics became more complex in the presence of straw mulching and plastic film mulching eagle et al 2000 xie et al 2017 the performance in grain production of both summer maize and winter wheat was better under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment this suggested that the pm treatment was more efficient than the sm treatment in alleviating c and n and hydrothermal limitations to maize and wheat growth which was consistent with luo et al 2015 and chen et al 2017 5 conclusion our study showed that soil water was higher under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment and mainly changed in the upper 60 cm soil layer soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were significantly affected in topsoil by the pm and sm treatments compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment decreased doc and don concentrations but significantly increased mbc and mbn concentrations and the sm treatment significantly increased soc tn mbc doc and don concentrations in addition the average grain yields under the pm and sm treatments were 26 4 9 8 in summer maize and 21 3 7 4 in winter wheat higher than that under the ck treatment respectively the average wue under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively thus it can be concluded that the sm treatment can be an effective practice for improving soc tn mbc doc and don concentrations in the short term but the pm treatment which can improve soil mbc and mbn concentrations is recommended with the objective of the highest crop yield and water use efficiency in the loess plateau china acknowledgements this study was supported by the

determined using the chloroform fumigation extraction method doc and tdn were determined following jones procedures proposed by jones and willett 2006 the results showed that soil water was higher under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment and mainly changed in the upper 60 cm soil layer compared with the ck treatment the concentrations of soc and tn under the sm treatment were increased by 16 9 and 7 7 at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively and the pm treatment had the similar soc and tn concentrations compared with the ck treatment soil c n ratio was increased under the sm treatment by 6 2 p 0 05 and that under the pm treatment was decreased by 5 2 p 0 05 after three years the concentrations of mbc under the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 42 0 and 24 1 respectively and mbn under the pm treatment was significantly increased by 5 6 at 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season compared with the ck treatment doc was significantly increased by 21 0 under the sm treatment and decreased by 13 1 under the pm treatment and don was significantly increased by 10 5 under the sm treatment and decreased by 4 3 under the pm treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season relative changes of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were more sensitive than that of soc and tn the relative decline or increase of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions was on average almost 13 6 for the mulching practices compared with the ck treatment the average maize yields under the pm and sm treatments were increased by 26 4 and 9 8 and the average wheat yields under the pm and sm treatments were increased by 21 3 and 7 4 respectively the average water use efficiencies under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively our results suggested that plastic film mulching could be used as an effective practice to improve low soil

and climatic conditions lal 2004 huo et al 2017 in the loess plateau of northwest china maize and wheat are both one of the most common grain crops li et al 2004 bu et al 2013 however soil degradation inefficient water use poor soil quality and low temperature stresses are the major constraints on crop production in this region fan and zhang 2000 bai et al 2009 liu et al 2009 liang et al 2010 gao et al 2016 2018 therefore a number of techniques including straw mulching plastic film mulching and rainwater harvesting have been widely used in this region to improve soil quality and crop growth environments thereby increasing crop yields li et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2010 bu et al 2013 li et al 2013a b in recent years the practice of returning crop straw to the field has been widespread in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in northwest china this is mainly due to the increased use of machinery that leaves the crop straw on the land in response to a ban on straw burning made by the chinese government a lot of crop straw is burned directly and this has caused serious environmental pollution in the last decade xiao 2012 straw mulching is one practice for effective disposal that can decrease air pollution and provide soil organic matter soon and lupwayi 2012 meanwhile straw mulching can reduce evaporation loss from the soil surface protect the surface from direct strike of raindrops enhance soil aggregation and promote biological activity salinas garcia et al 2001 blanco canqui and lal 2007 chen et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 sharma et al 2011 straw mulching can keep the soil warmer in winter and cooler in summer as well as reduce soil temperature oscillation chen et al 2007 however some researches present that low soil temperature caused by straw mulching froze wheat seedlings and roots during the winter thereby negatively influenced germination and tillering gao et al 2009 therefore straw mulching has not always been shown to increase but decrease yields bonfil et al 1999 wang et al 2002 taa et al 2004 currently plastic film mulching is widely used to increase soil temperature and reduce soil evaporation in vegetable and crop production in northwest china it is becoming a well evolved technique for agriculture in arid semiarid and sub humid areas especially where irrigation is not available and spring temperature is low dong et al 2009 plastic film mulching can increase topsoil temperature and prolong the reproductive growth period which in turn enhances grain yield wang et al 2009 li et al 2013a b however the increases in both soil water and temperature can change the soil biological characteristics and may negatively impact on soil quality and sustainability li et al 2004 it is known that the release of soil nutrients through decomposition of soil organic matter by microbes plays an important role in soil quality li et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to critically examine the effects of straw mulching and plastic film mulching on soil organic matter to assess the changes in soil quality soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn play a crucial role in the soil quality and fertility bauer and black 1994 monaco et al 2008 zhao et al 2015 because it significantly affects soil physical chemical and biological properties which can affect crop productivity and agro ecosystems sainju et al 2008 maintenance of satisfactory level of soc and tn are necessary for crop productivity and sustainable agro ecosystems however it is difficult to detect the changes of soc and tn in response to management practices in the short term haynes 2005 gong et al 2009 in contrast labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions i e mbc doc mbn and don that turn over quickly can respond more rapidly to soil management than soc and tn haynes 2005 schimel et al 2007 plaza bonilla et al 2014 therefore soc tn mbc mbn doc and don can be used to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on soil quality bremer et al 1994 gregorich et al 1994 dong et al 2009 plaza bonilla et al 2014 mulching practices may affect soil organic matter through decomposition and soil moisture preservation youkhana and idol 2009 however little is yet known about the effects of different mulching practices on soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions and crop yields in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system in this study we assumed that soil water soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions as well as crop yields would be affected by different mulching practices in winter wheat summer maize double cropping system therefore the overall objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effects of straw mulching and plastic film mulching practices on crop productivity in the loess plateau of northwest china 2 quantify soc tn and labile soil organic c and n contents after 3 year field experiment to assess different mulching practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments using a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system were conducted from june 2013 to june 2016 at the irrigation experimental station of the key laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering sponsored by the ministry of education 34 18 n 108 04 e 506 m asl in yangling shaanxi china the experimental site is located in the southern region of the loess plateau and belongs to a typical dry semi humid area in northwest china the average annual precipitation is 638 mm with nearly 60 falling between july and october the average annual sunshine hour is 2196 h and the average annual air temperature is 13 c the precipitation distribution and daily mean air temperature were recorded throughout the year over the whole period of experiments fig 1 the experimental soil was a silt clay loam with a mean bulk density of 1 45 g cm 3 and contained 11 17 g kg 1 total carbon and 0 95 g kg 1 total nitrogen in the 0 100 cm soil layer the groundwater level was approximately 50 m 2 2 experimental design the experimental field was cultivated with a winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system for 20 years prior to the establishment of this experiment this experiment had three treatments i traditional plough with no mulching ck ii traditional plough with plastic film mulching pm and iii traditional plough with straw mulching sm the ck treatment comprised a flat non mulched plot winter wheat straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at the rates of 4 0 t ha 1 in the summer maize plot and summer maize straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at the rates of 4 0 t ha 1 in the winter wheat plot after the seeds were sown in the sm treatment plastic film 0 005 mm thick 1 7 m wide was mulched in the winter wheat and summer maize plots by hand after the seeds were sown in the pm treatment the three treatments were arranged into a randomized complete block design with three replications each plot was 5 m long and 4 m wide the chemical fertilizers consisted of 120 kg n ha 1 as co nh2 2 and 54 kg p ha 1 as ca h2po4 2 for maize and wheat respectively and were applied to the upper soil layer 0 20 cm by rotary tillage for three treatments in order to facilitate tillage the roots for each plot were removed when the crop was harvested maize seeds cv qinlong 11 were sown at a density of 50 000 plants ha 1 on june 9 2013 june 20 2014 and june 15 2015 after a rotary tillage and the crops were harvested on september 28 2013 october 12 2014 and october 7 2015 three treatments involved alternating wide and narrow row spacing of 60 cm and 30 cm the plots were irrigated with 80 mm water in 2013 due to low precipitation and not irrigated in 2014 and 2015 wheat seeds cv xiaoyan 22 were sown at a density of 150 kg ha 1 on october 16 2013 october 18 2014 and october 19 2015 using a rotary tillage and the crops were harvested on june 8 2014 june 6 2015 and june 5 2016 winter wheat was planted with 25 cm wide row space the plots were irrigated with 60 mm water during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons due to drought stress and not irrigated during the 2015 2016 growing season 2 3 soil sampling 2 3 1 soil water during each summer maize or winter wheat growing season soil water content was measured gravimetrically at 20 cm intervals within the 0 100 cm profile in each plot at seeding stage jointing stage filling stage maturity stage and harvest time the soil water in the 0 100 cm soil layer in each plot was then calculated as the average soil water content in the three experimental seasons actual crop evapotranspiration eta was calculated by using the soil water balance equation 1 e t a i p e r q δ w where i is the irrigation depth mm pe is effective rainfall mm r is runoff loss from ground surface mm q is vertical soil water exchange at the depth of 100 cm positive downward negative upward mm and δw is the difference in soil water storage in the 100 cm soil layer between the two soil water measurements at begin and end seasons mm in this experiment the groundwater table remains at the depth of about 50 m below the surface and irrigation and rainfall amounts were low so the upward flow and downward flow into the root were negligible surface runoff is omitted due to the deep groundwater table and the experimental field being relatively flat 2 3 2 soil sample collection and analysis soil samples were collected at 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layer after the maize harvest in october 7 2015 and the wheat harvest in june 6 2013 and june 5 2016 in each plot five soil cores each 2 5 cm diameter were excavated randomly and mixed to form a composite sample all fresh samples were divided into two parts one part was air dried and sieved through a 0 25 mm screen to determine soc and tn the other part from 2015 and 2016 growing seasons was immediately transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until the samples were measured for mbc mbn doc and don soc was determined by the dichromate oxidation method mebius 1960 tn was analyzed using the kjeldahl method liu et al 1996 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were determined colorimetrically by the salicylate nitroprusside method on a flow injection autoanalyzer fia lachat instruments usa samples of 5 g fresh homogenized soil without roots were soaked with 50 ml kcl of 2 mol l 1 and shook for 1 h and then analyzed with the fia lachat instruments usa to determine the concentrations of extractable no3 n and nh4 n mbc and mbn were determined by the chloroform fumigation extraction method wu et al 1996 briefly fresh soil samples equivalent to 20 g air dried soil were fumigated at 25 c for 24 h after removing the chcl3 c and n were extracted from the fumigated and non fumigated samples with 0 5 mol l 1 k2so4 soil solution ratio of 1 4 w v for 1 h the filtered extracts were analyzed using a multi 3100 n c toc analyzer analytik jena germany a k ec value of 0 45 and a k en value of 0 54 were used to calculate the c and n content of the microbial biomass concentrations of doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were determined following jones procedures jones and willett 2006 specifically the field moist soil samples equivalent to 10 g oven dried weight were extracted with 50 ml k2so4 of 0 5 mol l 1 soil to solution ratio of 1 5 w v in the polypropylene bottles by shaking for 30 min at a speed of 200 rpm the supernatant was then filtered through 0 45 μm filters into separate vials for doc and tdn analysis by using a shimadzu toc tn analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan don was calculated as the difference between the tdn concentration and the combined nh4 n and no3 n concentration 2 4 yield measurements summer maize yield was determined by hand harvesting the two adjacent center rows 60 cm wide and 500 cm long in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 8 10 days and weighed after threshing the grain yield of summer maize was calculated when the water content in sun dried grain was about 12 measured by oven drying method winter wheat yield was determined by hand harvesting four rows of wheat 100 cm wide and 100 cm long in each plot at maturity the harvest samples were sun dried for 6 8 days and weighed after threshing the grain yield of winter wheat was calculated considering 12 water content in the sun dried grain water use efficiency wue can be expressed as 2 w u e y e t a where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and eta is the corresponding actual crop evapotranspiration mm 2 5 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using the anova procedure and statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical package multiple comparisons of annual mean values were performed using least significant difference lsd method in all analyses p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 soil water the dynamics of soil water content in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm layers of all experimental plots in 2013 2015 summer maize growing seasons are shown in fig 2 soil water under the pm treatment was higher than that under the sm treatment and mainly changed at the 0 60 cm soil depth in 2013 the soil water content for three treatments declined until 93 days after the sowing of summer maize dasm and increased from 93 to 112 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to about 55 mm of accumulation precipitation amount between 102 and 107 dasm and basically declined during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of lm pm and ck before 60 dasm and increased with the order of pm ck and lm after 60 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth and declined with the order of ck lm and pm during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth fig 2a and b in 2014 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 85 dasm and declined from 85 to 115 dasm at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation amount before 88 dasm and low precipitation amount after 90 dasm and increased during the total summer maize growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of pm ck and lm at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths during the total summer maize growing season fig 2c and d in 2015 the soil water content for three treatments increased at the 0 60 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of pm ck and lm at the 0 60 cm soil depth and basically declined with the order of ck lm and pm at the 60 100 cm soil depth during the total summer maize growing season fig 2e and f the dynamics of soil water content in the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm layers of all experimental plots in 2013 2016 winter wheat growing seasons are shown in fig 3 in 2013 2014 the soil water content for three treatments basically increased until 194 days after the sowing of winter wheat dasw and declined from 194 to 236 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to three large precipitation events between 170 and 194 dasw and the similar seasonal trend appeared at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of lm pm and ck before 194 dasw and increased with the order of lm ck and pm after 194 dasw at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths fig 3a and b in 2014 2015 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 161 dasw and declined from 161 to 232 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation amount between 160 and 190 dasw and decreased during the total growing season at the 60 100 cm soil depth the soil water content declined with the order of ck pm and lm at the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths during the total winter wheat growing season fig 3c and d in 2015 2016 the soil water content for three treatments increased until 75 dasw declined from 75 to 210 dasw and increased after 210 dasw at the 0 60 cm soil depth which was due to high precipitation before 75 dasw and low precipitation after 75 dasw and the similar seasonal trend appeared at the 60 100 cm soil depth except for the soil water content after 210 dasw the soil water content declined before 100 dasw with the order of pm ck and lm and after 100 dasw with the order of ck pm and lm at the 0 60 cm soil depth fig 3e the soil water content was basically higher in the ck treatment than in the pm and lm treatments at the 60 100 cm soil depth during the total summer maize growing season fig 3f 3 2 soil organic carbon and total nitrogen soc at the 0 10 cm soil depth was affected by mulching cultivation with three years table 1 soc was higher at the 0 10 cm soil depth than at the 10 20 cm soil depth compared with the ck treatment soc under the sm treatment was increased by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth whereas the pm treatment had the similar soc level at the 10 20 cm soil depth there was no difference in soc between the pm and ck treatments after three years of winter wheat summer maize rotation which was consistent with tian et al 2013 after mulching cultivation with three years tn was increased by 7 7 at the 0 10 cm soil depth under the sm treatment and increased by 9 0 at the 10 20 cm soil depth under the pm treatment respectively compared with the ck treatment table 1 from 2013 to 2016 tn at the 0 10 cm soil depth was increased by 11 1 under the ck treatment by 5 7 under the pm treatment and by 15 2 under the sm treatment however the difference of tn at the 10 20 cm soil depth was not significant table 1 compared with the ck treatment soil c n ratio was increased by 6 22 p 0 05 under the sm treatment but decreased by 5 17 p 0 05 under the pm treatment after three years 3 3 labile soc fractions under different mulching cultivations 3 3 1 soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen mbc and mbn concentrations were significantly affected by different mulching practices at the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil depths respectively whether in summer maize season or in winter wheat season fig 4 compared with the ck treatment mbc concentrations under the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 42 0 and 24 1 respectively mbn concentration under the pm treatment was significantly increased by 5 6 and the difference of mbn between the sm treatment and the ck treatment was not significant at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season fig 4a and b however mbc and mbn concentrations followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth mbc and mbn concentrations under the three treatments after the wheat season followed the same changing trend as that after the maize season fig 4c and d mbc after the wheat season was significantly increased by 23 8 4 8 and 18 2 than after maize season for the ck pm and sm treatments at 0 10 cm soil depth respectively meanwhile mbn concentration was higher for three treatments after the wheat season than that after the maize season 3 3 2 soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen doc and don concentrations under the sm treatment were significantly higher than that under the other treatments at the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil depths fig 5 compared with the ck treatment doc was significantly increased by 21 0 under the sm treatment and decreased by 13 1 under the pm treatment whereas don was significantly increased by 10 5 under the sm treatment and decreased by 4 3 under the pm treatment at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the maize season fig 5a and b in addition doc and don followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth doc and don concentrations under the three treatments after the winter wheat season followed the same changing trend as that after the summer maize season fig 5c and d doc concentrations under the ck pm and sm treatments after the winter wheat season were 3 1 3 2 2 8 times higher respectively than that after the summer maize season meanwhile don concentration was higher for three treatments after the winter wheat season than that after the summer maize season 3 4 relative sensitivity of carbon and nitrogen fractions changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were differed between the pm and sm treatments and the ck treatment after the summer maize fig 6 a and b and winter wheat seasons fig 6c and d in general relative changes of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were more sensitive than that of soc and tn compared with a small decline or increase of soc and tn the relative decline or increase of labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions was on average almost 13 6 for the mulching treatments in particular the average relative increases of the mbc fractions from the pm treatment and the sm treatment were almost 33 1 after the maize season 19 5 after the wheat season at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively in addition the relative changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions followed the same changing trend at the 10 20 cm soil depth 3 5 grain yields and water use efficiency the grain yields of summer maize and winter wheat were significantly affected by the different mulching treatments over the three years table 2 the summer maize yield was highest in 2013 and the lowest in 2014 the three year mean maize yields for each of the treatments were ranked as follows pm sm ck compared with the ck treatment the mean maize yields with the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 26 4 and 9 8 respectively similarly the three year mean wheat grain yield with the pm treatment was highest and lowest with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the mean wheat yields with the pm and sm treatments were significantly increased by 21 3 and 7 4 respectively the wue represents the relationship between water consumption and the grain yield compared with the ck treatment the pm and sm treatments significantly increased wue in three summer maize winter wheat growing seasons except for the 2013 and 2014 summer maize growing seasons table 1 the average wue under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively in addition the pm treatment obtained a higher grain yield using less water 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching practices on soil water with a lack of timely precipitation under arid or semi arid conditions surface mulching practices e g straw mulching and plastic film mulching can reduce unproductive water losses from the soil surface and improve soil water and thermal status which play an important role in crop management and growth kouwenhoven et al 2002 zhao et al 2014 straw mulching can increase water infiltration into soil reduce runoff and increase water in the soil profile li et al 2013a b compared with the ck treatment the sm treatment consistently increased soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer during the summer maize growing season of 2013 and winter wheat growing season of 2013 2014 figs 2a and 3a this was because that the rate of water vapor flux through mulched straw was generally slow compared with the rate of water loss from a moist soil surface li et al 2013a b however a lower soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed for the sm treatment during the summer maize growing season of 2014 and 2015 fig 2c and e and the winter wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3c and e this was mainly because the mulched straw promoted summer maize and winter wheat development and thus the greater consumption of soil water led to low soil water content zhang et al 2011 and the effectiveness of straw mulching in reducing evaporation weakened with natural decomposition in addition there was low rainfall and increased plant growth led to high transpiration rates further accounting for the reduced soil water content during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 currently plastic film mulching has been widely used in china for increasing yield zhang and yang 2001 and water use efficiency ma 1999 in the loess plateau with serious water deficit for agricultural production plastic film mulching has been utilized in cultivating corn spring and winter wheat zhang et al 2013 wu et al 2015 compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment resulted in an increase in soil water at the 0 60 cm soil depth during the summer maize growing seasons before 60 dasm in 2013 and of 2014 2015 fig 2a c and e and the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 fig 3a this was mainly because that high precipitation appeared in the above mentioned growing seasons and mulched plastic film blocked the water vapor movement pathway from the soil surface to the air and greatly reduced evaporation which could help to solve the low temperature phenomenon induced by straw mulching however a lower soil water content in the 0 60 cm soil layer was observed for the pm treatment during the summer maize growing season after 60 dasm in 2013 fig 2a and the winter wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3c and e this was mainly because that the pm treatment increased crop growth and higher crop transpiration rates during the crop growing seasons led to low soil water content li et al 2013a b and reduced soil water by intercepting rainwater and preventing rainwater from penetrating the soil when frequent but small rainfall appeared during the crop growing seasons döring et al 2005 in addition soil water content at the 0 60 cm soil depth was higher in pm than in sm during the summer maize growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 fig 2c and e and the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 3a c and e this was similar to the results found by li et al 2013a b and zhang et al 2013 in the same region the increase in soil water could be attributed to better water retention as pm could reduced more soil evaporation and thus conserve more soil water than sm did except for the summer maize growing season of 2013 which had the lower rainfall than the other summer maize growing seasons 4 2 effect of mulching practices on soil organic matter fractions plastic film mulching could lead to a decrease in the soc and decline in soil quality through increased soc mineralization and microbial activity li et al 2004 zhou et al 2012 indicating that plastic film mulching may not be a long term solution in managing the soil in contrast some other studies reported that plastic film mulching practice contributed to the positive balances of soc due to the increase in root biomass and root deposition of crops returned back to the soil fan et al 2012 gao et al 2014 in our study compared with the ck treatment mulching practices leaded to a similar pm or increase sm soc concentration at the 0 20 cm soil depths after three years of winter wheat summer maize rotation table 1 compared with the initial soc concentration the soc concentration under the pm treatment had a comparatively more decrease tendency at the 0 10 cm soil depth which was inconsistent with fan et al 2012 this was probably because the roots for each plot were removed when the crop was harvested in order to facilitate tillage which decreased the carbon input as crop roots biomass compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment was not conductive to the accumulation of the soc concentration despite the insignificant decrease tendency whereas the sm treatment increased the soc concentration relative increase by 16 9 at the 0 10 cm soil depth after the 3 year of winter maize summer wheat rotation tn was an important indicator of soil health in our study little changes in tn were found from 2013 to 2016 in three treatments table 1 soil ran short of nitrogen when tn content was less than 2 g kg 1 zhou et al 2012 in our study tn in three treatments ranged from 0 89 to 1 33 g kg 1 which indicated that the soil at the experiment site was very poor in tn a positive feedback loop between soc and c n was observed when the c n ratio ranged from 5 6 to 11 3 in a similar agro ecosystem characterized by mulching practices in a typical loess soil zhou et al 2012 the low ration of soc to tn under the pm treatment table 1 could mean an acceleration of soil organic matter decomposition jia et al 2006 a high input of organic matter could increase labile soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions graham et al 2002 however the increase in production of high yield and in soil water and topsoil temperature would result in consistent year on year decreases in the soc concentration mbc and mbn were recognized as important indicators of soil quality that respond rapidly to soil management practices chen et al 2009 although they only had a small proportion of soc and tn mclauchlan and hobbie 2004 powlson et al 1987 the mbc only took about 1 5 of soc and the mbn only accounted for 2 6 of tn but they had an important influence on the rate of nutrient cycling in agricultural ecosystems brookes et al 1985 powlson et al 1987 mbn was regarded as the most labile soil organic nitrogen fraction because of the rapid generation rate of soil microbial biomass and represented both a source and sink of mineral nitrogen luo et al 2015 in our study the significantly higher mbc and mbn concentrations in the mulching practices pm and sm versus the ck treatment in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layers were observed fig 4 it supported the previous observation that mulching practices increased mbc and mbn in the topsoil compared with the ck treatment and the higher topsoil moisture and temperature conditions played an important role in the changes of mbc and mbn in the semiarid area li et al 2004 liu et al 2013 meanwhile it indicated that mulching practices would improve soil biochemical properties and increase soil microbial activity zhou et al 2012 as reported by smith et al 1992 and li et al 2004 mbc was significantly improved because of the increased topsoil temperature from plastic film mulching and had a high positive correlation with soil moisture in our study mbc and mbn were higher under the pm treatment than that under the ck treatment which was largely due to the increase of soil water availability and temperature during the crop growing seasons as reported by our team previously chen et al 2017 doc represented the main source of energy rich carbon substrate for microorganisms and microbial metabolites constituted an important proportion of doc montano et al 2007 kamble et al 2014 don represented a labile nitrogen source for soil microorganisms jones and kielland 2002 in contrast to mbc and mbn the pm treatment showed a lower doc and don concentration after both summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons compared with the ck treatment this probably reflected a lower microbial use and microbial production of doc and don the increases in soil water and temperature due to plastic film mulching could change the biological characteristics song et al 2002 which could stimulate microbial activity and increases doc and don consumption neff and asner 2001 thereby decreasing the doc concentration fig 5a and c this indicated that the pm treatment can be an effective practice in soils with adequate n low soil water and temperature the sm treatment showed a higher doc and don concentration after both summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons compared with the ck treatment this was mainly because that crop straw decomposition could release a substantial amount of doc increased labile organic c and n and alleviated nutrient limitation of the microbes chan et al 2002 chen et al 2009 li et al 2016 xie et al 2017 this indicated that the sm treatment can be applied in soils with low quality in addition soil microorganisms consumed soc for energy loveland and webb 2003 therefore soc was much important for maintaining the pool of soil nutrients and improving nutrient availability zhao et al 2009 in our study mbc mbn doc and don were higher under the sm treatment than under the ck treatment in the 0 10 and 10 20 cm soil layer fig 6 this was mainly because that straw mulching increased soc concentration thereby stimulating microorganisms and producing more mbc mbn doc and don which was consistent with li et al 2016 4 3 effect of mulching practices on grain yields the effects of mulching practices on crop yields depend on the climate condition crop type and soil texture pituello et al 2016 in our study compared with the ck treatment the mean maize and wheat grain yields under the sm treatment were increased by 9 8 and 7 4 respectively and the mean maize and wheat yields under the pm treatment were increased by 26 4 and 21 3 respectively table 2 this was because that the sm and pm treatments reduced soil evaporation increased the proportion of plant transpiration and provided the higher soil mbc and mbn than the ck treatment did correlation analysis revealed that maize and wheat grain yields were significantly correlated with soil mbc mbn doc and don concentrations under the sm treatment p 0 05 and with soil mbc and mbn under the pm treatment p 0 05 these results suggested that adequate available c and n should be supplied to achieve high crop yields in soils n was the most yield limiting and difficult to manage nutrient in crop systems and n dynamics became more complex in the presence of straw mulching and plastic film mulching eagle et al 2000 xie et al 2017 the performance in grain production of both summer maize and winter wheat was better under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment this suggested that the pm treatment was more efficient than the sm treatment in alleviating c and n and hydrothermal limitations to maize and wheat growth which was consistent with luo et al 2015 and chen et al 2017 5 conclusion our study showed that soil water was higher under the pm treatment than under the sm treatment and mainly changed in the upper 60 cm soil layer soil organic carbon and nitrogen fractions were significantly affected in topsoil by the pm and sm treatments compared with the ck treatment the pm treatment decreased doc and don concentrations but significantly increased mbc and mbn concentrations and the sm treatment significantly increased soc tn mbc doc and don concentrations in addition the average grain yields under the pm and sm treatments were 26 4 9 8 in summer maize and 21 3 7 4 in winter wheat higher than that under the ck treatment respectively the average wue under the pm and sm treatments were 24 5 8 8 in winter wheat and 22 9 6 3 in summer maize higher than that under the ck treatment respectively thus it can be concluded that the sm treatment can be an effective practice for improving soc tn mbc doc and don concentrations in the short term but the pm treatment which can improve soil mbc and mbn concentrations is recommended with the objective of the highest crop yield and water use efficiency in the loess plateau china acknowledgements this study was supported by the

as well as root top and sugar yield and were of the most tolerant variety according to stress tolerance index sti followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon variety in a descending order whereas marathon was of the highest variety in sucrose purity and sugar recovery sr percentages increasing water stress level from 30 up to 70 from f c was significantly decreased beet growth throughout the growing season juice quality sucrose purity and sr significantly increased as water stress increased up to 70 while juice impurities and sucrose loss to molasses slm decreased a reduction in root

introduction irrigated agriculture is considered the main source of the fresh water resources about 70 of the total water withdrawals and 60 80 of total consumptive water use are consumed in irrigation huffaker and hamilton 2007 water shortage is of a vital importance in agriculture according to the prevailing arid and semi arid climate condition agricultural production is impossible without optimizing water resources kheirabi et al 1996 in egypt sugar production depends mainly on sugar cane and sugar beet crops sugar beet share with about 57 61 of total sugar production 2 2 million tons annually 42 39 being for sugar cane sugar crop councilreport 2017 sugar beet beta vulgaris l is a field crop which could be tolerant to drought vamerali et al 2009 however drought stress have an adverse effect on morpho physiological traits as root leaves and plant dry weight leaf chlorophyll and stomatal conductance root yield of sugar beet genotypes moosavi et al 2017 in this respect gharib and el henawy 2011 used three irrigation regimes of 40 55 and 70 soil water depletion on sugar beet yield and quality they found that increasing water stress significantly decreased leaf area index and net assimilation rate other studies reported a reduction in root and sugar yields in water stress conditions besheit et al 1996 used 20 40 and 60 of soil water depletion in root and sugar yields significantly increased when sugar beet was grown constantly under 40 water depletion from the field capacity they noticed a reduction in sugar yield under the higher level of water depletion which may be attributed to the reduction in root yield and or metabolic products translocated from leaves to roots the highest wue was obtained for 60 while mohamed et al 2000 used 50 65 and 80 soil water depletion of field capacity where they reported the maximum root and sugar yields as well as wue from 65 soil water depletion kiziloglu et al 2006 and topak et al 2011 found that root leaf and sugar yields were significantly decreased with increasing water deficit in the semi arid regions the relationship between evapotranspiration and root yield was linear the wue was the highest at the lowest irrigation conditions masri et al 2015 bahmani et al 2017 and zare abyaneh et al 2017 investigated the effects of water stress levels from 50 up to 100 of the crop water requirement they found that increasing the amount of irrigated water increased lai and root and white sugar yields however sugar content purity and extractable sugar were reduced other studies reported that drought stress decreased na and k content in beet roots mahmoodi et al 2008 abd el wahab and nemeat alla 2002 while baigy et al 2012 and hoffmann 2014 used water stress from 30 up to 100 of water holding capacity which they found that na and k content were not affected by water stress whereas amino n content was increased last et al 1983 found that the concentration of k and na were considered as impurities in the extracted root sap which have been shown to be inversely related to the amount of extractable sugar regarding tolerance variety of sugar beet to water stress shehata et al 2000 evaluated four sugar beet varieties top m9340 del 1939 and raspoly under different levels of available soil water 100 75 and 25 they found that growth and yield of sugar beet shoot were affected by water deficit more than the roots sucrose and purity increased but sugar yield decreased under water stress raspoly and del 1939 varieties were not affected by water stress level but m9340 was highly sensitive and top was moderately sensitive ober et al 2005 evaluated 46 sugar beet genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds they found significant genotypic differences for their stomatal conductance succulence index specific leaf weight and osmotic adjustment but not for photosynthetic rate relative water content or total water use droughted sugar yield was positively correlated with soil water extraction and negatively correlated with relative leaf expansion rate there was high positive correlation between transpiration rate and sugar yield under the irrigated conditions tsialtas et al 2012 tested 3 sugar beet varieties europa corsica and rival under drought for a month for wue and defoliation they found significant differences among varieties in wue but there were of no significant differences in defoliation hussein et al 2008 compared two varieties fd99 and cardova under 40 60 and 80 of the maximum water holding capacity whc of the soil they found that the interaction between varieties and whc was significant for total chlorophyll farshdfar et al 2012 and hesadi et al 2015 evaluated different sugar beet genotypes to drought stress stress tolerance index sti stress susceptibility index ssi tolerance index tol yield stability index ysi drought resistance index di yield index yi and abiotic tolerance index ati they indicated that sti di and ysi can be used as most suitable indicators for screening of the drought tolerance genotypes the target of this investigation was to study and evaluate varietal tolerance of sugar beet to water stress through determining growth performance for root and sugar yields and juice quality traits as well 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site and soil properties two field experiments were designed and carried out in the experimental station faculty of agriculture cairo university giza egypt during 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 seasons mechanical and chemical analysis of the upper soil of 40 cm of the

done using least significant differences l s d at 5 level of significance according to steel and torrie 1980 all statistical analysis was performed by using analysis of variance technique of computer software package mstat c 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth traits significant differences among varieties in root leaves and plant dry weight chlorophyll content and leaf area index lai were recorded at all sampling dates in both seasons differences among sugar beet varieties in production and distribution of dry matter were reported by rajabi et al 2009 the variety xanadu produced the highest values of growth traits throughout the growing season followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon in a descending order the highest increment in root leaves and plant dry weight for most of the studied beet varieties were recorded at the later stage of growth 175 200 days after sowing on the other hand leaves dry weight lai and chlorophyll content of all varieties gradually decreased as plants progressive towards maturity and the highest reduction in leaves dry weight was recorded at 125 150 days of age fig 1 while the highest reduction in chlorophyll content and lai was recorded at 175 200 days of age figs 2 and 3 reflecting senescence of leaves as a result of translocation of photosynthates from leaves to storage roots hoffmann 2010 reported that leaf dry matter markedly increased up to 15 weeks after sowing whereas root dry matter increased until the final harvest after 27 weeks he added that water stress restricted the growth of plant organs however under drought stress the reduction in root dry matter was more than leaf dry matter the variety xanadu was significantly the highest variety in photosynthetic efficiency in terms of rgr and nar in both seasons table 1 reflecting its superiority in dry matter accumulation as well as chlorophyll content and lai while marathon was the lowest one in this respect the other varieties were ranked in between the highest values of rgr and nar for all varieties were recorded at the later stage of growth 175 200 days differences among beet varieties in lai rgr and nar were reported by other workers nassar 1992 rajabi et al 2009 data in tables 2 4 revealed significant differences among water stress levels in growth traits of most of sampling dates in each season increasing water stress from 30 up to 70 of field capacity markedly decreased beet growth the best growth traits resulted from 30 water stress followed by 50 and 70 in a descending order of sampling dates the highest increment in root and plant dry weight rgr and nar were recorded during the period of 175 200 days of age for the water stress levels in each season bloch and hoffmann 2005 found that under drought leaf growth and root formation of sugar beet were reduced absorption of light is thus lowered because of reduced leaf area in addition the rate of photosynthesis is decreased and consequently the amount of assimilates that are provided for growth maintenance and root formation is restricted reflected the reduction in rgr and nar which were reported by hoffmann 2014 gharib and el henawy 2011 and masri et al 2015 noticed that fluorescence and lai were reduced during the growth periods but the reduction was greater under drought conditions than non stress conditions growth traits were significantly affected by the interaction between varieties and water stress levels in each season table 9 except for chlorophyll content at 200 days of age in the second season and rgr and nar at 175 200 days after sowing and 125 150 days in the first and second seasons respectively the xanadu beet variety grown under 30 water stress produced the highest value of all growth traits at all sampling dates in each of the two seasons similar trend in results was reported by hussein et al 2008 and gharib and el henawy 2011 whereas shaw et al 2002 reported that such varieties did not significantly respond to water stress 3 2 juice quality traits varieties significantly differed in sucrose purity impurities sucrose loss to molasses slm and sugar recovery sr in both seasons table 5 marathon variety produced the highest sucrose and purity while xanadu was of the lowest one on the other hand xanadu variety had the highest juice impurities and slm whereas marathon sugar beet variety produced the lowest juice impurities whereas heba and marathon being insignificantly different for the lowest variety in slm the highest sr was resulted from marathon while xanadu was of the lowest one due to its high content of impurities and slm results in table 6 revealed that sucrose and purity were significantly increased as water stress increased from 30 up to 70 in each of the two seasons similar results were also obtained by ucan and gencoglan 2004 whom they found that sugar content increased from 5 62 up to 17 5 as the deficit irrigation increased from 6 up to 60 mahmoodi et al 2008 recorded 16 92 17 45 17 23 and 15 5 decrease in sugar content by irrigating at 30 50 70 and 90 water stress whereas ghamarina et al 2012 reported 4 45 17 32 and 37 63 higher sugar content at 25 50 and 75 deficit irrigation respectively similar conclusion was confirmed by zare abyaneh et al 2017 significant differences among water stress levels in impurities sucrose loss to molasses slm and sugar recovery sr were obtained for the two seasons except for impurities in the 1st season table 6 the increase in water stress level from 30 up to 70 was associated with a reduction in impurities and slm while sugar recovery increased as water stress increased the reduction in impurities and slm under water stress could be due to the increase in sucrose and purity and the decrease in na and k impurities content as reported by abd el wahab and nemeat alla 2002 and mahmoodi et al 2008 the increase in sr may be due to the increase in sucrose and purity as well as the reduction in impurities as mentioned previously masri et al 2015 bahmani et al 2017 quality traits were significantly affected by the interaction of varieties and water stress level in the two seasons table 10 the highest sucrose and sr resulted from marathon variety with 70 water stress the highest purity was obtained for halawa and marathon varieties irrigated with 70 water stress while the highest slm was obtained from xanadu variety with 30 and 50 water stress in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively the positive response of beet quality traits of some sugar beet varieties to water stress was reported by shehata et al 2000 however bloch and hoffmann 2005 found that varieties soil water depletion levels were not significant in respect to sucrose content 3 3 root top and sugar yields varieties exhibited significant differences in root top and sugar yields in the two seasons table 7 xanadu variety surpassed the others with an average of root yield 32 42 and 34 87 ton fed 1 top yield 9 31 and 9 71 ton fed 1 and sugar yield 4 78 and 4 84 ton fed 1 in the first and second seasons respectively followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon varieties in a descending order the superiority of xanadu sugar beet variety may be due to its better growth traits as mentioned previously it is worth noting that the lower sucrose and purity of xanadu variety was compensated by the higher root yield and finally sugar yield increased differences in root top and sugar production among sugar beet varieties were reported by bloch and hoffmann 2005 significant differences among water stress levels in root top and sugar yields were recorded in the two seasons table 8 increasing water stress from 30 to 50 decreased root yield by 5 1 and 7 0 top yield by 1 8 and 4 8 sugar yield by 1 2 and 4 8 whereas increasing water stress from 50 to 70 decreased root yield by 8 9 and 9 2 top yield by 13 3 and 33 2 and sugar yield by 6 4 and 7 0 in the first and second seasons respectively these reductions could be due to the depressive effect of drought stress on beet growth in terms of dry weight of plant organs and lai which were reflected on the lower rgr and nar as mentioned before it is worth noting that the reduction in root yield accompanying water deficit was not compensated by the increase in sucrose purity sugar recovery and finally sugar yield decreased masri et al 2015 the interaction between varieties and water stress levels exhibited significant effect on sugar beet yields in the two seasons table 10 the highest root yield of 32 82 and 38 86 ton fed 1 produced from xanadu 30 water stress in the two seasons top yield of 10 90 and 11 87 ton was obtained from xanadu 70 and 50 water stress while the highest sugar yield produced from xanadu variety 50 and 30 water stress of the respective first and second seasons differential yield response of beet varieties to water deficit was reported by ober et al 2005 3 4 water relations consumed water for stress levels were 2621 6 and 2839 4 m3 fed 1 for 30 2351 0 and 2480 0 m3 fed 1 for 50 2040 4 and 2227 6 m3 fed 1 for 70 in the first and second seasons respectively the reduction in total water irrigation was 10 3 and 12 7 for 50 22 2 and 21 5 for 70 as compared with 30 water stress in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively the increase in the amount of water irrigation applied under the level of 30 water stress may be due to increasing irrigation frequencies as well as increasing the amount of water consumed by plants which was reflected in higher lai and dry weight of roots and leaves as mentioned before varieties differed significantly in wue for root yield in both seasons and for sugar yield in the first season table 11 xanadu variety recorded the highest wue for both root and sugar yields in both seasons followed by zwanpoly heba halawa and marathon in a descending order the same of the obtained results were reported by ucan and gencoglan 2004 who found that the greatest wue values were recorded in treatment of the highest yields increasing water stressed level significantly increased wue for root and sugar yield in the two seasons table 12 increasing water stress from 30 to 50 and from 50 to 70 increased wue for root yield by 5 8 and 3 7 and by 4 9 and 4 5 in the first and second seasons respectively also wue for sugar yield increased by 9 8 and 7 9 corresponding to increased water stress from 30 to 50 and by 6 7 and 4 9 for increased water stress level from 50 to 70 in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively this increase was mainly due to treatment of 70 water stress were irrigated with low quantities of water compared to the other applied treatments which was reflected on lower growth traits as lai rgr nar root weight and consequently reduced root and sugar yields as previously reported similar trend of the obtained results were notice by topak et al 2016 whom they indicated that wue increased by decreasing the amount of applied irrigated water 3 5 varietal tolerance data in table 13 revealed that sugar beet varieties varied in their response to drought stress condition it is worth noting that xanadu variety was the most tolerant variety according to stress tolerance index sti

introduction irrigated agriculture is considered the main source of the fresh water resources about 70 of the total water withdrawals and 60 80 of total consumptive water use are consumed in irrigation huffaker and hamilton 2007 water shortage is of a vital importance in agriculture according to the prevailing arid and semi arid climate condition agricultural production is impossible without optimizing water resources kheirabi et al 1996 in egypt sugar production depends mainly on sugar cane and sugar beet crops sugar beet share with about 57 61 of total sugar production 2 2 million tons annually 42 39 being for sugar cane sugar crop councilreport 2017 sugar beet beta vulgaris l is a field crop which could be tolerant to drought vamerali et al 2009 however drought stress have an adverse effect on morpho physiological traits as root leaves and plant dry weight leaf chlorophyll and stomatal conductance root yield of sugar beet genotypes moosavi et al 2017 in this respect gharib and el henawy 2011 used three irrigation regimes of 40 55 and 70 soil water depletion on sugar beet yield and quality they found that increasing water stress significantly decreased leaf area index and net assimilation rate other studies reported a reduction in root and sugar yields in water stress conditions besheit et al 1996 used 20 40 and 60 of soil water depletion in root and sugar yields significantly increased when sugar beet was grown constantly under 40 water depletion from the field capacity they noticed a reduction in sugar yield under the higher level of water depletion which may be attributed to the reduction in root yield and or metabolic products translocated from leaves to roots the highest wue was obtained for 60 while mohamed et al 2000 used 50 65 and 80 soil water depletion of field capacity where they reported the maximum root and sugar yields as well as wue from 65 soil water depletion kiziloglu et al 2006 and topak et al 2011 found that root leaf and sugar yields were significantly decreased with increasing water deficit in the semi arid regions the relationship between evapotranspiration and root yield was linear the wue was the highest at the lowest irrigation conditions masri et al 2015 bahmani et al 2017 and zare abyaneh et al 2017 investigated the effects of water stress levels from 50 up to 100 of the crop water requirement they found that increasing the amount of irrigated water increased lai and root and white sugar yields however sugar content purity and extractable sugar were reduced other studies reported that drought stress decreased na and k content in beet roots mahmoodi et al 2008 abd el wahab and nemeat alla 2002 while baigy et al 2012 and hoffmann 2014 used water stress from 30 up to 100 of water holding capacity which they found that na and k content were not affected by water stress whereas amino n content was increased last et al 1983 found that the concentration of k and na were considered as impurities in the extracted root sap which have been shown to be inversely related to the amount of extractable sugar regarding tolerance variety of sugar beet to water stress shehata et al 2000 evaluated four sugar beet varieties top m9340 del 1939 and raspoly under different levels of available soil water 100 75 and 25 they found that growth and yield of sugar beet shoot were affected by water deficit more than the roots sucrose and purity increased but sugar yield decreased under water stress raspoly and del 1939 varieties were not affected by water stress level but m9340 was highly sensitive and top was moderately sensitive ober et al 2005 evaluated 46 sugar beet genotypes with diverse genetic backgrounds they found significant genotypic differences for their stomatal conductance succulence index specific leaf weight and osmotic adjustment but not for photosynthetic rate relative water content or total water use droughted sugar yield was positively correlated with soil water extraction and negatively correlated with relative leaf expansion rate there was high positive correlation between transpiration rate and sugar yield under the irrigated conditions tsialtas et al 2012 tested 3 sugar beet varieties europa corsica and rival under drought for a month for wue and defoliation they found significant differences among varieties in wue but there were of no significant differences in defoliation hussein et al 2008 compared two varieties fd99 and cardova under 40 60 and 80 of the maximum water holding capacity whc of the soil they found that the interaction between varieties and whc was significant for total chlorophyll farshdfar et al 2012 and hesadi et al 2015 evaluated different sugar beet genotypes to drought stress stress tolerance index sti stress susceptibility index ssi tolerance index tol yield stability index ysi drought resistance index di yield index yi and abiotic tolerance index ati they indicated that sti di and ysi can be used as most suitable indicators for screening of the drought tolerance genotypes the target of this investigation was to study and evaluate varietal tolerance of sugar beet to water stress through determining growth performance for root and sugar yields and juice quality traits as well 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental site and soil properties two field experiments were designed and carried out in the experimental station faculty of agriculture cairo university giza egypt during 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 seasons mechanical and chemical analysis of the upper soil of 40 cm of the

done using least significant differences l s d at 5 level of significance according to steel and torrie 1980 all statistical analysis was performed by using analysis of variance technique of computer software package mstat c 1989 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth traits significant differences among varieties in root leaves and plant dry weight chlorophyll content and leaf area index lai were recorded at all sampling dates in both seasons differences among sugar beet varieties in production and distribution of dry matter were reported by rajabi et al 2009 the variety xanadu produced the highest values of growth traits throughout the growing season followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon in a descending order the highest increment in root leaves and plant dry weight for most of the studied beet varieties were recorded at the later stage of growth 175 200 days after sowing on the other hand leaves dry weight lai and chlorophyll content of all varieties gradually decreased as plants progressive towards maturity and the highest reduction in leaves dry weight was recorded at 125 150 days of age fig 1 while the highest reduction in chlorophyll content and lai was recorded at 175 200 days of age figs 2 and 3 reflecting senescence of leaves as a result of translocation of photosynthates from leaves to storage roots hoffmann 2010 reported that leaf dry matter markedly increased up to 15 weeks after sowing whereas root dry matter increased until the final harvest after 27 weeks he added that water stress restricted the growth of plant organs however under drought stress the reduction in root dry matter was more than leaf dry matter the variety xanadu was significantly the highest variety in photosynthetic efficiency in terms of rgr and nar in both seasons table 1 reflecting its superiority in dry matter accumulation as well as chlorophyll content and lai while marathon was the lowest one in this respect the other varieties were ranked in between the highest values of rgr and nar for all varieties were recorded at the later stage of growth 175 200 days differences among beet varieties in lai rgr and nar were reported by other workers nassar 1992 rajabi et al 2009 data in tables 2 4 revealed significant differences among water stress levels in growth traits of most of sampling dates in each season increasing water stress from 30 up to 70 of field capacity markedly decreased beet growth the best growth traits resulted from 30 water stress followed by 50 and 70 in a descending order of sampling dates the highest increment in root and plant dry weight rgr and nar were recorded during the period of 175 200 days of age for the water stress levels in each season bloch and hoffmann 2005 found that under drought leaf growth and root formation of sugar beet were reduced absorption of light is thus lowered because of reduced leaf area in addition the rate of photosynthesis is decreased and consequently the amount of assimilates that are provided for growth maintenance and root formation is restricted reflected the reduction in rgr and nar which were reported by hoffmann 2014 gharib and el henawy 2011 and masri et al 2015 noticed that fluorescence and lai were reduced during the growth periods but the reduction was greater under drought conditions than non stress conditions growth traits were significantly affected by the interaction between varieties and water stress levels in each season table 9 except for chlorophyll content at 200 days of age in the second season and rgr and nar at 175 200 days after sowing and 125 150 days in the first and second seasons respectively the xanadu beet variety grown under 30 water stress produced the highest value of all growth traits at all sampling dates in each of the two seasons similar trend in results was reported by hussein et al 2008 and gharib and el henawy 2011 whereas shaw et al 2002 reported that such varieties did not significantly respond to water stress 3 2 juice quality traits varieties significantly differed in sucrose purity impurities sucrose loss to molasses slm and sugar recovery sr in both seasons table 5 marathon variety produced the highest sucrose and purity while xanadu was of the lowest one on the other hand xanadu variety had the highest juice impurities and slm whereas marathon sugar beet variety produced the lowest juice impurities whereas heba and marathon being insignificantly different for the lowest variety in slm the highest sr was resulted from marathon while xanadu was of the lowest one due to its high content of impurities and slm results in table 6 revealed that sucrose and purity were significantly increased as water stress increased from 30 up to 70 in each of the two seasons similar results were also obtained by ucan and gencoglan 2004 whom they found that sugar content increased from 5 62 up to 17 5 as the deficit irrigation increased from 6 up to 60 mahmoodi et al 2008 recorded 16 92 17 45 17 23 and 15 5 decrease in sugar content by irrigating at 30 50 70 and 90 water stress whereas ghamarina et al 2012 reported 4 45 17 32 and 37 63 higher sugar content at 25 50 and 75 deficit irrigation respectively similar conclusion was confirmed by zare abyaneh et al 2017 significant differences among water stress levels in impurities sucrose loss to molasses slm and sugar recovery sr were obtained for the two seasons except for impurities in the 1st season table 6 the increase in water stress level from 30 up to 70 was associated with a reduction in impurities and slm while sugar recovery increased as water stress increased the reduction in impurities and slm under water stress could be due to the increase in sucrose and purity and the decrease in na and k impurities content as reported by abd el wahab and nemeat alla 2002 and mahmoodi et al 2008 the increase in sr may be due to the increase in sucrose and purity as well as the reduction in impurities as mentioned previously masri et al 2015 bahmani et al 2017 quality traits were significantly affected by the interaction of varieties and water stress level in the two seasons table 10 the highest sucrose and sr resulted from marathon variety with 70 water stress the highest purity was obtained for halawa and marathon varieties irrigated with 70 water stress while the highest slm was obtained from xanadu variety with 30 and 50 water stress in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively the positive response of beet quality traits of some sugar beet varieties to water stress was reported by shehata et al 2000 however bloch and hoffmann 2005 found that varieties soil water depletion levels were not significant in respect to sucrose content 3 3 root top and sugar yields varieties exhibited significant differences in root top and sugar yields in the two seasons table 7 xanadu variety surpassed the others with an average of root yield 32 42 and 34 87 ton fed 1 top yield 9 31 and 9 71 ton fed 1 and sugar yield 4 78 and 4 84 ton fed 1 in the first and second seasons respectively followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon varieties in a descending order the superiority of xanadu sugar beet variety may be due to its better growth traits as mentioned previously it is worth noting that the lower sucrose and purity of xanadu variety was compensated by the higher root yield and finally sugar yield increased differences in root top and sugar production among sugar beet varieties were reported by bloch and hoffmann 2005 significant differences among water stress levels in root top and sugar yields were recorded in the two seasons table 8 increasing water stress from 30 to 50 decreased root yield by 5 1 and 7 0 top yield by 1 8 and 4 8 sugar yield by 1 2 and 4 8 whereas increasing water stress from 50 to 70 decreased root yield by 8 9 and 9 2 top yield by 13 3 and 33 2 and sugar yield by 6 4 and 7 0 in the first and second seasons respectively these reductions could be due to the depressive effect of drought stress on beet growth in terms of dry weight of plant organs and lai which were reflected on the lower rgr and nar as mentioned before it is worth noting that the reduction in root yield accompanying water deficit was not compensated by the increase in sucrose purity sugar recovery and finally sugar yield decreased masri et al 2015 the interaction between varieties and water stress levels exhibited significant effect on sugar beet yields in the two seasons table 10 the highest root yield of 32 82 and 38 86 ton fed 1 produced from xanadu 30 water stress in the two seasons top yield of 10 90 and 11 87 ton was obtained from xanadu 70 and 50 water stress while the highest sugar yield produced from xanadu variety 50 and 30 water stress of the respective first and second seasons differential yield response of beet varieties to water deficit was reported by ober et al 2005 3 4 water relations consumed water for stress levels were 2621 6 and 2839 4 m3 fed 1 for 30 2351 0 and 2480 0 m3 fed 1 for 50 2040 4 and 2227 6 m3 fed 1 for 70 in the first and second seasons respectively the reduction in total water irrigation was 10 3 and 12 7 for 50 22 2 and 21 5 for 70 as compared with 30 water stress in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively the increase in the amount of water irrigation applied under the level of 30 water stress may be due to increasing irrigation frequencies as well as increasing the amount of water consumed by plants which was reflected in higher lai and dry weight of roots and leaves as mentioned before varieties differed significantly in wue for root yield in both seasons and for sugar yield in the first season table 11 xanadu variety recorded the highest wue for both root and sugar yields in both seasons followed by zwanpoly heba halawa and marathon in a descending order the same of the obtained results were reported by ucan and gencoglan 2004 who found that the greatest wue values were recorded in treatment of the highest yields increasing water stressed level significantly increased wue for root and sugar yield in the two seasons table 12 increasing water stress from 30 to 50 and from 50 to 70 increased wue for root yield by 5 8 and 3 7 and by 4 9 and 4 5 in the first and second seasons respectively also wue for sugar yield increased by 9 8 and 7 9 corresponding to increased water stress from 30 to 50 and by 6 7 and 4 9 for increased water stress level from 50 to 70 in the 1st and 2nd seasons respectively this increase was mainly due to treatment of 70 water stress were irrigated with low quantities of water compared to the other applied treatments which was reflected on lower growth traits as lai rgr nar root weight and consequently reduced root and sugar yields as previously reported similar trend of the obtained results were notice by topak et al 2016 whom they indicated that wue increased by decreasing the amount of applied irrigated water 3 5 varietal tolerance data in table 13 revealed that sugar beet varieties varied in their response to drought stress condition it is worth noting that xanadu variety was the most tolerant variety according to stress tolerance index sti this is from its better growth traits as well as root sugar and top yields as previously mentioned however marathon variety was the least drought tolerant variety and zwanpoly halawa and heba varieties ranked in between this was consistent with farshdfar et al 2012 and hesadi et al 2015 whom they found differences among sugar beet genotypes according to tolerance indices 4 conclusion this

and sugar yield xanadu variety recorded the highest dry matter accumulation chlorophyll content lai rgr nar and root top and sugar yields throughout the growing season followed by zwanpoly halawa heba and marathon varieties in a descending order while the variety marathon was of the highest juice quality traits increasing water stress level from 30 to 70 of the field capacity significantly

11537,drought is the most important crop production limiting factor in the changing climate scenario and its intensity is predicted to increase in future sunflower is an important oilseed crop having 8 share in the world oilseed production although it is a moderately drought tolerant crop severe drought causes reduction in the seed and oil production therefore to ensure sustainable sunflower achene and oil production it is very important to understand the relationship among the physiological biochemical genetic and agronomic basis of drought for its sustainable management impact of drought stress on various aspects of sunflower has been reported earlier but there is not a single study describing the physiological biochemical and genetic basis of drought in sunflower at molecular and crop level in this review manuscript influence of drought on sunflower achene yield and oil quality has been analyzed critically at both cell plant and crop level and the possible management options to mitigate the severity of the drought stress are proposed available literature describing the impact of drought stress on physiological and biochemical aspects like photosynthesis water relations nutrient uptake and oxidative damage morphological and growth parameters and achene yield and oil quality has been discussed critically based on the discussion on the impact of drought stress various management strategies such as breeding for drought tolerance conventional or biotechnological exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants seed treatment and soil nutrient management has been reviewed and discussed it is concluded from discussion that sunflower responds to water stress by osmotic adjustments turgor maintenance carbon assimilation maintenance and hormonal regulations a comprehensive research on integration of different management options including agronomic management conventional breeding and modern biotechnological advances is needed for the sustainable improvement of sunflower achene yield and oil quality under drought stress this may also contribute significantly under a climate change scenario keywords achene and oil yield physiology biochemistry genetics agronomy sustainable water management 1 introduction sunflower helianthus annuus l is an annual oilseed crop globally cultivated on 24 77 million hectares with a production of 44 31 million metric tons and it has 8 share in world oilseed market usda 2016 sunflower contains 40 50 oil and 17 20 protein thus have a fair potential to narrow the gap between production and consumption of edible oil and animal feed in the world actually it is a crop of tropical and subtropical regions with semi arid to arid climate and frequently grown in dry lands or on supplementary irrigation therefore the crop is affected by ambient environmental conditions like heat and drought pekcan et al 2015 robert et al 2016 however in a climate change scenario or and with the onset of early droughts the crop may be affected by drought stress debaeke et al 2017 in addition to the hiking problem of water stress the area devoted to irrigated food production systems is expected to decrease resulting in lesser food production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 farooq et al 2012 nonetheless expansion of irrigated land is not possible because of water competition among domestic industrial and agricultural users alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 severe water competition among different users will predominately change the irrigated lands to rain fed systems and ultimately crops have to suffer from periodic events of drought stress elliott et al 2014 hence all of agricultural crops and even the moderately drought tolerant crops such as sunflower will be badly affected by drought stress severe drought events have been recorded in asia and beyond including the countries with arid and semiarid climates during the last decades miyan 2015 farooq et al 2012 2014 which made management of drought stress more challenging although sunflower is moderately drought tolerant crop due to drought escape behavior it is highly sensitive to drought and heat stresses from early flowering to achene filling due to inefficiency in regulating the leaf expansion and transpiration rates under inadequate availability of soil moisture garcía lópez et al 2014 the decline in soil moisture leads to leaf wilting which results in substantial yield reduction in semi arid areas receiving the low rainfall aboudrare et al 2006 several reports indicate that drought stress significantly reduces sunflower achene yield oil yield and oil quality globally soleimanzadeh et al 2010 babaeian et al 2011 oraki and aghaalikhana 2012 ibrahim et al 2016 however the effects of drought stress on sunflower productivity are not same for all the growth stages exposure to drought at some specific phenophases like germination anthesis and achene filling etc is the most critical factor causing up to 50 yield reduction in sunflower kalarani et al 2004 hussain et al 2008 early season drought stress suppresses germination stem elongation and leaf area fulda et al 2011 fatemi 2014 while drought stress at anthesis results in the formation of empty achene production due to pollen infertility lyakh and totsky 2014 totsky and lyakh 2015 more available water at initial growth stages results in good vegetative growth but the subsequent low moisture availability at flowering and grain filling stages significantly reduces the yield due to high transpiration demands aboudrare et al 2006 sophisticated approaches are needed to sustain the productivity of existing crops and meet the challenge of food security in the area of global climate change increasing population pressure and decreasing resources being a rich source of edible oil and protein sunflower can play a vital role in evading the production gap of edible oil and protein in the world however effective use of available germplasm and technology needs to be well explored for sustaining the sunflower productivity under increasing risk of water scarcity although many individual efforts have been made to assess the effects of drought stress on sunflower yield and oil quality gholamhoseini et al 2013 manivannan et al 2015 determine the role of different management options to mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress and explore the physiological baloğlu et al 2012 ghobadi et al 2013 biochemical and molecular responses bowsher et al 2016 of the crop to drought stress however no comprehensive review interlinking all aspects is available in this article effects of drought stress on growth phenology light harvesting assimilate partitioning nutrient and water relations achene oil yield and oil quality of sunflower have been discussed management and crop improvement options for drought tolerance in sunflower are also described 2 physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress the crop plants respond to drought stress through changes in biochemical and physiological cascades that range from photosynthesis to metabolic processes plants exhibit various responses at the onset of drought stress which vary from whole plant to cellular and molecular level some major physiological and biochemical responses of sunflower to drought stress are described in the following sections 2 1 photosynthesis photosynthesis is one of the key metabolic pathways responsible for growth and development with the help of carbon fixation and light harvesting by plant leaves photosynthetic efficiency of plant species depends not only on their genetic potential to absorb light energy and utilize it for the production of carbohydrates but is also influenced by the environmental stresses andrianasolo et al 2016 it has long been known that instead of being a c3 plant sunflower has a high photosynthetic potential similar to c4 plant maize i e 25 32 μmol co2 fixed m 2 s 1 of leaf fock et al 1979 potter and breen 1980 the high photosynthetic potential of sunflower is due to the presence of stomata on both sides of the leaf which results in more tissue permeability for co2 diffusion and high rubisco activity ghobadi et al 2013 killi et al 2017 the process of photosynthesis in sunflower under drought stress is affected by two distinct mechanisms i through decreased co2 diffusion within the leaf due to closure of stomata and ii through the inhibition of metabolism of co2 tezara et al 1999 growth and productivity of sunflower is strongly affected under moisture deficit conditions due to low photosynthesis rate resulting due to stomatal closure thus restricting co2 diffusion into the leaves flexas et al 2004 rubp has a significant role in photosynthesis and is key to dark reaction the capacity of carboxylation and rubp regeneration decreases in severely stressed intact leaves galmés et al 2013 but in drought tolerant genotypes its content increases in response to prolonged drought pankovic et al 1999 which indicate more rubp generation as a sign of drought tolerance the stomatal conductance and the assimilation of co2 in sunflower leaves reduces with an enhancement in the drought intensity correia et al 2005 iqbal et al 2009 ghobadi et al 2013 nonetheless a genotypic variability exists for reduction in stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation in response to drought stress andrianasolo et al 2016 iqbal et al 2009 in a study tezara et al 2002 found an increase in net co2 assimilation rate in sunflower seedlings due to elevated co2 level with a simultaneous reduction in rubisco contents however the activity of rubisco was enhanced thus we can conclude that the elevated co2 increases the efficiency of rubisco even under water stress in a study ghobadi et al 2013 found that drought stress negatively affected the photosynthesis stay green photosystem ii photochemical efficiency and stomatal conductance and observed variation in genotypic response for aforementioned traits in another study kulundžić et al 2016 found that the photosynthetic efficiency was decreased in different sunflower genotypes under drought stress cechin et al 2015 also found that drought reduced the stomatal conductance which ultimately reduced the concentration of intercellular co2 and photosynthesis drought stress reduces photosynthesis in sunflower through stomatal closure and reduced co2 fixation stomatal closure mediated restricted co2 diffusion in the leaves is more dominating in sunflower compared to co2 assimilation elevated co2 level can compensate the drought induced photosynthetic damage under drought stress 2 2 water relations sunflower possesses stronger ability to use the available soil water due to strong tap root system drought stress affects the sunflower growth and productivity mainly by decreasing the water potential cell division expansion owing to loss of turgor leaf relative water contents as well as the water potential and its components viz turgor potential ψ t and osmotic potential ψ o correia et al 2006 kiani et al 2007a drought stress decreases the water potential in sunflower ghobadi et al 2013 for example various studies have reported a leaf water potential of 0 48 to 1 74 mpa in sunflower under diverse environmental conditions prasad et al 1985 rachidi et al 1993 however it can drop below 3 0 mpa under drought stress wise et al 1990 in a study sunflower lines differing in height responded differently to moisture deficits dwarf sunflower lines were more tolerant than the taller ones and maintained the high tissue water status under drought stress resulting in less yield reduction angadi and entz 2002b various sunflower cultivars exhibit different behavior with respect to plant water relations for example under water deficit conditions the genotype i e r1 genotype tolerant to drought maintained a high leaf water potential and wilted faster than those of a drought sensitive genotype ouvrard et al 1996 similarly hussain et al 2016 also observed that drought significantly decreased the water relations of sunflower hybrids having different ability of drought tolerance indeed drought stress results in an inadequate water transport from xylem which limits the sufficient nutrient supply from phloem ruehr et al 2009 however sunflower genotypes maintaining the higher water potential under drought stress maintain an adequate supply of water from xylem which ultimately maintain an adequate nutrient supply from phloem and thus maintain the water potential levels hussain et al 2016 which are supportive to plant growth under drought stress likewise the genotypes maintaining higher water potential extract the water from the deeper layers of soil which delays the osmotic adjustments angadi and entz 2002a terzi and kadioglu 2006 water potential is considered as a reliable indicator of plants response to water stress and genotypes differ for water potential due to differential ability to absorb water from soil and decrease the water loss through stomata which maintain the turgor pressure siddique et al 2000 terzi and kadioglu 2006 bayoumi et al 2008 in summary drought stress decreases the water supply to xylem which decreases an adequate nutrient supply to phloem thus resulting in the lower water potential however a huge variability exists among different genotypes for the maintenance of water potential mainly due to the ability of water absorption and root system however the adaptive responses of leaf water parameters to drought stress are variable in sunflower genotypes and needs to be investigated at molecular level in future studies 2 3 nutrient uptake drought stress decreases transpiration rates and impairs active transport and membrane permeability which collectively result in reduced absorbing power of crop plants kramer and boyer 1995 thus the nutrient transport from root to shoot is restricted due to weak absorbing power of the crop plants under drought stress nitrogen is the most required element by crop plants and constitute several plant components including amino and nucleic acids soil n mineralization is reduced by drought stress which ultimately lowers n availability a decreased transpiration as a consequence of drought stress is the other factor which lowers n transport from roots to the shoots tanguilig et al 1987 the p uptake is hampered under moisture deficit conditions pinkerton and simpson 1986 the primary reason of reduced p uptake is restricted translocation of p to shoots even under mild drought stress resnik 1970 drought significantly reduces the mineral uptake and disturbs nutrient balances as well gunes et al 2008a however plant species and genotypes within species vary in their response to water deficit stress in this regard garg 2003 drought induced reduction in n and k uptake in two sunflower hybrids have been recently reported by hussain et al 2016 the n and k utilization under drought stress at different growth stages is influenced by number of factors including physiochemical characteristics of the soil duration and intensity of drought relative to phenology and the evolutionary history of the organism killingbeck 2004 silla and escudero 2006 the stomatal closure is hampered by lower k supply because of loss of epidermal cell turgidity rahbarian et al 2011 as stomatal closure needs back pressure exerted by fully turgid epidermal pavement cells whereas the k accumulation is responsible for the required pressure roelfsema and hedrich 2002 habibi 2013 canavar and kaptan 2014 evaluated the uptake of nutrients p k magnesium mg calcium ca iron fe zinc zn copper cu manganese mn and sodium na in three sunflower hybrids under drought stress and found negative effect of water stress on the uptake but genotypes differed in their response another study gunes et al 2008a investigated the uptake of p k sulfur s ca mg fe cu zn mn chloride cl molybdenum mo silicon si na vanadium v aluminum al strontium sr rubidium rb titanium ti chromium cr nickel ni bromine br and barium ba in twelve sunflower genotypes under drought stress drought stress reduced the uptake of all the aforementioned minerals in conclusion drought stress hampers mineral uptake in sunflower reduced mineralization due to low moisture availability and restricted translocation of minerals to shoots because of low transport are the primary mechanisms of reduced mineral uptake impaired active transport and membrane permeability are the other restrictions which lead to imbalanced nutrition in sunflower under drought stress the imbalances in nutrients ultimately have serious effects on various growth and developmental process 2 4 oxidative damage reactive oxygen species ros are free radicals of oxygen which are continuously produced in plants even under normal condition as they play an important role in cell signaling however overproduction of ros leads towards the oxidative stress the major ros in plant system includes singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh among which oh is the most reactive species impa et al 2012 and these are highly toxic to plant physiological and biochemical processes el shabrawi et al 2010 drought stress causes an overproduction of different ros species cechin et al 2015 which may damage most of the cellular components drought stress stimulates the ros production in sunflower soleimanzadeh 2012 and the superoxide radicals are the most dominant ros produced in sunflower water deficit leads to shrinkage in cell volume which makes the cellular contents more viscous ultimately resulting in denaturation and aggregation of proteins hoekstra et al 2001 this phenomenon results in abnormal functioning of enzymes involved in photosynthesis the partial stomatal closure in response to water deficit limits co2 entry and its availability for photosynthesis this limitation results in reduced carboxylation efficiency of rubisco which increases oxygenation thus increasing the photo respiratory losses and ros production noctor et al 2002 furthermore reduced co2 fixation of photosynthesis decrease regeneration of nadp which is final electron acceptor of electron transport chain in chloroplast hence over reduction of electron transport chain results in leakage of electron to o2 and subsequent production of ros smirnoff 1993 sgherri et al 1996 in a study drought stress enhanced the production of ros especially h2o2 and leaf malaonaldehyde mda contents in sunflower with a simultaneous reduction in the activity of catalase gunes et al 2008a it is concluded that drought stress leads to production of ros in sunflower which react with proteins lipids and dna resulting in an ineffective antioxidant enzyme defense system 3 morphological physiological and yield responses in order to manage the drought stress at morphological and or physiological level it is necessary to understand its effects on morphology and physiology of crop plants sunflower is moderately drought tolerant crop due to its long and deep root system hussain et al 2013a which enables it to extract water from deeper soil layers however if drought stress prolongs it poses significant negative effect to sunflower from early stand establishment to maturity and ultimately on yield and oil characteristics andrianasolo et al 2014 flagella et al 2002 the effects of drought stress on different growth stages and morphological and physiological traits of sunflower are discussed in the following sections 3 1 germination and early stand establishment germination is the most critical phase in the ontogeny of crop plants the first effect of early season drought is impaired and erratic germination causing poor crop stand farooq et al 2012 seed germination is a complex process affected by a number of factors where moisture availability is the most critical luan et al 2014 drought delays the germination onset el midaoui et al 2001 with substantial decrease in the actual germination in sunflower sajjan et al 1999 ample soil moisture is required to initiate the germination process imbibition by seeds is the first step which depends on the water potential gradient between seed and soil any decrease in soil water potential causes linear decline in seed germination wen 2015 sunflower crop is frequently sown on beds and ridges with poor moisture conditions and lack of rainfall at this stage may result in erratic germination and seedling emergence angadi and entz 2002b mwale et al 2003 kaya et al 2006 in arid climates where supplementary irrigation is not available several studies have reported that drought stress in sunflower negatively influenced seed germination of sunflower sajjan et al 1999 smok et al 1993 el midaoui et al 2001 which was indicated through an increase in mean germination time owning to drought stress in summary seed imbibition is the first step in the germination process however the soil moisture deficit at this stage restricts the seed to uptake required amount of moisture resulting in poor erratic and non uniform seed germination and crop stand 3 2 plant growth and development drought stress is multidimensional in nature and affects plants at every organizational level plant growth is an important phenomenon that is regulated by several morphological and physiological factors drought stress after germination has systematic effect on growth with reduction of water potential relative water contents ünyayar et al 2004 and turgor of plant cells benlloch gonzález et al 2015 which elevate the concentration of solutes in cytosol these changes decrease cell elongation thus leading to growth inhibition lisar et al 2012 growth inhibition is followed by less carbon assimilation imbalanced mineral nutrition and accumulation of abscisic acid aba which cause wilting of plants farooq et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 the negative effects of drought stress on mineral nutrition and metabolism result in reduction of leaf area and disruption of assimilate partitioning considerable reduction in leaf area and associated morphological and physiological traits in sunflower lines under drought stress has been reported which varied with different cultivars fernández moroni et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 drought stress hampers numerous growth and development traits such as root volume rv total root length trl stem dry weight sdw total dry matter tdm chlorophyll contents plant height stem diameter leaf dry weight leaf area index lai crop growth rate cgr net assimilation rate nar and carotenoids table 1 it has long been known that drought stress impedes morphological traits like plant height stem diameter number of leaves etc in sunflower pirjol sovulescu et al 1974 sadras et al 1993 hussain et al 2010 drought stress at vegetative stage reduces main stem height stem diameter number of nodes or leaves per plant and leaf area turhan and baser 2004 whereas an increase in root length at the expense of above ground dry matter occurs resulting in higher root to shoot ratio javaid et al 2015 drought stress results in reduced leaf area yellowing and falling of leaves göksoy et al 2004 nezami et al 2008 and ultimately small plant canopy area which reduces the radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic activities resulting in low achene yield germ et al 2005 ghobadi et al 2013 a common adverse effect of drought stress on crop plants is reduction in fresh and dry biomass production due to decreased leaf area followed by less production of photosynthates farooq et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 reduction in biomass production under drought stress had been observed in numerous studies conducted on sunflower tahir and mehdi 2001 fatemi 2014 cechin et al 2015 santonoceto et al 2002 studied the accumulation dynamics of dry matter oil and major fatty acids in different genotypes of sunflower under water stress 100 67 33 and 0 deficit water of evapotranspiration and reported less evapotranspiration by closure of stomata reduced carbon assimilation pollen infertility and decrease biomass production due to water stress even with supplementary irrigation crop can face water stress and responds with low biomass production if irrigation is missed at critical growth stages of the crop buriro et al 2015 and alahdadi and oraki 2011 reported that skipping irrigation either at flowering or grain filling proved most lethal for the crop yield and biomass production in another experiment conducted by vijay 2004 to identify the most sensitive growth stage of sunflower to limited water supply flowering stage was observed as the most critical yield affecting stage in two other studies göksoy et al 2004 and demir et al 2006 reported that sunflower should be irrigated at least three times with full or limited irrigation i e at heading flowering and milking to obtain the highest achene and oil yields they also suggested that in case of limited water availability irrigation must not be skipped at flowering different levels of drought stress i e mild moderate and severe drought stress results in reduced growth and developmental traits depending upon the growth stage where the drought stress happens mild and severe drought stress imposed either at vegetative reproductive stage or whole season reduced total root length to 5 97 and 36 54 respectively table 1 similarly total dry matter was reduced to 11 70 65 61 and 45 54 in response to mild moderate and severe drought stress imposed at different growth stages of sunflower table 1 it is evident that all the intensities of drought stress significantly reduce the growth and development of sunflower compared to well watered conditions in conclusion drought stress affects all the growth and developmental traits of different sunflower cultivars drought stress results in reduced leaf area yellowing and falling of leaves and ultimately the small plant canopy area which reduces the radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic activities these processes result in weaker plant growth and development under water stress 3 3 achene yield crop yield is a complex trait which is influenced by genotype environmental factors and management practices sunflower achene yield is significantly reduced by drought stress faced by the plants either at vegetative or reproductive flowering and milking growth stages göksoy et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 hussain et al 2015 the intensity of yield reduction in response to drought stress depends on growth stage of the crop severity of the drought and the drought tolerance ability of genotypes flower initiation and anthesis are important growth phases which determine the achene yield since higher number of fertile flowers and florets result in higher achene yield göksoy et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 hussain et al 2015 drought stress at this stage is critical as it is coupled with high temperature which leads to pollen infertility low head diameter and reduced yield behrouzyar et al 2007 göksoy et al 2004 elsheikh et al 2015 benlloch gonzález et al 2015 different yield components such as head diameter capitulum diameter number of achenes per capitulum achene weight per capitulum and 1000 achene are significantly hampered by drought stress table 2 khan et al 2000 concluded that yield and yield components showed decreasing trend with increasing severity of drought stress irrigation reduced from 100 to 25 of field capacity they further concluded that achene yield reduced with increasing drought stress due to reduction in head diameter numbers of achenes per head and 1000 achene weight significant reduction in growth and grain yield of sunflower have also been reported with increasing intensity of drought stress oad et al 2002 kakar and soomro 2001 although limited water availability during early developmental stages of sunflower severely reduced the achene yield drought at reproductive stages is the most devastating reddy et al 1998 reddy et al 2003 göksoy et al 2004 vijay 2004 hussain et al 2008 nazarli et al 2010 garcía lópez et al 2014 jabari et al 2007 reported 83 reduction in seed yield of sunflower under drought stress at flowering due to reduction in number of achene per head and 1000 achene weight hussain et al 2009a b reported that drought stress either at budding or flowering stage had negative effects on achene yield drought stress at flowering stage causes pollen sterility resulting in less number of achenes per head with lighter weight which severely reduce achene yield unger 1990 hussain et al 2008 yield reduction in sunflower has been reported with different extent under drought stress imposed either at vegetative or reproductive stages with mild and or severe intensities of imposed drought table 3 it is depicted from the table that the achene yield is reduced depending upon the severity of drought stress and the critical crop growth stage at which it occur it is concluded that drought stress at different growth stages hampers yield components which ultimately lead towards lower achene yield in sunflower the yield reduction is the result of disturbed physiological and morphological attributes which ultimately affects the yield contributing traits of the sunflower resulting in lower achene yield under drought stress 3 4 oil yield and quality sunflower oil is considered high quality edible oil due to low content of palmitic and stearic acid and saturated fatty acids with elevated concentration up to 90 of unsaturated fatty acids predominately linoleic acid rodriguez et al 2002 the oil with more density of unsaturated fatty acids e g linoleic acid is essential as human body cannot synthesize these fatty acids eslami 2015 hence the sunflower oil is as a better quality edible oil due to its fatty acid composition flagella et al 2002 thus releasing the genotypes with much higher concentration of oleic acid rather than linoleic acid is the major objective of breeding programs drought either at vegetative or reproductive stages causes a significant reduction in oil yield and quality of sunflower flagella et al 2002 hussain et al 2008 ali et al 2009 because of reduction in oil contents and achene yield fatty acids composition in sunflower is altered by drought stress particularly the amounts of oleic and linoleic acids are changed under drought stress at different growth stages baldini et al 2002 which change the oxidative properties flagella et al 2002 drought stress alters the fatty acid composition mainly oleic linoleic acid ratio of sunflower oil known as unsaturation ratio similarly the changes in linoleic acid are also caused by enzymatic processes governed by genes coding for oleoyl δ 9 desaturase and oleoyl δ 12 desaturase which are main enzymes utilized in metabolic processes related to oleic and linoleic acids respectively cantisan et al 2000 rondanini et al 2003 lacombe et al 2004 the up and down regulation of these genes under drought stress alters the oil composition of sunflower anastasi et al 2010 on the other hand drought stress accelerates earlier embryo development and stimulates enzymatic activities of fatty acid biosynthesis including oleoyl δ 12 desaturase which alters the composition of sunflower oil baldini et al 2002 the variation in oleic acid is highly dependent on the synthesis or activation of oleate desaturase enzyme which is affected by water supply roche et al 2006 baldini et al 2002 the activity of the enzyme is also affected by disturbed mineral nutrition under drought stress different genes govern the variation in unsaturated fatty acids in standard and oleic sunflower genotypes which are differentially affected by ambient environmental conditions lacombe and bervillé 2001 martinez rivas et al 2001 pérez vich et al 2002 schuppert et al 2006 the oil of sunflower cultivars grown for edible oil contains four essential fatty acids viz palmitic stearic oleic and linoleic acids monotti 2003 however no effect of drought stress on oil quality and contents was noted in some studies e g petcu et al 2001 which may be due to low intensity of stress and use of high oleic sunflower genotypes limited water supply from flowering to physiological maturity increases the oleic acid and decreases the linoleic acid contents compared with well watered plants as described above flagella et al 2000 drought stress decreases achene oil contents at the expense of protein contents reddy et al 2003 daneshian et al 2005 in most of the cases oil yield reduction is less than seed yield reduction which indicates increase in oil contents but severe drought at flowering and bud stage reduced oil yield more than seed yield which may be due to decrease in seed oil contents tables 3 and 4 so these two stages may be regarded as the most sensitive to drought stress sunflower oil yield and quality are severely hampered by drought stress mainly due to reduced activity of enzyme oleate desaturase however there are some reports where drought stress had no effect on the oil quality of sunflower which might be attributed to genetic potential of the genotypes used in the studies more studies are needed to check the influence of drought stress and its intensity on the oil yield and oil quality of diverse sunflower genotypes under an array of climatic conditions across the globe 4 management strategies in theory of evolution by darwin he describes survival of the fittest which means that fit individual survived and other diminished only those crops are successful under harsh environment which can withstand stress it is crucial for crop scientist to develop strategies which can make the crop plants fit for harsh environmental conditions under climate change scenario various management strategies have been opted by different scientist in different agro climatic regions to improve the sunflower performance under drought stress these strategies are discussed critically in the following section 4 1 breeding approaches 4 1 1 screening of drought tolerant germplasm and development of tolerant variety through breeding exploration of genetic variation is the primary step towards improvement of drought resistance of crops such variation exists in wild types and modified genotypes that have evolved under natural selection and considered as the finest source of resistance traits appraisal of these resources via an integrated phenotyping and genotyping method in field circumstances together with traits identification that are directly related with yield are important for improvements in drought resistance genetic variability must be expanded for developing successful drought tolerant lines as significant variations are present among sunflower cultivars to attain better yield under drought stress rauf 2008 a high degree of genetic variability in water status osmotic adjustments root characteristics gas exchange parameters seedling establishment and drought susceptibility index was observed within a large number of sunflower genotypes belonging to diverse origins table 5 hence improvements in these traits through selection from the available germplasm could possibly improve the drought tolerance of sunflower selection of leaf area index with net assimilation rate may be preferred over leaf area for selecting genotypes under drought stress hemmati and soleymani 2014 root system is another important trait related to drought stress tolerance generally deeper roots along with higher root to shoot ratio is an adaptive mechanism for drought tolerance and can be used in breeding program to develop drought tolerant sunflower genotypes gomes et al 2005 rauf and sadaqat 2008b yield associated traits like root length upper and lower root weight root diameter and seedling recovery after reliving the stressful environment are used as important criteria for breeding to develop drought tolerant sunflower genotypes rauf and sadaqat 2008a b numerous other potential traits are reported that could be used for screening of drought stress tolerance which are positively correlated with yield table 4 drought stress index dsi is calculated on the basis of a ratio between yield under drought stress to the yield under no stress conditions and is important for drought stress tolerance therefore this trait may also be useful for breeding of sunflower drought tolerant genotypes fereres et al 1986 baldini et al 1992 alza and fernandez martinez 1997 rauf and sadaqat 2007 morphological physiological ad biochemical responses of the plant to drought stress demonstrates its tolerance nature susceptible or tolerant but analyses of most of these traits is needed to be conducted by growing the crop for full growth season this not only become a time consuming but also required a lot of resources and techniques which are normally not available at all laboratories to manage this problem genes responsible for such traits are identified and closely linked markers are developed with the help of these markers plants can be identified for stress tolerant traits at early stages of development with very less resources which saves time and money furthermore introgression of traits in succeeding generations has also been verified with same markers successful screening of sunflower genotypes for drought stress tolerance has been reported adiredjo et al 2014a ghaffari et al 2013 sarazin et al 2017 as most of the morphological and physiological traits associated with drought stress tolerance are negatively correlated dsi seems the most suitable traits describing the relative overall performance evolution of drought tolerant sunflower varieties hybrids through breeding programs is highly important to boost up the global sunflower production under water limited environments rauf and sadaqat 2007 different studies have used numerous traits such as stomatal conductance osmotic adjustment shoot and root length photosynthetic rate leaf area index malondialdehyde contents seedling traits harvest index drought susceptibility index root system leaf hydraulics chlorophyll fluorescence canopy temperature stem diameter and number of achenes per capitulum for selection of drought tolerance in sunflower table 5 the use of these traits is reported to improve the drought tolerance of sunflower to significant extent 4 1 2 introgression from wild relatives the genus helianthus has 51 species and 19 subspecies with 14 annual and 37 perennial species seiler 2007 wild species of sunflower may have some genes related to water stress tolerance which can be exploited by specific hybridization therefore induction of drought tolerant genes from the wild relatives in locally planted sunflower varieties hybrids may help to develop drought tolerant sunflower varieties hybrids mohan and seetharam 2005 sunflower has been ranked 5th out of 13 most important crops surveyed from 1980 s to 2005 which could be improved through introgression from wild relatives seiler et al 2017 it is reported that all helianthus species except helianthus agrestis p can be used to introgress traits with conventional back cross method helianthus argophyllus and helianthus anomalus wild species have been extensively used by sunflower breeders to introgress drought tolerant traits like higher water use efficiency improved drought sensitivity index and a high harvest index under water stress to the cultivated genotypes baldini and vannozzi 1998 baldini et al 1999 griveau et al 1998 seiler 2007 wild species gene introgression also upgrades the fatty acid composition and protein quality and tolerance to nutrient stress korrell et al 1996 brouillette and donovan 2011 seiler et al 2010 reported two sunflower cultivars ha 429 and ha 430 introgressed for salt and water stress tolerance traits from wild relatives but in some cases introgression of drought tolerant genes from many wild species has also been associated with the degradation of oil yield in cultivated sunflower seiler 2007 which must be rectified through successive back cross breeding it is concluded that selection and conventional breeding approaches are feasible tools which can be used for developing drought tolerant sunflower cultivars however too few works have been conducted to realize the potential of these approaches conventional approaches must be accompanied with molecular techniques to fasten the process of selection and development of genotypes furthermore wild relatives may also be used more extensively to enhance the genetic variability of available germplasm for drought stress tolerance 4 1 3 identification of quantitative trait loci qtls for water use efficiency water use efficiency is the measure of ability of a crop to convert water into plant biomass in a study canavar et al 2014 reported that the selection for water use efficiency using the indirect δ13c isotope can be a useful tool in sunflower breeding programs aimed at developing the drought tolerant sunflower genotypes the identification of quantitative trait loci qtl controlling the water use efficiency might also be beneficial for improving sunflower performance under drought stress for example adiredjo et al 2014a identified nine qtl controlling the water use efficiency in sunflower under drought stress another single qtl for phenotypic response controlling the water use efficiency was also identified in recent years use of leaf carbon isotope discrimination has been emerged as an indirect tool for breeding for water use efficiency in multiple crops for example adiredjo et al 2014b studied the genetic variability in four sunflower genotypes for assessing the phenotypic correlations between the leaf carbon isotope discrimination and water use efficiency they measured water use efficiency at leaf level and whole plant level they observed significant differences among the four sunflower genotypes for water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope discrimination at leaf level and whole plant level there existed a strong negative co relation between whole plant leaf level water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope discrimination with a decrease in water availability they suggested leaf carbon isotope discrimination as a pertinent and valuable trait to select the sunflower genotypes with high water use efficiency under drought stress adiredjo et al 2014b 4 2 biotechnology and functional genomics biotechnology and functional genomics of environmental stresses like drought heat and salinity has a prodigious contribution to a better understanding of plant adaptation to adverse environmental conditions drought tolerance is a multi genic traits as it is a combination of many traits which make ecological adaption of a plant to drought stress research on functional genomics has provided genetic basis of most of these traits gene products involved in the adaptation of plants to drought stress can be classified in to i directly involved in stress tolerance includes dehydrins and chaperons that protect cellular structure during stress enzymes for osmolytes synthesis that regulate cellular and tissue processes and detoxifying enzymes which detoxify the products produced due to stress or ii indirectly involved through regulation of others genes includes transcription factors which regulate the expression of directly involved genes kasuga et al 1999 roche et al 2007 reported differential expression of genes in drought tolerant and sensitive cultivars which might be associated with the expression of mrna in different environments giordani et al 2011 which is regulated with indirectly involved genes giordani et al 2011 reported that these changes in the expression of mrna can only be studied by using genomic dna of purely homozygous plants it was further reported the changes in the expression of genes were related to sequences variability in stress responsive genes the sequence variability is observed more for directly involved genes compared to indirectly involved genes therefore it can be extracted from the discussion that directly involve genes are more likely to be regulated with external harsh environment it is therefore concluded that along with dna markers these mirnas and cdna markers may also be utilized in developing sunflower cultivars exhibiting higher drought tolerance 4 3 agronomic approaches 4 3 1 exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants exogenous applications of phytohormones and osmoprotectants may help alleviating drought stress in sunflower hussain et al 2008 2009a b babaeian et al 2011 rabert et al 2014 exogenous application of different synthetic compounds such as abscisic acid potassium chloride foliar or root application of salicylic acid and ascorbic acid calcium chloride sodium nitroprusside as donor of nitric oxide triazole compounds and glycinebetaine significantly improved the growth development biochemical attributes yield and yield related traits including morphological physiological and biochemical traits table 6 for instance exogenous application of glycine betaine gb and salicylic acid sa significantly improved the achene and oil yield of sunflower subjected to drought stress at vegetative and reproductive phase hussain et al 2008 2009a b zaidi et al 2015 reported that foliar application of sa significantly improved the proline sugars and proteins in drought stressed sunflower indicating that exogenous sa application plays an important role in drought tolerance significant improvements in antioxidant enzymes and biochemical traits of drought stressed sunflower have been reported by 28 homobrassinolide application filová 2014 abscisic acid aba application at budding or flowering helped in mitigating the detrimental effects of drought stress and produced better yields compared to no application treatments hussain et al 2014 aba application also have been reported to regulate some stress responsive genes and proteins in sunflower under drought stress shinozaki and yamaguchi shinozaki 2007 for instance haacco2 transcript is accrued in leaves and exogenous aba application induces this gene in sunflower in response to drought stress boursiac et al 2013 nitric oxide no is lipophilic in nature and highly diffusible through cellular membrane and involved in many physiological biochemical and developmental processes in plants krasylenko et al 2010 cechin et al 2015 cechin et al 2015 reported that application of 10 μm sodium nitroprusside snp a no donor significantly improved the concentration of ros scavenging enzymes which significantly imparted drought tolerance to sunflower partial amelioration of adverse effects of drought stress in sunflower has been observed through the application of triazole compounds such as hexaconazole tebuconazole and propiconazole rabert et al 2014 2016 which have been reported to strengthen the antioxidant defense system of sunflower through increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as sod apx and cat it is concluded that exogenous application of osmoprotectants phytohormones micro and macro nutrients and several other compounds have been proved effective to improve sunflower growth yield and oil quality under drought stress therefore proper crop nutrition is an agronomic tool which can be employed to improve drought resistance of sunflower 4 3 2 use of mineral nutrients and organic manures drought stress hampers the transport of nutrients towards roots thus affecting the cell division and expansion of roots which might be due to reduced transpiration rate limited water supply affects the uptake of essential elements however an adequate nutrition of plants under water deficit may improve the performance of crops nitrogen n and potassium k are primary macronutrients required by plants in large amounts and govern several developmental processes such as photosynthesis translocation of photosynthates from roots to shoots protein synthesis stomatal closure water use efficiency and regulation of enzymes salami and saadat 2013 the application of these nutrients enhance the tolerance against drought stress by improving protein synthesis stomatal regulation homeostasis and osmoregulation through quenching the ros cakmak 2005 under drought stress the role of n role in improving growth and plant water relations is well established saneoka et al 2004 likewise improved k nutrition results in improved water uptake maintains plant turgor and regulates stomatal aperture bukhsh et al 2012 recently hussain et al 2016 has reported that combined application of n and k improves drought resistance of sunflower by improving turgor maintenance enhanced accumulation of osmoprotectants increased stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis reduced production of ros ultimately ending with higher yield different potassium k levels in soil have considerable role in growth regulation and water uptake ability of sunflower it is well known fact that k deficiency lowers plant resistance to drought stress marschner 1995 through stomatal closure and thus lowers the transpiration rates hsiao and lauchli 1986 however some authors also reported that moderate k starvation may cause anomalous stomatal behavior and has a positive effect on transpiration in some crops like wheat and sunflower brag 1972 lindhauer 1985 fournier et al 2005 reported that moderate k deficiency promotes water uptake and reduces wue in sunflower compare to well watered plants aba regulation in k deficiency plants possibly prevents stomatal closure increasing water uptake and transpiration moreover the enhanced uptake in k starved plants might be attributed to the increase transpiration rate which forced the plant to extract more water from soil to maintain a water balance application of micronutrients also improves the performance of sunflower under drought stress zafar et al 2014 babaeian et al 2011 rahimizadeh et al 2007 shehzad et al 2016 by improving the antioxidant defense stay green achenes weight achene yield biological yield and oil yield a 48 89 improvement in the production of antioxidant enzymes sod cat and gpx with fe zn cu mn application have been recorded in sunflower which indicates the significance of micronutrient application for improving the drought resistance of sunflower rahimizadeh et al 2007 babaeian et al 2011 significant improvements in physiological traits of drought stressed sunflower through zn and cacl2 application have also been reported zafar et al 2014 recently ibrahim et al 2016 reported positive effects of cacl2 foliar application on leaf relative water contents leaf pigments such as chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids anthocyanins carotenoids leaf minerals n p k and ca organic osmolytes proline and soluble sugars and phenolic related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal and peroxidase pod in sunflower under drought stress silicon application is also useful to reduce the drought induce yield losses in oilseed crops including sunflower in a study silicon application under drought stress improved the k sulphur magnesium iron copper manganese whereas the uptake of zinc remained unaffected gunes et al 2008b in another study gunes et al 2008b reported that exogenous application of silicon reduced leaf mda and enhanced the relative water contents and the activities of enzymatic e g catalase and non enzymatic antioxidant defense systems in sunflower gunes et al 2008a in a study on canola crop the exogenous application of silicon increased the root shoot dry weight net assimilation rate relative water contents co2 absorbance root amino acid contents root water uptake root proliferation and the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase habibi 2014 organic manures are other viable option which improve drought tolerance when applied alone or in combination with synthetic fertilizers esmaeilian et al 2012 these manures are beneficial source of major nutrients and affect the temporal dynamics of nutrient availability through improving soil physico chemical properties paul and beauchamp 1993 significant improvement in drought tolerance was obtained when organic manure was applied to drought stressed sunflower either alone or in combination with synthetic fertilizers aowad and mohamed 2009 similarly organic manures both alone and in combination improved the nutrient uptake of sunflower under drought stress which ultimately improved yield esmaeilian et al 2012 4 3 3 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and polymers the symbiotic relationship between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is also an important strategy to improve mineral nutrition under abiotic stresses in plants brachmann and parniske 2006 indeed the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi provides the surface area to plant roots to absorb water and nutrients e g p n zn cu smith and read 2008 in a study use of two species i e glumus mossea and glumus etanicatum of mycorrhiza improved the seed yield and seed nutrient contents in sunflower glumus etanicatum being more beneficial for improvement in seed yield and nutrient content of sunflower heidari and karami 2014 however further studies are also needed to study the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for improving the performance of sunflower under drought stress under diverse environmental conditions another way of improving the water use efficiency and achene yield of sunflower under drought stress is the use of super absorbent under arid and semi arid climates it has been reported that super absorbent polymers can hold 400 1500 g of water per dry gram of hydro gel boman and evans 1991 thus increasing the water absorption and retention under drought stress in a study super absorbent polymer application at 2 25 3 g kg of soil improved the water use efficiency under drought stress nazarli et al 2010 in conclusion drought stress imbalances mineral nutrition while use of macro and micro nutrients organic manures arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and polymers could possibly improve drought tolerance of sunflower through maintenance of nutrient balances 4 3 4 seed priming seed priming is a technique by which seeds are partially hydrated to a point where germination related metabolic processes begin but radicle is not emerged different seed priming techniques hydropriming salt priming on farm priming and chemical priming have been largely used for improving germination and crop establishment seed priming especially by osmopriming with kno3 and hydropriming improved the germination and stand establishment in sunflower crop both under stress salt and drought and normal conditions kaya et al 2006 hussain et al 2006 moghanibashi et al 2012 also reported that hydropriming of sunflower seeds improved the germination percentage germination index root shoot length and root shoot dry weight of sunflower under drought stress in another study hydropriming of sunflower seeds improved the germination percentage mean emergence time and seedling dry weight of two sunflower genotypes viz azargol and hysun 36 sheidaie et al 2013 kausar et al 2009 also found an improvement in seed vigour due to seed priming biological priming of seeds is a developing technique which imparts tolerance to plants against various types of biotic and abiotic stresses singh et al 2015 significant improvements in drought tolerance of sunflower with biologically primed seeds with azotobacter chroococcum bacillus polymyxa alone or in combination have been reported singh et al 2015 both growth promoting bacteria significantly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes thus ameliorated the adverse effects of drought stress in sunflower gholamhoseini et al 2013 found that inoculation of sunflower plants with two mycorrhizal fungi species viz glomus mosseae and g hoi improved the biomass achene and seed yield in sunflower than non inoculated plants it is concluded that seed priming either chemical or biological may help to improve the performance of drought stressed sunflower therefore seed priming can be used to ameliorate the negative effects of drought stress on germination growth and yield of sunflower to significant extent 5 conclusion and future directions drought stress affects the sunflower crop through its negative influence on seed germination seedling growth plant water relations mineral nutrition stay green photosynthesis transpiration and grain partitioning thus affecting the seed yield and oil quality however various management practices including breeding for drought tolerance conventional or biotechnological exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants seed treatment and soil nutrient management might be useful for improving drought tolerance in sunflower the rna mediated silencing and dna methylation processes of specific genes are recent options explored in the developing era of functional genomics for improving abiotic stress tolerance in plants which can be successfully used for improving drought tolerance in sunflower several physiological parameters such as improved stomatal conductance shoot and root dry weight harvest index root system leaf hydraulics and stay green are important physiological traits which needs to be considered when screening sunflower genotypes for breeding programs aimed on drought stress tolerance for improving the water use efficiency of sunflower under drought stress use of leaf carbon isotope discrimination technique identification of qtls responsible for efficient water use under drought stress and application of super absorbent might be quite beneficial a comprehensive research on integration of different management options including agronomic approaches conventional breeding and modern biotechnological advances is needed for the sustainable improvement of sunflower achene yield and oil quality under drought stress 
11537,drought is the most important crop production limiting factor in the changing climate scenario and its intensity is predicted to increase in future sunflower is an important oilseed crop having 8 share in the world oilseed production although it is a moderately drought tolerant crop severe drought causes reduction in the seed and oil production therefore to ensure sustainable sunflower achene and oil production it is very important to understand the relationship among the physiological biochemical genetic and agronomic basis of drought for its sustainable management impact of drought stress on various aspects of sunflower has been reported earlier but there is not a single study describing the physiological biochemical and genetic basis of drought in sunflower at molecular and crop level in this review manuscript influence of drought on sunflower achene yield and oil quality has been analyzed critically at both cell plant and crop level and the possible management options to mitigate the severity of the drought stress are proposed available literature describing the impact of drought stress on physiological and biochemical aspects like photosynthesis water relations nutrient uptake and oxidative damage morphological and growth parameters and achene yield and oil quality has been discussed critically based on the discussion on the impact of drought stress various management strategies such as breeding for drought tolerance conventional or biotechnological exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants seed treatment and soil nutrient management has been reviewed and discussed it is concluded from discussion that sunflower responds to water stress by osmotic adjustments turgor maintenance carbon assimilation maintenance and hormonal regulations a comprehensive research on integration of different management options including agronomic management conventional breeding and modern biotechnological advances is needed for the sustainable improvement of sunflower achene yield and oil quality under drought stress this may also contribute significantly under a climate change scenario keywords achene and oil yield physiology biochemistry genetics agronomy sustainable water management 1 introduction sunflower helianthus annuus l is an annual oilseed crop globally cultivated on 24 77 million hectares with a production of 44 31 million metric tons and it has 8 share in world oilseed market usda 2016 sunflower contains 40 50 oil and 17 20 protein thus have a fair potential to narrow the gap between production and consumption of edible oil and animal feed in the world actually it is a crop of tropical and subtropical regions with semi arid to arid climate and frequently grown in dry lands or on supplementary irrigation therefore the crop is affected by ambient environmental conditions like heat and drought pekcan et al 2015 robert et al 2016 however in a climate change scenario or and with the onset of early droughts the crop may be affected by drought stress debaeke et al 2017 in addition to the hiking problem of water stress the area devoted to irrigated food production systems is expected to decrease resulting in lesser food production alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 farooq et al 2012 nonetheless expansion of irrigated land is not possible because of water competition among domestic industrial and agricultural users alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 severe water competition among different users will predominately change the irrigated lands to rain fed systems and ultimately crops have to suffer from periodic events of drought stress elliott et al 2014 hence all of agricultural crops and even the moderately drought tolerant crops such as sunflower will be badly affected by drought stress severe drought events have been recorded in asia and beyond including the countries with arid and semiarid climates during the last decades miyan 2015 farooq et al 2012 2014 which made management of drought stress more challenging although sunflower is moderately drought tolerant crop due to drought escape behavior it is highly sensitive to drought and heat stresses from early flowering to achene filling due to inefficiency in regulating the leaf expansion and transpiration rates under inadequate availability of soil moisture garcía lópez et al 2014 the decline in soil moisture leads to leaf wilting which results in substantial yield reduction in semi arid areas receiving the low rainfall aboudrare et al 2006 several reports indicate that drought stress significantly reduces sunflower achene yield oil yield and oil quality globally soleimanzadeh et al 2010 babaeian et al 2011 oraki and aghaalikhana 2012 ibrahim et al 2016 however the effects of drought stress on sunflower productivity are not same for all the growth stages exposure to drought at some specific phenophases like germination anthesis and achene filling etc is the most critical factor causing up to 50 yield reduction in sunflower kalarani et al 2004 hussain et al 2008 early season drought stress suppresses germination stem elongation and leaf area fulda et al 2011 fatemi 2014 while drought stress at anthesis results in the formation of empty achene production due to pollen infertility lyakh and totsky 2014 totsky and lyakh 2015 more available water at initial growth stages results in good vegetative growth but the subsequent low moisture availability at flowering and grain filling stages significantly reduces the yield due to high transpiration demands aboudrare et al 2006 sophisticated approaches are needed to sustain the productivity of existing crops and meet the challenge of food security in the area of global climate change increasing population pressure and decreasing resources being a rich source of edible oil and protein sunflower can play a vital role in evading the production gap of edible oil and protein in the world however effective use of available germplasm and technology needs to be well explored for sustaining the sunflower productivity under increasing risk of water scarcity although many individual efforts have been made to assess the effects of drought stress on sunflower yield and oil quality gholamhoseini et al 2013 manivannan et al 2015 determine the role of different management options to mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress and explore the physiological baloğlu et al 2012 ghobadi et al 2013 biochemical and molecular responses bowsher et al 2016 of the crop to drought stress however no comprehensive review interlinking all aspects is available in this article effects of drought stress on growth phenology light harvesting assimilate partitioning nutrient and water relations achene oil yield and oil quality of sunflower have been discussed management and crop improvement options for drought tolerance in sunflower are also described 2 physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress the crop plants respond to drought stress through changes in biochemical and physiological cascades that range from photosynthesis to metabolic processes plants exhibit various responses at the onset of drought stress which vary from whole plant to cellular and molecular level some major physiological and biochemical responses of sunflower to drought stress are described in the following sections 2 1 photosynthesis photosynthesis is one of the key metabolic pathways responsible for growth and development with the help of carbon fixation and light harvesting by plant leaves photosynthetic efficiency of plant species depends not only on their genetic potential to absorb light energy and utilize it for the production of carbohydrates but is also influenced by the environmental stresses andrianasolo et al 2016 it has long been known that instead of being a c3 plant sunflower has a high photosynthetic potential similar to c4 plant maize i e 25 32 μmol co2 fixed m 2 s 1 of leaf fock et al 1979 potter and breen 1980 the high photosynthetic potential of sunflower is due to the presence of stomata on both sides of the leaf which results in more tissue permeability for co2 diffusion and high rubisco activity ghobadi et al 2013 killi et al 2017 the process of photosynthesis in sunflower under drought stress is affected by two distinct mechanisms i through decreased co2 diffusion within the leaf due to closure of stomata and ii through the inhibition of metabolism of co2 tezara et al 1999 growth and productivity of sunflower is strongly affected under moisture deficit conditions due to low photosynthesis rate resulting due to stomatal closure thus restricting co2 diffusion into the leaves flexas et al 2004 rubp has a significant role in photosynthesis and is key to dark reaction the capacity of carboxylation and rubp regeneration decreases in severely stressed intact leaves galmés et al 2013 but in drought tolerant genotypes its content increases in response to prolonged drought pankovic et al 1999 which indicate more rubp generation as a sign of drought tolerance the stomatal conductance and the assimilation of co2 in sunflower leaves reduces with an enhancement in the drought intensity correia et al 2005 iqbal et al 2009 ghobadi et al 2013 nonetheless a genotypic variability exists for reduction in stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation in response to drought stress andrianasolo et al 2016 iqbal et al 2009 in a study tezara et al 2002 found an increase in net co2 assimilation rate in sunflower seedlings due to elevated co2 level with a simultaneous reduction in rubisco contents however the activity of rubisco was enhanced thus we can conclude that the elevated co2 increases the efficiency of rubisco even under water stress in a study ghobadi et al 2013 found that drought stress negatively affected the photosynthesis stay green photosystem ii photochemical efficiency and stomatal conductance and observed variation in genotypic response for aforementioned traits in another study kulundžić et al 2016 found that the photosynthetic efficiency was decreased in different sunflower genotypes under drought stress cechin et al 2015 also found that drought reduced the stomatal conductance which ultimately reduced the concentration of intercellular co2 and photosynthesis drought stress reduces photosynthesis in sunflower through stomatal closure and reduced co2 fixation stomatal closure mediated restricted co2 diffusion in the leaves is more dominating in sunflower compared to co2 assimilation elevated co2 level can compensate the drought induced photosynthetic damage under drought stress 2 2 water relations sunflower possesses stronger ability to use the available soil water due to strong tap root system drought stress affects the sunflower growth and productivity mainly by decreasing the water potential cell division expansion owing to loss of turgor leaf relative water contents as well as the water potential and its components viz turgor potential ψ t and osmotic potential ψ o correia et al 2006 kiani et al 2007a drought stress decreases the water potential in sunflower ghobadi et al 2013 for example various studies have reported a leaf water potential of 0 48 to 1 74 mpa in sunflower under diverse environmental conditions prasad et al 1985 rachidi et al 1993 however it can drop below 3 0 mpa under drought stress wise et al 1990 in a study sunflower lines differing in height responded differently to moisture deficits dwarf sunflower lines were more tolerant than the taller ones and maintained the high tissue water status under drought stress resulting in less yield reduction angadi and entz 2002b various sunflower cultivars exhibit different behavior with respect to plant water relations for example under water deficit conditions the genotype i e r1 genotype tolerant to drought maintained a high leaf water potential and wilted faster than those of a drought sensitive genotype ouvrard et al 1996 similarly hussain et al 2016 also observed that drought significantly decreased the water relations of sunflower hybrids having different ability of drought tolerance indeed drought stress results in an inadequate water transport from xylem which limits the sufficient nutrient supply from phloem ruehr et al 2009 however sunflower genotypes maintaining the higher water potential under drought stress maintain an adequate supply of water from xylem which ultimately maintain an adequate nutrient supply from phloem and thus maintain the water potential levels hussain et al 2016 which are supportive to plant growth under drought stress likewise the genotypes maintaining higher water potential extract the water from the deeper layers of soil which delays the osmotic adjustments angadi and entz 2002a terzi and kadioglu 2006 water potential is considered as a reliable indicator of plants response to water stress and genotypes differ for water potential due to differential ability to absorb water from soil and decrease the water loss through stomata which maintain the turgor pressure siddique et al 2000 terzi and kadioglu 2006 bayoumi et al 2008 in summary drought stress decreases the water supply to xylem which decreases an adequate nutrient supply to phloem thus resulting in the lower water potential however a huge variability exists among different genotypes for the maintenance of water potential mainly due to the ability of water absorption and root system however the adaptive responses of leaf water parameters to drought stress are variable in sunflower genotypes and needs to be investigated at molecular level in future studies 2 3 nutrient uptake drought stress decreases transpiration rates and impairs active transport and membrane permeability which collectively result in reduced absorbing power of crop plants kramer and boyer 1995 thus the nutrient transport from root to shoot is restricted due to weak absorbing power of the crop plants under drought stress nitrogen is the most required element by crop plants and constitute several plant components including amino and nucleic acids soil n mineralization is reduced by drought stress which ultimately lowers n availability a decreased transpiration as a consequence of drought stress is the other factor which lowers n transport from roots to the shoots tanguilig et al 1987 the p uptake is hampered under moisture deficit conditions pinkerton and simpson 1986 the primary reason of reduced p uptake is restricted translocation of p to shoots even under mild drought stress resnik 1970 drought significantly reduces the mineral uptake and disturbs nutrient balances as well gunes et al 2008a however plant species and genotypes within species vary in their response to water deficit stress in this regard garg 2003 drought induced reduction in n and k uptake in two sunflower hybrids have been recently reported by hussain et al 2016 the n and k utilization under drought stress at different growth stages is influenced by number of factors including physiochemical characteristics of the soil duration and intensity of drought relative to phenology and the evolutionary history of the organism killingbeck 2004 silla and escudero 2006 the stomatal closure is hampered by lower k supply because of loss of epidermal cell turgidity rahbarian et al 2011 as stomatal closure needs back pressure exerted by fully turgid epidermal pavement cells whereas the k accumulation is responsible for the required pressure roelfsema and hedrich 2002 habibi 2013 canavar and kaptan 2014 evaluated the uptake of nutrients p k magnesium mg calcium ca iron fe zinc zn copper cu manganese mn and sodium na in three sunflower hybrids under drought stress and found negative effect of water stress on the uptake but genotypes differed in their response another study gunes et al 2008a investigated the uptake of p k sulfur s ca mg fe cu zn mn chloride cl molybdenum mo silicon si na vanadium v aluminum al strontium sr rubidium rb titanium ti chromium cr nickel ni bromine br and barium ba in twelve sunflower genotypes under drought stress drought stress reduced the uptake of all the aforementioned minerals in conclusion drought stress hampers mineral uptake in sunflower reduced mineralization due to low moisture availability and restricted translocation of minerals to shoots because of low transport are the primary mechanisms of reduced mineral uptake impaired active transport and membrane permeability are the other restrictions which lead to imbalanced nutrition in sunflower under drought stress the imbalances in nutrients ultimately have serious effects on various growth and developmental process 2 4 oxidative damage reactive oxygen species ros are free radicals of oxygen which are continuously produced in plants even under normal condition as they play an important role in cell signaling however overproduction of ros leads towards the oxidative stress the major ros in plant system includes singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh among which oh is the most reactive species impa et al 2012 and these are highly toxic to plant physiological and biochemical processes el shabrawi et al 2010 drought stress causes an overproduction of different ros species cechin et al 2015 which may damage most of the cellular components drought stress stimulates the ros production in sunflower soleimanzadeh 2012 and the superoxide radicals are the most dominant ros produced in sunflower water deficit leads to shrinkage in cell volume which makes the cellular contents more viscous ultimately resulting in denaturation and aggregation of proteins hoekstra et al 2001 this phenomenon results in abnormal functioning of enzymes involved in photosynthesis the partial stomatal closure in response to water deficit limits co2 entry and its availability for photosynthesis this limitation results in reduced carboxylation efficiency of rubisco which increases oxygenation thus increasing the photo respiratory losses and ros production noctor et al 2002 furthermore reduced co2 fixation of photosynthesis decrease regeneration of nadp which is final electron acceptor of electron transport chain in chloroplast hence over reduction of electron transport chain results in leakage of electron to o2 and subsequent production of ros smirnoff 1993 sgherri et al 1996 in a study drought stress enhanced the production of ros especially h2o2 and leaf malaonaldehyde mda contents in sunflower with a simultaneous reduction in the activity of catalase gunes et al 2008a it is concluded that drought stress leads to production of ros in sunflower which react with proteins lipids and dna resulting in an ineffective antioxidant enzyme defense system 3 morphological physiological and yield responses in order to manage the drought stress at morphological and or physiological level it is necessary to understand its effects on morphology and physiology of crop plants sunflower is moderately drought tolerant crop due to its long and deep root system hussain et al 2013a which enables it to extract water from deeper soil layers however if drought stress prolongs it poses significant negative effect to sunflower from early stand establishment to maturity and ultimately on yield and oil characteristics andrianasolo et al 2014 flagella et al 2002 the effects of drought stress on different growth stages and morphological and physiological traits of sunflower are discussed in the following sections 3 1 germination and early stand establishment germination is the most critical phase in the ontogeny of crop plants the first effect of early season drought is impaired and erratic germination causing poor crop stand farooq et al 2012 seed germination is a complex process affected by a number of factors where moisture availability is the most critical luan et al 2014 drought delays the germination onset el midaoui et al 2001 with substantial decrease in the actual germination in sunflower sajjan et al 1999 ample soil moisture is required to initiate the germination process imbibition by seeds is the first step which depends on the water potential gradient between seed and soil any decrease in soil water potential causes linear decline in seed germination wen 2015 sunflower crop is frequently sown on beds and ridges with poor moisture conditions and lack of rainfall at this stage may result in erratic germination and seedling emergence angadi and entz 2002b mwale et al 2003 kaya et al 2006 in arid climates where supplementary irrigation is not available several studies have reported that drought stress in sunflower negatively influenced seed germination of sunflower sajjan et al 1999 smok et al 1993 el midaoui et al 2001 which was indicated through an increase in mean germination time owning to drought stress in summary seed imbibition is the first step in the germination process however the soil moisture deficit at this stage restricts the seed to uptake required amount of moisture resulting in poor erratic and non uniform seed germination and crop stand 3 2 plant growth and development drought stress is multidimensional in nature and affects plants at every organizational level plant growth is an important phenomenon that is regulated by several morphological and physiological factors drought stress after germination has systematic effect on growth with reduction of water potential relative water contents ünyayar et al 2004 and turgor of plant cells benlloch gonzález et al 2015 which elevate the concentration of solutes in cytosol these changes decrease cell elongation thus leading to growth inhibition lisar et al 2012 growth inhibition is followed by less carbon assimilation imbalanced mineral nutrition and accumulation of abscisic acid aba which cause wilting of plants farooq et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 the negative effects of drought stress on mineral nutrition and metabolism result in reduction of leaf area and disruption of assimilate partitioning considerable reduction in leaf area and associated morphological and physiological traits in sunflower lines under drought stress has been reported which varied with different cultivars fernández moroni et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 drought stress hampers numerous growth and development traits such as root volume rv total root length trl stem dry weight sdw total dry matter tdm chlorophyll contents plant height stem diameter leaf dry weight leaf area index lai crop growth rate cgr net assimilation rate nar and carotenoids table 1 it has long been known that drought stress impedes morphological traits like plant height stem diameter number of leaves etc in sunflower pirjol sovulescu et al 1974 sadras et al 1993 hussain et al 2010 drought stress at vegetative stage reduces main stem height stem diameter number of nodes or leaves per plant and leaf area turhan and baser 2004 whereas an increase in root length at the expense of above ground dry matter occurs resulting in higher root to shoot ratio javaid et al 2015 drought stress results in reduced leaf area yellowing and falling of leaves göksoy et al 2004 nezami et al 2008 and ultimately small plant canopy area which reduces the radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic activities resulting in low achene yield germ et al 2005 ghobadi et al 2013 a common adverse effect of drought stress on crop plants is reduction in fresh and dry biomass production due to decreased leaf area followed by less production of photosynthates farooq et al 2012 lisar et al 2012 reduction in biomass production under drought stress had been observed in numerous studies conducted on sunflower tahir and mehdi 2001 fatemi 2014 cechin et al 2015 santonoceto et al 2002 studied the accumulation dynamics of dry matter oil and major fatty acids in different genotypes of sunflower under water stress 100 67 33 and 0 deficit water of evapotranspiration and reported less evapotranspiration by closure of stomata reduced carbon assimilation pollen infertility and decrease biomass production due to water stress even with supplementary irrigation crop can face water stress and responds with low biomass production if irrigation is missed at critical growth stages of the crop buriro et al 2015 and alahdadi and oraki 2011 reported that skipping irrigation either at flowering or grain filling proved most lethal for the crop yield and biomass production in another experiment conducted by vijay 2004 to identify the most sensitive growth stage of sunflower to limited water supply flowering stage was observed as the most critical yield affecting stage in two other studies göksoy et al 2004 and demir et al 2006 reported that sunflower should be irrigated at least three times with full or limited irrigation i e at heading flowering and milking to obtain the highest achene and oil yields they also suggested that in case of limited water availability irrigation must not be skipped at flowering different levels of drought stress i e mild moderate and severe drought stress results in reduced growth and developmental traits depending upon the growth stage where the drought stress happens mild and severe drought stress imposed either at vegetative reproductive stage or whole season reduced total root length to 5 97 and 36 54 respectively table 1 similarly total dry matter was reduced to 11 70 65 61 and 45 54 in response to mild moderate and severe drought stress imposed at different growth stages of sunflower table 1 it is evident that all the intensities of drought stress significantly reduce the growth and development of sunflower compared to well watered conditions in conclusion drought stress affects all the growth and developmental traits of different sunflower cultivars drought stress results in reduced leaf area yellowing and falling of leaves and ultimately the small plant canopy area which reduces the radiation use efficiency and photosynthetic activities these processes result in weaker plant growth and development under water stress 3 3 achene yield crop yield is a complex trait which is influenced by genotype environmental factors and management practices sunflower achene yield is significantly reduced by drought stress faced by the plants either at vegetative or reproductive flowering and milking growth stages göksoy et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 hussain et al 2015 the intensity of yield reduction in response to drought stress depends on growth stage of the crop severity of the drought and the drought tolerance ability of genotypes flower initiation and anthesis are important growth phases which determine the achene yield since higher number of fertile flowers and florets result in higher achene yield göksoy et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 hussain et al 2015 drought stress at this stage is critical as it is coupled with high temperature which leads to pollen infertility low head diameter and reduced yield behrouzyar et al 2007 göksoy et al 2004 elsheikh et al 2015 benlloch gonzález et al 2015 different yield components such as head diameter capitulum diameter number of achenes per capitulum achene weight per capitulum and 1000 achene are significantly hampered by drought stress table 2 khan et al 2000 concluded that yield and yield components showed decreasing trend with increasing severity of drought stress irrigation reduced from 100 to 25 of field capacity they further concluded that achene yield reduced with increasing drought stress due to reduction in head diameter numbers of achenes per head and 1000 achene weight significant reduction in growth and grain yield of sunflower have also been reported with increasing intensity of drought stress oad et al 2002 kakar and soomro 2001 although limited water availability during early developmental stages of sunflower severely reduced the achene yield drought at reproductive stages is the most devastating reddy et al 1998 reddy et al 2003 göksoy et al 2004 vijay 2004 hussain et al 2008 nazarli et al 2010 garcía lópez et al 2014 jabari et al 2007 reported 83 reduction in seed yield of sunflower under drought stress at flowering due to reduction in number of achene per head and 1000 achene weight hussain et al 2009a b reported that drought stress either at budding or flowering stage had negative effects on achene yield drought stress at flowering stage causes pollen sterility resulting in less number of achenes per head with lighter weight which severely reduce achene yield unger 1990 hussain et al 2008 yield reduction in sunflower has been reported with different extent under drought stress imposed either at vegetative or reproductive stages with mild and or severe intensities of imposed drought table 3 it is depicted from the table that the achene yield is reduced depending upon the severity of drought stress and the critical crop growth stage at which it occur it is concluded that drought stress at different growth stages hampers yield components which ultimately lead towards lower achene yield in sunflower the yield reduction is the result of disturbed physiological and morphological attributes which ultimately affects the yield contributing traits of the sunflower resulting in lower achene yield under drought stress 3 4 oil yield and quality sunflower oil is considered high quality edible oil due to low content of palmitic and stearic acid and saturated fatty acids with elevated concentration up to 90 of unsaturated fatty acids predominately linoleic acid rodriguez et al 2002 the oil with more density of unsaturated fatty acids e g linoleic acid is essential as human body cannot synthesize these fatty acids eslami 2015 hence the sunflower oil is as a better quality edible oil due to its fatty acid composition flagella et al 2002 thus releasing the genotypes with much higher concentration of oleic acid rather than linoleic acid is the major objective of breeding programs drought either at vegetative or reproductive stages causes a significant reduction in oil yield and quality of sunflower flagella et al 2002 hussain et al 2008 ali et al 2009 because of reduction in oil contents and achene yield fatty acids composition in sunflower is altered by drought stress particularly the amounts of oleic and linoleic acids are changed under drought stress at different growth stages baldini et al 2002 which change the oxidative properties flagella et al 2002 drought stress alters the fatty acid composition mainly oleic linoleic acid ratio of sunflower oil known as unsaturation ratio similarly the changes in linoleic acid are also caused by enzymatic processes governed by genes coding for oleoyl δ 9 desaturase and oleoyl δ 12 desaturase which are main enzymes utilized in metabolic processes related to oleic and linoleic acids respectively cantisan et al 2000 rondanini et al 2003 lacombe et al 2004 the up and down regulation of these genes under drought stress alters the oil composition of sunflower anastasi et al 2010 on the other hand drought stress accelerates earlier embryo development and stimulates enzymatic activities of fatty acid biosynthesis including oleoyl δ 12 desaturase which alters the composition of sunflower oil baldini et al 2002 the variation in oleic acid is highly dependent on the synthesis or activation of oleate desaturase enzyme which is affected by water supply roche et al 2006 baldini et al 2002 the activity of the enzyme is also affected by disturbed mineral nutrition under drought stress different genes govern the variation in unsaturated fatty acids in standard and oleic sunflower genotypes which are differentially affected by ambient environmental conditions lacombe and bervillé 2001 martinez rivas et al 2001 pérez vich et al 2002 schuppert et al 2006 the oil of sunflower cultivars grown for edible oil contains four essential fatty acids viz palmitic stearic oleic and linoleic acids monotti 2003 however no effect of drought stress on oil quality and contents was noted in some studies e g petcu et al 2001 which may be due to low intensity of stress and use of high oleic sunflower genotypes limited water supply from flowering to physiological maturity increases the oleic acid and decreases the linoleic acid contents compared with well watered plants as described above flagella et al 2000 drought stress decreases achene oil contents at the expense of protein contents reddy et al 2003 daneshian et al 2005 in most of the cases oil yield reduction is less than seed yield reduction which indicates increase in oil contents but severe drought at flowering and bud stage reduced oil yield more than seed yield which may be due to decrease in seed oil contents tables 3 and 4 so these two stages may be regarded as the most sensitive to drought stress sunflower oil yield and quality are severely hampered by drought stress mainly due to reduced activity of enzyme oleate desaturase however there are some reports where drought stress had no effect on the oil quality of sunflower which might be attributed to genetic potential of the genotypes used in the studies more studies are needed to check the influence of drought stress and its intensity on the oil yield and oil quality of diverse sunflower genotypes under an array of climatic conditions across the globe 4 management strategies in theory of evolution by darwin he describes survival of the fittest which means that fit individual survived and other diminished only those crops are successful under harsh environment which can withstand stress it is crucial for crop scientist to develop strategies which can make the crop plants fit for harsh environmental conditions under climate change scenario various management strategies have been opted by different scientist in different agro climatic regions to improve the sunflower performance under drought stress these strategies are discussed critically in the following section 4 1 breeding approaches 4 1 1 screening of drought tolerant germplasm and development of tolerant variety through breeding exploration of genetic variation is the primary step towards improvement of drought resistance of crops such variation exists in wild types and modified genotypes that have evolved under natural selection and considered as the finest source of resistance traits appraisal of these resources via an integrated phenotyping and genotyping method in field circumstances together with traits identification that are directly related with yield are important for improvements in drought resistance genetic variability must be expanded for developing successful drought tolerant lines as significant variations are present among sunflower cultivars to attain better yield under drought stress rauf 2008 a high degree of genetic variability in water status osmotic adjustments root characteristics gas exchange parameters seedling establishment and drought susceptibility index was observed within a large number of sunflower genotypes belonging to diverse origins table 5 hence improvements in these traits through selection from the available germplasm could possibly improve the drought tolerance of sunflower selection of leaf area index with net assimilation rate may be preferred over leaf area for selecting genotypes under drought stress hemmati and soleymani 2014 root system is another important trait related to drought stress tolerance generally deeper roots along with higher root to shoot ratio is an adaptive mechanism for drought tolerance and can be used in breeding program to develop drought tolerant sunflower genotypes gomes et al 2005 rauf and sadaqat 2008b yield associated traits like root length upper and lower root weight root diameter and seedling recovery after reliving the stressful environment are used as important criteria for breeding to develop drought tolerant sunflower genotypes rauf and sadaqat 2008a b numerous other potential traits are reported that could be used for screening of drought stress tolerance which are positively correlated with yield table 4 drought stress index dsi is calculated on the basis of a ratio between yield under drought stress to the yield under no stress conditions and is important for drought stress tolerance therefore this trait may also be useful for breeding of sunflower drought tolerant genotypes fereres et al 1986 baldini et al 1992 alza and fernandez martinez 1997 rauf and sadaqat 2007 morphological physiological ad biochemical responses of the plant to drought stress demonstrates its tolerance nature susceptible or tolerant but analyses of most of these traits is needed to be conducted by growing the crop for full growth season this not only become a time consuming but also required a lot of resources and techniques which are normally not available at all laboratories to manage this problem genes responsible for such traits are identified and closely linked markers are developed with the help of these markers plants can be identified for stress tolerant traits at early stages of development with very less resources which saves time and money furthermore introgression of traits in succeeding generations has also been verified with same markers successful screening of sunflower genotypes for drought stress tolerance has been reported adiredjo et al 2014a ghaffari et al 2013 sarazin et al 2017 as most of the morphological and physiological traits associated with drought stress tolerance are negatively correlated dsi seems the most suitable traits describing the relative overall performance evolution of drought tolerant sunflower varieties hybrids through breeding programs is highly important to boost up the global sunflower production under water limited environments rauf and sadaqat 2007 different studies have used numerous traits such as stomatal conductance osmotic adjustment shoot and root length photosynthetic rate leaf area index malondialdehyde contents seedling traits harvest index drought susceptibility index root system leaf hydraulics chlorophyll fluorescence canopy temperature stem diameter and number of achenes per capitulum for selection of drought tolerance in sunflower table 5 the use of these traits is reported to improve the drought tolerance of sunflower to significant extent 4 1 2 introgression from wild relatives the genus helianthus has 51 species and 19 subspecies with 14 annual and 37 perennial species seiler 2007 wild species of sunflower may have some genes related to water stress tolerance which can be exploited by specific hybridization therefore induction of drought tolerant genes from the wild relatives in locally planted sunflower varieties hybrids may help to develop drought tolerant sunflower varieties hybrids mohan and seetharam 2005 sunflower has been ranked 5th out of 13 most important crops surveyed from 1980 s to 2005 which could be improved through introgression from wild relatives seiler et al 2017 it is reported that all helianthus species except helianthus agrestis p can be used to introgress traits with conventional back cross method helianthus argophyllus and helianthus anomalus wild species have been extensively used by sunflower breeders to introgress drought tolerant traits like higher water use efficiency improved drought sensitivity index and a high harvest index under water stress to the cultivated genotypes baldini and vannozzi 1998 baldini et al 1999 griveau et al 1998 seiler 2007 wild species gene introgression also upgrades the fatty acid composition and protein quality and tolerance to nutrient stress korrell et al 1996 brouillette and donovan 2011 seiler et al 2010 reported two sunflower cultivars ha 429 and ha 430 introgressed for salt and water stress tolerance traits from wild relatives but in some cases introgression of drought tolerant genes from many wild species has also been associated with the degradation of oil yield in cultivated sunflower seiler 2007 which must be rectified through successive back cross breeding it is concluded that selection and conventional breeding approaches are feasible tools which can be used for developing drought tolerant sunflower cultivars however too few works have been conducted to realize the potential of these approaches conventional approaches must be accompanied with molecular techniques to fasten the process of selection and development of genotypes furthermore wild relatives may also be used more extensively to enhance the genetic variability of available germplasm for drought stress tolerance 4 1 3 identification of quantitative trait loci qtls for water use efficiency water use efficiency is the measure of ability of a crop to convert water into plant biomass in a study canavar et al 2014 reported that the selection for water use efficiency using the indirect δ13c isotope can be a useful tool in sunflower breeding programs aimed at developing the drought tolerant sunflower genotypes the identification of quantitative trait loci qtl controlling the water use efficiency might also be beneficial for improving sunflower performance under drought stress for example adiredjo et al 2014a identified nine qtl controlling the water use efficiency in sunflower under drought stress another single qtl for phenotypic response controlling the water use efficiency was also identified in recent years use of leaf carbon isotope discrimination has been emerged as an indirect tool for breeding for water use efficiency in multiple crops for example adiredjo et al 2014b studied the genetic variability in four sunflower genotypes for assessing the phenotypic correlations between the leaf carbon isotope discrimination and water use efficiency they measured water use efficiency at leaf level and whole plant level they observed significant differences among the four sunflower genotypes for water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope discrimination at leaf level and whole plant level there existed a strong negative co relation between whole plant leaf level water use efficiency and leaf carbon isotope discrimination with a decrease in water availability they suggested leaf carbon isotope discrimination as a pertinent and valuable trait to select the sunflower genotypes with high water use efficiency under drought stress adiredjo et al 2014b 4 2 biotechnology and functional genomics biotechnology and functional genomics of environmental stresses like drought heat and salinity has a prodigious contribution to a better understanding of plant adaptation to adverse environmental conditions drought tolerance is a multi genic traits as it is a combination of many traits which make ecological adaption of a plant to drought stress research on functional genomics has provided genetic basis of most of these traits gene products involved in the adaptation of plants to drought stress can be classified in to i directly involved in stress tolerance includes dehydrins and chaperons that protect cellular structure during stress enzymes for osmolytes synthesis that regulate cellular and tissue processes and detoxifying enzymes which detoxify the products produced due to stress or ii indirectly involved through regulation of others genes includes transcription factors which regulate the expression of directly involved genes kasuga et al 1999 roche et al 2007 reported differential expression of genes in drought tolerant and sensitive cultivars which might be associated with the expression of mrna in different environments giordani et al 2011 which is regulated with indirectly involved genes giordani et al 2011 reported that these changes in the expression of mrna can only be studied by using genomic dna of purely homozygous plants it was further reported the changes in the expression of genes were related to sequences variability in stress responsive genes the sequence variability is observed more for directly involved genes compared to indirectly involved genes therefore it can be extracted from the discussion that directly involve genes are more likely to be regulated with external harsh environment it is therefore concluded that along with dna markers these mirnas and cdna markers may also be utilized in developing sunflower cultivars exhibiting higher drought tolerance 4 3 agronomic approaches 4 3 1 exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants exogenous applications of phytohormones and osmoprotectants may help alleviating drought stress in sunflower hussain et al 2008 2009a b babaeian et al 2011 rabert et al 2014 exogenous application of different synthetic compounds such as abscisic acid potassium chloride foliar or root application of salicylic acid and ascorbic acid calcium chloride sodium nitroprusside as donor of nitric oxide triazole compounds and glycinebetaine significantly improved the growth development biochemical attributes yield and yield related traits including morphological physiological and biochemical traits table 6 for instance exogenous application of glycine betaine gb and salicylic acid sa significantly improved the achene and oil yield of sunflower subjected to drought stress at vegetative and reproductive phase hussain et al 2008 2009a b zaidi et al 2015 reported that foliar application of sa significantly improved the proline sugars and proteins in drought stressed sunflower indicating that exogenous sa application plays an important role in drought tolerance significant improvements in antioxidant enzymes and biochemical traits of drought stressed sunflower have been reported by 28 homobrassinolide application filová 2014 abscisic acid aba application at budding or flowering helped in mitigating the detrimental effects of drought stress and produced better yields compared to no application treatments hussain et al 2014 aba application also have been reported to regulate some stress responsive genes and proteins in sunflower under drought stress shinozaki and yamaguchi shinozaki 2007 for instance haacco2 transcript is accrued in leaves and exogenous aba application induces this gene in sunflower in response to drought stress boursiac et al 2013 nitric oxide no is lipophilic in nature and highly diffusible through cellular membrane and involved in many physiological biochemical and developmental processes in plants krasylenko et al 2010 cechin et al 2015 cechin et al 2015 reported that application of 10 μm sodium nitroprusside snp a no donor significantly improved the concentration of ros scavenging enzymes which significantly imparted drought tolerance to sunflower partial amelioration of adverse effects of drought stress in sunflower has been observed through the application of triazole compounds such as hexaconazole tebuconazole and propiconazole rabert et al 2014 2016 which have been reported to strengthen the antioxidant defense system of sunflower through increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as sod apx and cat it is concluded that exogenous application of osmoprotectants phytohormones micro and macro nutrients and several other compounds have been proved effective to improve sunflower growth yield and oil quality under drought stress therefore proper crop nutrition is an agronomic tool which can be employed to improve drought resistance of sunflower 4 3 2 use of mineral nutrients and organic manures drought stress hampers the transport of nutrients towards roots thus affecting the cell division and expansion of roots which might be due to reduced transpiration rate limited water supply affects the uptake of essential elements however an adequate nutrition of plants under water deficit may improve the performance of crops nitrogen n and potassium k are primary macronutrients required by plants in large amounts and govern several developmental processes such as photosynthesis translocation of photosynthates from roots to shoots protein synthesis stomatal closure water use efficiency and regulation of enzymes salami and saadat 2013 the application of these nutrients enhance the tolerance against drought stress by improving protein synthesis stomatal regulation homeostasis and osmoregulation through quenching the ros cakmak 2005 under drought stress the role of n role in improving growth and plant water relations is well established saneoka et al 2004 likewise improved k nutrition results in improved water uptake maintains plant turgor and regulates stomatal aperture bukhsh et al 2012 recently hussain et al 2016 has reported that combined application of n and k improves drought resistance of sunflower by improving turgor maintenance enhanced accumulation of osmoprotectants increased stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis reduced production of ros ultimately ending with higher yield different potassium k levels in soil have considerable role in growth regulation and water uptake ability of sunflower it is well known fact that k deficiency lowers plant resistance to drought stress marschner 1995 through stomatal closure and thus lowers the transpiration rates hsiao and lauchli 1986 however some authors also reported that moderate k starvation may cause anomalous stomatal behavior and has a positive effect on transpiration in some crops like wheat and sunflower brag 1972 lindhauer 1985 fournier et al 2005 reported that moderate k deficiency promotes water uptake and reduces wue in sunflower compare to well watered plants aba regulation in k deficiency plants possibly prevents stomatal closure increasing water uptake and transpiration moreover the enhanced uptake in k starved plants might be attributed to the increase transpiration rate which forced the plant to extract more water from soil to maintain a water balance application of micronutrients also improves the performance of sunflower under drought stress zafar et al 2014 babaeian et al 2011 rahimizadeh et al 2007 shehzad et al 2016 by improving the antioxidant defense stay green achenes weight achene yield biological yield and oil yield a 48 89 improvement in the production of antioxidant enzymes sod cat and gpx with fe zn cu mn application have been recorded in sunflower which indicates the significance of micronutrient application for improving the drought resistance of sunflower rahimizadeh et al 2007 babaeian et al 2011 significant improvements in physiological traits of drought stressed sunflower through zn and cacl2 application have also been reported zafar et al 2014 recently ibrahim et al 2016 reported positive effects of cacl2 foliar application on leaf relative water contents leaf pigments such as chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids anthocyanins carotenoids leaf minerals n p k and ca organic osmolytes proline and soluble sugars and phenolic related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal and peroxidase pod in sunflower under drought stress silicon application is also useful to reduce the drought induce yield losses in oilseed crops including sunflower in a study silicon application under drought stress improved the k sulphur magnesium iron copper manganese whereas the uptake of zinc remained unaffected gunes et al 2008b in another study gunes et al 2008b reported that exogenous application of silicon reduced leaf mda and enhanced the relative water contents and the activities of enzymatic e g catalase and non enzymatic antioxidant defense systems in sunflower gunes et al 2008a in a study on canola crop the exogenous application of silicon increased the root shoot dry weight net assimilation rate relative water contents co2 absorbance root amino acid contents root water uptake root proliferation and the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase habibi 2014 organic manures are other viable option which improve drought tolerance when applied alone or in combination with synthetic fertilizers esmaeilian et al 2012 these manures are beneficial source of major nutrients and affect the temporal dynamics of nutrient availability through improving soil physico chemical properties paul and beauchamp 1993 significant improvement in drought tolerance was obtained when organic manure was applied to drought stressed sunflower either alone or in combination with synthetic fertilizers aowad and mohamed 2009 similarly organic manures both alone and in combination improved the nutrient uptake of sunflower under drought stress which ultimately improved yield esmaeilian et al 2012 4 3 3 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and polymers the symbiotic relationship between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is also an important strategy to improve mineral nutrition under abiotic stresses in plants brachmann and parniske 2006 indeed the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi provides the surface area to plant roots to absorb water and nutrients e g p n zn cu smith and read 2008 in a study use of two species i e glumus mossea and glumus etanicatum of mycorrhiza improved the seed yield and seed nutrient contents in sunflower glumus etanicatum being more beneficial for improvement in seed yield and nutrient content of sunflower heidari and karami 2014 however further studies are also needed to study the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for improving the performance of sunflower under drought stress under diverse environmental conditions another way of improving the water use efficiency and achene yield of sunflower under drought stress is the use of super absorbent under arid and semi arid climates it has been reported that super absorbent polymers can hold 400 1500 g of water per dry gram of hydro gel boman and evans 1991 thus increasing the water absorption and retention under drought stress in a study super absorbent polymer application at 2 25 3 g kg of soil improved the water use efficiency under drought stress nazarli et al 2010 in conclusion drought stress imbalances mineral nutrition while use of macro and micro nutrients organic manures arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and polymers could possibly improve drought tolerance of sunflower through maintenance of nutrient balances 4 3 4 seed priming seed priming is a technique by which seeds are partially hydrated to a point where germination related metabolic processes begin but radicle is not emerged different seed priming techniques hydropriming salt priming on farm priming and chemical priming have been largely used for improving germination and crop establishment seed priming especially by osmopriming with kno3 and hydropriming improved the germination and stand establishment in sunflower crop both under stress salt and drought and normal conditions kaya et al 2006 hussain et al 2006 moghanibashi et al 2012 also reported that hydropriming of sunflower seeds improved the germination percentage germination index root shoot length and root shoot dry weight of sunflower under drought stress in another study hydropriming of sunflower seeds improved the germination percentage mean emergence time and seedling dry weight of two sunflower genotypes viz azargol and hysun 36 sheidaie et al 2013 kausar et al 2009 also found an improvement in seed vigour due to seed priming biological priming of seeds is a developing technique which imparts tolerance to plants against various types of biotic and abiotic stresses singh et al 2015 significant improvements in drought tolerance of sunflower with biologically primed seeds with azotobacter chroococcum bacillus polymyxa alone or in combination have been reported singh et al 2015 both growth promoting bacteria significantly improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes thus ameliorated the adverse effects of drought stress in sunflower gholamhoseini et al 2013 found that inoculation of sunflower plants with two mycorrhizal fungi species viz glomus mosseae and g hoi improved the biomass achene and seed yield in sunflower than non inoculated plants it is concluded that seed priming either chemical or biological may help to improve the performance of drought stressed sunflower therefore seed priming can be used to ameliorate the negative effects of drought stress on germination growth and yield of sunflower to significant extent 5 conclusion and future directions drought stress affects the sunflower crop through its negative influence on seed germination seedling growth plant water relations mineral nutrition stay green photosynthesis transpiration and grain partitioning thus affecting the seed yield and oil quality however various management practices including breeding for drought tolerance conventional or biotechnological exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants seed treatment and soil nutrient management might be useful for improving drought tolerance in sunflower the rna mediated silencing and dna methylation processes of specific genes are recent options explored in the developing era of functional genomics for improving abiotic stress tolerance in plants which can be successfully used for improving drought tolerance in sunflower several physiological parameters such as improved stomatal conductance shoot and root dry weight harvest index root system leaf hydraulics and stay green are important physiological traits which needs to be considered when screening sunflower genotypes for breeding programs aimed on drought stress tolerance for improving the water use efficiency of sunflower under drought stress use of leaf carbon isotope discrimination technique identification of qtls responsible for efficient water use under drought stress and application of super absorbent might be quite beneficial a comprehensive research on integration of different management options including agronomic approaches conventional breeding and modern biotechnological advances is needed for the sustainable improvement of sunflower achene yield and oil quality under drought stress 
11538,the us pacific northwest is one of the most productive potato regions in the world however due to the high inputs nitrate contamination of groundwater is frequently documented and maximizing crop productivity while minimizing nitrate leaching is still challenging the goal of this study was to assess how irrigation level soil type and weather condition during various phenological phases would affect tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching and profit margin the cropping system model csm substor potato was used to simulate the response variables for various scenarios that comprised two soil types five irrigation levels five phenological phases five weather conditions and 75 years of historical weather data for 3 locations in this region the simulation results showed that nitrate leaching was higher with a higher amount of irrigation and for a lighter soil tuber yield and profit margins were lowest for a lighter soil and highest for 300 mm of irrigation for an extremely drained soil and 400 mm of irrigation for a well drained soil the increase in profit margins with an increase in total irrigation up to 400 mm was highest for a well drained soil whereas the decrease in profit margins with an increase in irrigation beyond a total amount of 300 mm was larger for an extremely drained soil for the different types of weather scenarios that were studied only severe hot weather had an impact on tuber yield and profit margins the reduction was highest at tuber bulking and significant when hot weather continued from sprout development through tuber bulking or from plant establishment through tuber maturation however any change in weather condition from the long term average for any growth phase did not affect leaching these findings might be helpful to potato growers in this region to protect their potatoes from adverse weather conditions through appropriate mitigation strategies keywords dssat leaching model phenological phase potato profit simulation substor weather 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is one of the most valuable field crops in the pacific northwest region of the usa the columbia river basin is the most productive area for high quality processing potatoes alva et al 2012 and has the highest potato yield in the world washington state potato commission wspc 2015 this area has a comparative advantage over other potato growing areas in the united states due to close proximity to foreign markets economical production inputs excellent environmental conditions and good irrigation facilities beleiciks 2005 wspc 2007 the columbia basin consists of long growing seasons rich volcanic soils and a semi arid climate characterized by long hot dry days and cool nights wspc 2007 due to these ideal growing conditions potato production in this area can be conducted at a large scale in rotation with other high yielding crops such as maize vegetables and wheat the major inputs to potato production in the columbia basin are nitrogen n and water potato growers in this region use high rates of these inputs peralta and stöckle 2001 since the cost associated with them relative to the expected income from the crop is small hodges 1999 the high rates of n and water are expected to transport nitrate below the root zone and eventually contaminate groundwater the groundwater in this region contains a high concentration of nitrate cook et al 1996 wsde 2011 nitrate leaching is influenced by various crop environmental and management factors such as growth phase irrigation soil type and weather condition alva et al 2012 cambouris et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 potato management practices must reflect differences among climatic conditions soil properties and water management among other things zebarth and rosen 2007 it is important to optimally manage n and water for maintaining high yield levels and profits while minimizing nitrate pollution of the groundwater alva 2004a zebarth and rosen 2007 the excess or deficiency of water or n can have harmful effects on the environment profit and tuber yield goffart et al 2011 public concern about the sustainability of agro ecosystems and environmental quality is increasing thus emphasizing the need for developing management strategies that can improve n and water use efficiencies and minimize losses badr et al 2012 because the roots of potato plants are comparatively sparse and shallow jabro et al 2012 shock et al 2007 the retention capacity of a soil for water and soluble nutrients plays an important role in nitrate leaching in this crop because soils differ in retention capacity nitrate leaching is expected to be different for different soil types alva 2004a cambouris et al 2008 fertilization and irrigation guidelines are supposed to be location specific because the amounts of fertilizer and water to be applied may be defined by soil type and weather both of which vary significantly across space potato production is greatly affected by weather conditions an unpredictable environment can have profound effects on both tuber yield and quality pavek et al 2015 for the optimal occurrence of each phenological phase especially sprout development tuber initiation and tuber growth optimum daytime and nighttime temperatures are required dwelle et al 1981 fao 2015 kooman and haverkort 1995 wheeler et al 1986 weather conditions at planting impact the length of the growing season through the influence on emergence for instance continued cool temperatures may prolong the rest period and thus delay sprout development cool nights during tuber bulking on the other hand may promote tuber growth montoya et al 2016 any interruption of ideal weather conditions may result in reduced tuber growth rates and losses in yield and quality dean 1994 any condition that limits healthy foliage growth disrupts tuber growth or shifts dry matter partitioning from the tubers to the foliage decreases yield potential temperature is one of the key factors that affect tuber bulking and shift the balance between vine and tuber growth dwelle and love 2003 temperature and precipitation are the key meteorological factors that control nitrate leaching wick et al 2012 temperature influences a number of processes that are involved in nitrate leaching hill 1991 and is the dominating factor for the variability of the nitrate concentration in leachate liang et al 2011 weather conditions affect the potential for n loss by influencing various processes such as nitrification denitrification and volatilization nitrate leaching may occur once n is converted into nitrate a water soluble product through the nitrification process weather also impacts water uptake and the soil water balance because the relative importance of plant available soil moisture varies across plant growth phases shock et al 1993 wright and stark 1990 the effects of weather conditions on potato production and associated nitrate leaching are therefore affected by the phenological phase of the potato plant the challenge of developing best management practices that maximize crop productivity while minimizing harmful environmental impacts still exists in spite of the considerable progress that has been made in improving the understanding of n and water management effects on tuber yield quality and n losses shrestha et al 2010 zebarth and rosen 2007 determining the correct application rates for fertilizer and irrigation is still challenging despite decades of research peralta and stöckle 2001 shrestha et al 2010 as shown by the reports of nitrate contamination of groundwater potato tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching have been assessed in various studies that have evaluated different irrigation and n fertilization regimes for instance alva et al 2012 evaluated the scenarios comprising two irrigation i and two n levels and found that a 20 reduction in full irrigation and 50 reduction in the recommended n application reduced tuber yield considerably with the evaluation of the interaction of six irrigation and four nitrogen scenarios king et al 2011 found significant interactions between irrigation and n rates for tuber yield water use efficiency and gross return peralta and stöckle 2001 concluded that reducing fertilization rates would be the only effective approach to reducing nitrate leaching arora et al 2013 discovered that the effect of irrigation on tuber yield water use and n uptake was greater when n was sufficient montoya et al 2016 after studying 5i scenarios came up with the finding that the most efficient use of water would be associated with the irrigations meeting 60 80 of crop water demand various researchers including errebhi et al 1998 jégo et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 verhagen 1997 and woli et al 2016 found that nitrate leaching would be greater with a larger irrigation amount a longer irrigation interval a higher n application rate and a lighter soil and that the increase in leaching with an increase in irrigation water would be smaller for a longer irrigation interval and a lighter soil but larger for a higher n rate so far ample studies have been conducted on the interaction of irrigation and n fertilizer application rates however studies that include the effect of soil type and weather conditions are limited especially information regarding the impact of different weather conditions during the main phenological phases on potato productivity nitrate leaching and economic returns are rare literature is lacking on the interactions among crop phenological phase irrigation amount soil type and weather condition on tuber yield nitrate leaching and profit margins an improved understanding of the interactions among management and environmental factors could help adopt better management practices production practices involving fertilization and irrigation must be sound from both economic and environmental perspectives reflecting differences among soil properties and weather conditions shock et al 2007 and balanced from both agronomic and economic perspectives hopkins et al 2015 although columbia basin is the highest potato yielder in the world agro economic environmental studies on potato production for this region are very limited this study was conducted to assess how changes in irrigation amount soil type and weather condition at various phenological phases of potato would affect tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching and profit margins 2 materials and methods this study was conducted using a systems analysis and modeling approach which is valuable method for analyzing the response of agricultural systems under different climatic geographical and management conditions tsuji et al 1998 wallach et al 2014 potato tuber yields and the associated nitrate leaching were simulated for various irrigation soil and weather scenarios using a widely tested and used potato model arora et al 2013 prasad et al 2015 stastna et al 2010 called simulation of underground bulking storage organs substor griffin et al 1993 singh et al 1998 2 1 the substor potato model the substor potato model belongs to decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2015 jones et al 2003 a suite of computer programs that facilitate the application of a family of crop models using weather data soil properties genotype parameters and crop management information as inputs substor potato simulates the daily dynamics of water nitrogen biomass phenology and tuber yield accumulation among other things the models of soil water and soil n dynamics used in the substor potato are capacity type the potato model assumes five phenological stages pre planting sprout elongation emergence tuber initiation maturity has five genotypic parameters that control plant growth and development processes such as leaf area expansion tuber initiation potential tuber growth rate and tuber growth cessation and uses various relative temperature functions with values ranging from 0 to 1 for each cardinal temperature base optimum and maximum for simulating the temperature effects on leaf root and tuber growth photosynthesis and tuber initiation potato growth and development are simulated based on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass in relation to intercepted radiation photoperiodicity and temperature tuber growth is controlled by the potential tuber growth rate and soil water and n balances soil water balance comprises precipitation irrigation infiltration deep drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and plant transpiration processes plant transpiration is defined by the potential evapotranspiration plant root distribution and the plant available water in the soil computed as the difference between field capacity and wilting point values soil nitrogen balance consists of various n processes such as mineralization immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonification and plant n uptake which in turn is defined by crop demand and soil supply for details the reader is referred to griffin et al 1993 and singh et al 1998 2

geographical distribution the availability of long term historical weather data and major potato growing areas in the columbia basin then the effects of irrigation amount soil type and weather on tuber yield nitrate leaching and profit margin were assessed using five amounts of irrigation two types of soil and five types of weather the effect of each weather type was examined with 12 different growth phases the five levels of irrigation were a seasonal amount of 200 300 400 500 and 600 mm a given amount of irrigation was applied during the growing season following an assumed crop canopy coverage curve fig 1 king and stark 2014 for instance if x mm of irrigation were to be applied irrigation would be given once in every three days in such a way that the amount given per irrigation would follow the crop demand represented by the canopy coverage curve and that the total seasonal amount would equal x nitrogen was applied at the rate of 336 kg ha 1 the recommended rate for this area lauer 1985 roberts et al 1991 woli et al 2016 to minimize losses and improve uptake efficiency one third of it was applied at planting and the rest as in season alva 2004a 2004b errebhi et al 1998 in six equal parts the first in season part was applied 10 days after tuber initiation which was assumed to occur at 50 days after planting dap zebarth and rosen 2007 and the other applications were conducted at 10 day intervals soil properties play a major role in soil water dynamics the property values control various flows in the soil water balance such as surface runoff infiltration deep drainage water retention capillary rise etc in the columbia basin most of the soils used in potato growing are fine sand or sandy loam thus based on the distribution of local soil types in the basin and the suitability for growing potatoes hipple 2011 two soils were considered as representative soils for the region taunton sandy loam mixed mesic xeric haplodurid and quincy fine sand mixed mesic xeric torriorthent these soils were distinct in terms of water retention capacity taunton sandy loam was moderately drained whereas quincy fine sand was extremely drained the relevant properties of the two soils are presented in table 1 because including additional soils basically similar to the above might not provide new information about the soil effects no additional soils were considered additionally one of the basic objectives of this study was to compare different locations in the region in terms of climate difference in order to avoid any confounding effects of local soils on climate comparison therefore no location specific soils were considered a potato plant has five growth phases zebarth and rosen 2007 i sprout development 1 30 dap ii plant establishment 31 50 dap iii

combinations thereof i ii iii iv v i ii i iii i iv i v ii v iii v and iv v the five types of weather considered were severe cold mild cold average mild hot and severe hot as explained in the following paragraph the effects of the above factors were studied with 75 years of historical weather data 1941 2015 the potato growing season in each year was divided into five periods one for each growth phase using the growth phase windows stated above then average temperature was computed for each period in each year from the 75 temperature values of each period the 5th 23rd 27th 48th 52nd 73rd 77th and 95th percentiles were computed the years belonging to 5th 23rd 27th 48th 52nd 73rd 77th and 95th percentiles of temperature values were then defined as severe cold mild cold average mild hot and severe hot years respectively thus the probability of occurrence of each of these weather scenarios that was considered was 0 05 such classification was carried out for each growth phase for each growth phase year type referred to hereafter as weather type combination the weather data during a given growth phase were pulled from the years belonging to the weather type for each weather type these pulled periodical or partial seasonal weather type specific weather data from all growth phases were then combined to form the full seasonal weather data which finally were used in model simulations 2 3 model simulations the model simulations were carried out for russet burbank a very popular potato cultivar in this region collinge et al 2010 the substor potato model was already calibrated and evaluated for russet burbank in this region by woli et al 2016 their results showed that the model performance was quite satisfactory in the current study therefore no further evaluation was conducted the potato model was used to simulate tuber yield and nitrate n leaching for a number of scenarios comprising 12 growth phases 5 irrigation amounts 2 soil types and 5 weather

included in the computation of profit margin these costs were assumed to be constant for all scenarios because the main idea of this study was to assess the effects of irrigation and n fertilization only 2 5 significance testing statistical significance tests were performed to examine if the values of a response variable across the levels of a factor were different from each other using the pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test wilcoxon 1945 a nonparametric alternative to the two sample t test with bonferroni as the p value adjustment method bonferroni 1936 the wilcoxon test was used because the assumption of normality was not met for each test for the analysis of variance test the statistical analyses were performed using r project www r project org 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and soil effects on leaching nitrate leaching increased almost exponentially with an increase in the amount of irrigation water table 2 this increase was expected because more amount of water present in the soil caused more drainage and thus more losses of n this result was in agreement with the findings of several previous researchers such as giletto and echeverria 2013 han et al 1995 jégo et al 2008 and poch massegú et al 2014 that the amount of nitrate leached was directly associated with the amount of water irrigated nitrate leaching was greater in the quincy soil than in the taunton soil table 2 the higher leaching in the quincy soil was because it was much sandier and lighter than the taunton soil and extremely drained hipple 2011 lighter soils have higher potential for nitrate leaching especially in a shallow rooted crop such as potato because of their lower retention capacity for water and soluble nutrients alva 2004a hodges 1999 prasad et al 2015 shrestha et al 2010 the leaching difference between the two soils increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water fig 2 the rate of nitrate leaching with respect to irrigation water was higher for the quincy soil this difference was likely because the quincy soil having very low water holding capacity drained more quantity of water and its solutes than did the taunton soil and a larger quantity of water thus drained removed more amount of n it contained 3 2 irrigation and soil effects on yield tuber yield increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water until it peaked at 400 mm and declined thereafter table 2 these results indicated that 400 mm is the optimum amount of irrigation for potatoes in this area woli et al 2016 who examined the effects of irrigation amount with five levels 400 800 mm also came up with the same finding although the optimum amount may seem unlikely to compare with the potential evapotranspiration eto of 800 mm in this area the amounts of nitrate leached were significantly larger for the irrigation amounts larger than 400 mm fig 2 the decrease in yield because of the decrease in soil n due to leaching was so large that even the larger amounts of irrigation were not able to compensate for the yield losses caused by n leaching compared with the taunton soil the quincy soil was associated with smaller yields table 2 the smaller yield was because of the availability of less quantity of n for plant uptake due to more nitrate leaching the smaller yield was also likely due to the availability of less water in a lighter soil potato plants have low tolerance to soil water stress because they have relatively sparse and shallow root systems jabro et al 2012 shock et al 2007 arora et al 2013 also observed that yield and water productivity would be less on a lighter soil for comparable irrigation and n regime the yield difference between the two soils increased with an increase in irrigation amount fig 2 the increase in yield with an increase in irrigation amount up to 400 mm was larger in the taunton soil whereas the decrease in yield with an increase in irrigation amount beyond 400 mm was larger in the quincy soil the larger yield increase in the taunton soil was because the amount of nitrate leached up to the irrigation amount of 400 mm was very small so n uptake was higher because the water holding capacity of this soil was higher its water use efficiency was also higher the larger yield decrease in the quincy soil was because the amount of nitrate leached beyond the irrigation amount of 400 mm was very large so n uptake was lower the water use efficiency of this soil was also lower because its water retention capacity was far lower than that of the taunton soil 3 3 irrigation and soil effects on profit the profit margin increased with an increase in irrigation water up to 300 mm for the quincy soil or 400 mm for the taunton soil and declined thereafter table 2 thus the irrigation water of 300 mm and 400 mm were indicated as the optimum amount for the quincy and taunton soils in this region respectively in terms of maximizing profit margin the largest profit margin with 300 mm of irrigation for the quincy soil was because nitrate leaching was negligible whereas tuber yields were close to the maximum fig 2 on the other hand the largest profit margin with 400 mm of irrigation for the taunton soil was because of very low nitrate leaching but the highest tuber yields with irrigation water of greater than or equal to 400 mm the taunton soil produced more yields than did the quincy soil compared with the irrigation water of less than 400 mm which was because leaching in the latter was much greater than that in the former when the irrigation amount was greater than 300 mm with an increase in irrigation beyond 300 or 400 mm therefore leaching increased significantly thus decreasing profit margin the profit margin was higher with the taunton soil than with the quincy soil table 2 this difference was expected because the taunton soil having higher water holding capacity was associated with lower nitrate leaching and higher tuber yields while lower leaching led to smaller leaching costs higher yield led to larger gross revenues the profit margin difference between the two soils increased with an increase in irrigation amount fig 2 the increase in profit margin with an increase in irrigation amount up to 400 mm was larger in the taunton soil whereas the decrease in profit margin with an increase in irrigation amount beyond 400 mm was larger in the quincy soil the larger profit margin increase in the taunton soil was because of the corresponding lower leaching and larger yields the larger profit margin decrease in the quincy soil was because of the corresponding higher leaching and smaller yields 3 4 weather effects on leaching depending on growth phase and location the periodical growth phase duration average temperature pat of the severe cold weather was 2 2 3 8 c below the long term average weather temperature lat the pat of the mild cold weather was 0 6 1 4 c below the lat the pat of the mild hot weather was 0 5 1 6 c above the lat and the pat of the severe hot weather was 2 2 5 4 c above the lat any change in weather from the long term average severe cold mild cold mild hot or severe hot at any potato phase sprout development plant establishment tuber initiation tuber bulking or tuber maturation did not affect nitrate leaching significantly in any soil or location in the columbia basin fig 3 the amount of nitrate leached for a given soil and location under all weather conditions at all plant growth phases were about the same these results however did not conform to the findings of several other researchers who observed that nitrate leaching would be impacted by temperature jabloun et al 2015 found that n leaching would increase with an increase in temperature due to an increase in mineralization similarly liang et al 2011 observed that increasing temperature could increase the rate of soil nitrification and thus the concentration of nitrate in the leachate wick et al 2012 on the other hand noticed that higher temperature would result in lower nitrate concentration of groundwater possibly due to an increase in evapotranspiration schweigert et al 2004 also observed that high temperatures often correlating with dryness would slow the process of mineralization eventually reducing nitrate leaching hill 1991 concluded that an increase in temperature would slow down the rate of leaching by increasing the rate of evapotranspiration and in the presence of crop cover by accelerating the rates of n uptake and crop growth whereas in the absence of crop cover would increase the rate of leaching by increasing the rate of nitrification turner and henry 2010 found that increase in nitrate leaching would generally occur when plant roots were largely inactive or plants were not fully established the disagreement of our results with those of the above researchers could be due to the following reasons first the temperature differences between the long term average weather and the mild cold or mild hot weathers were not significant 0 5 1 6 c second the soils used in our study had very low organic matter content so the expected enhanced rate of mineralization through organic matter decomposition was negligible third irrigations of smaller amounts were given frequently once every three days so low nitrate leaching and more accumulated soil n due to high evaporation was expected fourth n fertilizer was applied on small split doses every 10 days so the rates of nitrification were possibly low 3 5 weather effects on yield among the five weather types only severe hot weather was significantly influential on tuber yield fig 4 for all soils and locations the influence of this weather was greatest during tuber bulking phase iv and the least during the sprout development phase i and tuber initiation phase iii phases among the five growth phases phase iv was associated with the largest yield reduction whereas phase i did not have any yield reductions when severe hot weather conditions continued from phase i through phase iv from phase i through phase v from phase ii through phase v from phase iii through phase v or from phase iv through phase v the decrease in tuber yield was significant for other periods such as phase i through phase ii or phase i through phase iii tuber yield under severe hot conditions was about the same as those under average weather conditions of the 12 growth phases studied five basic plus seven combined the ii v phase was the most vulnerable to severe hot weather conditions the same results were found for both soils that is the weather type growth phase interaction effect was not significantly influenced by soil type the other weather conditions severe cold mild cold and mild hot during any single or combined growth phase did not significantly influence tuber yield for any soil or location the results that nitrate leaching was not impacted by weather type growth phase interactions showed that the tuber yield responses observed above were not due to the leaching of nitrate from the root zone but to the influence of temperature on plant physiology both mild cold and mild hot weather conditions at each of the five growth phases had about the same temperatures as had the long term average weather table 3 thus tuber yield under mild cold and mil hot weather conditions was not different from the ones under the average weather conditions at growth phase i sprout development the temperatures under both severe cold weather and severe hot weather were greater than 5 c the minimum temperature needed for tuber sprouting but were less than 18 c the upper limit of the optimum range for sprout growth mcgee et al 1986 these weather types during phase i therefore did not have tuber yields significantly smaller than those under the long term average weather during phase ii plant establishment the temperatures under severe cold weather and severe hot weather each were in between 10 c and 28 c the broad optimum range for photosynthesis dean 1994 above and below this range the rates of net photosynthesis decrease rapidly because the temperatures under these weather conditions at this growth phase did not fall outside of this range there were no significant yield reductions under these weather conditions accordingly the tuber yields under these weather types did not differ from the ones under the average weather during phase iii tuberization the temperatures under severe cold 14 15 c and severe hot 20 21 c weather conditions were close to 15 20 c the optimum range for tuber formation rykaczewska 2013 as were the temperatures of the average weather conditions 17 c thus there were no significant yield reductions due to these weather conditions at this growth phase accordingly tuber yield under these weathers was not different from the ones under the average weather during phase iv tuber bulking the severe cold weather had temperatures within 15 22 c the optimum range for tuber bulking dean 1994 thus tuber yield under this weather condition was not significantly lower than the yield for the average weather temperature range of 19 23 c under severe hot weather conditions during growth phase iv however temperatures were higher 25 26 c than the optimum range thus there were significant yield losses due to severe hot weather conditions at this phase accordingly the tuber yield differences between severe hot and average weather conditions were significant during growth phase v tuber maturation the severe cold weather had temperatures within the optimum range for tuber bulking whereas the temperatures were higher than the optimum range under severe hot weather during tuber maturation however temperature is not an important factor in terms of tuber yield although it is a critical factor for tuber quality thus tuber yield under severe hot weather was not significantly different from the ones under the average weather 3 6 weather effects on profit the effects of weather conditions on profit margins were similar to those on tuber yield fig 5 that is only severe hot weather was influential on profit margins the profit margin reduction of the five basic growth phases studied was greatest during phase iv and the greatest profit margin decrease of the seven combined phases was when all growth phases from the second through the fifth were exposed to severe hot weather the severe hot weather conditions during phase i did not actually reduce profit margins when severe hot weather continued from the first phase through the fourth or fifth phase or from the second third or fourth phase through the fifth phase the decrease in profit margin was significant these responses were mainly due to the effects of weather type growth phase interaction on tuber yield a change in yield led to a similar change in gross revenue and thus in profit margin as on tuber yield the interaction effects of weather type and growth phase on profit margin were not significant under severe cold mild cold or mild hot weather conditions which were because the corresponding interaction effects on tuber yield were not significant under these weather conditions to sum up nitrate leaching was higher with a larger irrigation and on a lighter soil the increase in leaching with an increase in irrigation water was higher for a lighter soil tuber yields were smaller with a lighter soil and increased with an increase in irrigation water until they peaked at 400 mm and declined thereafter the increase in yield with an increase in irrigation water of up to 400 mm was larger on a well drained soil whereas the decrease in yield with an increase in irrigation water beyond 400 mm was larger on an extremely drained soil profit margin was smaller on a lighter soil and increased with an increase in irrigation water of up to 300 mm for an extremely drained soil or up to 400 mm for a well drained soil and declined thereafter indicating these amounts as the optimum irrigation amounts for these soils in this region in terms of maximizing profit margins the increase in profit margin with an increase in irrigation up to the optimum amount was larger on a well drained soil whereas the decrease in profit margin with an increase in irrigation beyond the optimum amount was larger on an extremely drained soil any change in weather from the long term average during any potato growth phase was not found to affect leaching for any soil or location to tuber yield and profit margin only severe hot weather was influential the reductions in tuber yield and profit margin due to severe hot weather were highest during tuber bulking tb but lowest during sprout development sd and tuber initiation ti tuber yield and profit margin reductions were significant when severe hot weather continued from sd through tb or tuber maturation tm or from plant establishment pe ti or tb through tm of the various growth periods studied the pe tm period was the most vulnerable to severe hot weather in terms of reducing both tuber yield and profit margins managing water optimally taking into consideration crop phenological phase soil type and weather condition is crucial to improve water uptake efficiency and maximize yield and profits the findings of this study can be helpful to the people involved in potato production in this region in identifying the growth phase location soil and weather specific rates of irrigation aimed at maintaining high tuber yields and profits while minimizing the nitrate contamination of groundwater the findings however are based on the study where the factors and variables considered represent only simplified conditions for simplicity other crop management variables such as plant protection and tillage were assumed to be in standard conditions and fixed in reality these conditions might vary over space and time furthermore the finding that any change in weather from the long term average at any potato growth phase did not affect leaching is based on a specific set of growing conditions insignificant temperature differences between long term average weather and mild cold hot weathers very low organic matter containing soils frequent smaller irrigations and small split doses of n fertilizers the results could be very different if the growing conditions were different from the ones considered for instance if temperature differences were large or if irrigations were infrequent and large or if n fertilizer doses were large and undivided a change in weather from the long term average could impact leaching at one or more phenological phase due to the unavailability of sufficient data this study considered just one cultivar and a few locations and soils it also considered potato crops as continuous for the same reason although potatoes in this region are grown in rotations with other crops such as maize or wheat based on the availability of necessary data which is increasing over time some potential future studies may involve various cropping systems and additional cultivars and soils another consideration for a future study may be conducting a spatial analysis of potato production in this region from an agro economic environmental perspective 4 conclusions the findings of this study indicated that potato growers in the columbia basin might obtain highest profit margins with the irrigation of 300 mm on an extremely drained soil and 400 mm on a moderately drained soil it may be less profitable and environment friendly to apply larger amounts than these especially on a soil with low water holding capacity the potato growers need to be cautious while irrigating an extremely drained soil that profit margin may decrease substantially if irrigation is given beyond the optimum amount they are further cautioned that although the results showed no effect of weather change at any growth phase on leaching the results do not apply to heavy infrequent irrigations heavy undivided n fertilizations and large temperature anomalies they also need to be aware that tuber bulking is the most susceptible phase to severe hot weather and that tuber yield and profit margin are hit hardest if this weather continues from the vegetative establishment phase through the tuber maturation phase although it is not possible to control weather it is possible to mitigate its effects through the adoption of appropriate strategies such as crop canopy maintenance cultivar selection fertilization and irrigation for instance the potential impact of severe hot weather at tuber bulking the most vulnerable phase could be skipped by shifting the time of planting preponing or postponing a drier hotter year in this region may be anticipated from the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon if a certain year is forecast to be an el niño year this year is generally drier and hotter in the us pacific northwest another way for reducing the impact of severe hot weather could be using a heat tolerant cultivar the application of light frequent irrigations might also be an effective mitigation measure for minimizing the impact of severe hot weather using one or more of such strategies or measures potato growers in this region might protect their potatoes from severe hot weather acknowledgement we thank the u s department of agriculture national institute for food and agriculture usda nifa for supporting this work through a grant 
11538,the us pacific northwest is one of the most productive potato regions in the world however due to the high inputs nitrate contamination of groundwater is frequently documented and maximizing crop productivity while minimizing nitrate leaching is still challenging the goal of this study was to assess how irrigation level soil type and weather condition during various phenological phases would affect tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching and profit margin the cropping system model csm substor potato was used to simulate the response variables for various scenarios that comprised two soil types five irrigation levels five phenological phases five weather conditions and 75 years of historical weather data for 3 locations in this region the simulation results showed that nitrate leaching was higher with a higher amount of irrigation and for a lighter soil tuber yield and profit margins were lowest for a lighter soil and highest for 300 mm of irrigation for an extremely drained soil and 400 mm of irrigation for a well drained soil the increase in profit margins with an increase in total irrigation up to 400 mm was highest for a well drained soil whereas the decrease in profit margins with an increase in irrigation beyond a total amount of 300 mm was larger for an extremely drained soil for the different types of weather scenarios that were studied only severe hot weather had an impact on tuber yield and profit margins the reduction was highest at tuber bulking and significant when hot weather continued from sprout development through tuber bulking or from plant establishment through tuber maturation however any change in weather condition from the long term average for any growth phase did not affect leaching these findings might be helpful to potato growers in this region to protect their potatoes from adverse weather conditions through appropriate mitigation strategies keywords dssat leaching model phenological phase potato profit simulation substor weather 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is one of the most valuable field crops in the pacific northwest region of the usa the columbia river basin is the most productive area for high quality processing potatoes alva et al 2012 and has the highest potato yield in the world washington state potato commission wspc 2015 this area has a comparative advantage over other potato growing areas in the united states due to close proximity to foreign markets economical production inputs excellent environmental conditions and good irrigation facilities beleiciks 2005 wspc 2007 the columbia basin consists of long growing seasons rich volcanic soils and a semi arid climate characterized by long hot dry days and cool nights wspc 2007 due to these ideal growing conditions potato production in this area can be conducted at a large scale in rotation with other high yielding crops such as maize vegetables and wheat the major inputs to potato production in the columbia basin are nitrogen n and water potato growers in this region use high rates of these inputs peralta and stöckle 2001 since the cost associated with them relative to the expected income from the crop is small hodges 1999 the high rates of n and water are expected to transport nitrate below the root zone and eventually contaminate groundwater the groundwater in this region contains a high concentration of nitrate cook et al 1996 wsde 2011 nitrate leaching is influenced by various crop environmental and management factors such as growth phase irrigation soil type and weather condition alva et al 2012 cambouris et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 potato management practices must reflect differences among climatic conditions soil properties and water management among other things zebarth and rosen 2007 it is important to optimally manage n and water for maintaining high yield levels and profits while minimizing nitrate pollution of the groundwater alva 2004a zebarth and rosen 2007 the excess or deficiency of water or n can have harmful effects on the environment profit and tuber yield goffart et al 2011 public concern about the sustainability of agro ecosystems and environmental quality is increasing thus emphasizing the need for developing management strategies that can improve n and water use efficiencies and minimize losses badr et al 2012 because the roots of potato plants are comparatively sparse and shallow jabro et al 2012 shock et al 2007 the retention capacity of a soil for water and soluble nutrients plays an important role in nitrate leaching in this crop because soils differ in retention capacity nitrate leaching is expected to be different for different soil types alva 2004a cambouris et al 2008 fertilization and irrigation guidelines are supposed to be location specific because the amounts of fertilizer and water to be applied may be defined by soil type and weather both of which vary significantly across space potato production is greatly affected by weather conditions an unpredictable environment can have profound effects on both tuber yield and quality pavek et al 2015 for the optimal occurrence of each phenological phase especially sprout development tuber initiation and tuber growth optimum daytime and nighttime temperatures are required dwelle et al 1981 fao 2015 kooman and haverkort 1995 wheeler et al 1986 weather conditions at planting impact the length of the growing season through the influence on emergence for instance continued cool temperatures may prolong the rest period and thus delay sprout development cool nights during tuber bulking on the other hand may promote tuber growth montoya et al 2016 any interruption of ideal weather conditions may result in reduced tuber growth rates and losses in yield and quality dean 1994 any condition that limits healthy foliage growth disrupts tuber growth or shifts dry matter partitioning from the tubers to the foliage decreases yield potential temperature is one of the key factors that affect tuber bulking and shift the balance between vine and tuber growth dwelle and love 2003 temperature and precipitation are the key meteorological factors that control nitrate leaching wick et al 2012 temperature influences a number of processes that are involved in nitrate leaching hill 1991 and is the dominating factor for the variability of the nitrate concentration in leachate liang et al 2011 weather conditions affect the potential for n loss by influencing various processes such as nitrification denitrification and volatilization nitrate leaching may occur once n is converted into nitrate a water soluble product through the nitrification process weather also impacts water uptake and the soil water balance because the relative importance of plant available soil moisture varies across plant growth phases shock et al 1993 wright and stark 1990 the effects of weather conditions on potato production and associated nitrate leaching are therefore affected by the phenological phase of the potato plant the challenge of developing best management practices that maximize crop productivity while minimizing harmful environmental impacts still exists in spite of the considerable progress that has been made in improving the understanding of n and water management effects on tuber yield quality and n losses shrestha et al 2010 zebarth and rosen 2007 determining the correct application rates for fertilizer and irrigation is still challenging despite decades of research peralta and stöckle 2001 shrestha et al 2010 as shown by the reports of nitrate contamination of groundwater potato tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching have been assessed in various studies that have evaluated different irrigation and n fertilization regimes for instance alva et al 2012 evaluated the scenarios comprising two irrigation i and two n levels and found that a 20 reduction in full irrigation and 50 reduction in the recommended n application reduced tuber yield considerably with the evaluation of the interaction of six irrigation and four nitrogen scenarios king et al 2011 found significant interactions between irrigation and n rates for tuber yield water use efficiency and gross return peralta and stöckle 2001 concluded that reducing fertilization rates would be the only effective approach to reducing nitrate leaching arora et al 2013 discovered that the effect of irrigation on tuber yield water use and n uptake was greater when n was sufficient montoya et al 2016 after studying 5i scenarios came up with the finding that the most efficient use of water would be associated with the irrigations meeting 60 80 of crop water demand various researchers including errebhi et al 1998 jégo et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 verhagen 1997 and woli et al 2016 found that nitrate leaching would be greater with a larger irrigation amount a longer irrigation interval a higher n application rate and a lighter soil and that the increase in leaching with an increase in irrigation water would be smaller for a longer irrigation interval and a lighter soil but larger for a higher n rate so far ample studies have been conducted on the interaction of irrigation and n fertilizer application rates however studies that include the effect of soil type and weather conditions are limited especially information regarding the impact of different weather conditions during the main phenological phases on potato productivity nitrate leaching and economic returns are rare literature is lacking on the interactions among crop phenological phase irrigation amount soil type and weather condition on tuber yield nitrate leaching and profit margins an improved understanding of the interactions among management and environmental factors could help adopt better management practices production practices involving fertilization and irrigation must be sound from both economic and environmental perspectives reflecting differences among soil properties and weather conditions shock et al 2007 and balanced from both agronomic and economic perspectives hopkins et al 2015 although columbia basin is the highest potato yielder in the world agro economic environmental studies on potato production for this region are very limited this study was conducted to assess how changes in irrigation amount soil type and weather condition at various phenological phases of potato would affect tuber yield and the associated nitrate leaching and profit margins 2 materials and methods this study was conducted

elongation emergence tuber initiation maturity has five genotypic parameters that control plant growth and development processes such as leaf area expansion tuber initiation potential tuber growth rate and tuber growth cessation and uses various relative temperature functions with values ranging from 0 to 1 for each cardinal temperature base optimum and maximum for simulating the temperature effects on leaf root and tuber growth photosynthesis and tuber initiation potato growth and development are simulated based on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass in relation to intercepted radiation photoperiodicity and temperature tuber growth is controlled by the potential tuber growth rate and soil water and n balances soil water balance comprises precipitation irrigation infiltration deep drainage unsaturated flow soil evaporation and plant transpiration processes plant transpiration is defined by the potential evapotranspiration plant root distribution and the plant available water in the soil computed as the difference between field capacity and wilting point values soil nitrogen balance consists of various n processes such as mineralization immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonification and plant n uptake which in turn is defined by crop demand and soil supply for details the reader is referred to griffin et al 1993 and singh et al 1998 2

geographical distribution the availability of long term historical weather data and major potato growing areas in the columbia basin then the effects of irrigation amount soil type and weather on tuber yield nitrate leaching and profit margin were assessed using five amounts of irrigation two types of soil and five types of weather the effect of each weather type was examined with 12 different growth phases the five levels of irrigation were a seasonal amount of 200 300 400 500 and 600 mm a given amount of irrigation was applied during the growing season following an assumed crop canopy coverage curve fig 1 king and stark 2014 for instance if x mm of irrigation were to be applied irrigation would be given once in every three days in such a way that the amount given per irrigation would follow the crop demand represented by the canopy coverage curve and that the total seasonal amount would equal x nitrogen was applied at the rate of 336 kg ha 1 the recommended rate for this area lauer 1985 roberts et al 1991 woli et al 2016 to minimize losses and improve uptake efficiency one third of it was applied at planting and the rest as in season alva 2004a 2004b errebhi et al 1998 in six equal parts the first in season part was applied 10 days after tuber initiation which was assumed to occur at 50 days after planting dap zebarth and rosen 2007 and the other applications were conducted at 10 day intervals soil properties play a major role in soil water dynamics the property values control various flows in the soil water balance such as surface runoff infiltration deep drainage water retention capillary rise etc in the columbia basin most of the soils used in potato growing are fine sand or sandy loam thus based on the distribution of local soil types in the basin and the suitability for growing potatoes hipple 2011 two soils were considered as representative soils for the region taunton sandy loam mixed mesic xeric haplodurid and quincy fine sand mixed mesic xeric torriorthent these soils were distinct in terms of water retention capacity taunton sandy loam was moderately drained whereas quincy fine sand was extremely drained the relevant properties of the two soils are presented in table 1 because including additional soils basically similar to the above might not provide new information about the soil effects no additional soils were considered additionally one of the basic objectives of this study was to compare different locations in the region in terms of climate difference in order to avoid any confounding effects of local soils on climate comparison therefore no location specific soils were considered a potato plant has five growth phases zebarth and rosen 2007 i sprout development 1 30 dap ii plant establishment 31 50 dap iii

combinations thereof i ii iii iv v i ii i iii i iv i v ii v iii v and iv v the five types of weather considered were severe cold mild cold average mild hot and severe hot as explained in the following paragraph the effects of the above factors were studied with 75 years of historical weather data 1941 2015 the potato growing season in each year was divided into five periods one for each growth phase using the growth phase windows stated above then average temperature was computed for each period in each year from the 75 temperature values of each period the 5th 23rd 27th 48th 52nd 73rd 77th and 95th percentiles were computed the years belonging to 5th 23rd 27th 48th 52nd 73rd 77th and 95th percentiles of temperature values were then defined as severe cold mild cold average mild hot and severe hot years respectively thus the probability of occurrence of each of these weather scenarios that was considered was 0 05 such classification was carried out for each growth phase for each growth phase year type referred to hereafter as weather type combination the weather data during a given growth phase were pulled from the years belonging to the weather type for each weather type these pulled periodical or partial seasonal weather type specific weather data from all growth phases were then combined to form the full seasonal weather data which finally were used in model simulations 2 3 model simulations the model simulations were carried out for russet burbank a very popular potato cultivar in this region collinge et al 2010 the substor potato model was already calibrated and evaluated for russet burbank in this region by woli et al 2016 their results showed that the model performance was quite satisfactory in the current study therefore no further evaluation was conducted the potato model was used to simulate tuber yield and nitrate n leaching for a number of scenarios comprising 12 growth phases 5 irrigation amounts 2 soil types and 5 weather classes april 1 and september 1 were considered the planting and harvesting dates respectively http www potatoes com our industry how we grow row spacing and seed rate were specified as 86 cm and 45

the initial soil water content was set to field capacity and the residual n was assumed to be 15 kg ha 1 the other growing conditions were assumed to be standard and no stresses other than those of n

included in the computation of profit margin these costs were assumed to be constant for all scenarios because the main idea of this study was to assess the effects of irrigation and n fertilization only 2 5 significance testing statistical significance tests were performed to examine if the values of a response variable across the levels of a factor were different from each other using the pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test wilcoxon 1945 a nonparametric alternative to the two sample t test with bonferroni as the p value adjustment method bonferroni 1936 the wilcoxon test was used because the assumption of normality was not met for each test for the analysis of variance test the statistical analyses were performed using r project www r project org 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and soil effects on leaching nitrate leaching increased almost exponentially with an increase in the amount of irrigation water table 2 this increase was expected because more amount of water present in the soil caused more drainage and thus more losses of n this result was in agreement with the findings of several previous researchers such as giletto and echeverria 2013 han et al 1995 jégo et al 2008 and poch massegú et al 2014 that the amount of nitrate leached was directly associated with the amount of water irrigated nitrate leaching was greater in the quincy soil than in the taunton soil table 2 the higher leaching in the quincy soil was because it was much sandier and lighter than the taunton soil and extremely drained hipple 2011 lighter soils have higher potential for nitrate leaching especially in a shallow rooted crop such as potato because of their lower retention capacity for water and soluble nutrients alva 2004a hodges 1999 prasad et al 2015 shrestha et al 2010 the leaching difference between the two soils increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water fig 2 the rate of nitrate leaching with respect to irrigation water was higher for the quincy soil this difference was likely because the quincy soil having very low water holding capacity drained more quantity of water and its solutes than did the taunton soil and a larger quantity of water thus drained removed more amount of n it contained 3 2 irrigation and soil effects on yield tuber yield increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water until it peaked at 400 mm and declined thereafter table 2 these results indicated that 400 mm is the optimum amount of irrigation for potatoes in this area woli et al 2016 who examined the effects of irrigation amount with five levels 400 800 mm also came up with the same finding although the optimum amount may seem unlikely to compare with the potential evapotranspiration eto of 800 mm in this area the amounts of nitrate leached were significantly larger for the irrigation amounts larger than 400 mm fig 2 the decrease in yield because of the decrease in soil n due to leaching was so large that even the larger amounts of irrigation were not able to compensate for the yield losses caused by n leaching compared with the taunton soil the quincy soil was associated with smaller yields table 2 the smaller yield was because of the availability of less quantity of n for plant uptake due to more nitrate leaching the smaller yield was also likely due to the availability of less water in a lighter soil potato plants have low tolerance to soil water stress because they have relatively sparse and shallow root systems jabro et al 2012 shock et al 2007 arora et al 2013 also observed that yield and water productivity would be less on a lighter soil for comparable irrigation and n regime the yield difference between the two soils increased with an increase in irrigation amount fig 2 the increase in yield with an increase in irrigation amount up to 400 mm was larger in the taunton soil whereas the decrease in yield with an increase in irrigation amount beyond 400 mm was larger in the quincy soil the larger yield increase in the taunton soil was because the amount of nitrate leached up to the irrigation amount of 400 mm was very small so n uptake was higher because the water holding capacity of this soil was higher its water use efficiency was also higher the larger yield decrease in the quincy soil was because the amount of nitrate leached beyond the irrigation amount of 400 mm was very large so n uptake was lower the water use efficiency of this soil was also lower because its water retention capacity was far lower than that of the taunton soil 3 3 irrigation and soil effects on profit the profit margin increased with an increase in irrigation water up to 300 mm for the quincy soil or 400 mm for the taunton soil and declined thereafter table 2 thus the irrigation water of 300 mm and 400 mm were indicated as the optimum amount for the quincy and taunton soils in this region respectively in terms of maximizing profit margin the largest profit margin with 300 mm of irrigation for the quincy soil was because nitrate leaching was negligible whereas tuber yields were close to the maximum fig 2 on the other hand the largest profit margin with 400 mm of irrigation for the taunton soil was because of very low nitrate leaching but the highest tuber yields with irrigation water of greater than or equal to 400 mm the taunton soil produced more yields than did the quincy soil compared with the irrigation water of less than 400 mm which was because leaching in the latter was much greater than that in the former when the irrigation amount was greater than 300 mm with an increase in irrigation beyond 300 or 400 mm therefore leaching increased significantly thus decreasing profit margin the profit margin was higher with the taunton soil than with the quincy soil table 2 this difference was expected because the taunton soil having higher water holding capacity was associated with lower nitrate leaching and higher tuber yields while lower leaching led to smaller leaching costs higher yield led to larger gross revenues the profit margin difference between the two soils increased with an increase in irrigation amount fig 2 the increase in profit margin with an increase in irrigation amount up to 400 mm was larger in the taunton soil whereas the decrease in profit margin with an increase in irrigation amount beyond 400 mm was larger in the quincy soil the larger profit margin increase in the taunton soil was because of the corresponding lower leaching and larger yields the larger profit margin decrease in the quincy soil was because of the corresponding higher leaching and smaller yields 3 4 weather effects on leaching depending on growth phase and location the periodical growth phase duration average temperature pat of the severe cold weather was 2 2 3 8 c below the long term average weather temperature lat the pat of the mild cold weather was 0 6 1 4 c below the lat the pat of the mild hot weather was 0 5 1 6 c above the lat and the pat of the severe hot weather was 2 2 5 4 c above the lat any change in weather from the long term average severe cold mild cold mild hot or severe hot at any potato phase sprout development plant establishment tuber initiation tuber bulking or tuber maturation did not affect nitrate leaching significantly in any soil or location in the columbia basin fig 3 the amount of nitrate leached for a given soil and location under all weather conditions at all plant growth phases were about the same these results however did not conform to the findings of several other researchers who observed that nitrate leaching would be impacted by temperature jabloun et al 2015 found that n leaching would increase with an increase in temperature due to an increase in mineralization similarly liang et al 2011 observed that increasing temperature could increase the rate of soil nitrification and thus the concentration of nitrate in the leachate wick et al 2012 on the other hand noticed that higher temperature would result in lower nitrate concentration of groundwater possibly due to an increase in evapotranspiration schweigert et al 2004 also observed that high temperatures often correlating with dryness would slow the process of mineralization eventually reducing nitrate leaching hill 1991 concluded that an increase in temperature would slow down the rate of leaching by increasing the rate of evapotranspiration and in the presence of crop cover by accelerating the rates of n uptake and crop growth whereas in the absence of crop cover would increase the rate of leaching by increasing the rate of nitrification turner and henry 2010 found that increase in nitrate leaching would generally occur when plant roots were largely inactive or plants were not fully established the disagreement of our results with those of the above researchers could be due to the following reasons first the temperature differences between the long term average weather and the mild cold or mild hot weathers were not significant 0 5 1 6 c second the soils used in our study had very low organic matter content so the expected enhanced rate of mineralization through organic matter decomposition was negligible third irrigations of smaller amounts were given frequently once every three days so low nitrate leaching and more accumulated soil n due to high evaporation was expected fourth n fertilizer was applied on small split doses every 10 days so the rates of nitrification were possibly low 3 5 weather effects on yield among the five weather types only severe hot weather was significantly influential on tuber yield fig 4 for all soils and locations the influence of this weather was greatest during tuber bulking phase iv and the least during the sprout development phase i and tuber initiation phase iii phases among the five growth phases phase iv was associated with the largest yield reduction whereas phase i did not have any yield reductions when severe hot weather conditions continued from phase i through phase iv from phase i through phase v from phase ii through phase v from phase iii through phase v or from phase iv through phase v the decrease in tuber yield was significant for other periods such as phase i through phase ii or phase i through phase iii tuber yield under severe hot conditions was about the same as those under average weather conditions of the 12 growth phases studied five basic plus seven combined the ii v phase was the most vulnerable to severe hot weather conditions the same results were found for both soils that is the weather type growth phase interaction effect was not significantly influenced by soil type the other weather conditions severe cold mild cold and mild hot during any single or combined growth phase did not significantly influence tuber yield for any soil or location the results that nitrate leaching was not impacted by weather type growth phase interactions showed that the tuber yield responses observed above were not due to the leaching of nitrate from the root zone but to the influence of temperature on plant physiology both mild cold and mild hot weather conditions at each of the five growth phases had about the same temperatures as had the long term average weather table 3 thus tuber yield under mild cold and mil hot weather conditions was not different from the ones under the average weather conditions at growth phase i sprout development the temperatures under both severe cold weather and severe hot weather were greater than 5 c the minimum temperature needed for tuber sprouting but were less than 18 c the upper limit of the optimum range for sprout growth mcgee et al 1986 these weather types during phase i therefore did not have tuber yields significantly smaller than those under the long term average weather during phase ii plant establishment the temperatures under severe cold weather and severe hot weather each were in between 10 c and 28 c the broad optimum range for photosynthesis dean 1994 above and below this range the rates of net photosynthesis decrease rapidly because the temperatures under these weather conditions at this growth phase did not fall outside of this range there were no significant yield reductions under these weather conditions accordingly the tuber yields under these weather types did not differ from the ones under the average weather during phase iii tuberization the temperatures under severe cold 14 15 c and severe hot 20 21 c weather conditions were close to 15 20 c the optimum range for tuber formation rykaczewska 2013 as were the temperatures of the average weather conditions 17 c thus there were no significant yield reductions due to these weather conditions at this growth phase accordingly tuber yield under these weathers was not different from the ones under the average weather during phase iv tuber bulking the severe cold weather had temperatures within 15 22 c the optimum range for tuber bulking dean 1994 thus tuber yield under this weather condition was not significantly lower than the yield for the average weather temperature range of 19 23 c under severe hot weather conditions during growth phase iv however temperatures were higher 25 26 c than the optimum range thus there were significant yield losses due to severe hot weather conditions at this phase accordingly the tuber yield differences between severe hot and average weather conditions were significant during growth phase v tuber maturation the severe cold weather had temperatures within the optimum range for tuber bulking whereas the temperatures were higher than the optimum range under severe hot weather during tuber maturation however temperature is not an important factor in terms of tuber yield although it is a critical factor for tuber quality thus tuber yield under severe hot weather was not significantly different from the ones under the average weather 3 6 weather effects on profit the effects of weather conditions on profit margins were similar to those on tuber yield fig 5 that is only severe hot weather was influential on profit margins the profit margin reduction of the five basic growth phases studied was greatest during phase iv and the greatest profit margin decrease of the seven combined phases was when all growth phases from the second through the fifth were exposed to severe hot weather the severe hot weather conditions during phase i did not actually reduce profit margins when severe hot weather continued from the first phase through the fourth or fifth phase or from the second third or fourth phase through the fifth phase the decrease in profit margin was significant these responses were mainly due to the effects of weather type growth phase interaction on tuber yield a change in yield led to a similar change in gross revenue and thus in profit margin as on tuber yield the interaction effects of weather type and growth phase on profit margin were not significant under severe cold mild cold or mild hot weather conditions which were because the corresponding interaction effects on tuber yield were not significant under these weather conditions to sum up nitrate leaching was higher with a larger irrigation and on a lighter soil the increase in leaching with an increase in irrigation water was higher for a lighter soil tuber yields were smaller with a lighter soil and increased with an increase in irrigation water until they peaked at 400 mm and declined thereafter the increase in yield with an increase in irrigation water of up to 400 mm was larger on a well drained soil whereas the decrease in yield with an increase in irrigation water beyond 400 mm was larger on an extremely drained soil profit margin was smaller on a lighter soil and increased with an increase in irrigation water of up to 300 mm for an extremely drained soil or up to 400 mm for a well drained soil and declined thereafter indicating these amounts as the optimum irrigation amounts for these soils in this region in terms of maximizing profit margins the increase in profit margin with an increase in irrigation up to the optimum amount was larger on a well drained soil whereas the decrease in profit margin with an increase in irrigation beyond the optimum amount was larger on an extremely drained soil any change in weather from the long term average during any potato growth phase was not found to affect leaching for any soil or location to tuber yield and profit margin only severe hot weather was influential the reductions in tuber yield and profit margin due to severe hot weather were highest during tuber bulking tb but lowest during sprout development sd and tuber initiation ti tuber yield and profit margin reductions were significant when severe hot weather continued from sd through tb or tuber maturation tm or from plant establishment pe ti or tb through tm of the various growth periods studied the pe tm period was the most vulnerable to severe hot weather in terms of reducing both tuber yield and profit margins managing water optimally taking into consideration crop phenological phase soil type and weather condition is crucial to improve water uptake efficiency and maximize yield and profits the findings of this study can be helpful to the people involved in potato production in this region in identifying the growth phase location soil and weather specific rates of irrigation aimed at maintaining high tuber yields and profits while minimizing the nitrate contamination of groundwater the findings however are based on the study where the factors and variables considered represent only simplified conditions for simplicity other crop management variables such as plant protection and tillage were assumed to be in standard conditions and fixed in reality these conditions might vary over space and time furthermore the finding that any change in weather from the long term average at any potato growth phase did not affect leaching is based on a specific set of growing conditions insignificant temperature differences between long term average weather and mild cold hot weathers very low organic matter containing soils frequent smaller irrigations and small split doses of n fertilizers the results could be very different if the growing conditions were different from the ones considered for instance if temperature differences were large or if irrigations were infrequent and large or if n fertilizer doses were large and undivided a change in weather from the long term average could impact leaching at one or more phenological phase due to the unavailability of sufficient data this study considered just one cultivar and a few locations and soils it also considered potato crops as continuous for the same reason although potatoes in this region are grown in rotations with other crops such as maize or wheat based on the availability of necessary data which is increasing over time some potential future studies may involve various cropping systems and additional cultivars and soils another consideration for a future study may be conducting a spatial analysis of potato production in this region from an agro economic environmental perspective 4 conclusions the findings of this study indicated that potato growers in the columbia basin might obtain highest profit margins with the irrigation of 300 mm on an extremely drained soil and 400 mm on a moderately drained soil it may be less profitable and environment friendly to apply larger amounts than these especially on a soil with low water holding capacity the potato growers need to be cautious while irrigating an extremely drained soil that profit margin may decrease substantially if irrigation is given beyond the optimum amount they are further cautioned that although the results showed no effect of weather change at any growth phase on leaching the results do not apply to heavy infrequent irrigations heavy undivided n fertilizations and large temperature anomalies they also need to be aware that tuber bulking is the most susceptible phase to severe hot weather and that tuber yield and profit margin are hit hardest if this weather continues from the vegetative establishment phase through the tuber maturation phase although it is not possible to control weather it is possible to mitigate its effects through the adoption of appropriate strategies such as crop canopy maintenance cultivar selection fertilization and irrigation for instance the potential impact of severe hot weather at tuber bulking the most vulnerable phase could be skipped by shifting the time of planting preponing or postponing a drier hotter year in this region may be anticipated from the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon if a certain year is forecast to be an el niño year this year is generally drier and hotter in the us pacific northwest another way for reducing the impact of severe hot weather could be using a heat tolerant cultivar the application of light frequent irrigations might also be an effective mitigation measure for minimizing the impact of severe hot weather using one or more of such strategies or measures potato growers in this region might protect their potatoes from severe hot weather acknowledgement we thank the u s department of agriculture national institute for food and agriculture usda

satellite overpass time and daily actual crop evapotranspiration et a over an intensive olive grove daily values were obtained by the use of the evaporative fraction method and corrected for latent heat available energy and evaporative fraction biases beta factor correction model estimates were compared to ground based measurements heat flux densities eddy covariance method were recorded and

evapotranspiration into its evaporation and transpiration components evaporation estimated from the stseb model was compared with evaporation estimated from a model adjusted from local lysimeter measurements transpiration data obtained from calibrated sap flow measurements were after local calibration also compared to model estimates model results agreed with the measured data showing under

olive orchards 100 trees ha 1 have been replaced by intensive to super intensive ones 2000 trees ha 1 especially in the south of portugal with mediterranean climate conditions this development demands improved water management and optimised irrigation practices in terms of quantifying olive water requirements this study aims to estimate actual evapotranspiration et a and its contributing parts of canopy transpiration le v and soil water evaporation le s as the latter is often seen as water loss for irrigated crops an existing simplified two source energy balance model stseb based on norman et al 1995 and further simplified by sánchez et al 2008b has been in combination with satellite imagery tested for separately estimating le s and le v on a daily basis to estimate the amount of water transferred to the atmosphere from different crops various estimation approaches have been developed in general using implicitly or explicitly the leaf surface conductance bulk stomatal and leaf boundary layer due to the difficulty in obtaining this variable for every crop in any water status condition simple semi empirical models have been used to calculate et a for decades the principle is based on the reference evapotranspiration et 0 estimated from on site collected meteorological data which then is multiplied by a crop coefficient obtaining et m k c et m et 0 and finally by a stress coefficient k s et a et m in a well known group of guidelines fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 proposed estimating et 0 based on the penman montheith equation which incorporates aerodynamic and physiological parameters of a previously defined reference grass to retrieve k c and k s coefficients an alternative approach to obtain et a and its contributing parts le v and le s was adopted from the energy balance equation eq a 1 a distinction is drawn between one and two source models to account for the different heat transfers from the soil surface and the plant canopy one source models assume one surface temperature and aerodynamic resistance for the zone of soil and vegetation cover while the two source models identify soil and vegetation layers as separate sources of

particularly dry environments while the tseb model was in agreement with the et a measurements generally tseb models give reasonable results for et a and are used for separately estimating le v and le

fernandes silva 2008 plants are in comfort between 0 4 mpa and 0 7 mpa the observed values for the well irrigated subplot 3 were never below 0 5 mpa conceição et al 2017 trees with a pre dawn leaf water potential of down to 0 5 mpa were therefore defined as being in comfort values below this point indicated water stressed olive trees 2 2 on site measurements 2 2 1 measurement of energy heat fluxes at the main plot the installation of ec sensors allowed the measurement of the flux densities of latent heat flux density le and sensible heat flux density h with a three dimensional sonic anemometer and a krypton hygrometer csat3 d and kh20 respectively campbell scientific usa which were mounted on a metallic tower at the height of 4 5 m above ground and oriented into the dominant wind direction fig 1 raw fluxes h and le were recorded by a data logger cr10x campbell scientific usa and 30 min averages were stored corrections for air density variations wpl correction webb et al 1980 and oxygen cross sensitivity for krypton hygrometers because of oxygen absorption tanner et al 1993 were performed the net radiation r n was measured with net radiometers nr2 and nrlite kipp zonen netherlands and the soil heat flux density g was recorded using six heat flux plates heat flux sensors hfp01 and hft 3 1 manufactured by hukseflux and radiation and energy balance systems respectively with known thermal conductivity the heat flux plates were buried in the ground at a depth of 0 05 m perpendicular to the flow direction to quantify the heat stored in the soil layer between 0 and 0 05 m copper constantan thermocouples were used at 0 025 m soil depth 1 30 hz 10 min average further information about equipment and data processing are described in conceição et al 2017 a simplified footprint analysis schuepp et al 1990 allowed the evaluation of the relative contribution of fluxes coming from different areas within the plot to the total measured flux more than 85 of the measured le came from an upwind area less than 140 m away from the measurements point le and h fluxes were selected according to the wind direction taking into consideration the outputs from the footprint analysis conceição et al 2017 in relation to the fetch for each direction 2 2 2 transpiration and soil evaporation at the main plot using the thermal dissipation method granier 1985 the sap flow was recorded for seven trees in the main plot measurements were taken every 60 s and averaged every 30 min by a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific usa for details see also conceição et al 2017 measurements of le s with micro lysimeters were taken in total ten lysimeters were installed here six of them were along the tree line with a spacing of 0 75 m and another four near the line where two of which were in the shade of the crown and two exposed to the sun tezza 2014 the lysimeter measurements were used to model le s for the days were no measurements were taken using locally adjusted model parameters as described in tezza 2014 and conceição et al 2017 by subtracting le s micro lysimeters or model from et a measured at the ec tower le v was obtained subsequently le v was compared with average sap flow data in order to correct it obtaining a time series for le v of the main plot under deficit irrigation where also total le was measured afterwards it was possible to infer le v for the small subplots 2 and 3 in the way explained in the following section 2 2 3 transpiration of the two subplots for the duration of a stress period 3 august to 15 september 2011 the experimental site had additionally two small subplots outside the footprint area of the main plot fig 1 in each of the two subplots sap flow measurements for six trees were taken also using the thermal dissipation method as described by granier 1985 subplots 2 38 1 13 99 n 8 10 42 68 w and 3 38 1 11 81 n 8 10 41 12 w were equipped with independent irrigation systems and a stress period was temporarily induced from 3 august day of the year doy 215 until 15 september 258 2011 in subplot 2 only during the stress period of six weeks subplot 2 remained non irrigated while subplot 3 was kept well irrigated for reference pre dawn leaf water potential above 0 5 mpa this experimental lay out was used to analyse the impact of water shortage on water stress indicators and water fluxes ferreira et al 2012a before the beginning of the stress period all plots had reached maximum water status comfort 0 5 mpa of pre dawn leaf water potential the main plot 1 continued to be deficit irrigated approximately 1 4 mm day 1 the value of le v for the well irrigated subplot 3 was obtained by dividing le v of the main plot by the stress coefficient of the main plot le v 3 le v 1 k s 1 which takes into account the le v reduction in the main plot being deficit irrigated this factor k s 0 88 was retrieved from the relationship between pre dawn leaf water potential and k s or relative le v obtained during the stress period ferreira et al 2012b conceição et al 2017 by using the values measured in all subplots for the day of satellite overpass during this stress cycle the same principle was applied to le v for the highly stressed subplot 2 day of satellite of overpass on doy 255 2011 by using the measured relative le v of this plot i e k s 0 77 being le v of stressed subplot 2 le v of the well irrigated subplot 3 multiplied by 0 77 because le v 2 le v 3 k s 2 five cloud free landsat 5 thematic mapper l5 tm images were selected in approximately monthly intervals from may until october 2011 including one image

earth s surface the level 1 product of surface reflectance data level 1 product bands 1 5 and 7 atmospherically corrected by landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and the brightness temperature band 6 provided by the u s geological survey earth resources observation and science eros data center http earthexplorer usgs gov were downloaded and further processed for the estimates of the main plot a square of 3 3 pixels within the footprint area was extracted and averaged while for the subplots 2 and 3 central coordinates were used to extract the corresponding pixels in the images to compare with ground observations the subplots themselves covered only around 941 m2 28 trees corresponding to the 30 30 m pixel size of the visible band of landsat we have tested two approaches averaging over the overlapping pixels or using just the closest pixel to the center of each subplot and since the latter lead to better estimates we have used it in our calculations knowing that the tree lines were rather uniform landsat derived albedo α land surface temperature t rad and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi see section 3 4 were plotted against et a for 15 observation days along the year 2011 the time pattern of those variables was compared to verify that the input data for the stseb model were in line with the annual distribution of remote sensing data furthermore simple and multiple regression models using as predictors α t rad or ndvi were fitted to evaluate how the stseb model improved the et a estimation over simple statistical models the global solar radiation s was provided by the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams and downloaded from soda solar energy services for professionals http www soda pro com air temperature t a and wind

hemispheric up welling sky irradiance l atm were obtained by introducing radio sounding data into the modtran 4 0 code berk 1999 the atmospheric parameters τ l atm and l atm served for atmospheric corrections in order to obtain t rad from brightness temperature and were calculated by the atmospheric correction parameter calculator http atmcorr gsfc nasa gov barsi et al 2003 2 3 model description the stseb model sánchez et al 2008a is based on the energy balance equation eq a 1 and estimates instantaneous values for r n h and g w m 2 from meteorological data and satellite imagery in order to obtain le to retrieve daily values from the instantaneous ones the ef method described at the end of this section was applied i e the ratio of le and the available energy during satellite overpass g was estimated as a portion of r n eq a 11 choudhury et al 1987 and considered for retrieving daily et a using the ef method 2 3 1 instantaneous values one of the key processes in the stseb model is the successful partitioning into the contributing parts of the vegetation v and the soil s timmermans et al 2007 kustas et al 2012 sánchez et al 2015b in order to obtain p v eq 1 valor and caselles 1996 this means that p v is calculated from the ndvi eq a 5 and the coefficient k eq a 6 1 p v 1 ndvi ndvi s 1 ndvi ndvi s k 1 ndvi ndvi v both ndvi and k were calculated from the red and near infrared bands b 3 and b 4 band designations b i for landsat satellites are provided by the official site of u s geological survey usgs http www usgs gov the fully vegetated and bare soil areas were manually selected by the use of the ndvi and averaged they are referred to by the subscripts of v and s respectively region of interest roi table 1 the rois obtained for the ndvi v and ndvi s classification were also used to obtain the average values of the bands for vegetated and bare soil regions for k the classification of the ndvi into vegetated and bare soil regions are found in sobrino et al 2004 separating t s and t v when only t rad is available is probably the most intricate issue in the stseb models hereby for each day t rad retrieved from the thermal band eq a 7 was plotted against p v main plot 3 3 pixels where isolines with an almost linear relationship were obtained carlson 2007 yang et al 2015b kasim and usman 2016 first estimates for the components soil t s and canopy t v temperature of t rad were retrieved here higher temperatures related to low values of p v bare soil pixels represented the estimate of t s while lower temperatures related to high values of p v vegetated pixels gave the estimate for t v during satellite overpass table 2 the partitioning of the different fluxes into soil 1 p v and canopy p v components was used to estimate h s eq a 10 and h v eq a 9 separately to be consistent this approach was also applied to estimating the contributing parts of soil and vegetation cover for r n adapting eq a 2 by using the soil and canopy specific emissivities and α following this methodology the component fluxes of le s and le v as well as total le were retrieved applying 2 le s r ns h s g 1 p v 3 le v r nv h v 4 le p v le v 1 p v le s 2 3 2 daily values finally daily values were retrieved by applying the ef constant method as described in ruan et al 2014 this algorithm assumes that ef is constant during the daytime hours and is defined for the total scene and the individual portions of canopy and soil respectively as 5 ef t i le i r ni g i 6 ef v i le v i r nv i 7 ef s i le s i r ns i g i where i denotes the instantaneous values measured or estimated at the time of satellite overpass for the total t scene the canopy v or soil s contribution gentine et al 2007 however van niel et al 2011 address three major surface energy balance interactions with ef that result in a bias those interactions are called beta factors and represent the systematic errors in le in the available energy r n g and in the evaporative fraction assuming daytime self preservation the combined influence of the beta factors was determined and multiplied as explained in van niel et al 2011 the daily values of et a were then multiplied by the combined beta factors as listed in table 4 physical background and application of the beta factors must be retrieved from the given reference as this is beyond of the scope of this paper daily

water density 1000 kg m 3 and ef i is the evaporative fraction for the total scene the soil or the vegetation contribution eqs 5 7 2 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data the stseb model relies on the surface reflectance and the thermal band of l5 tm however for the time series landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus l7 etm data were also available a total of 15 observations from may 15 2011 until october 30 2011 were evaluated testing the representativeness of the five observations used for the stseb model since the stseb model was not used to estimate et a for the additional ten dates we limited ourselves to looking at the relation between landsat derived variables used in the stseb model and in situ measured et a the combination of tm and etm data for the stseb model would have further complicated our analysis and add additional variability different sensors and orbits and was therefore not considered to investigate whether et a could be modeled by simple linear regression on the predictor variables α ndvi and t rad which were extracted from a time series of landsat data multiple linear regression techniques were used the linear model assumes that the response variable can be written as a linear function of the predictors plus a gaussian random error ϵ formally 9 y i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β p x p i ϵ i i 1 n for the n observations and p predictors where ϵ i has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and fixed but unknown variance σ 2 the goodness of fit is evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 which measures the proportion of the variability of the response that is explained by the regression model nested models i e where only a subset of predictors is considered were compared using a f test to understand if the inclusion of additional variables lead to a significant increase in the coefficient of determination dytham 2011 3 results 3 1 instantaneous et a the satellite derived r n was underestimated by at most 26 w m 2 compared to that measured on average the estimated values mismatched the ground measurements by only 3 mean absolute deviation mad of 17 w m 2 the absolute maximum difference for h was 27 w m 2 resulting in a relative deviation of 4 mad of 16 w m 2 for g a maximum absolute difference of 3 w m 2 was observed and on average the values differed from the measured soil heat flux densities by 1 mad of 1 3 w m 2 for the main plot for le the maximum deviation of 28 w m 2 resulting in an error of 18 mad of 36 w m 2 on average for the days analysed see also table 3 3 2 daily et a comparing the daily estimated values of r n le and h with the ones observed at the main plot differences of 3 mad of 5 w m 2 14 mad of 15 w m 2 and 3 mad of 5 w m 2 were observed on average respectively instantaneous values of g were estimated eq a 11 and considered for modeling in order to retrieve daily values of le by using the ef constant method in fig 2 the daily measured g is given which was between 0 6 and 17 w m 2 for the five days used for this study generally the daily estimated et a of the subplots were lower than the ones from the main plot with the exception of doy 255 which was the observation day during the stress period on that day et a either measured or estimated from the model was higher in subplot 3 being well irrigated therefore subplot 3 evapotranspirated more than the main plot which was kept deficit irrigated the model was able to detect a clear difference to subplot 2 receiving no irrigation water at that time table 4 even though the differences between observed and estimated values were rather small with exception of doy 207 for the main plot et a for subplots 2 and 3 were underestimated assuming the same conditions in comparison with the main plot except for doy 255 e g tree height and tree distribution water application and irrigation scheduling thus the beta factor correction as described by van niel et al 2011 was used to account for systematic errors made in le available energy r n g and the evaporative fraction assuming daytime self preservation the estimations especially for doy 207 could be improved table 4 in the main plot a difference of only 0 1 mm day 1 before 0 6 mm day 1 between measured and estimated et a was achieved after applying the beta factor of 1 19 subplots 2 and 3 were also corrected by this factor reducing the underestimation from 1 0 mm day 1 to 0 3 mm day 1 3 3 evaporation transpiration partitioning the possibility of separating evapotranspiration into its contributing portions of le v and le s by means of the stseb algorithm was explored again the ef constant method eqs 2 8 was used to estimate daily values from the records during the satellite overpass and the beta factor correction was applied as describe in section 2 3 2 a clear difference in le v was recorded during the stress period which lasted from doy 215 to 258 3 august until 15 september 2011 during this time the main plot was kept deficit irrigated while subplot 2 was not irrigated at all stressed and subplot 3 was kept near field capacity control accordingly subplot 3 transpired the most during the stress period while in relative terms subplot 2 transpired the least the daily measurements of le v at the main plot and the subplots with the corresponding estimates are given in fig 3 for doy 255 the graph displays extra data due to the fact that this was during the stress period applied to subplot 2 when le v for subplots 2 and 3 were also measured for the main plot the greatest differences were observed for doys 175 and 207 with an underestimation of 1 4 mm day 1 followed by doy 255 with an underestimation of 1 0 mm day 1 for the subplots 2 and 3 the greatest differences between observed and estimated le v were recorded at doy 175 when the overestimation was 1 9 and 1 6 mm day 1 respectively fig 3 in summary the estimated daily le v values for the main plot and the subplots were underestimated for the stress period doy 255 the stseb algorithm was able to detect differences in le v for the different water applications fig 3 where subplot 3 was highest control followed by the main plot deficit irrigated and the subplot 2 stressed the fraction of le s after application of ef method and systematic error correction was compared with the model estimates showing relatively large differences overestimation for the doys 175 207 and 255 of at most 1 1 mm day 1 but good agreement for the doys 143 and 303 0 2 mm day 1 table 5 3 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data as discussed the landsat data were used to derive α eq a 3 ndvi eqs a 5 1 and a 6 and to estimate t rad eq a 7 see also fig 4 b fig 4a depicts the relations between the landsat 5 7 derived variables α ndvi and t rad and et a in situ observations one can notice that the five observations used in earlier sections were well distributed among the available data which is an indication of their representativeness fig 4a shows that α had the best correlation with et a and that they were positively correlated this resulted from the combined effect of both canopy and inter row components of the landsat signal as summer progresses the herbaceous component of ground cover dries out and therefore the soil s reflectance increases simultaneously and independently le v rates also increase due to irrigation in combination with a higher atmospheric demand ndvi fig 4a on the other hand showed a very weak correlation with et a as expected it showed lower values in summer since the soil surface was almost bare and increased when the natural conditions were favourable for the development of the ground cover therefore ndvi variation reflected mostly the ground cover dynamics which was mostly driven by the inter rows since the leaf area of olive tree canopies was relatively stable over the course of the year häusler et al 2016 in the stseb model ndvi was in fact used essentially to distinguish the soil from the canopy it is worth noting that landsat derived α and ndvi happen to have an almost opposite time pattern although α correlates more with et a multiple linear regression analysis of the data in fig 4a was performed to understand if a combination of variables could describe the et a values the most important individual variable was α followed by t rad leading to a small increase of the goodness of fit from r 2 0 49 to r 2 0 54 the inclusion however of ndvi did not improve the model significantly p 0 5205 this is further evidence that the stseb model made better use of landsat derived data than a multiple regression model 4 discussion 4 1 instantaneous et a at the olive orchard le fluxes showed the largest error in relation to the other energy heat fluxes 18 and were overestimated on average however the errors for r n 3 h 4 and g 1 were rather small sánchez et al 2015a reported relative errors of 4 40 14 and 40 for r n g h and le respectively at a burnt forest area during the satellite overpass with the exception of g this tendency agrees with our results applying a similar version of the stseb model and comparing its estimates to ec measurements in another study the energy heat fluxes were estimated from a two layer model and compared to instantaneous values from ec measurements at an olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 they reported a rather small error of g 2 which agrees with our findings r n and h were generally both underestimated by around 5 while our observations resulted in an underestimation of r n and an overestimation of h the largest error was determined for le 7 a constant overestimation which is in agreement with our results nevertheless in our case study le had a larger deviation mainly due to the first observation date 23 may doy 143 when le was overestimated by 54 w m 2 due to the underestimation of p v in order to estimate t v and t s the radiometric surface temperature t rad was plotted against the partial vegetation cover p v described in section 2 3 this relationship depends on soil moisture and surface emissivity carlson 2007 yang et al 2015b kasim and usman 2016 between 16 and 23 of may there were several rain events with a total of 42 7 mm moistening and darkening the soil and thus influencing the reflectance on doy 143 on this day ndvi s was significantly higher compared to the other days table 1 and consequently decreased the estimate of p v this variable is calculated from the vegetation index ndvi eq a 5 and the coefficient k a 6 both retrieved from the bands b 4 and b 3 thus t v was higher leading to an overestimation of le 4 2 daily et a in our case study the model estimates for daily et a had the tendency to be underestimated maximum underestimation of 0 6 mm day 1 before and to be slightly overestimated maximum overestimation of 0 2 mm day 1 after the beta factor correction table 4 a tendency of underestimating et a in tseb models was also reported by sánchez et al 2015b and kustas et al 2013 while ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 stated an overestimation of et a depending on the phenological stage of the crop plant moisture and temperature stress zhuang and wu 2015 pôças et al 2014 stated a maximum overestimation of 0 8 mm day 1 the study by pôças et al 2014 was conducted at a super intensive olive grove not far from our site 75 km applying the ef method to obtain daily values for partly the same dates and landsat imagery in 2011 in their study et a was estimated using a one source energy balance model mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalised calibration metric and the surface energy balance fluxes were compared to ground measurements ec method they reported a mean bias of 12 6 between measured and estimated daily et a this is much higher than in our study where the mean bias was 5 thus indicating better results for heterogeneous vegetation surfaces when a two source energy balance model is used 4 3 evaporation transpiration partitioning as stated in section 3 3 for subplots 2 and 3 differences of more than 1 4 mm day 1 were reported colaizzi et al 2014 reported much smaller discrepancies of 0 79 mm day 1 for le s and 0 76 mm day 1 of le v in a fully irrigated cotton field at bushland texas using a tseb model to estimate the components of et a for different time intervals one reason could be the difference in p v subplots 2 and 3 had much lower p v values than the main plot p v differences of 0 2 data not shown which implies reduced canopy fraction ortega farías et al 2016 and ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 stated that canopy training systems and their associated canopy geometry may significantly affect the partitioning into the energy heat flux densities another possible explanation would be that the thermal band has a lower spatial resolution of 120 m as compared to the other bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m therefore the t rad for a pixel of a higher resolution than 120 m might not yield the actual surface temperature and result in errors calculating et a uncertainties in temperature of 1 k t a t v and t s have the greatest impact on stseb flux estimates and result in errors of up to 30 in le sánchez et al 2008b the systematic underestimation of le v and overestimation of le s might not only be related to the stseb model itself but also to the retrieval of the daily values by the use of the ef constant method this method assumes diurnal self preservation of et a which is often not the case as shown by lhomme and elguero 1999 among other authors gentine et al 2007 have investigated the ef principle for et a le s and le v separately that study showed that the soil component of ef can be assumed to be constant here we have applied the beta factor correction also to ef s which might have partly contributed to the overestimation of le s as the multiplication factors were larger than one table 4 4 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data so far our analysis has focused on each date at a time which we now extend by a brief description of the temporal pattern of our variables to that end we have analysed a denser time series of the major landsat derived variables ndvi α t rad of the stseb model fig 4b depicts those landsat 5 7 responses and relates them to et a it suggests that the overall ground cover dynamics of the study area is driven by the heterogeneity of the olive grove at the landsat spatial resolution scale with both canopies and inter rows land cover affecting the signal this explains the positive correlation found between α and et a which is contrary to eq a 2 if et a was proportional to r n but is a result of the combined effect of the dry and hot summer conditions over both components of the system irrigated plants and increasing drier soil in between plant rows moreover fig 4b confirms that the dates that were used as inputs of the stseb model are in fact representative of the observations along the year 5 conclusions instantaneous and daily energy heat flux densities and subsequently et a were estimated for an intensive and deficit irrigated olive grove in the region of alentejo portugal the performance of a stseb model was tested and the possibility of partitioning evapotranspiration into its components le v and le s was investigated by comparing its estimates with on site measurements i the results show good agreement between measured and estimated r n g h and le for instantaneous values on crop trees which have a relatively stable phenology over the course of the year ii the maximum difference recorded between modeled and measured daily et a was 0 6 mm day 1 with a rmse of 0 2 before and 0 2 mm day 1 after applying a correction factor which is in agreement with other studies iii after beta factorcorrection the partitioning of evapotranspiration into its contributing parts showed a maximum underestimation of 1 4 mm day 1 for le v and a maximum overestimation of 1 1 mm day 1 for le s at the main plot iv although satellite data with resolution of 30 m reflectance and 120 m temperature was poorly correlated with measured et a and le v r 2 approximately 0 5 which is not surprising due to the heterogeneity of the land cover in one pixel the stseb model was able to obtain refined estimates for stress conditions that fit the estimates from ground measurements in conclusion these results add to those previously reported in the literature resulting in an under and overestimation of daily values of le v and le s respectively which were retrieved by applying the ef method and the beta factor correction nevertheless the remote sensing based application of the stseb model showed a good performance in the estimation of instantaneous and daily et a from medium resolution satellite images and

11539,this study is based on the application of an existing simplified two source energy balance stseb model using medium resolution satellite imagery landsat to estimate instantaneous at the satellite overpass time and daily actual crop evapotranspiration et a over an intensive olive grove daily values were obtained by the use of the evaporative fraction method and corrected for latent heat available energy and evaporative fraction biases beta factor correction model estimates were compared to ground based measurements heat flux densities eddy covariance method were recorded and five landsat images at approximately monthly intervals were used covering our study site in 2011 comparison with ground measurements showed a maximum difference of 0 6 mm day 1 before and 0 2 mm day 1 after beta factor correction for the main plot the experimental site consisted of a main plot exposed to deficit irrigation and two small subplots where during a limited period of time six weeks one was temporarily not irrigated and the other well irrigated for reference one landsat image was available for this limited period of time additionally the stseb algorithm was tested for partitioning evapotranspiration into its evaporation and transpiration components evaporation estimated from the stseb model was compared with evaporation estimated from a model adjusted from local lysimeter measurements transpiration data obtained from calibrated sap flow measurements were after local calibration also compared to model estimates model results agreed with the measured data showing under and overestimation for transpiration and evaporation respectively keywords landsat evaporation transpiration evaporative fraction method 1 introduction over the last decade more and more traditional olive orchards 100 trees ha 1 have been replaced by intensive to super intensive ones 2000 trees ha 1 especially in the south of portugal with mediterranean climate conditions this development demands improved water management and optimised irrigation practices in terms of quantifying olive water requirements this study aims to estimate actual evapotranspiration et a and its contributing parts of canopy transpiration le v and soil water evaporation le s as the latter is often seen as water loss for irrigated crops an existing simplified two source energy balance model stseb based on norman et al 1995 and further simplified by sánchez et al 2008b has been in combination with satellite imagery tested for separately estimating le s and le v on a daily basis to estimate the amount of water transferred to the atmosphere from different crops various estimation approaches have been developed in general using implicitly or explicitly the leaf surface conductance bulk stomatal and leaf boundary layer due to the difficulty in obtaining this variable for every crop in any water status condition simple semi empirical models have been used to calculate et a for decades the principle is based on the reference evapotranspiration et 0 estimated from on site collected meteorological data which then is multiplied by a crop coefficient obtaining et m k c et m et 0 and finally by a stress coefficient k s et a et m in a well known group of guidelines fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 proposed estimating et 0 based on the penman montheith equation which incorporates aerodynamic and physiological parameters of a previously defined reference grass to retrieve k c and k s coefficients an alternative approach to obtain et a and its contributing parts le v and le s was adopted from the energy balance equation eq a 1 a distinction is drawn between one and two source models to account for the different heat transfers from the soil surface and the plant canopy one source models assume one surface temperature and aerodynamic resistance for the zone of soil and vegetation cover while the two source models identify soil and vegetation layers as separate sources of heat flux to date many studies have been carried out over annual crops or uniform land covers tasumi et al 2005 agam et al 2010 hoffmann et al 2016 timmermans et al 2007 and many studies have dealt with heterogeneous ground cover bastiaanssen et al 1998 colaizzi et al 2016 roerink et al 2000 and only recently with tree crops e g olive orchards cammalleri et al 2012 pôças et al 2014 ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 due to the accessibility of satellite data remote sensing based estimations of et a sun et al 2012 peng et al 2012 minacapilli et al 2016 combined with energy balance models du et al 2013 ruhoff et al 2013 became more and more attractive especially because only a few additional meteorological variables e g air temperature wind speed global solar radiation are needed being regularly measured at meteorological stations yang et al 2015a made a comparison between three two source remote sensing evapotranspiration models where two of them were two source energy balance models tseb and the third was the mod16 et a algorithm algorithm according to norman et al 1995 and nishida et al 2003b a results showed that mod16 failed to reproduce spatial et a patterns over particularly dry environments while the tseb model was in agreement with the et a measurements generally tseb models give reasonable results for et a and are used for separately estimating le v and le s which based on remote sensing has not been tested yet to its full extent one reason might be that tseb models tend to overestimate le s and underestimate le v colaizzi et al 2014 2016 here the stseb model gives the opportunity to operate on a larger scale e g field scale due to relatively few input variables the use of standard meteorological data and satellite imagery daily values of et a le v and le s were estimated using the evaporative fraction ef constant method correction factors beta factors according to van niel et al 2011 were tested to improve model estimations on this background the objectives of this study were to i estimate instantaneous et a in discontinuous vegetation e g for an olive grove ii detect significant reductions in evapotranspiration due to the water status of the trees iii test the performance of the model for partitioning evapotranspiration into its contributing parts transpiration and evaporation and iv evaluate the overall ground cover dynamics effect of canopies and inter row soil cover affecting the use of satellite imagery on site measurements of total et a obtained with the eddy covariance ec method and its contributing parts le s and le v were compared to the model estimates consequently the sections highlighting the results of the research at hand as well as the discussion of these results are split in accordance with the aforementioned objectives 2 materials and methods a detailed description of the experimental set up instrumentation and their specifications are given in conceição et al 2017 2 1 study site this work is based on data obtained in an intensive olive grove in the southeast of portugal located in the region of alentejo in 2011 latitude 38 1 15 90 n longitude 8 10 44 50 w datum wgs84 97 m above sea level in september 2004 a 10 ha olive grove cv arbequina with a tree spacing of 4 8 m and a row spacing of 7 m was installed where a continuous area of 434 ha was selected for taking measurements in 2010 the average height of the trees was 3 2 m the average canopy projected area was 5 7 m2 and the average leaf area index on a total area basis was 1 01 m2 m 2 further biometric measurements were taken and are described in häusler et al 2014 the climate in the region of alentejo is temperate and is one of the mediterranean types csa characterized by mild and wet winters and very hot and dry summers

agriculture organization of the united nations fao 2006 with a apbtc profile the total olive orchard with the exception of two subplots during a limited stress period was deficit irrigated each tree row had a line of drippers spaced 0 75 m apart the nominal flow for the deficit irrigation was 1 6 l h 1 which corresponds to an irrigation flux density of 0 31 mm h 1 during 2011 the deficit irrigation operated from 15 june to 26 september 103 days with an average irrigation depth of 1 4 mm day 1 during six weeks two subplots received different treatments one received no water at all subplot 2 and the other was well irrigated subplot 3 see also section 2 2 3 and conceição et al 2017 pre dawn leaf water potential served to monitor and define the plant water status according to fernandes silva 2008 plants are in comfort between 0 4 mpa and 0 7 mpa the observed values for the well irrigated subplot 3 were never below 0 5 mpa conceição et al 2017 trees with a pre dawn leaf water potential of down to 0 5 mpa were therefore defined as being in comfort values below this point indicated water stressed olive trees 2 2 on site measurements 2 2 1 measurement of energy heat fluxes at the main plot the installation of ec sensors allowed the measurement of the flux densities of latent heat flux density le and sensible heat flux density h with a three dimensional sonic anemometer and a krypton hygrometer csat3 d and kh20 respectively campbell scientific usa which were mounted on a metallic tower at the height of 4 5 m above ground and oriented into the dominant wind direction fig 1 raw fluxes h and le were recorded by a data logger cr10x campbell scientific usa and 30 min averages were stored corrections for air density variations wpl correction webb et al 1980

netherlands and the soil heat flux density g was recorded using six heat flux plates heat flux sensors hfp01 and hft 3 1 manufactured by hukseflux and radiation and energy balance systems respectively with known thermal conductivity the heat flux plates were buried in the ground at a depth of 0 05 m perpendicular to the flow direction to quantify the heat stored in the soil layer between 0 and 0 05

footprint analysis schuepp et al 1990 allowed the evaluation of the relative contribution of fluxes coming from different areas within the plot to the total measured flux more than 85 of the measured le came from an upwind area less than 140 m away from the measurements point le and h fluxes were selected according to the wind direction taking into consideration the outputs from the footprint analysis conceição et al 2017 in relation to the fetch for each direction 2 2 2 transpiration and soil evaporation at the main plot using the thermal dissipation method granier 1985 the sap flow was recorded for seven trees in the main plot measurements were taken every 60 s and averaged every 30 min by a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific usa for details see also conceição et al 2017 measurements of le s with micro lysimeters were taken in total ten lysimeters were installed here six of them were along the tree line with a spacing of 0 75 m and another four near the line where two of which were in the shade of the crown and two exposed to the sun tezza 2014 the lysimeter measurements were used to model le s for the days were no measurements were taken using locally adjusted model parameters as described in tezza 2014 and conceição et al 2017 by subtracting le s micro lysimeters or model from et a measured at the ec tower le v was obtained subsequently le v was compared with average sap flow data in order to correct it obtaining a time series for le v of the main plot under deficit irrigation where also total le was measured afterwards it was possible to infer le v for the small subplots 2 and 3 in the way explained in the following section 2 2 3 transpiration of the two subplots for the duration of a stress period 3 august to 15 september 2011 the experimental site had additionally two small subplots outside the footprint area of the main plot fig 1 in each of the two subplots sap flow measurements for six trees were taken also using the thermal dissipation method as described by granier 1985 subplots 2 38 1 13 99 n 8 10 42 68 w and 3 38 1 11 81 n 8 10 41 12 w were equipped with independent irrigation systems and a stress period was temporarily induced from 3 august day of the year doy 215 until 15 september 258 2011 in subplot 2 only during the stress period of six weeks subplot 2 remained non irrigated while subplot 3 was kept well irrigated for reference pre dawn leaf water potential above 0 5 mpa this experimental lay out was used to analyse the impact of water shortage on water stress indicators and water fluxes ferreira et al 2012a before the beginning of the stress period all plots had reached maximum water status comfort 0 5 mpa of pre dawn leaf water potential the main plot 1 continued to be deficit irrigated approximately 1 4 mm day 1 the value of le v for the well irrigated subplot 3 was obtained by dividing le v of the main plot by the stress coefficient of the main plot le v 3 le v 1 k s 1 which takes into account the le v reduction in the main plot being deficit irrigated this factor k s 0 88 was retrieved from the relationship between pre dawn leaf water potential and k s or relative le v obtained during the stress period ferreira et al 2012b conceição et al 2017 by using the values measured in all subplots for the day of satellite overpass during this stress cycle the same principle was applied to le v for the highly stressed subplot 2 day of satellite of overpass on doy 255 2011 by using the measured relative le v of this plot i e k s 0 77 being le v of stressed subplot 2 le v of the well irrigated subplot 3 multiplied by 0 77 because le v 2 le v 3 k s 2 five cloud free landsat 5 thematic mapper l5 tm images were selected in approximately monthly intervals from may until october 2011 including one image

earth s surface the level 1 product of surface reflectance data level 1 product bands 1 5 and 7 atmospherically corrected by landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and the brightness temperature band 6 provided by the u s geological survey earth resources observation and science eros data center http earthexplorer usgs gov were downloaded and further processed for the estimates of the main plot a square of 3 3 pixels within the footprint area was extracted and averaged while for the subplots 2 and 3 central coordinates were used to extract the corresponding pixels in the images to compare with ground observations the subplots themselves covered only around 941 m2 28 trees corresponding to the 30 30 m pixel size of the visible band of landsat we have tested two approaches averaging over the overlapping pixels or using just the closest pixel to the center of each subplot and since the latter lead to better estimates we have used it in our calculations knowing that the tree lines were rather uniform landsat derived albedo α land surface temperature t rad and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi see section 3 4 were plotted against et a for 15 observation days along the year 2011 the time pattern of those variables was compared to verify that the input data for the stseb model were in line with the annual distribution of remote sensing data furthermore simple and multiple regression models using as predictors α t rad or ndvi were fitted to evaluate how the stseb model improved the et a estimation over simple statistical models the global solar radiation s was provided by the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service cams and downloaded from soda solar energy services for professionals http www soda pro com air temperature t a and wind

hemispheric up welling sky irradiance l atm were obtained by introducing radio sounding data into the modtran 4 0 code berk 1999 the atmospheric parameters τ l atm and l atm served for atmospheric corrections in order to obtain t rad from brightness temperature and were calculated by the atmospheric correction parameter calculator http atmcorr gsfc nasa gov barsi et al 2003 2 3 model description the stseb model sánchez et al 2008a is based on the energy balance equation eq a 1 and estimates instantaneous values for r n h and g w m 2 from meteorological data and satellite imagery in order to obtain le to retrieve daily values from the instantaneous ones the ef method described at the end of this section was applied i e the ratio of le and the available energy during satellite overpass g was estimated as a portion of r n eq a 11 choudhury et al 1987 and considered for retrieving daily et a using the ef method 2 3 1 instantaneous values one of the key processes in the stseb model is the successful partitioning into the contributing parts of the vegetation v and the soil s timmermans et al 2007 kustas et al 2012 sánchez et al 2015b in order to obtain p v eq 1 valor and caselles 1996 this means that p v is calculated from the ndvi eq a 5 and the coefficient k eq a 6 1 p v 1 ndvi ndvi s 1 ndvi ndvi s k 1 ndvi ndvi v both ndvi and k were calculated from the red and near infrared bands b 3 and b 4 band designations b i for landsat satellites are provided by the official site of u s geological survey usgs http www usgs gov the fully vegetated and bare soil areas were manually selected by the use of the ndvi and averaged they are referred to by the subscripts of v and s respectively region of interest roi table 1 the rois obtained for the ndvi v and ndvi s classification were also used to obtain the average values of the bands for vegetated and bare soil regions for k the classification of the ndvi into vegetated and bare soil regions are found in sobrino et al 2004 separating t s and t v when only t rad is available is probably the most intricate issue in the stseb models hereby for each day t rad retrieved from the thermal band eq a 7 was plotted against p v main plot 3 3 pixels where isolines with an almost linear relationship were obtained carlson 2007 yang et al 2015b kasim and usman 2016 first estimates for the components soil t s and canopy t v temperature of t rad were retrieved here higher temperatures related to low values of p v bare soil pixels represented the estimate of t s while lower temperatures related to high values of p v vegetated pixels gave the estimate for t v during satellite overpass table 2 the partitioning of the different fluxes into soil 1 p v and canopy p v components was used to estimate h s eq a 10 and h v eq a 9 separately to be consistent this approach was also applied to estimating the contributing parts of soil and vegetation cover for r n adapting eq a 2 by using the soil and canopy specific emissivities and α following this methodology the component fluxes of le s and le v as well as total le were retrieved applying 2 le s r ns h s g 1 p v 3 le v r nv h v 4 le p v le v 1 p v le s 2 3 2 daily values finally daily values were retrieved by applying the ef constant method as described in ruan et al 2014 this algorithm assumes that ef is constant during the daytime hours and is defined for the total scene and the individual portions of canopy and soil respectively as 5 ef t i le i r ni g i 6 ef v i le v i r nv i 7 ef s i le s i r ns i g i where i denotes the instantaneous values measured or estimated at the time of satellite overpass for the total t scene the canopy v or soil s contribution gentine et al 2007 however van niel et al 2011 address three major surface energy balance interactions with ef that result in a bias those interactions are called beta factors and represent the systematic errors in le in the available energy r n g and in the evaporative fraction assuming daytime self preservation the combined influence of the beta factors was determined and multiplied as explained in van niel et al 2011 the daily values of et a were then multiplied by the combined beta factors as listed in table 4 physical background and application of the beta factors must be retrieved from the given reference as this is beyond of the scope of this paper daily et a mm day 1 were retrieved from instantaneous observations using ruan et al 2014 8 et a daily 8 64 10 7 ef i r nd g d l ρ w where l is the latent heat of vaporization given in mj kg 1 ρ w is the water density 1000 kg m 3 and ef i is the evaporative fraction for the total scene the soil or the vegetation contribution eqs 5 7 2 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data the stseb model relies on the surface reflectance and the thermal band of l5 tm however for the time series landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus l7 etm data were also available a total of 15 observations from may 15 2011 until october 30 2011 were evaluated testing the representativeness of the five observations used for the stseb model since the stseb model was not used to estimate et a for the additional ten dates we limited ourselves to looking at the relation between landsat derived variables used in the stseb model and in situ measured et a the combination of tm and etm data for the stseb model would have further complicated our analysis and add additional variability different sensors and orbits and was therefore not considered to investigate whether et a could be modeled by simple linear regression on the predictor variables α ndvi and t rad which were extracted from a time series of landsat data multiple linear regression techniques were used the linear model assumes that the response variable can be written as a linear function of the predictors plus a gaussian random error ϵ formally 9 y i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β p x p i ϵ i i 1 n for the n observations and p predictors where ϵ i has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and fixed but unknown variance σ 2 the goodness of fit is evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 which measures the proportion of the variability of the response that is explained by the regression model nested models i e where only a subset of predictors is considered were compared using a f test to understand if the inclusion of additional variables lead to a significant increase in the coefficient of determination dytham 2011 3 results 3 1 instantaneous et a the satellite derived r n was underestimated by at most 26 w m 2 compared to that measured on average the estimated values mismatched the ground measurements by only 3 mean absolute deviation mad of 17 w m 2 the absolute maximum difference for h was 27 w m 2 resulting in a relative deviation of 4 mad of 16 w m 2 for g a maximum absolute difference of 3 w m 2 was observed and on average the values differed from the measured soil heat flux densities by 1 mad of 1 3 w m 2 for the main plot for le the maximum deviation of 28 w m 2 resulting in an error of 18 mad of 36 w m 2 on average for the days analysed see also table 3 3 2 daily et a comparing the daily estimated values of r n le and h with the ones observed at the main plot differences of 3 mad of 5 w m 2 14 mad of 15 w m 2 and 3 mad of 5 w m 2 were observed on average respectively instantaneous values of g were estimated eq a 11 and considered for modeling in order to retrieve daily values of le by using the ef constant method in fig 2 the daily measured g is given which was between 0 6 and 17 w m 2 for the five days used for this study generally the daily estimated et a of the subplots were lower than the ones from the main plot with the exception of doy 255 which was the observation day during the stress period on that day et a either measured or estimated from the model was higher in subplot 3 being well irrigated therefore subplot 3 evapotranspirated more than the main plot which was kept deficit irrigated the model was able to detect a clear difference to subplot 2 receiving no irrigation water at that time table 4 even though the differences between observed and estimated values were rather small with exception of doy 207 for the main plot et a for subplots 2 and 3 were underestimated assuming the same conditions in comparison with the main plot except for doy 255 e g tree height and tree distribution water application and irrigation scheduling thus the beta factor correction as described by van niel et al 2011 was used to account for systematic errors made in le available energy r n g and the evaporative fraction assuming daytime self preservation the estimations especially for doy 207 could be improved table 4 in the main plot a difference of only 0 1 mm day 1 before 0 6 mm day 1 between measured and estimated et a was achieved after applying the beta factor of 1 19 subplots 2 and 3 were also corrected by this factor reducing the underestimation from 1 0 mm day 1 to 0 3 mm day 1 3 3 evaporation transpiration partitioning the possibility of separating evapotranspiration into its contributing portions of le v and le s by means of the stseb algorithm was explored again the ef constant method eqs 2 8 was used to estimate daily values from the records during the satellite overpass and the beta factor correction was applied as describe in section 2 3 2 a clear difference in le v was recorded during the stress period which lasted from doy 215 to 258 3 august until 15 september 2011 during this time the main plot was kept deficit irrigated while subplot 2 was not irrigated at all stressed and subplot 3 was kept near field capacity control accordingly subplot 3 transpired the most during the stress period while in relative terms subplot 2 transpired the least the daily measurements of le v at the main plot and the subplots with the corresponding estimates are given in fig 3 for doy 255 the graph displays extra data due to the fact that this was during the stress period applied to subplot 2 when le v for subplots 2 and 3 were also measured for the main plot the greatest differences were observed for doys 175 and 207 with an underestimation of 1 4 mm day 1 followed by doy 255 with an underestimation of 1 0 mm day 1 for the subplots 2 and 3 the greatest differences between observed and estimated le v were recorded at doy 175 when the overestimation was 1 9 and 1 6 mm day 1 respectively fig 3 in summary the estimated daily le v values for the main plot and the subplots were underestimated for the stress period doy 255 the stseb algorithm was able to detect differences in le v for the different water applications fig 3 where subplot 3 was highest control followed by the main plot deficit irrigated and the subplot 2 stressed the fraction of le s after application of ef method and systematic error correction was compared with the model estimates showing relatively large differences overestimation for the doys 175 207 and 255 of at most 1 1 mm day 1 but good agreement for the doys 143 and 303 0 2 mm day 1 table 5 3 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data as discussed the landsat data were used to derive α eq a 3 ndvi eqs a 5 1 and a 6 and to estimate t rad eq a 7 see also fig 4 b fig 4a depicts the relations between the landsat 5 7 derived variables α ndvi and t rad and et a in situ observations one can notice that the five observations used in earlier sections were well distributed among the available data which is an indication of their representativeness fig 4a shows that α had the best correlation with et a and that they were positively correlated this resulted from the combined effect of both canopy and inter row components of the landsat signal as summer progresses the herbaceous component of ground cover dries out and therefore the soil s reflectance increases simultaneously and independently le v rates also increase due to irrigation in combination with a higher atmospheric demand ndvi fig 4a on the other hand showed a very weak correlation with et a as expected it showed lower values in summer since the soil surface was almost bare and increased when the natural conditions were favourable for the development of the ground cover therefore ndvi variation reflected mostly the ground cover dynamics which was mostly driven by the inter rows since the leaf area of olive tree canopies was relatively stable over the course of the year häusler et al 2016 in the stseb model ndvi was in fact used essentially to distinguish the soil from the canopy it is worth noting that landsat derived α and ndvi happen to have an almost opposite time pattern although α correlates more with et a multiple linear regression analysis of the data in fig 4a was performed to understand if a combination of variables could describe the et a values the most important individual variable was α followed by t rad leading to a small increase of the goodness of fit from r 2 0 49 to r 2 0 54 the inclusion however of ndvi did not improve the model significantly p 0 5205 this is further evidence that the stseb model made better use of landsat derived data than a multiple regression model 4 discussion 4 1 instantaneous et a at the olive orchard le fluxes showed the largest error in relation to the other energy heat fluxes 18 and were overestimated on average however the errors for r n 3 h 4 and g 1 were rather small sánchez et al 2015a reported relative errors of 4 40 14 and 40 for r n g h and le respectively at a burnt forest area during the satellite overpass with the exception of g this tendency agrees with our results applying a similar version of the stseb model and comparing its estimates to ec measurements in another study the energy heat fluxes were estimated from a two layer model and compared to instantaneous values from ec measurements at an olive orchard ortega farías et al 2016 they reported a rather small error of g 2 which agrees with our findings r n and h were generally both underestimated by around 5 while our observations resulted in an underestimation of r n and an overestimation of h the largest error was determined for le 7 a constant overestimation which is in agreement with our results nevertheless in our case study le had a larger deviation mainly due to the first observation date 23 may doy 143 when le was overestimated by 54 w m 2 due to the underestimation of p v in order to estimate t v and t s the radiometric surface temperature t rad was plotted against the partial vegetation cover p v described in section 2 3 this relationship depends on soil moisture and surface emissivity carlson 2007 yang et al 2015b kasim and usman 2016 between 16 and 23 of may there were several rain events with a total of 42 7 mm moistening and darkening the soil and thus influencing the reflectance on doy 143 on this day ndvi s was significantly higher compared to the other days table 1 and consequently decreased the estimate of p v this variable is calculated from the vegetation index ndvi eq a 5 and the coefficient k a 6 both retrieved from the bands b 4 and b 3 thus t v was higher leading to an overestimation of le 4 2 daily et a in our case study the model estimates for daily et a had the tendency to be underestimated maximum underestimation of 0 6 mm day 1 before and to be slightly overestimated maximum overestimation of 0 2 mm day 1 after the beta factor correction table 4 a tendency of underestimating et a in tseb models was also reported by sánchez et al 2015b and kustas et al 2013 while ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 stated an overestimation of et a depending on the phenological stage of the crop plant moisture and temperature stress zhuang and wu 2015 pôças et al 2014 stated a maximum overestimation of 0 8 mm day 1 the study by pôças et al 2014 was conducted at a super intensive olive grove not far from our site 75 km applying the ef method to obtain daily values for partly the same dates and landsat imagery in 2011 in their study et a was estimated using a one source energy balance model mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution using internalised calibration metric and the surface energy balance fluxes were compared to ground measurements ec method they reported a mean bias of 12 6 between measured and estimated daily et a this is much higher than in our study where the mean bias was 5 thus indicating better results for heterogeneous vegetation surfaces when a two source energy balance model is used 4 3 evaporation transpiration partitioning as stated in section 3 3 for subplots 2 and 3 differences of more than 1 4 mm day 1 were reported colaizzi et al 2014 reported much smaller discrepancies of 0 79 mm day 1 for le s and 0 76 mm day 1 of le v in a fully irrigated cotton field at bushland texas using a tseb model to estimate the components of et a for different time intervals one reason could be the difference in p v subplots 2 and 3 had much lower p v values than the main plot p v differences of 0 2 data not shown which implies reduced canopy fraction ortega farías et al 2016 and ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 stated that canopy training systems and their associated canopy geometry may significantly affect the partitioning into the energy heat flux densities another possible explanation would be that the thermal band has a lower spatial resolution of 120 m as compared to the other bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m therefore the t rad for a pixel of a higher resolution than 120 m might not yield the actual surface temperature and result in errors calculating et a uncertainties in temperature of 1 k t a t v and t s have the greatest impact on stseb flux estimates and result in errors of up to 30 in le sánchez et al 2008b the systematic underestimation of le v and overestimation of le s might not only be related to the stseb model itself but also to the retrieval of the daily values by the use of the ef constant method this method assumes diurnal self preservation of et a which is often not the case as shown by lhomme and elguero 1999 among other authors gentine et al 2007 have investigated the ef principle for et a le s and le v separately that study showed that the soil component of ef can be assumed to be constant here we have applied the beta factor correction also to ef s which might have partly contributed to the overestimation of le s as the multiplication factors were larger than one table 4 4 4 time series analysis of remote sensing data so far our analysis has focused on each date at a time which we now extend by a brief description of the temporal pattern of our variables to that end we have analysed a denser time series of the major landsat derived variables ndvi α t rad of the stseb model fig 4b depicts those landsat 5 7 responses and relates them to et a it suggests that the overall ground cover dynamics of the study area is driven by the heterogeneity of the olive grove at the landsat spatial resolution scale with both canopies and inter rows land cover affecting the signal this explains the positive correlation found between α and et a which is contrary to eq a 2 if et a was proportional to r n but is a result of the combined effect of the dry and hot summer conditions over both components of the system irrigated plants and increasing drier soil in between plant rows moreover fig 4b confirms that the dates that were used as inputs of the stseb model are in fact representative of the observations along the year 5 conclusions instantaneous and daily energy heat flux densities and subsequently et a were estimated for an intensive and deficit irrigated olive grove in the region of alentejo portugal the performance of a stseb model was tested and the possibility of partitioning evapotranspiration into its components le v and le s was investigated by comparing its estimates with on site measurements i the results show good agreement between measured and estimated r n g h and le for instantaneous values on crop trees which have a relatively stable phenology over the course of the year ii the maximum difference recorded between modeled and measured daily et a was 0 6 mm day 1 with a rmse of 0 2 before and 0 2 mm day 1 after applying a correction factor which is in agreement with other studies iii after beta factorcorrection the partitioning of evapotranspiration into its contributing parts showed a maximum underestimation of 1 4 mm day 1 for le v and a maximum overestimation of 1 1 mm day 1 for le s at the main plot iv although satellite data with resolution of 30 m reflectance and 120 m temperature was poorly correlated with measured et a and le v r 2 approximately 0 5 which is not surprising due to the heterogeneity of the land cover in one pixel the stseb model was able to obtain refined estimates for stress conditions that fit the estimates from ground measurements in conclusion these results add to those previously reported in the literature resulting in an under and overestimation of daily values of le v and le s respectively which were retrieved by applying the ef method and the beta factor correction nevertheless the remote sensing based application of the stseb model showed a good performance in the estimation of instantaneous and daily et a from medium resolution satellite images and is therefore useful for irrigation management to optimize crop production in relation to agricultural water use funding this work was supported within the framework of the phd research grants
