8460,study region the upper jordan river is the major water resource in israel a country which suffers from increasing shortage of natural water resources study focus in this study we apply for the first time to this area an approach based on an ensemble of regional climate models verify their trends vs observations for a control period and use them for simulating future discharges of the jordan river new hydrological insights for the region the results of this study show that the observed negative trend of precipitation for the control period is also simulated by the climate models ensemble and projects a continued decreasing trend to the near future and further into the far future using the gr6j daily hydrological model for evaluating the effects of the predicted climate changes on the hydrological cycle in the region shows an increase in potential evaporation and a decrease in streamflow volumes in the jordan river northern israel the results reveal and quantify the changes in rainfall runoff relationships these changes in the hydrological cycle in the region can be explained by changes in precipitation distribution and duration and decrease in soil moisture caused by the increase in evaporation results presented in this study could imply major consequences for the region the findings here are relevant not only to israel but also to the surrounding countries keywords rainfall runoff relationships ensemble of regional climate models changes in the hydrological cycle 1 introduction the expected impacts of climate change in the eastern mediterranean and middle east region are worrying the most recent ipcc general circulation models gcms projections agree on drying scenarios in the region by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2013 future climate in the region is expected to be characterized by possible decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature trends kunstmann et al 2007 krichak et al 2010 peleg et al 2015 samuels et al 2017 these future evolutions impact a region that is already affected by sparse water resources evans 2009 chenoweth et al 2011 smiatek et al 2011 kelley et al 2015 a significant decrease in rainfall spring flow and streamflow has recently been documented both in the jordan river basin in northern israel givati and rosenfeld 2007 rimmer et al 2011 as well as in the litani river basin in lebanon shaban 2009 the average available water natural recharge minus evaporation in lake kinneret decreased to 392 mcm year for the period 1975 2010 to 365 mcm year for the period 1985 2010 and down to 319 mcm year for the period 1993 2010 rimmer and givati 2014 fig 1 shows a statistically significant p 0 006 decreasing trend in the available water volumes entering into lake kinneret for the period 1975 2017 available water volumes are defined as the total incoming water to lake from direct precipitation streamflow and springs minus the evaporation from the lake future hydroclimate projections are extremely important for operational stakeholders and for planning the water sector in this region there is a growing need for hydrological simulations at the basin scale in order to better plan the future water allocation gcms are relatively coarse 100 200 km grid resolution and are incapable of resolving the necessary details of the complex precipitation structures that are forced by mesoscale orography land surface heterogeneities and land water contrasts in the eastern mediterranean region strong sea air interactions and orographic forcing produce precipitation with strong gradients that are generally missed by the coarse grid operational models in israel the precipitation patterns are particularly complex and large precipitation contrasts occur over a relatively small geographical distance large climatological precipitation gradients in israel are caused by the complex orography and the coastline shape saaroni et al 2009 to cope with these limitations downscaling of gcms outputs is necessary the downscaling can be realized through the use of regional climate models rcms that are limited area models constrained by the gcms outputs analyses confirm the ability of rcms to capture the basic features of the climate at the euro cordex domain including its variability in space and time kotlarski et al 2014 moreover climate change impact needs to be assessed at regional and local scales this requires climate projection information at a spatial scale relevant to the system of interest which is often significantly smaller than the resolution of gcms dynamic downscaling with rcms is capable to address this scale gap a number of previous projects have produced regional climate projections using rcm ensembles including prudence kotlarski et al 2014 ensembles van der linden and mitchell 2009 rmip fu et al 2005 narccap mearns et al 2012 claris lpb solman et al 2013 in each case various strategies were used to design the experimental procedure in order to sample the model uncertainties which are driven by practical limitations of computation time and data storage the highest possible accuracy of climate projections precipitation temperatures is needed for hydrological projections including the eastern mediterranean and middle east in order to support the decision makers studies have to address a range of future hydroclimate scenarios while identifying the most likely one here we propose a new methodology that uses the output of an ensemble of regional climate models as input to hydrological modeling and apply the outcome to the upper jordan river for predicting future water volumes and discharges we used daily precipitation and temperature from the various climate models provided by cordex after verifying each of them vs the observed precipitation trend as an input for the hydrological simulation and obtain the streamflow at the jordan river in addition to the hydrological simulations based on individual climate models we used the average of the 19 outputs which constitutes the ensemble mean each member was represented with an identical weight in the ensemble previous studies have already shown the advantages of using ensemble of climate models for hydrological applications in israel givati et al 2017 various hydrological models can be used in order to translate climate input data into water volumes we used in this study the gr6j daily lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model in order to assess the impact of climate change on river streamflow such hydro climate simulations were not done yet in the eastern mediterranean their ensemble results will give water resources mangers and planners in the region new tools to evaluate and plan accordingly in response to expected changes in the hydrological cycle and water availability under various climate hydrological scenarios the range of scenarios is based on the ipcc emission scenarios this study is also trying to evaluate changes in rainfall runoff relationship in order to better understand the effects of climate change on the hydrological cycle 2 methodology and study area 2 1 the study area the study area is the upper jordan river basin in northern israel fig 2 the climate conditions in the basin change sharply from north to south while the north is relatively wet with annual precipitation around 800 1000 mm y in the mountain regions and provides most the of water resources of the basin the southern part covers lower elevations the lake galilee is located at 210 masl and is drier annual precipitation is less than 400 mm y the region s climate is strongly affected by external forcing of both mid latitude and tropical origins alpert et al 2005 most of the annual precipitation is obtained during a limited number of rainy days 45 to 60 days the rainy events are typically associated with intrusions of cold air masses with a north european origin that pass over the mediterranean sea topography and coastal features with windward effects gap winds land sea breezes also influence the spatial distribution of climate characteristics in the region krichak et al 2010 observed meteorological forcing daily precipitation and temperatures was available from the kefar giladi israeli meteorological station daily observed discharge data from the sede nehamia israeli hydrological service hydrometric station at the jordan river head water was used the station drains an area of 800 km2 and the annual average streamflow volume is 360 mcm for the period 1979 2005 see the station location on fig 2 the potential evapotranspiration that was used for the rainfall runoff model was computed with the use of the oudin s formula oudin et al 2005 implemented in the airgr package coron et al 2017b 2 2 the cordex data base ensemble of regional climate models nineteen daily regional climate models rcms from the cordex project were used in this study for the control and future simulations for future simulations at rcp 8 5 scenario we had to use only 17 models due to partial data we used models from africa middle east north africa mena and euro cordex domains that contain simulations based on observed emission for the period 1951 2005 and future simulations based on future emission scenarios for the period 2006 2080 for two ipcc radiative concentration pathways rcps rcp4 5 reduced co2 emissions after 2040 and rcp8 5 business as usual the data from the models were extracted for a chosen location at the upper part of the jordan river basin lat 33 240 long 35 596 see location at fig 2 in the black circle kefar giladi meteorological station the data set contains daily time series for precipitation and temperature the period from 1951 until 2005 was defined as control period and from 2006 the simulations were based on the different rcps we analyzed the full 1951 2005 period for long term trends of observed and projected climate and then compared to around 30 years of simulation 1979 2005 as the control period vs the future periods of 2020 2049 near future and 2050 2079 far future fourteen models of the cordex data base were from the africa cordex domain 3 from euro cordex and 2 from mena cordex one rcm was provided by the israeli meteorological service and the other by the cyprus institute zittis et al 2014 the list of gcms and the details regarding the cordex different rcms are provided in table 1 since the climate data from the various models are used to simulate the future hydrological conditions with respect to the current ones for example the average water volume amounts at the jordan river for the period 2020 2050 with respect to the average volumes at the period 1979 2005 there is a need to evaluate first each rcm performance with respect to observed values in order to do it we calculated the annual precipitation trends for the period 1951 2005 the trend was calculated for each individual rcm and for the rcm ensemble mean the rcms trend was compared to the observed precipitation trend at kefar giladi meteorological station the closest location to the models grid point extraction see fig 2 a student s t test was used in order to evaluate the significance of each model trend with respect to the observed precipitation trend a parametric method for normal distribution annual precipitation data set the assumption behind this methodology is that if a model was able to reconstruct well the observed precipitation trend it allows us to consider using it for the future simulations good performance of a model ensemble for the control period still does not assure that this will be also the case in the future it can only allow us to assume that the model results for the control period are indicating a suitable model physics which can give some more credibility for the future simulation annual precipitation data are important for the models long term trend analysis however monthly resolution is also essential for evaluating the models seasonality and precipitation variability bias in monthly precipitation distribution in a model with respect to the observed for example simulated compared to the observed precipitation of the dry seaso which is the summer means unresolved model physics and would make it difficult to trust the simulations for the future in addition bias in monthly precipitation would directly lead to bias in the hydrological simulation in order to examine the climate models seasonality behavior we plotted the monthly precipitation averages of each model and the ensemble mean vs the observed precipitation values in kefar giladi rain gauge for the period 1951 2005 the post processing of the climate model data included statistical downscaling for the precipitation and temperature daily data using the quintile mapping methodology for bias correction no climate model was excluded from the ensemble 2 3 hydrological simulations using the gr6j rainfall runoff model assessing the impact of climate change on river streamflow requires the use of rainfall runoff models i e models transforming climatic time series into streamflow time series in this study the daily lumped conceptual gr6j model was used it was chosen because of its ability to reproduce well high as well as low flows pushpalatha et al 2011 the gr6j model is a storage type model that has six free parameters to calibrate the gr6j requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration input time series the potential evapotranspiration input was calculated using the oudin formulation oudin et al 2005 the gr6j model and the oudin potential evapotranspiration were used within the airgr version 1 5 0 12 r package coron et al 2017a b the robustness of hydrological models i e their ability of being applied to different periods or basins is crucial for applications to changing conditions thirel et al 2015 in this work a calibration validation exercise was undertaken an automatic calibration algorithm was used to find the combination of parameters that lead to the best simulations of discharge i e simulated discharge closest to observed discharge calibration was performed over the period 1981 1987 and an independent validation was made over the period 1988 2014 for this exercise we used the observed meteorological forcing from the kefar giladi israeli meteorological station a station with a full daily data set of precipitation and temperature for the entire calibration and validation periods the model calibration was done against observed daily discharge data from the sede nehamia israeli hydrological service hydrometric station an expected feature of the rainfall runoff model is to provide good quality simulations over the validation period indeed this shows the robustness of the model i e its temporal transferability which is a necessary quality especially for climate change impact applications klemeš 1986 thirel et al 2015 to assess the quality of the simulations we used both numerical criteria and visual inspection the main criterion that we used is the kge kling et al 2012 which is a combination of the bias ratio the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of variation in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used for an evaluation purpose only the next step after running the model for the calibration and validation periods with observed meteorological data set was to produce hydrological projections for the periods 1979 2005 and 2020 2080 using the different 19 climate projections for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 used as inputs the annual streamflow volume at the upper jordan river was calculated for each simulation and also for the ensemble in both rcp scenarios in addition to the daily precipitation inputs we analyzed the daily simulated potential evaporation and discharge of gr6j for the jordan river basin at the sede nehamia hydrometric station analyzes of simulated streamflow were performed both for the 1979 2005 control period and for the 2020 2049 and 2050 2079 future periods extracted from the continuous 2020 2080 gr6j simulations 3 results 3 1 simulated vs observed precipitation for the control period table 2 displays the annual precipitation trend for each model vs the observed slope for the period 1951 2005 using the statistical student s t test it can be seen that the annual precipitation observed trend at kefar giladi decreased by 0 14 mm y for the period 1951 2005 the wide dispersion of the 19 rcms can be seen in table 2 and in fig 3 a s that displays the observed against the simulated trend for each model some of the models show a negative slope decreasing trend and other a positive slope while the range was between 6 56 mm y clmcom mohc mpi esm ims to 4 15 mm y clmcom mohc hadgem2 es and 0 16 mm y for the ensemble mean the ensemble mean represents very well the observed precipitation slope with significant p value of 0 01 fig 4 summarizes the precipitation trends and displays the observed precipitation for the period 1951 2005 vs the ensemble mean for this simulate control period it shows the larger variability in the observed annual precipitation than in the mean of the ensemble fig 5 displays the monthly precipitation averages of each climate model a and the ensemble mean b for the period 1951 2005 vs the observed precipitation values in kefar giladi rain gauge it can be seen that while variability and range differ between the models the rcm s seasonality fits well to the observed behavior djf is the wet season with precipitation peak in january and the dry season occurs in jja with the lowest amount of precipitation in august 3 2 calibration and validation of streamflow volumes at the upper jordan river using the gr6j hydrological model fig 6 displays observed vs simulated daily discharge at the upper jordan river sede nehamia hydrometric station for the calibration period 1981 1987 using the gr6j model middle and lower panels the observed precipitation at the upper jordan river basin is shown in the upper panel of the figure we can observe a slight underestimation of low flows by the model while high flows are generally well reproduced the results for the calibration period show nse 0 82 and kge 0 91 results for the validation period of 1988 2014 fig 7 are lower but still have relatively good agreement with the observed flow nse 0 76 and kge 0 84 it can be seen in the model that although there is an overall agreement between the observed and the simulated flows the model underestimates the high flows in the jordan river flood events and overestimates the low flows at the dry season june september except in a few cases the inter annual streamflow regime is globally well reproduced these results indicate that gr6j is robust for the jordan river basin i e that the performance of the model does not drop too much on an independent validation period as a consequence the application of gr6j for the present climate change case study can be performed with reasonable confidence about the reliability of the results 3 3 future precipitation and potential evapotranspiration trends table 3 displays the relative changes in annual precipitation for the near 2020 2049 1979 2005 and far future 2050 2079 1979 2005 periods at the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for each model and for the ensemble mean compared with the reference period it can be seen that according to the rcp4 5 ensemble for the near future there is a 3 5 decrease in precipitation and a 11 decrease for the far future while for the rcp8 5 ensemble the evolution is 10 5 for the near future and 15 5 at the far future fig 8 shows the precipitation trend range at all models for the near future at rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 1951 2100 and the observed precipitation for the period 1951 2017 large annual precipitation range can be seen between the various models we can also observe that the annual mean of the climate projections does not fit well with the observed values as the annual variability is not well reproduced this is an expected feature as climate models projections are not intended to represent the chronology of past climate as a consequence the average of projections masks the actual projection variability over the years decreasing trends can be seen for both scenarios with much larger decreasing trends in the rcp8 5 scenario 1 46 mm y compared to 0 8 mm y for rcp4 5 fig 9 top row displays the simulated potential evaporation at the upper jordan river basin for the periods 1951 1978 1979 2010 2020 2050 and 2071 2098 increases of 4 6 and 5 4 can be seen in the rcp4 5 scenario for the near and far future respectively fig 9a and increases of 14 5 and 15 4 can be seen in the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9b the middle and bottom panels display the same but for precipitation and stream flow at the jordan river according to the ensemble mean decreases of 2 7 and 7 6 can be seen for precipitation in the rcp4 5 scenario for the near and far future respectively fig 9c and 5 20 respectively fig 9d can be seen for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9d fig 9e display the change in stream flow for rcp4 5 scenario 12 3 22 for the near and far future respectively and 8 f for rcp8 5 15 8 50 for the near and far future precipitation and evaporation are the major elements in the hydrological cycle and changes in their regimes decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation should have a major effect on the hydrological regime 3 4 future streamflow volumes at the jordan river table 4 shows the changes in average annual streamflow for all the models at different periods for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it can be seen that according to the ensemble mean the annual streamflow volumes is decreasing by 12 and 22 for the near and far future respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario a much more important decrease is expected 16 and 50 for the near and far future respectively again a wide range of uncertainty can be noted in table 4 as for the rcp4 5 scenario the annual streamflow ratio with respect to the control period is changing from maximum of 15 to minimum of 28 for the near future and from 3 to 45 for the far future for the rcp8 5 scenario the spread of the ratio changes is even larger from maximum of 9 to minimum of 46 for the near future and from 9 to 51 for the far future this corroborates the results of fig 8 that show how much larger the relative change is for discharge compare to precipitation or actual evapotranspiration in the future fig 10 illustrates that the decrease of discharge is present for almost all gcms rcms couples and that the decrease is more intense for rcp8 5 than for rcp4 5 and for the far future than for the near future fig 11 shows the annual streamflow at the jordan river mcm for the period 2006 2100 represented by the ensemble mean at rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the strong decreasing trend is striking and it can be observed that rcp8 5 projections indicate lower future discharge fig 12 summarizes the simulation results and displays the change in annual precipitation in respect to the change in annual streamflow for the periods 2020 2049 and 2050 2079 vs 1979 2005 at the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it demonstrates very well how streamflow volumes decrease with the decrease in rainfall on a non linear way as a decrease of precipitation by 20 can lead to a decrease of stream flow of more than 40 for many projections 4 discussion and summary this study shows new hydroclimate findings for the upper jordan river in the northern part of israel israel and the surrounding countries are already experiencing a significant decrease in water availability the projected trends for precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow presented in this study will have major effects for the region as already indicated by previous studies in this study we used for the first time an ensemble of 19 rcms some of them having a very high resolution the euro cordex domain we assessed their trends against observations for a control period of 54 years 1951 2005 such relatively long time series allow us to robustly quantify each model slope against the observed precipitation slope and to assess our confidence in its results although there is a large spread between the various models a decreasing trend in precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration can be seen in the majority of the models especially for the far future and for the rcp8 5 scenario respectively the streamflow volumes at the upper jordan river are decreasing but in much sharper trend than the precipitation the results presented in this study show the effects of climate change on water availability by table 4 show that a decrease of 4 and 11 in precipitation in the near and far future rcp4 5 leads to a significant decrease of 11 and 16 in annual stream flow volumes respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario a decrease of 5 and 14 in precipitation for the near and far future leads to a decrease of 16 and 44 in the simulated stream flow respectively such trends are dramatic for the region in terms of future water availability and water scarcity we also suggest that the modification of the rainfall runoff relationship could lead to enhanced impact of the combined effects of decrease of precipitation and increase of evaporation on the water resources availability using more detailed hydrological models that combine also the effects of changes in land use on the hydrological cycle and water obstructions on downstream flow may sharpen our insight and knowledge of future streamflow decision makers will have to decide how to adapt their water sector management based on such climate scenarios and hydrological projections the results here present the range between the best and the worst case scenarios and the ensemble mean they also provide some clues regarding the quality of each gcm rcm combination for the control period such findings as presented here can help decision makers to better plan the water management with respect to the predicted climate changes

annual precipitation data are important for the models long term trend analysis however monthly resolution is also essential for evaluating the models seasonality and precipitation variability bias in monthly precipitation distribution in a model with respect to the observed for example simulated compared to the observed precipitation of the dry seaso which is the summer means unresolved model physics and would make it difficult to trust the simulations for the future in addition bias in monthly precipitation would directly lead to bias in the hydrological simulation in order to examine the climate models seasonality behavior we plotted the monthly precipitation averages of each model and the ensemble mean vs the observed precipitation values in kefar giladi rain gauge for the period 1951 2005 the post processing of the climate model data included statistical downscaling for the precipitation and temperature daily data using the quintile mapping methodology for bias correction no climate model was excluded from the ensemble 2 3 hydrological simulations using the gr6j rainfall runoff model assessing the impact of climate change on river streamflow requires the use of rainfall runoff models i e models transforming climatic time series into streamflow time series in this study the daily lumped conceptual gr6j model was used it was chosen because of its ability to reproduce well high as well as low flows pushpalatha et al 2011 the gr6j model is a storage type model that has six free parameters to calibrate the gr6j requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration input time series the potential evapotranspiration input was calculated using the oudin formulation oudin et al 2005 the gr6j model and the oudin potential evapotranspiration were used within the airgr version 1 5 0 12 r package coron et al 2017a b the robustness of hydrological models i e their ability of being applied to different periods or basins is crucial for applications to changing conditions thirel et al 2015 in this work a calibration validation exercise was undertaken an automatic calibration algorithm was used to find the combination of parameters that lead to the best simulations of discharge i e simulated discharge closest to observed discharge calibration was performed over the period 1981 1987 and an independent validation was made over the period 1988 2014 for this exercise we used the observed meteorological forcing from the kefar giladi israeli meteorological station a station with a full daily data set of precipitation and temperature for the entire calibration and validation periods the model calibration was done against observed daily discharge data from the sede nehamia israeli hydrological service hydrometric station an expected feature of the rainfall runoff model is to provide good quality simulations over the validation period indeed this shows the robustness of the model i e its temporal transferability which is a necessary quality especially for climate change impact applications klemeš 1986 thirel et al 2015 to assess the quality of the simulations we used both numerical criteria and visual inspection the main criterion that we used is the kge kling et al 2012 which is a combination of the bias ratio the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of variation in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used for an evaluation purpose only the next step after running the model for the calibration and validation periods with observed meteorological data set was to produce hydrological projections for the periods 1979 2005 and 2020 2080 using the different 19 climate projections for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 used as inputs the annual streamflow volume at the upper jordan river was calculated for each simulation and also for the ensemble in both rcp scenarios in addition to the daily precipitation inputs we analyzed the daily simulated potential evaporation and discharge of gr6j for the jordan river basin at the sede nehamia hydrometric station analyzes of simulated streamflow were performed both for the 1979 2005 control period and for the 2020 2049 and 2050 2079 future periods extracted from the continuous 2020 2080 gr6j simulations 3 results 3 1 simulated vs observed precipitation for the control period table 2 displays the annual precipitation trend for each model vs the observed slope for the period 1951 2005 using the statistical student s t test it can be seen that the annual precipitation observed trend at kefar giladi decreased by 0 14 mm y for the period 1951 2005 the wide dispersion of the 19 rcms can be seen in table 2 and in fig 3 a s that displays the observed against the simulated trend for each model some of the models show a negative slope decreasing trend and other a positive slope while the range was between 6 56 mm y clmcom mohc mpi esm ims to 4 15 mm y clmcom mohc hadgem2 es and 0 16 mm y for the ensemble mean the ensemble mean represents very well the observed precipitation slope with significant p value of 0 01 fig 4 summarizes the precipitation trends and displays the observed precipitation for the period 1951 2005 vs the ensemble mean for this simulate control period it shows the larger variability in the observed annual precipitation than in the mean of the ensemble fig 5 displays the monthly precipitation averages of each climate model a and the ensemble mean b for the period 1951 2005 vs the observed precipitation values in kefar giladi rain gauge it can be seen that while variability and range differ between the models the rcm s seasonality fits well to the observed behavior djf is the wet season with precipitation peak in january and the dry season occurs in jja with the lowest amount of precipitation in august 3 2 calibration and validation of streamflow volumes at the upper jordan river using the gr6j hydrological model fig 6 displays observed vs simulated daily discharge at the upper jordan river sede nehamia hydrometric station for the calibration period 1981 1987 using the gr6j model middle and lower panels the observed precipitation at the upper jordan river basin is shown in the upper panel of the figure we can observe a slight underestimation of low flows by the model while high flows are generally well reproduced the results for the calibration period show nse 0 82 and kge 0 91 results for the validation period of 1988 2014 fig 7 are lower but still have relatively good agreement with the observed flow nse 0 76 and kge 0 84 it can be seen in the model that although there is an overall agreement between the observed and the simulated flows the model underestimates the high flows in the jordan river flood events and overestimates the low flows at the dry season june september except in a few cases the inter annual streamflow regime is globally well reproduced these results indicate that gr6j is robust for the jordan river basin i e that the performance of the model does not drop too much on an independent validation period as a consequence the application of gr6j for the present climate change case study can be performed with reasonable confidence about the reliability of the results 3 3 future precipitation and potential evapotranspiration trends table 3 displays the relative changes in annual precipitation for the near 2020 2049 1979 2005 and far future 2050 2079 1979 2005 periods at the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for each model and for the ensemble mean compared with the reference period it can be seen that according to the rcp4 5 ensemble for the near future there is a 3 5 decrease in precipitation and a 11 decrease for the far future while for the rcp8 5 ensemble the evolution is 10 5 for the near future and 15 5 at the far future fig 8 shows the precipitation trend range at all models for the near future at rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the period 1951 2100 and the observed precipitation for the period 1951 2017 large annual precipitation range can be seen between the various models we can also observe that the annual mean of the climate projections does not fit well with the observed values as the annual variability is not well reproduced this is an expected feature as climate models projections are not intended to represent the chronology of past climate as a consequence the average of projections masks the actual projection variability over the years decreasing trends can be seen for both scenarios with much larger decreasing trends in the rcp8 5 scenario 1 46 mm y compared to 0 8 mm y for rcp4 5 fig 9 top row displays the simulated potential evaporation at the upper jordan river basin for the periods 1951 1978 1979 2010 2020 2050 and 2071 2098 increases of 4 6 and 5 4 can be seen in the rcp4 5 scenario for the near and far future respectively fig 9a and increases of 14 5 and 15 4 can be seen in the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9b the middle and bottom panels display the same but for precipitation and stream flow at the jordan river according to the ensemble mean decreases of 2 7 and 7 6 can be seen for precipitation in the rcp4 5 scenario for the near and far future respectively fig 9c and 5 20 respectively fig 9d can be seen for the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9d fig 9e display the change in stream flow for rcp4 5 scenario 12 3 22 for the near and far future respectively and 8 f for rcp8 5 15 8 50 for the near and far future precipitation and evaporation are the major elements in the hydrological cycle and changes in their regimes decrease in precipitation and increase in evaporation should have a major effect on the hydrological regime 3 4 future streamflow volumes at the jordan river table 4 shows the changes in average annual streamflow for all the models at different periods for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it can be seen that according to the ensemble mean the annual streamflow volumes is decreasing by 12 and 22 for the near and far future respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario a much more important decrease is expected 16 and 50 for the near and far future respectively again a wide range of uncertainty can be noted in table 4 as for the rcp4 5 scenario the annual streamflow ratio with respect to the control period is changing from maximum of 15 to minimum of 28 for the near future and from 3 to 45 for the far future for the rcp8 5 scenario the spread of the ratio changes is even larger from maximum of 9 to minimum of 46 for the near future and from 9 to 51 for the far future this corroborates the results of fig 8 that show how much larger the relative change is for discharge compare to precipitation or actual evapotranspiration in the future fig 10 illustrates that the decrease of discharge is present for almost all gcms rcms couples and that the decrease is more intense for rcp8 5 than for rcp4 5 and for the far future than for the near future fig 11 shows the annual streamflow at the jordan river mcm for the period 2006 2100 represented by the ensemble mean at rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the strong decreasing trend is striking and it can be observed that rcp8 5 projections indicate lower future discharge fig 12 summarizes the simulation results and displays the change in annual precipitation in respect to the change in annual streamflow for the periods 2020 2049 and 2050 2079 vs 1979 2005 at the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it demonstrates very well how streamflow volumes decrease with the decrease in rainfall on a non linear way as a decrease of precipitation by 20 can lead to a decrease of stream flow of more than 40 for many projections 4 discussion and summary this study shows new hydroclimate findings for the upper jordan river in the northern part of israel israel and the surrounding countries are already experiencing a significant decrease in water availability the projected trends for precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow presented in this study will have major effects for the region as already indicated by previous studies in this study we used for the first time an ensemble of 19 rcms some of them having a very high resolution the euro cordex domain we assessed their trends against observations for a control period of 54 years 1951 2005 such relatively long time series allow us to robustly quantify each model slope against the observed precipitation slope and to assess our confidence in its results although there is a large spread between the various models a decreasing trend in precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration can be seen in the majority of the models especially for the far future and for the rcp8 5 scenario respectively the streamflow volumes at the upper jordan river are decreasing but in much sharper trend than the precipitation the results presented in this study show the effects of climate change on water availability by table 4 show that a decrease of 4 and 11 in precipitation in the near and far future rcp4 5 leads to a significant decrease of 11 and 16 in annual stream flow volumes respectively for the rcp8 5 scenario a decrease of 5 and 14 in precipitation for the near and far future leads to a decrease of 16 and 44 in the simulated stream flow respectively such trends are dramatic for the region in terms of future water availability and water scarcity we also suggest that the modification of the rainfall runoff relationship could lead to enhanced impact of the combined effects of decrease of precipitation and increase of evaporation on the water resources availability using more detailed hydrological models that combine also the effects of changes in land use on the hydrological cycle and water obstructions on downstream flow may sharpen our insight and knowledge of future streamflow decision makers will have to decide how to adapt their water sector management based on such climate scenarios and hydrological projections the results here present the range between the best and the worst case scenarios and the ensemble mean they also provide some clues regarding the quality of each gcm rcm combination for the control period such findings as presented here can help decision makers to better plan the water management with respect to the predicted climate changes 
8461,study region the study area is located in southern manitoba in the prairie region of canada study focus this study examined the impact of hydrological variability on the timing and magnitude of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated watersheds in the red river valley manitoba canada new hydrological insights for the region in 2013 discharge showed a seasonal pattern typical of streams traversing the canadian prairies high discharge during snowmelt followed by cessation of flow in early june due to lack of precipitation in 2014 discharge still peaked during snowmelt but compared to 2013 was 49 lower during snowmelt yet 21 higher during summer and fall due to greater rainfall these hydrologic differences were associated with differences in fractionation of nutrients between years thus higher concentrations and loads of particulate phosphorus p and nitrogen n and a greater p 0 05 share of the total nutrient pool in particulate forms particularly for p were observed during the snowmelt dominated year 2013 our findings show that the nutrient concentrations fractionation and export from prairie watersheds differ between years and amongst hydrological seasons in relation to hydrological conditions additional management actions may be required to address changes in the quantity timing and fractionation of nutrient export associated with rainier summers forecasted under future climate scenarios keywords nutrients hydroclimatology canadian prairies lake winnipeg eutrophication 1 introduction watersheds in the central canadian prairies exhibit classic cold regions hydroclimatology with long 4 5 month cold winters followed by a short 2 5 week spring characterized by warming temperatures high surface runoff due to snowmelt over frozen soils and peak discharge glozier et al 2006 fang et al 2010 cade menun et al 2013 in contrast the remainder of the hydrologic year summer and fall is typified by limited discharge because of high evaporation and infiltration rates fang et al 2010 the strong seasonality of cold regions hydroclimatology drives the transport and delivery of nutrients and other pollutants from source watersheds to lakes e g rattan et al 2017 with the amount of snowpack and the timing and volume of runoff intrinsically linked to seasonal and interannual climate variability barnett et al 2005 for example a three year study of seasonality of nutrient export from 11 canadian prairie streams showed that total p tp and total n tn concentrations and loads both peaked during the snowmelt season rattan et al 2017 similarly rankinen et al 2015 observed that total p and total suspended solids concentrations in selected finnish catchments tracked changes in seasonal discharge with highest values in april during snowmelt because nutrient losses from cold region watersheds are closely tied to hydrology changes in snowpack depth the timing and volume of runoff and the frequency and intensity of rain events could dramatically influence the timing and magnitude of nutrient loss from the land base to proximate streams and downstream waterbodies analyses of historical data from across canada have shown significant changes in hydroclimatology over the past 60 years snow depth and snow cover duration have exhibited decreasing trends since the mid 1970s with the greatest changes observed during late winter and spring derksen and brown 2012 debeer et al 2016 in particular annual snow cover duration has decreased by an average of 4 days per decade between 1950 and 2012 equating to a shortening snow cover period of 1 to 2 months in mid western and western canada debeer et al 2016 likewise analysis of long term trends 1951 2000 in the duration of rainfall events has revealed that the frequency of multi day rain storms have increased in the mid western and western region while the number of single day events has decreased vincent et al 2012 shook and pomeroy 2012 these findings of decreases in snow cover derksen and brown 2012 dumanski et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 increases in rain precipitation and persistent rainfall events millet et al 2009 vincent et al 2012 shook and pomeroy 2012 over the last five decades have been associated with changes in the hydrology of prairie streams for example dumanski et al 2015 observed dramatic long term changes in hydrology of the smith creek research basin in southern saskatchewan canada results showed that discharge was dominated by snowmelt runoff during the earliest study years 1975 1994 whereas rain on snow contributed to higher runoff peaks in spring during subsequent years 1995 2000 moreover recent 2011 2014 rain events have produced peaks during snowmelt with secondary discharge peaks also occurring in summer dumanski et al 2015 previous research by rattan et al 2017 showed that land based activities such as fertilizer application livestock density and sewage were critical factors influencing tn and tp concentrations in canadian prairie streams whereas physical factors such as water temperature and discharge were the primary determinants of tn and tp loads these findings have implications for water management in the red river valley rrv of central canada influencing the types of beneficial management practices bmps most appropriate for minimizing nutrient loss tillage method crop residue management nutrient management water retention yet to our knowledge there are no studies that consider the effect of hydroclimatic variability on total dissolved and particulate nutrient loss from canadian prairie watersheds this study was designed to evaluate the impact of hydroclimatic variability on the timing and quantity of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated watersheds in the rrv of central canada by examining seasonal changes in dissolved and particulate nutrient export during a snowmelt dominated hydrological year versus a year with lower snowfall and higher rainfall amounts we tested the hypothesis that concentrations of particulate forms of n and p are greater in a year when snowmelt is the dominant contributor to runoff however in a year with a greater influence of rainfall generated runoff a large share of the p pool and to a lesser extent the n pool will be in the dissolved form because rainfall has a lower erosion potential than snowmelt wu et al 2018 this study provides information on the importance of inter annual variability in climate and hydrology on water quality in addition our research will support improved decision making particularly decisions regarding the type and extent of bmps required to control nutrient export to proximate and downstream receiving water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the rrv of southern manitoba fig 1 seven sub watersheds were selected from 11 sub watersheds described by rattan et al 2017 to span the range in nutrient producing agricultural activities occurring in this region four sub watersheds strongly influenced by seasonal sewage discharge were not included in the present analysis table 1 much of the watershed of the rrv is used for agriculture predominately cultivation of feed wheat oats and grain corn manitoba government 2018a b census and land use data manitoba government 2018a b confirmed that the sub watersheds were not subjected to significant changes in land use between the two study years 2013 and 2014 for example human population in southern manitoba showed no variation from 2013 to 2014 manitoba government 2018a b in addition farm locations crop cover and number of large livestock farms showed no significant p 0 05 differences between the two study years manitoba government 2018a b the well drained and cropped farmlands in the rrv are situated along a band of very low relief terrain underlain by nearly impermeable glaciolacustrine fine sediments mccullough et al 2012 this plain is intersected by small wetlands and channelized streams and rivers during snowmelt stream channels are hydrologically connected whereas during the rest of the year all streams except mainstem rivers have disconnected reaches as a result of low or no flows caused by high temperatures limited rain precipitation and increased evaporation summer and fall or frozen channels winter corriveau et al 2013 the region experiences a cold continental climate with the warmest month being july 20 c and the coldest january 14 6 c 1981 2010 long term means for morden mb government of canada 2018 annual precipitation averages 426 mm with 27

precipitation in each of those months snowmelt typically produces 60 of annual runoff with soils usually remaining frozen at the time of snowmelt thereby preventing infiltration of the water rapidly released by the melting snow ali et al 2017 rain precipitation of high intensity can occur in spring summer or early fall resulting in intermittent flashy discharge fang et al 2010 bmps used in cold climate prairie regions primarily reduce particulate loss these practices include buffer strips and conservation tillage and have been proven effective in reducing particulate nutrient export uusi kamppa et al 2012 these practices may not however be as effective in controlling the loss of dissolved nutrients entering streams for example the lack of soil inversion with conservation tillage can result in accumulation of nutrients at the soil surface resulting in a greater proportion of dissolved nutrients in runoff tiessen et al 2010 li et al 2011 cade menun et al 2013 2 2 hydroclimatic data historical long term means 1980 2010 and contemporary 2013 2014 air temperature and snow depth data were obtained from the morden mb climate station government of canada 2018a b the only station in the region with snow data snow depth expressed as centimetres on the ground was used to identify maximum snow depth duration of continuous snow cover and first snow free date the duration of continuous snow cover was defined as the longest length of time within one snow season where snow depth is 1 cm the first snow free date was the first day when snow depth was 0 cm total precipitation snow rain data were available for only one station morden from environment and climate change canada government of canada 2018a b rain precipitation data daily volumes mm were obtained from five

stations carman altona starbuck and elm creek from manitoba agriculture food and rural development manitoba government 2018a b multiple day rainfall events were defined as two or more consecutive days

dissolved n tdn nitrate and nitrite n no3 no2 and ammonium n nh4 n for all years and sites samples were collected daily during the rising limb and peak of snowmelt and weekly during the falling limb thus in 2013 samples were collected daily from april 25th to may 13th 19 samples weekly from may 15th to june 3rd 3 samples and biweekly thereafter for a total of 34 samples per site in 2014 samples were collected daily from april 7th to april 27th 21samples weekly from may 1st to may 31 st 4 samples and biweekly thereafter for a total of 42 samples per site sampling ceased in late october or when current velocity was 0 001 103 mm9 s measured over a period of 5 min samples were not collected during winter as rivers in the rrv with the exception of the largest typically freeze to the bottom all water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles stored at 4 c in a cooler and transported to the biogeochemical analytical services laboratory university of alberta edmonton alberta samples for srp and nh4 n were filtered within 24 h of collection and frozen the remaining p and n fractions were stored at 4 c and analyzed within a week of sampling samples were analyzed using standard methods american water works association 1999 detection limits were 0 001 mg l for phosphorus tp tdp and srp 0 007 mg l for tn 0 002 mg l for no3 no2 and 0 003 mg l for nh4 n particulate p and n were determined by subtracting total dissolved from total concentrations of p and n yates and johnes 2013 dissolved unreactive phosphorus dup was calculated as the difference between tdp and srp dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and no3 no2 and nh4 n yates and johnes 2013 water levels and temperature were recorded every 30 min at each site with a pressure transducer logger hobo onset computer corporation ma usa daily discharge the volume of water moving past the study site per day was estimated by establishing a rating curve based on a power relationship between discharge measured at the nearest water survey of canada site wsc government of canada 2018a b weighted by the drainage area ratio between the sampling site and the wsc station corriveau et al 2013 and water level measured at the sampling site significant correlations between the predicted discharge values estimated by the rating curves produced for each sub watershed and the wsc station confirmed that wsc discharge corrected for difference in watershed area was a good predictor of site discharge stream runoff i e the height mm of water that drains from a sub watershed over a period of time was calculated as the volume of water flowing out of the sub watershed over a hydrologic season snowmelt spring summer and fall or the sampling year april october divided by sub watershed area nutrient loads were calculated as the product of discharge and nutrient concentrations for each hydrologic season snowmelt spring summer and fall and the sampling year april october for dates with missing nutrient concentrations values were linearly interpolated between the nearest two sampling dates as recommended by schilling et al 2017 when calculating loads using periodic grab samples comparison of loads calculated using both the linear interpolation method and the stratified beale ratio an unbiased estimator of nutrient loads booty et al 2014 showed that there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the two methods suggesting both approaches can be used as a useful and reliable tool for estimating watershed nutrient load model validation and calibration 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical tests excluding wavelet analysis were performed using minitab ver 14 minitab ver 14 2003 descriptive statistics mean standard error 95 confidence intervals were calculated both annually and seasonally for total precipitation morden station rain precipitation 5 weather stations surface runoff volume 7 study watersheds and discharge 7 study watersheds table 2 a mann whitney u test was used to compare snow depth between the two sampling years snow depth data were highly skewed thus necessitating the use of non parametric tests tiessen et al 2010 wavelet analysis was used to quantify the degree of variability for each hydrological and climate variable discharge runoff volume snow accumulation temperature and rain precipitation this analysis decomposes data on a scale by scale basis by applying filters that capture features such as abrupt changes in variability blukacz et al 2009 different filters can be used to decompose variability of the input data and it is critical to select a rigorous filter we used the daubechies filter least asymmetric filter la8 because it is better at conserving variability at a given scale than the commonly used haar filter blukacz et al 2009 in addition wavelet analysis does not have stationarity assumptions constant mean and variance like traditional approaches e g spectral analysis gençay et al 2002 labat 2005 dadu and deka 2016 recently wavelet analyses have been used on ecological data sets to quantify spatial patterns in plankton blukacz et al 2009 and in hydrology to quantify temporal patterns in hydrological signals such as precipitation and water levels kang and lin 2007 the relative importance of variability across five temporal scales ranging from daily to seasonal was measured as the slope from a log log plot of wavelet variance as a function of scale or a wavelet slope a positive wavelet slope indicates that variability increases with scale whereas the opposite holds for a negative slope blukacz et al 2009 all computations were performed using the waveslim package in r stats r core team 2014 a nonparametric mann whitney t test was used to test for significant differences in wavelet slopes between sampling years for each hydrological and climate variable two way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in nutrient concentrations nutrient ratios tdp tp srp tp pp tp tdn tn no3 no2 tn nh4 n tn and pn tn and nutrient loads among seasons and between years for the seven sub watersheds post hoc tukey s test was used to identify significant differences between each level and interaction plots were used to determine if one factor was dependent on the level of the other factor also dissolved srp dup no3 no2 nh4 n and don and particulate pp and pn concentrations and loads were expressed as a percentage of tp and tn concentrations and loads in addition bivariate plots and pearson s r correlation analysis were used to quantify seasonal relationships between hydrology and nutrient concentrations total dissolved and particulate for both study years prior to analysis concentration and load data that did not meet normality assumptions shapiro wilks test were log transformed to meet parametric assumptions 3 results 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 snow and rain precipitation patterns total snow rain annual

deep the 2012 2013 winter ended on march 18th when snow started melting from a peak depth of 35 cm to depletion on april 19th during the 2013 2014 winter snow on the ground peaked at 24 cm deep on february 13th and then melted for 45 days with an average snow depth over the melt of 12 cm in contrast to 2013 snow loss during 2014 occurred in steps with minimal loss between february 14th and march 4th and actually small gains in snow depths on certain days followed by three stepwise losses comparison of the four weeks prior to the first snow free day showed that snow depth distribution

analysis of concentration versus discharge plots showed that associations between n fractions and discharge differed between hydrologic periods and years the higher pn concentrations of 2013 were

fractions as a percentage of tn concentrations showed that on an annual basis pn concentrations comprised a small portion of tn for both years 15 25 with little variation 15 20 among seasons fig 6d on average tdn represented 76 of tn in 2013 and 80 of tn in 2014 3 3 temporal patterns in nutrient loads comparison of nutrient loads normalized to 100 showed that in 2013 pp comprised 51 of the tp load on an annual basis with pp representing the largest share of the tp pool in snowmelt 52 and the smallest share in fall 27 in 2014 the pp pool comprised 21 of the tp load annually and was proportionately greatest in spring 38 and smallest in fall 7 in the case of nitrogen pn comprised 28 of the annual tn load in 2013 compared to 17 of the annual tn load in 2014 a two way anova examining seasonal and annual variation in nutrient loads showed a significant effect of season p 0 01 for all p and n forms total particulate and dissolved with no interaction between seasons and years table 3 with the exception of pp in 2014 loads of all p and n forms were greatest during snowmelt fig 7 in addition tp pp and pn loads differed between years table 4 such that both annual and seasonal total p and particulate p and n loads were greater in 2013 than 2014 fig 7 a d h and inset the difference in pp loads between the two years was mirrored in tp loads i e a greater tp load in 2013 than 2014 table 4 but not tn loads 4 discussion the timing and quantity of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated streams in the canadian prairies was strongly influenced by differences between two years in weather conditions and in turn stream hydrology differences in maximum snow depth 35 cm in 2013 versus 24 cm in 2014 and timing of snowmelt occurring three weeks later in 2013 compared to 2014 resulted in 61 more snowmelt runoff and 58 greater snowmelt discharge in 2013 these hydroclimatic differences between years were associated with higher concentrations of pp and pn a greater share of tp concentration as pp and lower dissolved n concentrations during 2013 when snowmelt runoff generation predominated the intensity of precipitation events is recognized to influence nutrient delivery including the quantity and forms of nutrients in prairie as well as other ecoregions for example larson et al 2013 reported that tp and tn concentrations in two prairie streams missouri usa increased by 3 fold and 12 fold respectively in response to rain events likewise kalkhoff et al 2016 observed that dissimilarities in nutrient concentrations and loadings between two mid west usa agricultural catchments were related to differences in rainfall runoff and cropping practices such that increased concentrations of no3 n and tp were observed during the months and years with greatest rainfall research from two sub watersheds in england outram et al 2016 also identified that the quantity and timing of rain precipitation was directly associated with variation in volume of runoff and discharge and in turn the quantity of n or p lost from the catchment although our analysis spanned only two consecutive years the results are consistent with other studies showing that runoff and nutrient delivery from agricultural watersheds are related to daily seasonal or interannual changes in precipitation volume 4 1 hydroclimatology analysis of hydroclimatic variables showed that 2013 was typical of cold prairie region hydrology whereas 2014 was characterized by less snow earlier snow cover depletion and more rain precipitation particularly during summer wavelet analysis also showed that rainfall patterns differed between the two years exhibiting greater variability at longer i e weekly scales in 2014 consistent with occurrence of periodic storm events during summer 2014 the differences between our two study years reflect trends observed over the past five decades notably reductions in snow depth and snow cover duration derksen and brown 2012 debeer et al 2016 increases in rain precipitation and persistent rain events dumanski et al 2015 and greater delivery of rain during summer ehsanzadeh et al 2012 dumanski et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 thus our two study years although sequential represent two different hydroclimatic scenarios 2013 was typical of classic canadian prairie climate and hydrology with a snowy winter spring rain and a dry summer whereas 2014 was characterized by lower than normal snow cover earlier snow depletion and a wet summer our finding of classical weather conditions in 2013 compared to wetter rainier conditions in 2014 was associated with clear differences in stream hydrology in 2013 greater snow depth at the end of winter and less rainfall with most delivered during spring resulted in runoff and discharge being greatest during snowmelt 69 of annual runoff and substantially lower during subsequent seasons in 2014 reduced snow depth followed by a wetter summer still resulted in peak runoff and discharge during snowmelt 53 of annual runoff but was followed by greater and flashier water delivery in summer this flashier water delivery was evident in the fact that both runoff and discharge showed greatest variability at a weekly time scale in 2014 compared to a daily time scale in 2013 other researchers examining longer 60 year records of prairie hydrology have previously remarked on the variability of snowmelt discharge and runoff e g fang and pomeroy 2007 liu et al 2013 for example fang and pomeroy 2007 concluded that spring runoff and stream discharge are inherently unstable in prairie systems with lower snow depth higher air temperature and lower initial soil moisture causing a noticeable reduction in snowmelt runoff and discharge recent research has linked changes in prairie hydrology to changes in climate for example in the red river basin ehsanzadeh et al 2012 noted that abrupt upward shifts in runoff and rain precipitation in the mid 1990s as well as a gradual increase in discharge over a 96 year period were due to climate change and changing farm activities similarly analysis of historical long term normal 70 year records for smith creek a small prairie watershed in saskatchewan canada revealed an almost 50 decrease in snowmelt generated runoff and a 27 increase in rainfall generated runoff this shift in discharge generation from snowmelt to snowmelt rainfall generated runoff was interpreted to result from climate change exacerbated by changing land use and drainage dumanski et al 2015 4 2 nutrient concentrations comparison of nutrient concentrations between 2013 and 2014 revealed that the snowmelt dominated year 2013 was associated with higher annual tp concentrations as a result of elevated pp concentrations higher annual pn concentrations and lower annual concentrations of dissolved n while concentrations of all nutrient fractions were greatest during snowmelt or snowmelt and spring for both years the difference in mean annual pp concentrations between years high in 2013 and low in 2014 and greater dissolved n concentrations in 2014 resulted in a larger share of dissolved forms comprising total p and to a lesser extent total n in 2014 previous research in cold climate regions have identified that a large proportion of nutrients in both agricultural runoff and streams are in dissolved form 75 of tp as tdp in runoff from prairie fields hansen et al 2000 tiessen et al 2010 and 65 of tp as tdp and 80 of tn as tdn for small prairie streams glozier et al 2006 corriveau et al 2013 our results also showed that a large share of the p pool is in the dissolved form during snowmelt but more importantly that this fraction differs p 0 05 between years i e 64 of tp as tdp for 2013 compared to 75 of tp as tdp for 2014 in contrast the dissolved n share of the tn pool did not differ p 0 001 between years tdn represented 78 of tn in 2013 and 80 of tn in 2014 although several prairie studies e g vanni et al 2001 li et al 2011 rattan et al 2017 have quantified nutrient concentrations and fluxes over multiple years these studies focused on relationships between nutrients and human activity rather than comparing nutrient concentration fractions among years in relation to weather and hydrology our results showed that dissolved forms comprised a larger share of total nutrient pool in a year when the mechanism for discharge generation was a combination of snowmelt rainfall generated runoff versus primarily snowmelt generated runoff the seasonality we observed in nutrient concentrations and nutrient ratios relates to hydrological differences including antecedent winter conditions during snowmelt greater concentrations of particulate forms of p and n result from the erosive action associated with melt of the snow cover the deeper snow cover and later melt in 2013 when air temperatures were warmer and surficial soils had likely begun to thaw was associated with higher concentrations of pp compared to the shallower snow cover and early melt in 2014 in addition we observed that snowmelt pp and pn concentrations showed strong significant associations with discharge in 2013 but not 2014 fig s3c s4c these findings strongly suggest that the higher pn and pp concentrations during the 2013 snowmelt were related to the greater p 0 01 discharge in similar cold climate regions rankinen et al 2015 and gonzales inca et al 2018 observed high soil erodibility in partially thawed soil during snowmelt runoff soil erodibility is high in recently thawed soils because high water content decreases the cohesive strength of soil aggregates van klaveren and mccool 1998 therefore snowmelt runoff may be associated with high concentrations of suspended solids and particulate p gonzales inca et al 2018 spring was also associated with high concentrations of particulate n and p likely due to the fact that clay soils dominate the rrv and once wet i e during and following snowmelt small clay particles stay in suspension almost indefinitely due to brownian motion partheniade 2009 in summer particulate concentrations showed a sharp decline in 2013 likely due to the limited runoff and presence of vegetation which protects soil against erosion in contrast pn showed no decrease in concentration over summer and fall 2014 while pp showed only a small decrease in fall 2014 possibly because summer storms continued to ensure delivery of particulates to proximate streams 4 3 nutrient loads comparison of nutrient loads between the two study years showed that particulate loads of both p and n were greater in the snowmelt dominated year others have observed higher particulate nutrient export during snowmelt in cold climate regions cade menun et al 2013 liu et al 2013 rankinen et al 2015 though there have been no studies showing that hydrological variation can influence the particulate fractions of n and p between years our observation of greater particulate loads during the snowmelt generated year combined with the fact that the proportion of particulate p differed more between years than the proportion of particulate n suggests that hydrological variability among years could change stoichiometric n p ratios in receiving waters vanni et al 2011 rattan and chambers 2017 temporal variation in n p ratios has substantial implications for aquatic food webs in particular the productivity and composition of primary producers in lake erie the 2011 record setting algal bloom was dominated by microcystis sp followed by anabaena sp michalak et al 2013 this species replacement was likely related to shifts in n and p concentrations microcystis sp abundance was made possible by high concentrations of srp and dissolved inorganic n whereas n fixing anabaena sp occurred after the microcystis sp bloom when dissolved inorganic n was likely depleted michalak et al 2013 5 conclusions our finding that nutrient concentrations fractionation and export for prairie streams differs between years according to hydrological conditions has implications for water quality particularly in response to climate change when reduced snowmelt and increased rain events are forecast to occur during snowmelt dominated years particulate nutrient concentrations and loads are greater and likely to result in increased water turbidity in contrast during years with reduced snowmelt runoff and greater rainfall concentrations and loads of particulate n and p are lower in streams dissecting the red river valley the difference in nutrient export between snowmelt versus snow rain dominated years may require changes or adaptations to current bmps in order to control nutrient losses under a future climate change scenario while measures to reduce nutrient loss such as crop rotation liu et al 2013 and placement and timing of fertilizer application flaten 2011 have been implemented additional actions may be needed to address the variability in nutrient particularly p loss between snowmelt dominated and snowmelt rain dominated years in particular actions may be need to address the difference in seasonality of nutrient loss between snowmelt dominated years when snowmelt and spring losses predominate compared to snowmelt rain dominated year when losses occur during snowmelt spring and summer conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest

8461,study region the study area is located in southern manitoba in the prairie region of canada study focus this study examined the impact of hydrological variability on the timing and magnitude of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated watersheds in the red river valley manitoba canada new hydrological insights for the region in 2013 discharge showed a seasonal pattern typical of streams traversing the canadian prairies high discharge during snowmelt followed by cessation of flow in early june due to lack of precipitation in 2014 discharge still peaked during snowmelt but compared to 2013 was 49 lower during snowmelt yet 21 higher during summer and fall due to greater rainfall these hydrologic differences were associated with differences in fractionation of nutrients between years thus higher concentrations and loads of particulate phosphorus p and nitrogen n and a greater p 0 05 share of the total nutrient pool in particulate forms particularly for p were observed during the snowmelt dominated year 2013 our findings show that the nutrient concentrations fractionation and export from prairie watersheds differ between years and amongst hydrological seasons in relation to hydrological conditions additional management actions may be required to address changes in the quantity timing and fractionation of nutrient export associated with rainier summers forecasted under future climate scenarios keywords nutrients hydroclimatology canadian prairies lake winnipeg eutrophication 1 introduction watersheds in the central canadian prairies exhibit classic cold regions hydroclimatology with long 4 5 month cold winters followed by a short 2 5 week spring characterized by warming temperatures high surface runoff due to snowmelt over frozen soils and peak discharge glozier et al 2006 fang et al 2010 cade menun et al 2013 in contrast the remainder of the hydrologic year summer and fall is typified by limited discharge because of high evaporation and infiltration rates fang et al 2010 the strong seasonality of cold regions hydroclimatology drives the transport and delivery of nutrients and other pollutants from source watersheds to lakes e g rattan et al 2017 with the amount of snowpack and the timing and volume of runoff intrinsically linked to seasonal and interannual climate variability barnett et al 2005 for example a three year study of seasonality of nutrient export from 11 canadian prairie streams showed that total p tp and total n tn concentrations and loads both peaked during the snowmelt season rattan et al 2017 similarly rankinen et al 2015 observed that total p and total suspended solids concentrations in selected finnish catchments tracked changes in seasonal discharge with highest values in april during snowmelt because nutrient losses from cold region watersheds are closely tied to hydrology changes in snowpack depth the timing and volume of runoff and the frequency and intensity of rain events could dramatically influence the timing and magnitude of nutrient loss from the land base to proximate streams and downstream waterbodies analyses of historical data from across canada have shown significant changes in hydroclimatology over the past 60 years snow depth and snow cover duration have exhibited decreasing trends since the mid 1970s with the greatest changes observed during late winter and spring derksen and brown 2012 debeer et al 2016 in particular annual snow cover duration has decreased by an average of 4 days per decade between 1950 and 2012 equating to a shortening snow cover period of 1 to 2 months in mid western and western canada debeer et al 2016 likewise analysis of long term trends 1951 2000 in the duration of rainfall events has revealed that the frequency of multi day rain storms have increased in the mid western and western region while the number of single day events has decreased vincent et al 2012 shook and pomeroy 2012 these findings of decreases in snow cover derksen and brown 2012 dumanski et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 increases in rain precipitation and persistent rainfall events millet et al 2009 vincent et al 2012 shook and pomeroy 2012 over the last five decades have been associated with changes in the hydrology of prairie streams for example dumanski et al 2015 observed dramatic long term changes in hydrology of the smith creek research basin in southern saskatchewan canada results showed that discharge was dominated by snowmelt runoff during the earliest study years 1975 1994 whereas rain on snow contributed to higher runoff peaks in spring during subsequent years 1995 2000 moreover recent 2011 2014 rain events have produced peaks during snowmelt with secondary discharge peaks also occurring in summer dumanski et al 2015 previous research by rattan et al 2017 showed that land based activities such as fertilizer application livestock density and sewage were critical factors influencing tn and tp concentrations in canadian prairie streams whereas physical factors such as water temperature and discharge were the primary determinants of tn and tp loads these findings have implications for water management in the red river valley rrv of central canada influencing the types of beneficial management practices bmps most appropriate for minimizing nutrient loss tillage method crop residue management nutrient management water retention yet to our knowledge there are no studies that consider the effect of hydroclimatic variability on total dissolved and particulate nutrient loss from canadian prairie watersheds this study was designed to evaluate the impact of hydroclimatic variability on the timing and quantity of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated watersheds in the rrv of central canada by examining seasonal changes in dissolved and particulate nutrient export during a snowmelt dominated hydrological year versus a year with lower snowfall and higher rainfall amounts we tested the hypothesis that concentrations of particulate forms of n and p are greater in a year when snowmelt is the dominant contributor to runoff however in a year with a greater influence of rainfall generated runoff a large share of the p pool and to a lesser extent the n pool will be in the dissolved form because rainfall has a lower erosion potential than snowmelt wu et al 2018 this study provides information on the importance of inter annual variability in climate and hydrology on water quality in addition our research will support improved decision making particularly decisions regarding the type and extent of bmps required to control nutrient export to proximate and downstream receiving water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the rrv of southern manitoba fig 1 seven sub watersheds were selected from 11 sub watersheds described by rattan et al 2017 to span the range in nutrient producing agricultural activities occurring in this region four sub watersheds strongly influenced by seasonal sewage discharge were not included in the present analysis table 1 much of the watershed of the rrv is used for agriculture predominately cultivation of feed wheat oats and grain corn manitoba government 2018a b census and land use data manitoba government 2018a b confirmed that the sub watersheds were not subjected to significant changes in land use between the two study years 2013 and 2014 for example human population in southern manitoba showed no variation from 2013 to 2014 manitoba government 2018a b in addition farm locations crop cover and number of large livestock farms showed no significant p 0 05 differences between the two study years manitoba government 2018a b the well drained and cropped farmlands in the rrv are situated along a band of very low relief terrain underlain by nearly impermeable glaciolacustrine fine sediments mccullough et al 2012 this plain is intersected by small wetlands and channelized streams and rivers during snowmelt stream channels are hydrologically connected whereas during the rest of the year all streams except mainstem rivers have disconnected reaches as a result of low or no flows caused by high temperatures limited rain precipitation and increased evaporation summer and fall or frozen channels winter corriveau et al 2013 the region experiences a cold continental climate with the warmest month being july 20 c and the coldest january 14 6 c 1981 2010 long term means for morden mb government of canada 2018 annual precipitation averages 426 mm with 27

precipitation in each of those months snowmelt typically produces 60 of annual runoff with soils usually remaining frozen at the time of snowmelt thereby preventing infiltration of the water rapidly released by the melting snow ali et al 2017 rain precipitation of high intensity can occur in spring summer or early fall resulting in intermittent flashy discharge fang et al 2010 bmps used in cold climate prairie regions primarily reduce particulate loss these practices include buffer strips and conservation tillage and have been proven effective in reducing particulate nutrient export uusi kamppa et al 2012 these practices may not however be as effective in controlling the loss of dissolved nutrients entering streams for example the lack of soil inversion with conservation tillage can result in accumulation of nutrients at the soil surface resulting in a greater proportion of dissolved nutrients in runoff tiessen et al 2010 li et al 2011 cade menun et al 2013 2 2 hydroclimatic data historical long term means 1980 2010 and contemporary 2013 2014 air temperature and snow depth data were obtained from the morden mb climate station government of canada 2018a b the only station in the region with snow data snow depth expressed as centimetres on the ground was used to identify maximum snow depth duration of continuous snow cover and first snow free date the duration of continuous snow cover was defined as the longest length of time within one snow season where snow depth is 1 cm the first snow free date was the first day when snow depth was 0 cm total precipitation snow rain data were available for only one station morden from environment and climate change canada government of canada 2018a b rain precipitation data daily volumes mm were obtained from five weather stations all seven study sites were located within 30 km of a weather station one station morden from environment and climate change canada government of canada 2018a b and another four stations carman altona starbuck and elm creek from manitoba agriculture food and rural development manitoba government 2018a b multiple day rainfall events were defined as two or more consecutive days

dissolved n tdn nitrate and nitrite n no3 no2 and ammonium n nh4 n for all years and sites samples were collected daily during the rising limb and peak of snowmelt and weekly during the falling limb thus in 2013 samples were collected daily from april 25th to may 13th 19 samples weekly from may 15th to june 3rd 3 samples and biweekly thereafter for a total of 34 samples per site in 2014 samples were collected daily from april 7th to april 27th 21samples weekly from may 1st to may 31 st 4 samples and biweekly thereafter for a total of 42 samples per site sampling ceased in late october or when current velocity was 0 001 103 mm9 s measured over a period of 5 min samples were not collected during winter as rivers in the rrv with the exception of the largest typically freeze to the bottom all water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles stored at 4 c in a cooler and transported to the biogeochemical analytical services laboratory university of alberta edmonton alberta samples for srp and nh4 n were filtered within 24 h of collection and frozen the remaining p and n fractions were stored at 4 c and analyzed within a week of sampling samples were analyzed using standard methods american water works association 1999 detection limits were 0 001 mg l for phosphorus tp tdp and srp 0 007 mg l for tn 0 002 mg l for no3 no2 and 0 003 mg l for nh4 n particulate p and n were determined by subtracting total dissolved from total concentrations of p and n yates and johnes 2013 dissolved unreactive phosphorus dup was calculated as the difference between tdp and srp dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated as the difference between tdn and no3 no2 and nh4 n yates and johnes 2013 water levels and temperature were recorded every 30 min at each site with a pressure transducer logger hobo onset computer corporation ma usa daily discharge the volume of water moving past the study site per day was estimated by establishing a rating curve based on a power relationship between discharge measured at the nearest water survey of canada site wsc government of canada 2018a b weighted by the drainage area ratio between the sampling site and the wsc station corriveau et al 2013 and water level measured at the sampling site significant correlations between the predicted discharge values estimated by the rating curves produced for each sub watershed and the wsc station confirmed that wsc discharge corrected for difference in watershed area was a good predictor of site discharge stream runoff i e the height mm of water that drains from a sub watershed over a period of time was calculated as the volume of water flowing out of the sub watershed over a hydrologic season snowmelt spring summer and fall or the sampling year april october divided by sub watershed area nutrient loads were calculated as the product of discharge and nutrient concentrations for each hydrologic season snowmelt spring summer and fall and the sampling year april october for dates with missing nutrient concentrations values were linearly interpolated between the nearest two sampling dates as recommended by schilling et al 2017 when calculating loads using periodic grab samples comparison of loads calculated using both the linear interpolation method and the stratified beale ratio an unbiased estimator of nutrient loads booty et al 2014 showed that there were no significant differences p 0 05 between the two methods suggesting both approaches can be used as a useful and reliable tool for estimating watershed nutrient load model validation

study watersheds table 2 a mann whitney u test was used to compare snow depth between the two sampling years snow depth data were highly skewed thus necessitating the use of non parametric tests tiessen et al 2010 wavelet analysis was used to quantify the degree of variability for each hydrological and climate variable discharge runoff volume snow accumulation temperature and rain precipitation this analysis decomposes data on a scale by scale basis by applying filters that capture features such as abrupt changes in variability blukacz et al 2009 different filters can be used to decompose variability of the input data and it is critical to select a rigorous filter we used the daubechies filter least asymmetric filter la8 because it is better at conserving variability at a given scale than the commonly used haar filter blukacz et al 2009 in addition wavelet analysis does not have stationarity assumptions constant mean and variance like traditional approaches e g spectral analysis gençay et al 2002 labat 2005 dadu and deka 2016 recently wavelet analyses have been used on ecological data sets to quantify spatial patterns in plankton blukacz et al 2009 and in hydrology to quantify temporal patterns in hydrological signals such as precipitation and water levels kang and lin 2007 the relative importance of variability across five temporal scales ranging from daily to seasonal was measured as the slope from a log log plot of wavelet variance as a function of scale or a wavelet slope a positive wavelet slope indicates that variability increases with scale whereas the opposite holds for a negative slope blukacz et al 2009 all computations were performed using the waveslim package in r stats r core team 2014 a nonparametric mann whitney t test was used to test for significant differences in wavelet slopes between sampling years for each hydrological and climate variable two way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in nutrient

to identify significant differences between each level and interaction plots were used to determine if one factor was dependent on the level of the other factor also dissolved srp dup no3 no2 nh4 n and don and particulate pp and pn concentrations and loads were expressed as a percentage of tp and tn concentrations and loads in addition bivariate plots and pearson s r correlation analysis were used to quantify seasonal relationships between hydrology and nutrient concentrations total dissolved and particulate for both study years prior to analysis concentration and load data that did not meet normality assumptions shapiro wilks test were log transformed to meet parametric assumptions 3 results 3 1 hydrology 3 1 1 snow and rain precipitation patterns total snow rain annual

average tdn represented 76 of tn in 2013 and 80 of tn in 2014 3 3 temporal patterns in nutrient loads comparison of nutrient loads normalized to 100 showed that in 2013 pp comprised 51 of the tp load

seasonal total p and particulate p and n loads were greater in 2013 than 2014 fig 7 a d h and inset the difference in pp loads between the two years was mirrored in tp loads i e a greater tp load in 2013 than 2014 table 4 but not tn loads 4 discussion the timing and quantity of nutrient export from seven agriculturally dominated streams in the canadian prairies was strongly influenced by differences between two years in weather conditions and in turn stream hydrology differences in maximum snow depth 35 cm in 2013 versus 24 cm in 2014 and timing of snowmelt occurring three weeks later in 2013 compared to 2014 resulted in 61 more snowmelt runoff and 58 greater snowmelt discharge in 2013 these hydroclimatic differences between years were associated with higher concentrations of pp and pn a greater share of tp concentration as pp and lower dissolved n concentrations during 2013 when snowmelt runoff generation predominated the intensity of precipitation events is recognized to influence nutrient delivery including the quantity and forms of nutrients in prairie as well as other ecoregions for example larson et al 2013 reported that tp and tn concentrations in two prairie streams missouri usa increased by 3 fold and 12 fold respectively in response to rain events likewise kalkhoff et al 2016 observed that dissimilarities in nutrient concentrations and loadings between two mid west usa agricultural catchments were related to differences in rainfall runoff and cropping practices such that increased concentrations of no3 n and tp were observed during the months and years with greatest rainfall research from two sub watersheds in england outram et al 2016 also identified that the quantity and timing of rain precipitation was directly associated with variation in volume of runoff and discharge and in turn the quantity of n or p lost from the catchment although our analysis spanned only two consecutive years the results are consistent with other studies showing that runoff and nutrient delivery from agricultural watersheds are related to daily seasonal or interannual changes in precipitation volume 4 1 hydroclimatology analysis of hydroclimatic variables showed that 2013 was typical of cold prairie region hydrology whereas 2014 was characterized by less snow earlier snow cover depletion and more rain precipitation particularly during summer wavelet analysis also showed that rainfall patterns differed between the two years exhibiting greater variability at longer i e weekly scales in 2014 consistent with occurrence of periodic storm events during summer 2014 the differences between our two study years reflect trends observed over the past five decades notably reductions in snow depth and snow cover duration derksen and brown 2012 debeer et al 2016 increases in rain precipitation and persistent rain events dumanski et al 2015 and greater delivery of rain during summer ehsanzadeh et al 2012 dumanski et al 2015 vincent et al 2015 thus our two study years although sequential represent two different hydroclimatic scenarios 2013 was typical of classic canadian prairie climate and hydrology with a snowy winter spring rain and a dry summer whereas 2014 was characterized by lower than normal snow cover earlier snow depletion and a wet summer our finding of classical weather conditions in 2013 compared to wetter rainier conditions in 2014 was associated with clear differences in stream hydrology in 2013 greater snow depth at the end of winter and less rainfall with most delivered during spring resulted in runoff and discharge being greatest during snowmelt 69 of annual runoff and substantially lower during subsequent seasons in 2014 reduced snow depth followed by a wetter summer still resulted in peak runoff and discharge during snowmelt 53 of annual runoff but was followed by greater and flashier water delivery in summer this flashier water delivery was evident in the fact that both runoff and discharge showed greatest variability at a weekly time scale in 2014 compared to a daily time scale in 2013 other researchers examining longer 60 year records of prairie hydrology have previously remarked on the variability of snowmelt discharge and runoff e g fang and pomeroy 2007 liu et al 2013 for example fang and pomeroy 2007 concluded that spring runoff and stream discharge are inherently unstable in prairie systems with lower snow depth higher air temperature and lower initial soil moisture causing a noticeable reduction in snowmelt runoff and discharge recent research has linked changes in prairie hydrology to changes in climate for example in the red river basin ehsanzadeh et al 2012 noted that abrupt upward shifts in runoff and rain precipitation in the mid 1990s as well as a gradual increase in discharge over a 96 year period were due to climate change and changing farm activities similarly analysis of historical long term normal 70 year records for smith creek a small prairie watershed in saskatchewan canada revealed an almost 50 decrease in snowmelt generated runoff and a 27 increase in rainfall generated runoff this shift in discharge generation from snowmelt to snowmelt rainfall generated runoff was interpreted to result from climate change exacerbated by changing land use and drainage dumanski et al 2015 4 2 nutrient concentrations comparison of nutrient concentrations between 2013 and 2014 revealed that the snowmelt dominated year 2013 was associated with higher annual tp concentrations as a result of elevated pp concentrations higher annual pn concentrations and lower annual concentrations of dissolved n while concentrations of all nutrient fractions were greatest during snowmelt or snowmelt and spring for both years the difference in mean annual pp concentrations between years high in 2013 and low in 2014 and greater dissolved n concentrations in 2014 resulted in a larger share of dissolved forms comprising total p and to a lesser extent total n in 2014 previous research in cold climate regions have identified that a large proportion of nutrients in both agricultural runoff and streams are in dissolved form 75 of tp as tdp in runoff from prairie fields hansen et al 2000 tiessen et al 2010 and 65 of tp as tdp and 80 of tn as tdn for small prairie streams glozier et al 2006 corriveau et al 2013 our results also showed that a large share of the p pool is in the dissolved form during snowmelt but more importantly that this fraction differs p 0 05 between years i e 64 of tp as tdp for 2013 compared to 75 of tp as tdp for 2014 in contrast the dissolved n share of the tn pool did not differ p 0 001 between years tdn represented 78 of tn in 2013 and 80 of tn in 2014 although several prairie studies e g vanni et al 2001 li et al 2011 rattan et al 2017 have quantified nutrient concentrations and fluxes over multiple years these studies focused on relationships between nutrients and human activity rather than comparing nutrient concentration fractions among years in relation to weather and hydrology our results showed that dissolved forms comprised a larger share of total nutrient pool in a year when the mechanism for discharge generation was a combination of snowmelt rainfall generated runoff versus primarily snowmelt generated runoff the seasonality we observed in nutrient concentrations and nutrient ratios relates to hydrological differences including antecedent winter conditions during snowmelt greater concentrations of particulate forms of p and n result from the erosive action associated with melt of the snow cover the deeper snow cover and later melt in 2013 when air temperatures were warmer and surficial soils had likely begun to thaw was associated with higher concentrations of pp compared to the shallower snow cover and early melt in 2014 in addition we observed that snowmelt pp and pn concentrations showed strong significant associations with discharge in 2013 but not 2014 fig s3c s4c these findings strongly suggest that the higher pn and pp concentrations during the 2013 snowmelt were related to the greater p 0 01 discharge in similar cold climate regions rankinen et al 2015 and gonzales inca et al 2018 observed high soil erodibility in partially thawed soil during snowmelt runoff soil erodibility is high in recently thawed soils because high water content decreases the cohesive strength of soil aggregates van klaveren and mccool 1998 therefore snowmelt runoff may be associated with high concentrations of suspended solids and particulate p gonzales inca et al 2018 spring was also associated with high concentrations of particulate n and p likely due to the fact that clay soils dominate the rrv and once wet i e during and following snowmelt small clay particles stay in suspension almost indefinitely due to brownian motion partheniade 2009 in summer particulate concentrations showed a sharp decline in 2013 likely due to the limited runoff and presence of vegetation which protects soil against erosion in contrast pn showed no decrease in concentration over summer and fall 2014 while pp showed only a small decrease in fall 2014 possibly because summer storms continued to ensure delivery of particulates to proximate streams 4 3 nutrient loads comparison of nutrient loads between the two study years showed that particulate loads of both p and n were greater in the snowmelt dominated year others have observed higher particulate nutrient export during snowmelt in cold climate regions cade menun et al 2013 liu et al 2013 rankinen et al 2015 though there have been no studies showing that hydrological variation can influence the particulate fractions of n and p between years our observation of greater particulate loads during the snowmelt generated year combined with the fact that the proportion of particulate p differed more between years than the proportion of particulate n suggests that hydrological variability among years could change stoichiometric n p ratios in receiving waters vanni et al 2011 rattan and chambers 2017 temporal variation in n p ratios has substantial implications for aquatic food webs in particular the productivity and composition of primary producers in lake erie the 2011 record setting algal bloom was dominated by microcystis sp followed by anabaena sp michalak et al 2013 this species replacement was likely related to shifts in n and p concentrations microcystis sp abundance was made possible by high concentrations of srp and dissolved inorganic n whereas n fixing anabaena sp occurred after the microcystis sp bloom when dissolved inorganic n was likely depleted michalak et al 2013 5 conclusions our finding that nutrient concentrations fractionation and export for prairie streams differs between years according to hydrological conditions has implications for water quality particularly in response to climate change when reduced snowmelt and increased rain events are forecast to occur during snowmelt dominated years particulate nutrient concentrations and loads are greater and likely to result in increased water turbidity in contrast during years with reduced snowmelt runoff and greater rainfall concentrations and loads of particulate n and p are lower in streams dissecting the red river valley the difference in nutrient export between snowmelt versus snow rain dominated years may require changes or adaptations to current bmps in order to control nutrient losses under a future climate change scenario while measures to reduce nutrient loss such as crop rotation liu et al 2013 and placement and timing of fertilizer application flaten 2011 have been implemented additional actions may be needed to address the variability in nutrient particularly p loss between snowmelt dominated and snowmelt rain dominated years in particular actions may be need to address the difference in seasonality of nutrient loss between snowmelt dominated years when snowmelt and spring losses predominate compared to snowmelt rain dominated year when losses occur during snowmelt spring and summer conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest

8462,study region this study focuses on two study areas the province of trento italy 6200 km² and entire sweden 447000km² the province of trento is a complex mountainous area including subarctic humid continental and tundra climates sweden instead is mainly dominated by a subarctic climate in the north and an oceanic climate in the south study focus hydrological predictions often require long weather time series of high temporal resolution daily observations typically exceed the length of sub daily observations and daily gauges are more widely available than sub daily gauges the issue can be overcome by disaggregating daily into sub daily values we present an open source tool for the non parametric space time disaggregation of daily precipitation and temperature into hourly values called spatial method of fragments s mof a large number of comparative experiments was conducted for both s mof and mof in the two study regions new hydrological insights for the region our experiments demonstrate the applicability of the univariate and spatial method of fragments in the two temperate subarctic study regions where snow processes are important s mof is able to produce consistent precipitation and temperature fields at sub daily resolution with acceptable method related bias for precipitation although climatologically more complex s mof generally leads to better results in the province of trento than in sweden mainly due to the smaller spatial extent of the former region keywords precipitation temperature disaggregation space time scaling non parametric method of fragments 1 introduction for hydrological predictions the available records of precipitation and temperature are usually longest at daily resolution and daily gauges are more widely available than sub daily gauges pui et al 2012 reynolds et al 2017 sub daily records are often short even in high income countries di baldassarre et al 2006 in hydrology characteristic space and time scales exist blöschl and sivapalan 1995 skoien et al 2003 in small catchments for example daily resolution often does not match the temporal scale of hydrological processes blöschl and sivapalan 1995 reynolds et al 2017 a high temporal resolution of precipitation is particularly desirable when modelling flash floods or local erosion lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 sikorska and seibert 2018 for example the rapid response parameters of conceptual hydrological models largely depend on the temporal resolution of the precipitation input and calibrating to sub daily resolution can lead to better

and transpiration boote et al 2013 simulating yields of the major annual food crops requires at the minimum hourly temperature porter and semenov 2005 unlike in the case of precipitation the role of consistent high resolution temperature fields i e the spatial signal has received less attention in the literature a possible explanation may be the high spatial correlation of temperature through its continuous non intermittent nature while different authors have proposed sophisticated distributed energy balance models of high temporal resolution e g lehning et al 2006 rigon et al 2006 warscher et

observations and ii still provide high resolution forcing data for distributed process oriented modelling daily meteorological records can be disaggregated into finer time steps the daily records for

of different univariate precipitation disaggregation techniques conversion from daily into sub daily temperature is typically achieved by sinusoidal approaches when the daily maximum and minimum

2013 first müller and haberlandt 2015 disaggregated the precipitation independently at each site second they used simulated annealing to transform the disaggregated and inconsistent precipitation fields into spatial consistency bardossy and pegram 2016 proposed a space time method for disaggregating daily precipitation to hourly intensities using a gaussian copula based model increased attention has been recently dedicated to space time approaches based on the idea of the univariate non parametric method of fragments mof mehrotra et al 2012 sharma and srikanthan 2006 westra et al 2012 the fundamental idea of mof is disaggregate the day of interest using a similar candidate day similarity can be derived in different ways e g similar season precipitation amount etc and impose the relative distribution i e fragments of the candidate day on the day of interest mezghani and hingray 2009 applied a space time version of mof for disaggregating climate projections where potential candidates are selected from a temporal window a method later on used in a similar way by lu and qin 2014 the best fragments are selected among these potential candidates using the mahalanobis distance the highest probability is assigned to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using the method presented in lall and sharma 1996 li et al 2018 presented a space time approach based on mof called mul using daily regional precipitation means clustered into different intensity classes for identifying suitable candidates for the disaggregation although not developed for hourly disaggregation evin et al 2018 presented a similar method for disaggregating spatial precipitation fields from a 3 day temporal resolution to a daily resolution candidate fragments are selected based on the season class of intensity and using a score of similarity computed across the precipitation fields in this paper we propose a robust non parametric method for the space time disaggregation of precipitation and temperature the method is another spatial interpretation of the non parametric method of fragments mof hereafter called s mof we applied s mof in two diverse study areas in terms of climates and spatial scales which were the province of trento italy area 6200 km² and entire sweden area 447000km² moreover we examine the performance of a joint i e multivariate and separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature and demonstrate the impact of imbalances in available daily and sub daily gauges using different interpolation techniques in both study areas s mof is able to reproduce spatially consistent precipitation and temperature fields with acceptable method related bias non parametric approaches have a long tradition in hydrology and have not only been applied in the temporal disaggregation of weather time series but also real time flood forecasting brath et al 2002 generation of stream flow time series lall and sharma 1996 markovic et al 2015 or stochastic weather generation brandsma and buishand 1998 wojcik and buishand 2003 such methods are usually characterized by a low level of complexity non parametric approaches do not require data transformations or assumptions regarding the dependence structure of the data borgomeo et al 2015 however as they are fully data driven they can be sensitive to outliers villarini et al 2008 non parametric methods also rely on a representative data sample despite their differences non parametric and parametric approaches share the same general problem a too strong stratification compared to a limited sample size may lead to a perfect fit with limited prediction power whereas a weaker stratification i e fewer parameters implies a decrease of fitting performance but improved prediction skills the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the proposed space time disaggregation algorithm section 3 presents the design of real data experiments in the two study areas section 4 provides the related results and section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions with recommendations for application 2 disaggregation algorithm for the sake of clarity we first introduce the basic concept of mof at single sites for precipitation step by step and then describe our spatial interpretation including the disaggregation of temperature s mof 2 1 disaggregation of precipitation at single sites using mof the method of fragments mof is a non parametric disaggregation technique the idea is to resample a vector of fragments that represents the relative distribution of sub daily to daily precipitation pui et al 2012 the number of fragments corresponds to the sub daily temporal resolution used i e if the disaggregation is conducted from daily to hourly values the relative distribution of sub daily values consists of 24 relative weights that sum up to 1 in the simulation variability is introduced by a k nearest neighbor algorithm the procedure can be summarized as follows i obtain the daily precipitation value r t to disaggregate where t represents the date of the day r t may be the aggregated sum of the observed hourly time series or taken from another source such as observed daily records or from a stochastic daily weather generator use the observational hourly records x i m to build daily time series r i where m is the hourly time step and i denotes the day eq 1 1 r i 1 24 x i m form a time series with hourly to daily ratios eq 2 2 f i m x i m r i ii build a window with l days around the day t of the daily precipitation records for example if t represents the 1 st of january and l 14 all days between the 18th of december and the 15th of january from all available years are considered for disaggregation to avoid the recreation of the observations the current year is discarded if the aggregated observed hourly records are used as the daily value r t iii to account for the continuity of rainstorms such as more persistent frontal rainstorms only take into account days from step ii that correspond to the same class of wet dry days of the neighboring days according to the following four classes eq 3 3 class 1 dry wet dry r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 2 wet wet dry r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 3 dry wet wet r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 4 wet wet wet r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 where j denotes a day within the moving window around the specific date t for disaggregation iv identify the class c t c t c l a s s 1 4 to which r t belongs v identify the number of nearest neighbors k n where n denotes the sample size of all days falling within the moving window and meeting the class criterion build a vector r j from the absolute differences for all neighbors using r j r t for all j 1 2 k and assign the highest probability p j to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using eq 4 lall and sharma 1996 4 p j 1 j i 1 k 1 i sample from eq 4 inverse cumulative distribution function using a uniformly distributed random number 0 1 use the date of the sampled day and find the corresponding hourly ratios from f i m and form the new disaggregated time series r t for day t using eq 5 5 r t r t f i m vi repeat step ii to step v for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated an inherent property of mof and other block bootstrap algorithms is that the temporal correlation of the precipitation is maintained within the disaggregated vectors of 24 h and discontinuities occur between blocks improvements to address this issue have been discussed sharma and srikanthan 2006 but are not further discussed here 2 2 transferring mof into space for precipitation and temperature the proposed non parametric s mof model works as follows i obtain the daily precipitation vector r t s to disaggregate where t represents the date of the day and s individual sites of the observation network as in the case of the univariate mof r t s can come from the observed multi site hourly records used for the disaggregation or from another source such as daily weather generators use the observational hourly records x i m s to build daily time vectors r i s where i denotes the day m is the hourly time step and s is a site of the observation network eq 6 6 r i s 1 s 24 x i m s form a time series of vectors with hourly to daily ratios eq 7 7 f i m s x i m s r i s ii build a window with l days around the day t of the daily precipitation records for example if t represents the 1 st of january and l 14 all days between the 18th of december and the 15th of january from all available years are considered for disaggregation to avoid the recreation of the observations the current year is discarded if the observations are used as the daily vector r t s iii instead of using binary precipitation information populate the matrix a p with actual precipitation amounts a p eq 8 the precipitation amounts are standardized beforehand with a square root standardization which is preferable for positively skewed variables such as precipitation stephenson et al 1999 the standardization led to an improved reproduction of dry and wet spells in our experiments a standardization of the temperature did not lead to an improved performance and was thus not considered 8 a p r t 1 s 1 r t 1 s 2 r t 1 s n r t s 1 r t s 2 r t s n r t 1 s 1 r t 1 s 2 r t 1 s n r t 1 s n 0 r t s n 0 r t 1 s n 0 compare matrix a p to the values for disaggregation by building matrices b p for all days j within the moving window around the specific date eq 9 t accordingly also here the square root standardization must be applied 9 b p r j 1 s 1 r j 1 s 2 r j 1 s n r j s 1 r j s 2 r j s n r j 1 s 1 r j 1 s 2 r j 1 s n r j 1 s n 0 r j s n 0 r j 1 s n 0 a separate i e independent of the precipitation disaggregation for the temperature is conducted accordingly with the matrices a t and b t populated with the temperature observations eqs 10 and 11 10 a t t t 1 s 1 t t 1 s 2 t t 1 s n t t s 1 t t s 2 t t s n t t 1 s 1 t t 1 s 2 t t 1 s n t t 1 s n ℝ t t s n ℝ t t 1 s n ℝ 11 b t t j 1 s 1 t j 1 s 2 t j 1 s n t j s 1 t j s 2 t j s n t j 1 s 1 t j 1 s 2 t j 1 s n t j 1 s n ℝ t j s n ℝ t j 1 s n ℝ a joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature was also tested that is the matrices a p and a t as well as b p and b t were joined into the matrices a m and b m eqs 12 and 13 containing both meteorological variables 12 13 if the entire day t is dry at all sites of the observation network a m and b m reduce to t t s n and t j s n the rationale behind the joint disaggregation was to examine whether using the precipitation and temperature from the same day for disaggregation would lead to a more consistent disaggregation of both variables thereby maintaining the dry and wet temperatures iv use a distance measure d to derive the similarities between a p a t and all instances of b p b t or in case of a joint disaggregation a w and b w we used the manhattan distance eq 14 which also turned out to work well with nearest neighbor algorithms for univariate precipitation disaggregation e g breinl et al 2017b 14 d a b i 1 j a b v identify the number of nearest neighbors k m where m denotes the number of days falling within the moving window the distances are sorted for all j 1 2 k and the highest probability p j is assigned to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using eq 4 vi sample a neighbor using a uniformly distributed random number 0 1 from the inverse cumulative distribution function from eq 4 the date of the sampled day is used and the corresponding hourly ratios are applied at each site in the disaggregation for the precipitation vectors the new hourly time series r i s are derived using eq 15 15 r i s r t s f i m s for the temperature the disaggregation method is different first a time series of the absolute deviations between the hourly values and their mean is generated eq 16 16 g i m s y i m s y i m s the new disaggregated temperature time series for day t is then derived with eq 17 using the daily mean temperature t t s 17 t i s t t s g i m s this adapted method for the temperature eqs 16 and 17 ensures that the hourly distribution of negative and positive values in cold seasons is maintained after the disaggregation and that the deviations between the input and disaggregated hourly values are kept constant over the 24 h which is important for the temperature autocorrelation vii repeat step ii to step vi for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated to reduce the impact of densely spaced sites of a network in particular for precipitation it can help to use thiessen weights which are then multiplied with the corresponding columns of the matrices a eqs 8 10 and 12 however thiessen weights did not noticeably improve the results in the two study areas presented 3 data experiments and validation 3 1 study area and data we applied s mof to two different study areas in the first study area we used hourly precipitation and temperature records from 48 gauges in the north of italy province of trento fig 1 covering a period of 15 years 1992 2006 the maximum distance between the sites is 104 km area about 6200 km² the complex mountainous area in italy comprises subarctic humid continental and tundra climates kottek et al 2006 the total annual precipitation varies between 760 mm and 1500 mm mean 1100 mm across all sites the percentage of wet days varies between 31 6 and 47 2 mean 37 2 the mean annual temperature ranges from 0 6 c to 8 5 c mean 5 3 c the second study area is the entire country of sweden area of approximately 447000km² fig 1 for sweden 22 years 1996 2017 of simultaneous hourly precipitation and temperature time series were available 65 gauges the maximum distance between sites is 1430 km accordingly the density of the gauge station network in italy is about 53 times higher sweden is mainly dominated by a subarctic climate in the north and an oceanic climate in the south kottek et al 2006 the total annual precipitation varies between 398 mm and 1000 mm mean 577 mm the percentage of wet days varies between 42 2 and 58 3 mean 50 6 the mean annual temperature ranges from 1 3 c to 8 8 c mean 4 6 c both study areas are characterized by temperate and continental climates and snow processes are important 3 2 types of experiments and related methods we conducted seven major types of experiments for s mof and three major experiments for mof as a benchmark table 1 in addition we applied s mof in a univariate setup i e separate disaggregation at each site hereinafter called mof table 1 we limited the number of experiments for the univariate algorithms mof and mof to keep the study concise in all experiments we conducted the disaggregation 50 times and compared observations with simulations to better understand the impact of missing data in the observation records we randomly removed 10 and 30 of the entire observation days in each of the 50 simulations m10 and m30 table 1 also as described in the introduction the number of available sub daily gauges may be lower than the number of daily gauges we thus tested the influence of a reduced gauge network by intentionally reducing the number of sub daily sites for the disaggregation using s mof to do so we applied an advanced interpolation routine using 70 50 and 30 of the hourly gauges int70 int50 int30 table 1 and a simplified interpolation routine using 50 of the hourly gauges int50s table 1 for mof and mof we only applied int50 and int50 s to keep the tests concise to mimic the complexity of real life data availability the network was randomly reduced to the required percentage in each of the 50 simulation runs in the advanced interpolation routine for precipitation we first built 24 hour hyetographs for the site without hourly information i e the removed site from the three hyetographs h n of three closest gauges with precipitation records the three neighbouring hyetographs were weighted according to the inverse of their distance w n to the site without hourly information eq 18 18 h d i s a g g w 1 h 1 w 2 h 2 w 3 h 3 where h 1 is the 24 hour hyetograph of the first of the three nearest sites with precipitation records w 1 is the inverse of the distance between the site of disaggregation and the first neighbouring site and so forth w 1 w 2 w 3 is scaled to 1 as the hyetographs h n may overlap in time e g time lag from moving weather systems there is the possibility of overestimating the number of wet hours at the site of disaggregation for this reason the final hyetograph was adapted by randomly cutting out a fraction of h d i s a g g with the weighted average length of each of the three neighbouring hyetographs the weights for the lengths were again derived from the three distances the starting hour of the fraction was randomly chosen within the total duration of h d i s a g g this procedure turned out to avoid the simulation of too many wet hours at the site of disaggregation the procedure was applied accordingly in the advanced temperature interpolation but without the step of cutting out a fraction as temperature is continuous and non intermittent in the simplistic interpolation procedure precipitation and temperature we assigned each of the removed site to the closest site of the reduced network i e our criterion of similarity was the spatial distance there are other ways of selecting a suitable neighbouring site such as using the crossing distance which penalizes the crossing of crests and valleys gottardi et al 2012 likewise other general interpolation routines such as kriging with external drift ked would be possible we focused on the following ten non spatial and spatial statistical metrics to evaluate the algorithm performance at each site in regard to hourly precipitation extremes 50th 75th and 99th percentiles standard deviation in mm skewness of the distribution of wet hours mean length of dry spells mean length of wet spells lag1 autocorrelation lag2 autocorrelation inter site correlation spatial metric inter site correlation lagged by one hour spatial metric continuity ratio spatial metric the continuity ratio c wilks 1998 is a tool for assessing the quality of simulated precipitation and is defined as eq 19 19 c e x i x i 0 x j 0 e x i x i 0 x j 0 the continuity ratio defines the ratio of the mean of the precipitation at site i depending on whether site j is wet or dry if the correlation between sites is high the continuity ratio will be relatively small and if the correlation is low it will be relatively large for hourly temperature we used the following six non spatial and spatial statistical metrics for the evaluation at each site extremes 50th 75th and 99th percentiles standard deviation in c lag1 autocorrelation lag2 autocorrelation inter site correlation spatial metric inter site correlation lagged by one hour spatial metric in all experiments the observed hourly values were first aggregated to daily values and then disaggregated using s mof mof and mof we applied the three algorithms with a window of l 30 i e 60 days as without day t and 8 neighbors k see 2 1 ii and v all experiments described above were conducted twice for both study areas one time with a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 8 11 and one time jointly i e the same day was used for the disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 12 and 13 as explained above the motivation for the joint disaggregation was our hypothesis that the joint procedure would result in an improved simulation of hourly dry and wet temperatures in the main paper we present the main results for a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature the reason is that the separate disaggregation scheme turned out in contradiction to our hypothesis to be preferable which we further demonstrate in section 4 3 where we compare results from the joint and separate disaggregation schemes we present results based on the entire annual time series seasonal results can be obtained from the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 precipitation fig 2 shows the results for the separate disaggregation of precipitation in italy the boxplots for the observations are built from all sites of the observation network the boxplots for the simulations are built from all sites and the mean of all 50 simulations the dashed red line indicates the median of the observations the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles for the extremes all algorithms and all experiments lead to a slight overestimation s mof full network leads to a mean absolute error mae of 0 44 mean absolute percentage error mape 8 9 while mof and mof lead to a mae of 0 56 and 0 47 mape 9 5 and 8 6 the slightly higher overestimation of the mae with mof is related to the reduced number of potential neighbors in the disaggregation as the four binary classes eq 3 represent an additional constraint this constraint does not exist in s mof and mof an increasing number of missing values 10 and 30 in s mof increases the bias in simulating extremes the advanced interpolation outperforms the simplistic interpolation for all three algorithms the results are similar for the standard deviation of hourly precipitation and the skewness of wet hours while all algorithms and experiments lead to an overestimation of the observations s mof tends to produce less bias the improved performance of mof in comparison with mof can again be explained by the additional constraint of binary classes in mof for dry spells the univariate mof and mof algorithms lead to slightly better results in terms of the mae s mof 1 64 mof 1 37 mof 1 00 and mape s mof 4 6 mof 3 9 mof 2 8 this observation does not apply to wet spells where s mof performs better in terms of the mae s mof 0 16 mof 0 31 mof 0 27 and mape s mof 4 6 mof 9 0 mof 7 8 the interpolation has a more pronounced effect with s mof compared to mof and mof while the advanced interpolation leads to better results of reproducing dry spells in s mof int50 mae 1 20 int50s mae 2 76 the simplistic interpolation leads to equally good results in the simulation of wet spells int50 mae 0 21 int50s mae 0 22 in general the interpolation routines have a less pronounced impact on the simulation results with mof and mof compared to s mof all algorithms tend to underestimate the autocorrelation of precipitation however s mof and mof perform better than mof for the lag1 autocorrelation the mae of s mof mof and mof is 0 04 0 07 and 0 05 mape 6 8 11 9 and 8 9 the reason is that mof uses binary classes to simulate the continuity of rainstorms while s mof and mof use the actual precipitation amounts the advanced interpolation leads to better results when simulating the autocorrelation missing data increase the bias in s mof the key difference in the performance of s mof and the univariate algorithms becomes obvious when examining statistics related to the spatial characteristics of the precipitation fields namely the inter site correlations and the continuity ratio both univariate algorithms fail in reproducing the inter site correlations by a pronounced underestimation while the continuity ratio is clearly overestimated for the inter site correlation s mof leads to a mae of 0 02 mof 0 26 mof 0 25 and to a mape of 3 9 mof 57 2 mof 54 9 the differences are equally pronounced for the continuity ratio the lack of skills of the univariate algorithms becomes even more obvious when using scatter plots for the spatial metrics from fig 2 fig s1 in the supplementary material fig 3 shows the results for the separate disaggregation of precipitation for sweden for the extremes unlike in italy the univariate algorithms mof mae 0 14 mape 7 1 and mof mae 0 12 mape 6 6 perform better than s mof mae 0 32 mape 15 4 the same applies to the standard deviation of precipitation and the skewness the reason is that in the significantly larger study area of sweden the candidate vectors are characterized by a higher variability than in italy this is related to the higher heterogeneity of the climate while missing values have a similar negative effect on the statistics as in italy interpolation routines generally lead to a more pronounced bias with s mof compared to mof and mof in particular for the standard deviation the advanced interpolation routine produces less bias with all three algorithms dry spells are comparatively well reproduced by all three algorithms wet spells are better reproduced with s mof compared to mof and mof while the interpolation has generally less impact on the simulation results with mof and mof it produces higher biases with s mof missing data do not significantly impact the simulation results with s mof dry spells are better reproduced with s mof when applying the simplistic interpolation routine the opposite applies to wet spells where the advanced interpolation routine leads to better results with mof and mof the advanced interpolation routine reduces the bias for both dry and wet spells unlike in italy s mof performs worse in simulating the autocorrelation of precipitation compared to mof and mof this can be explained by the increased heterogeneity of the climate and higher gauge distances i e s mof does not find enough candidate vectors that are essentially similar to the vector of the day of disaggregation in italy s mof performed better than the univariate algorithms the advanced interpolation outperforms the simplistic interpolation with all three algorithms as in the case of italy the univariate algorithms have reduced skills in reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation in sweden the issue seems to be less pronounced though this can be explained by the significantly higher distances between sites i e lower inter site correlations the deviations between the observations and the simulations are more pronounced for mof and mof better noticeable with scatter plots fig s2 in the supplementary material fig 4 shows the absolute error for the inter site correlation between all possible pairs of sites and their distances as can be seen with mof the error is higher for closer sites i e the higher the correlation between station pairs the higher the error s mof does not show this characteristic and produces an equally low bias across all station pair distances the effect is much more pronounced in italy than in sweden due to the high inter site correlations in sweden s mof also produces a slightly higher bias for closer sites to better understand the performance in the simulation of dry and wet spells we also plotted their observed and simulated density fig 5 shows the results for italy and all three algorithms full network up to a spell duration of 24 h the patterns for all algorithms are similar longer wet spells tend to be underestimated while longer dry spells tend to be overestimated important to notice is the similar performance of s mof compared to mof and mof its ability to simulate consistent space time precipitation fields does not noticeably impact the simulation of the length of dry and wet spells the results are slightly different for sweden fig 6 the most pronounced difference is the reduced skill of s mof to simulate longer wet spells however as in the case of italy all algorithms tend to underestimate longer wet spells while shorter wet and dry spells are generally well reproduced by all algorithms longer dry spells are overestimated except for s mof which tends to slightly underestimate dry spells above a length of 20 h interestingly the performance of s mof in regard to simulating the length of wet and dry spells appears to be of very good quality when comparing it to the skills of different univariate disaggregation schemes across australia as presented in pui et al 2012 fig 15 and fig 16 in pui et al 2012 where most algorithms show higher biases in particular for wet spells in pui et al 2012 the univariate algorithm leading to the least bias is mof tables 2 and 3 give a summary of other important dry and wet spell characteristics in italy and sweden in italy table 2 the performance of the three algorithms is comparable with similar biases for the different metrics the most remarkable difference is the higher bias of s mof regarding the skewness of dry and wet spells the same applies to sweden table 3 where the differences in reproducing the skewness of dry and wet spells are even more pronounced a larger bias for the standard deviation of dry and wet spell durations can also be detected the numbers for sweden and s mof as provided in table 3 are comparable with the results in müller and haberlandt 2015 who used a different model for simulating high resolution space time precipitation fields see section 1 of this article and müller and haberlandt 2015 for details but at considerably smaller spatial scale maximum site distance of about 200 km seasonal results for the precipitation simulations can be obtained from the supplementary material figs s3 and s4 4 2 temperature the different algorithms and experiments have a less pronounced impact on the simulated temperature fields fig 7 provides an overview of the performance of the three algorithms and all experiments for the separate disaggregation of temperature in italy for the extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelations the results of s mof mof and mof are comparable bias is being introduced by the interpolation routines but the maes are low as in the case of precipitation fig 2 the bias of the interpolation routines is generally lower with the univariate algorithms mof and mof compared to s mof even though the differences are less pronounced compared to the precipitation simulations while the advanced interpolation routine does not significantly improve the results with s mof it performs better with mof and mof the autocorrelation of the temperature is comparatively well reproduced with all three algorithms the bias introduced from missing data and interpolations is almost negligible considering the very low values of the mae as in the case of the precipitation the inter site correlations are underestimated with the two univariate algorithms but to a much lower degree than for precipitation the results are very similar for sweden fig 8 important to notice are the almost similar patterns compared to italy of the mae across the experiments and algorithms for the extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelation the mae is higher for the extremes and the standard deviation in sweden with s mof which can be explained by its larger spatial extent also important to notice is the higher bias when using the advanced interpolation the simple interpolation routine appears to perform better for the autocorrelation and the inter site correlations while the inter site correlations are generally better reproduced with s mof compared to mof and mof the differences are less pronounced in sweden as in the case of precipitation this can be explained with the lower inter site correlations due to the higher spatial distances between sites in general the maes for the temperature are small across all algorithms and experiments table 4 provides an overview of all results mape for s mof mof and mof full network simulated both meteorological variables and study areas split into non spatial and spatial metrics 4 3 separate and joint disaggregation in comparison as explained in the section 3 2 we conducted all experiments twice one time with a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 8 11 and another time jointly i e the same day from the observations was used for the disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 12 and 13 our hypothesis was that a joint disaggregation may lead to a better reproduction of the dry and wet temperatures with s mof fig 9 shows the results mae split into dry and wet temperatures for both study areas what first becomes obvious is that the joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature is not able to significantly improve the dry and wet temperatures the maes are comparable for both approaches in both study areas in general the mae is lower for the dry temperature compared to the wet temperature due to the higher number of dry hours in the observations when simulating the full observation networks in italy a joint disaggregation leads to marginally better results for the dry and wet temperature interpolation routines introduce additional bias the highest bias of simulating dry temperatures is caused by missing values in sweden in contradiction to our aforementioned hypothesis a separate disaggregation even leads to a better reproduction of the dry and wet temperature across algorithms and experiments most importantly the joint disaggregation has a significant impact on the performance of the precipitation and temperature specific statistics already shown in figs 2 3 7 and 8 a noticeable decrease in the performance when conducting a joint disaggregation in italy can be depicted from fig 10 precipitation and fig s5 in the supplementary material temperature which show the mae from both disaggregation strategies in italy for the precipitation fig 10 almost all metrics suffer from a joint disaggregation for the temperature in italy a joint disaggregation likewise decreases the performance a marginal improvement can be detected for the univariate algorithms mof and mof and the inter site correlations for sweden the differences are less pronounced for s mof and precipitation fig s6 in the supplementary material the univariate algorithms mof and mof however lead to significantly higher biases for extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelation of precipitation in a joint disaggregation the differences for the temperature are less pronounced except for the simple interpolation routine with mof and mof where the bias is significantly higher compared to the advanced interpolation routine fig s7 in the supplementary material the negative impact of the joint disaggregation also becomes noticeable when examining nonexceedance curves of hourly precipitation figs 11 and 12 show the non exceedance curves of hourly precipitation for the separate fig 11 and joint fig 12 disaggregation of precipitation for five selected sites across the italian study area see fig 1 for the selected five sites as can be depicted from fig 11 all three algorithms reproduce the nonexceedance probabilities well a slight overestimation of extremes can be identified for all algorithms all three algorithms produce values below the gauge station measuring accuracy a well known characteristic of disaggregation models the joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature introduces a higher bias in the nonexceedance curves fig 12 while the increased bias for s mof is not particularly pronounced but still recognizable e g site 4 and site 5 upper 5 the deviations are generally more pronounced for the univariate algorithms mof and mof the results are similar for the sweden figs s8 and s9 in the supplementary material the general tendency of a decrease in performance across the algorithms and study areas when applying the joint disaggregation scheme appears to be reasonable the joint algorithm considers both the distances to the precipitation and temperature candidates eqs 12 and 13 i e the algorithm considers the smallest common denominator for both precipitation and temperature however we also examined the inter variable correlation between precipitation and temperature which on average is 0 11 in italy and 0 21 in sweden pearson correlation when using the separate disaggregation in italy the inter variable correlation was underestimated by 42 6 s mof full station network which reduced to a 24 9 underestimation with the joint approach in sweden differences were less pronounced underestimation in separate simulation 25 4 in joint simulation 24 1 however given the overall decrease in performance and the fact that the dry and wet temperatures are not significantly better reproduced a joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature is not recommended and our original hypothesis of improved simulations of dry and wet temperatures using the same day has to be rejected 5 discussion and conclusions for precipitation s mof generally leads to better results at smaller spatial scale italy compared to very large spatial scales sweden at small spatial scale s mof even outperforms the univariate mof and mof algorithms with the exception of simulating dry spells and a higher bias of the skewness of the dry and wet spell durations s mof performs generally well at small scale as the candidate vectors in the resampling algorithm tend to be similar homogenous climate at small scale with larger spatial scales the climate and precipitation becomes more heterogeneous in space and time i e the daily and hourly snapshots of precipitation have a higher spatial variability leading to higher model biases the univariate algorithms fail at reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation this shortcoming is more pronounced when facing high inter site correlations such as in smaller and more densely gauged study areas as reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation with s mof at very large spatial scales comes along with reduced skills in simulating other precipitation characteristics e g standard deviation and autocorrelation univariate models across such large domains appear to be a good alternative interpolation with the proposed advanced interpolation routine leads to better results for most metrics in future research it may be worth investigating the impact of more sophisticated interpolation routines such as ked for temperature simulations with s mof are generally more robust producing less bias than for precipitation which can be explained by the continuous non intermittent nature of temperature interpolation routines applied to the temperature have less impact on the simulation results and the simplistic interpolation routine leads to good results from a practical point of view different biases produced by s mof have different implications for applications in impact studies at small scale the slight overestimation of precipitation extremes appears to be negligible also for simulating extreme events such as flash floods at larger scale the overestimation of extremes increases here while the simulation of large scale river floods and water balance simulations may be less affected the simulation of flash floods in small catchments may become more problematic s mof may thus be applied at smaller scale when such small scale extreme events are in focus in that context sensitivity studies only using a subset of sites for the disaggregation not shown here revealed a less pronounced bias in simulating extremes the bias in simulating dry and wet spells appears to be acceptable with all algorithms also when applying interpolation however it should be tested what the implications are by applying s mof and univariate alternatives in coupled rainfall runoff frameworks a high bias in the space time simulation of the water balance and spatial extreme events can be expected at small scale when using univariate precipitation models instead of s mof this has for example been demonstrated by müller and haberlandt 2018 who compared univariate and multivariate disaggregation approaches and observed unrealistic flood volumes when ignoring spatial consistency regardless of the different metrics and their implications one must also be aware that the simulated time series will eventually be interpolated for distributed impact modeling which is another source of uncertainty that may increase or decrease the bias from the disaggregation algorithms the bias from the temperature simulations seems to be less problematic however missing data and interpolation routines introduce higher biases also here it is difficult to speculate and sensitivity studies using an exemplary catchment will help for example by using sub daily precipitation and temperature generated at large with higher bias and small scale lower bias to understand the impact of both input datasets it would be interesting for further research to test s mof with different sub daily temporal resolutions e g 3 or 6 h an important finding of the study is that precipitation and temperature should be disaggregated separately a joint disaggregation of both variables does not lead to a significantly better reproduction of dry and wet temperatures and introduces a significantly higher bias in both the precipitation and temperature simulations furthermore mof appears to be an interesting alternative to mof and leads to a reduced bias compared to mof for various statistics the proposed method has some limitations i the parameters of s mof are derived from observations and it is assumed that these parameters remain valid in the future as for the vast majority of disaggregation algorithms pui et al 2012 the assumption of stationarity has been widely discussed in the literature e g luke et al 2017 milly et al 2008 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 argue that any system is characterized by variability that cannot be explained and that physically based stochastic models assuming stationarity remain robust and useful tools for hydrological risk assessment serinaldi and kilsby 2015 state that scientists should be careful when using nonstationary approaches due to the increased complexity and uncertainty and that non stationary approaches are not suitable for the often short observation time series luke et al 2017 show that stationary methods are more robust than non stationary ones unless there is clear information about major physical changes in the river basin as the length of available sub daily observation time series is short in many places around the world the assumption of stationarity appears to be reasonable but should be tested whenever possible in that context further research could look into ways of modifying and applying s mof for future climate projections one of the key challenges behind such an attempt is that the projected increase of hourly precipitation extremes may exceed the expectations from changes in the temperature clausius clapeyron relation lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 this behavior should be taken into account as the future climate will be warmer fragments equating to extreme daily precipitation will be different than in the current climate which is for example related to changing storm dynamics in warming temperatures wasko and sharma 2015 using an averaged temperature anomaly as an additional covariate in selecting the day for resampling may be an avenue to make the model more robust for disaggregating climate projections ii as addressed in section 2 1 s mof mof and other block bootstrap methods have the inherent limitation of discontinuities between blocks as a general feature while considering the day before and after in finding neighbours reduces the risk of generating pronounced artefacts another strategy to cope with the issue could be implementing additional constraints for selecting a suitable day for disaggregation to ensure smoother transitions between blocks such efforts would however increase the number of parameters while facing comparatively short time series thus potentially reducing the prediction power of the model iii the application of s mof is limited to regions where continuous sub daily observations are available in the case of our experiments simultaneous records at all sites were available the algorithm could be modified so that single missing records in the hourly observations vectors are complemented using an interpolation routine however this step can also be considered to be part of the data preparation before applying s mof iv we tested s mof in different precipitation rich climates across different spatial scales disaggregating precipitation with s mof in arid climates may lead to issues as the candidate vectors may become highly diverse i e the algorithm may not find a sufficient number of candidates for the disaggregation however in arid climates correlations between sites may generally be low so that spatial methods are not needed in summary the proposed open source s mof disaggregation algorithm is a straightforward and robust method for generating sub daily precipitation and temperature fields that are consistent in space and time s mof complements the available spatial disaggregation techniques currently available and has potential for various applications in engineering and water resources research declarations of

8462,study region this study focuses on two study areas the province of trento italy 6200 km² and entire sweden 447000km² the province of trento is a complex mountainous area including subarctic humid continental and tundra climates sweden instead is mainly dominated by a subarctic climate in the north and an oceanic climate in the south study focus hydrological predictions often require long weather time series of high temporal resolution daily observations typically exceed the length of sub daily observations and daily gauges are more widely available than sub daily gauges the issue can be overcome by disaggregating daily into sub daily values we present an open source tool for the non parametric space time disaggregation of daily precipitation and temperature into hourly values called spatial method of fragments s mof a large number of comparative experiments was conducted for both s mof and mof in the two study regions new hydrological insights for the region our experiments demonstrate the applicability of the univariate and spatial method of fragments in the two temperate subarctic study regions where snow processes are important s mof is able to produce consistent precipitation and temperature fields at sub daily resolution with acceptable method related bias for precipitation although climatologically more complex s mof generally leads to better results in the province of trento than in sweden mainly due to the smaller spatial extent of the former region keywords precipitation temperature disaggregation space time scaling non parametric method of fragments 1 introduction for hydrological predictions the available records of precipitation and temperature are usually longest at daily resolution and daily gauges are more widely available than sub daily gauges pui et al 2012 reynolds et al 2017 sub daily records are often short even in high income countries di baldassarre et al 2006 in hydrology characteristic space and time scales exist blöschl and sivapalan 1995 skoien et al 2003 in small catchments for example daily resolution often does not match the temporal scale of hydrological processes blöschl and sivapalan 1995 reynolds et al 2017 a high temporal resolution of precipitation is particularly desirable when modelling flash floods or local erosion lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 sikorska and seibert 2018 for example the rapid response parameters of conceptual hydrological models largely depend on the temporal resolution of the precipitation input and calibrating to sub daily resolution can lead to better predictions wang et al 2009 the spatial characteristics of precipitation fields are likewise relevant arnaud et al 2002 evin et al 2018 zhang and han 2017 for example in trans regional flood risk and water management leander et al 2005 when modelling sewer systems in urban areas müller and haberlandt 2018 or for simulating the superposition of flood waves at the confluence of rivers hoch et al 2017 a comprehensive literature review of the importance of spatial variability of precipitation in rainfall runoff processes can be found in tetzlaff and uhlenbrook 2005 the temporal resolution of temperature is crucial for snow and ice dominated regions sub daily temporal resolution is required for modelling melt induced diurnal discharge variations hock 2003 simoni et al 2011 also various process oriented plant and soil models require sub daily temperature forcing debele et al 2007 hourly resolution allows for evaluating processes such as leaf level photosynthesis canopy assimilation and transpiration boote et al 2013 simulating yields of the major annual food crops requires at the minimum hourly temperature porter and semenov 2005 unlike in the case of precipitation the role of consistent high resolution temperature fields i e the spatial signal has received less attention in the literature a possible explanation may be the high spatial correlation of temperature through its continuous non intermittent nature while different authors have proposed sophisticated distributed energy balance models of high temporal resolution e g lehning et al 2006 rigon et al 2006 warscher et al 2013 they are less commonly used due to the need of spatially distributed hydrometeorological forcing data mutzner et al 2015 to i overcome the aforementioned issue of less available sub daily observations and ii still provide high resolution forcing data for distributed process oriented modelling daily meteorological records can be disaggregated into finer time steps the daily records for the disaggregation can be observed or synthetic for instance from space time stochastic weather models e g apipattanavis et al 2007 bardossy and plate 1992 breinl et al 2017a 2015 2013 buishand and brandsma 2001 clark et al 2004 evin et al 2018 such daily space time weather generators can also be trained with climate model outputs to simulate future climates wilks 1999 numerous models have been proposed for the univariate disaggregation from daily to finer sub daily values at single sites primarily for precipitation examples include bartlett lewis neyman scott rectangular pulse algorithms khaliq and cunnane 1996 rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 random cascade algorithms carsteanu and foufoula georgiou 1996 gupta and waymire 1993 molnar and burlando 2005 the randomized bartlett lewis model koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 or the more recent non parametric method of fragments mof mehrotra et al 2012 sharma and srikanthan 2006 westra et al 2012 pui et al 2012 provide a comprehensive overview of different univariate precipitation disaggregation techniques conversion from daily into sub daily temperature is typically achieved by sinusoidal approaches when the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are available johnson and fitzpatrick 1977 parton and logan 1981 independent univariate disaggregation of weather time series at each observation site leads to unrealistic weather fields lacking spatial consistence koutsoyiannis et al 2003 müller and haberlandt 2015 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 proposed a parametric space time approach where several univariate autoregressive and multivariate precipitation models are implemented at different time scales müller and haberlandt 2015 applied a modified microcanonical disaggregation model for precipitation based on lisniak et al 2013 first müller and haberlandt 2015 disaggregated the precipitation independently at each site second they used simulated annealing to transform the disaggregated and inconsistent precipitation fields into spatial consistency bardossy and pegram 2016 proposed a space time method for disaggregating daily precipitation to hourly intensities using a gaussian copula based model increased attention has been recently dedicated to space time approaches based on the idea of the univariate non parametric method of fragments mof mehrotra et al 2012 sharma and srikanthan 2006 westra et al 2012 the fundamental idea of mof is disaggregate the day of interest using a similar candidate day similarity can be derived in different ways e g similar season precipitation amount etc and impose the relative distribution i e fragments of the candidate day on the day of interest mezghani and hingray 2009 applied a space time version of mof for disaggregating climate projections where potential candidates are selected from a temporal window a method later on used in a similar way by lu and qin 2014 the best fragments are selected among these potential candidates using the mahalanobis distance the highest probability is assigned to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using the method presented in lall and sharma 1996 li et al 2018 presented a space time approach based on mof called mul using daily regional precipitation means clustered into different intensity classes for identifying suitable candidates for the disaggregation although not developed for hourly disaggregation evin et al 2018 presented a similar method for disaggregating spatial precipitation fields from a 3 day temporal resolution to a daily resolution candidate fragments are selected based on the season class of intensity and using a score of similarity computed across the precipitation fields in this paper we propose a robust non parametric method for the space time disaggregation of precipitation and temperature the method is another spatial interpretation of the non parametric method of fragments mof hereafter called s mof we applied s mof in two diverse study areas in terms of climates and spatial scales which were the province of trento italy area 6200 km² and entire sweden area 447000km² moreover we examine the performance of a joint i e multivariate and separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature and demonstrate the impact of imbalances in available daily and sub daily gauges using different interpolation techniques in both study areas s mof is able to reproduce spatially consistent precipitation and temperature fields with acceptable method related bias non parametric approaches have a long tradition in hydrology and have not only been applied in the temporal disaggregation of weather time series but also real time flood forecasting brath et al 2002 generation of stream flow time series lall and sharma 1996 markovic et al 2015 or stochastic weather generation brandsma and buishand 1998 wojcik and buishand 2003 such methods are usually characterized by a low level of complexity non parametric approaches do not require data transformations or assumptions regarding the dependence structure of the data borgomeo et al 2015 however as they are fully data driven they can be sensitive to outliers villarini et al 2008 non parametric methods also rely on a representative data sample despite their differences non parametric and parametric approaches share the same general problem a too strong stratification compared to a limited sample size may lead to a perfect fit with limited prediction power whereas a weaker stratification i e fewer parameters implies a decrease of fitting performance but improved prediction skills the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the proposed space time disaggregation algorithm section 3 presents the design of real data experiments in the two study areas section 4 provides the related results and section 5 provides a discussion and conclusions with recommendations for application 2 disaggregation algorithm for the sake of clarity we first introduce the basic concept of mof at single sites for precipitation step by step and then describe our spatial interpretation including the disaggregation of temperature s mof 2 1 disaggregation of precipitation at single sites using mof the method of fragments mof is a non parametric disaggregation technique the idea is to resample a vector of fragments that represents the relative distribution of sub daily to daily precipitation pui et al 2012 the number of fragments corresponds to the sub daily temporal resolution used i e if the disaggregation is conducted from daily to hourly values the relative distribution of sub daily values consists of 24 relative weights that sum up to 1 in the simulation variability is introduced by a k nearest neighbor algorithm the procedure can be summarized as follows i obtain the daily precipitation value r t to disaggregate where t represents the date of the day r t may be the aggregated sum of the observed hourly time series or taken from another source such as observed daily records or from a stochastic daily weather generator use the observational hourly records x i m to build daily time series r i where m is the hourly time step and i denotes the day eq 1 1 r i 1 24 x i m form a time series with hourly to daily ratios eq 2 2 f i m x i m r i ii build a window with l days around the day t of the daily precipitation records for example if t represents the 1 st of january and l 14 all days between the 18th of december and the 15th of january from all available years are considered for disaggregation to avoid the recreation of the observations the current year is discarded if the aggregated observed hourly records are used as the daily value r t iii to account for the continuity of rainstorms such as more persistent frontal rainstorms only take into account days from step ii that correspond to the same class of wet dry days of the neighboring days according to the following four classes eq 3 3 class 1 dry wet dry r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 2 wet wet dry r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 3 dry wet wet r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 class 4 wet wet wet r j 0 r j 1 0 r j 1 0 where j denotes a day within the moving window around the specific date t for disaggregation iv identify the class c t c t c l a s s 1 4 to which r t belongs v identify the number of nearest neighbors k n where n denotes the sample size of all days falling within the moving window and meeting the class criterion build a vector r j from the absolute differences for all neighbors using r j r t for all j 1 2 k and assign the highest probability p j to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using eq 4 lall and sharma 1996 4 p j 1 j i 1 k 1 i sample from eq 4 inverse cumulative distribution function using a uniformly distributed random number 0 1 use the date of the sampled day and find the corresponding hourly ratios from f i m and form the new disaggregated time series r t for day t using eq 5 5 r t r t f i m vi repeat step ii to step v for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated an inherent property of mof and other block bootstrap algorithms is that the temporal correlation of the precipitation is maintained within the disaggregated vectors of 24 h and discontinuities occur between blocks improvements to address this issue have been discussed sharma and srikanthan 2006 but are not further discussed here 2 2 transferring mof into space for precipitation and temperature the proposed non parametric s mof model works as follows i obtain the daily precipitation vector r t s to disaggregate where t represents the date of the day and s individual sites of the observation network as in the case of the univariate mof r t s can come from the observed multi site hourly records used for the disaggregation or from another source such as daily weather generators use the observational hourly records x i m s to build daily time vectors r i s where i denotes the day m is the hourly time step and s is a site of the observation network eq 6 6 r i s 1 s 24 x i m s form a time series of vectors with hourly to daily ratios eq 7 7 f i m s x i m s r i s ii build a window with l days around the day t of the daily precipitation records for example if t represents the 1 st of january and l 14 all days between the 18th of december and the 15th of january from all available years are considered for disaggregation to avoid the recreation of the observations the current year is discarded if the observations are used as the daily vector r t s iii instead of using binary precipitation information populate the matrix a p with actual precipitation amounts a p eq 8 the precipitation amounts are standardized beforehand with a square root standardization which is preferable for positively skewed variables such as precipitation stephenson et al 1999 the standardization led to an improved reproduction of dry and wet spells in our experiments a standardization of the temperature did not lead to an improved performance and was thus not considered 8 a p r t 1 s 1 r t 1 s 2 r t 1 s n r t s 1 r t s 2 r t s n r t 1 s 1 r t 1 s 2 r t 1 s n r t 1 s n 0 r t s n 0 r t 1 s n 0 compare matrix a p to the values for disaggregation by building matrices b p for all days j within the moving window around the specific date eq 9 t accordingly also here the square root standardization must be applied 9 b p r j 1 s 1 r j 1 s 2 r j 1 s n r j s 1 r j s 2 r j s n r j 1 s 1 r j 1 s 2 r j 1 s n r j 1 s n 0 r j s n 0 r j 1 s n 0 a separate i e independent of the precipitation disaggregation for the temperature is conducted accordingly with the matrices a t and b t populated with the temperature observations eqs 10 and 11 10 a t t t 1 s 1 t t 1 s 2 t t 1 s n t t s 1 t t s 2 t t s n t t 1 s 1 t t 1 s 2 t t 1 s n

and temperature was also tested that is the matrices a p and a t as well as b p and b t were joined into the matrices a m and b m eqs 12 and 13 containing both meteorological variables 12 13 if the entire day t is dry at all sites of the observation network a m and b m reduce to t t s n and t j s n the rationale behind the joint disaggregation was to examine whether using the precipitation and temperature from the same day for disaggregation would lead to a more consistent disaggregation of both variables thereby maintaining the dry and wet temperatures iv use a distance measure d to derive the similarities between a p a t and all instances of b p b t or in case of a joint disaggregation a w and b w we used the manhattan distance eq 14 which also turned out to work well with nearest neighbor algorithms for univariate precipitation disaggregation e g breinl et al 2017b 14 d a b i 1 j a b v identify the number of nearest neighbors k m where m denotes the number of days falling within the moving window the distances are sorted for all j 1 2 k and the highest probability p j is assigned to the neighbor with the lowest deviation using eq 4 vi sample a neighbor using a uniformly distributed random number 0 1 from the inverse cumulative distribution function from eq 4 the date of the sampled day is used and the corresponding hourly ratios are applied at each site in the disaggregation for the precipitation vectors the new hourly time series r i s are derived using eq 15 15 r i s r t s f i m s for the temperature the disaggregation method is different first a time series of the absolute deviations between the hourly values and their mean is generated eq 16 16 g i m s y i m s y i m s the new disaggregated temperature time series for day t is then derived with eq 17 using the daily mean temperature t t s 17 t i s t t s g i m s this adapted method for the temperature eqs 16 and 17 ensures that the hourly distribution of negative and positive values in cold seasons is maintained after the disaggregation and that the deviations between the input and disaggregated hourly values are kept constant over the 24 h which is important for the temperature autocorrelation vii repeat step ii to step vi for each day t until the entire daily records are disaggregated to reduce the impact of densely spaced sites of a network in particular for precipitation it can help to use thiessen weights which are then multiplied with the corresponding columns of the matrices a eqs 8 10 and 12 however thiessen weights did not noticeably improve the results in the two study areas presented 3 data experiments and validation 3 1 study area and data we applied s mof to two different study areas in the first study area we used hourly precipitation and temperature records from 48 gauges in the north of italy province of trento fig 1 covering a period of 15 years 1992 2006 the maximum distance between the sites is 104 km area about 6200 km² the complex mountainous area in italy comprises subarctic humid continental and tundra climates kottek et al 2006 the total annual precipitation varies between 760 mm and 1500 mm mean 1100 mm across all sites the percentage of wet days varies between 31 6 and 47 2 mean 37 2 the mean annual temperature ranges from 0 6 c to 8 5 c mean 5 3 c the second study area is the entire country of sweden area of approximately 447000km² fig 1 for sweden 22 years 1996 2017 of simultaneous hourly precipitation and temperature time series were available 65 gauges the maximum distance between sites is 1430 km accordingly the density of the gauge station network in italy is about 53 times higher sweden is mainly dominated by a subarctic climate in the north and an oceanic climate in the south kottek et al 2006 the total annual precipitation varies between 398 mm and 1000 mm mean 577 mm the percentage of wet days varies between 42 2 and 58 3 mean 50 6 the mean annual temperature ranges from 1 3 c to 8 8 c mean 4 6 c both study areas are characterized by temperate and continental climates and snow processes are important 3 2 types of experiments and related methods we conducted seven major types of experiments for s mof and three major experiments for mof as a benchmark table 1 in addition we applied s mof in a univariate setup i e separate disaggregation at each site hereinafter called mof table 1 we limited the number of experiments for the univariate algorithms mof and mof to keep the study concise in all experiments we conducted the disaggregation 50 times and compared observations with simulations to better understand the impact of missing data in the observation records we randomly removed 10 and 30 of the entire observation days in each of the 50 simulations m10 and m30 table 1 also as described in the introduction the number of available sub daily gauges may be lower than the number of daily gauges we thus tested the influence of a reduced gauge network by intentionally reducing the number of sub daily sites for the disaggregation using s mof to do so we applied an advanced interpolation routine using 70 50 and 30 of the hourly gauges int70 int50 int30 table 1 and a simplified interpolation routine using 50 of the hourly gauges int50s table 1 for mof and mof we only applied int50 and int50 s to keep the tests concise to mimic the complexity of real life data availability the network was randomly reduced to the required percentage in each of the 50 simulation runs in the advanced interpolation routine for precipitation we first built 24 hour hyetographs for the site without hourly information i e the removed site from the three hyetographs h n of three closest gauges with precipitation records the three neighbouring hyetographs were weighted according to the inverse of their distance w n to the site without hourly information eq 18 18 h d i s a g g w 1 h 1 w 2 h 2 w 3 h 3 where h 1 is the 24 hour hyetograph of the first of the three nearest sites with precipitation records w 1 is the inverse of the distance between the site of disaggregation and the first neighbouring site and so forth w 1 w 2 w 3 is scaled to 1 as the hyetographs h n may overlap in time e g time lag from moving weather systems there is the possibility of overestimating the number of wet hours at the site of disaggregation for this reason the final hyetograph was adapted by randomly cutting out a fraction of h d i s a g g with the weighted average length of each of the three neighbouring hyetographs the weights for the lengths were again derived from the three distances the starting hour of the fraction was randomly chosen within the total duration of h d i s a g g this procedure turned out to avoid the simulation of too many wet hours at the site of disaggregation the procedure was applied accordingly in the advanced temperature interpolation but without the step of cutting out a fraction as temperature is continuous and non intermittent in the simplistic interpolation procedure precipitation and temperature we assigned each of the removed site to the closest site of the reduced network i e our criterion of similarity was the spatial distance there are other ways of selecting a suitable neighbouring site such as using the crossing distance which penalizes the crossing of crests and valleys gottardi et al 2012 likewise other general interpolation routines such as kriging with external drift ked would be possible we focused on the following ten non spatial and spatial statistical metrics to evaluate the algorithm performance at each site in regard to hourly precipitation extremes 50th 75th and 99th percentiles standard deviation in mm skewness of the distribution of wet hours mean length of dry spells mean length of wet spells lag1 autocorrelation lag2 autocorrelation inter site correlation spatial metric inter site correlation lagged by one hour spatial metric continuity ratio spatial metric the continuity ratio c wilks 1998 is a tool for assessing the quality of simulated precipitation and is defined as eq 19 19 c e x i x i 0 x j 0 e x i x i 0 x j 0 the continuity ratio defines the ratio of the mean of the precipitation at site i depending on whether site j is wet or dry if the correlation between sites is high the continuity ratio will be relatively small and if the correlation is low it will be relatively large for hourly temperature we used the following six non spatial and spatial statistical metrics for the evaluation at each site extremes 50th 75th and 99th percentiles standard deviation in c lag1 autocorrelation lag2 autocorrelation inter site correlation spatial metric inter site correlation lagged by one hour spatial metric in all experiments the observed hourly values were first aggregated to daily values and then disaggregated using s mof mof and mof we applied the three algorithms with a window of l 30 i e 60 days as without day t and 8 neighbors k see 2 1 ii and v all experiments described above were conducted twice for both study areas one time with a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 8 11 and one time jointly i e the same day was used for the disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 12 and 13 as explained above the motivation for the joint disaggregation was our hypothesis that the joint procedure would result in an improved simulation of hourly dry and wet temperatures in the main paper we present the main results for a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature the reason is that the separate disaggregation scheme turned out in contradiction to our hypothesis to be preferable which we further demonstrate in section 4 3 where we compare results from the joint and separate disaggregation schemes we present results based on the entire annual time series seasonal results can be obtained from the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 precipitation fig 2 shows the results for the separate disaggregation of precipitation in italy the boxplots for the observations are built from all sites of the observation network the boxplots for the simulations are built from all sites and the mean of all 50 simulations the dashed red line indicates the median of the observations the boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles for the extremes all algorithms and all experiments lead to a slight overestimation s mof full network leads to a mean absolute error mae of 0 44 mean absolute percentage error mape 8 9 while mof and mof lead to a mae of 0 56 and 0 47 mape 9 5 and 8 6 the slightly higher overestimation of the mae with mof is related to the reduced number of potential neighbors in the disaggregation as the four binary classes eq 3 represent an additional constraint this constraint does not exist in s mof and mof an increasing number of missing values 10 and 30 in s mof increases the bias in simulating extremes the advanced interpolation outperforms the simplistic interpolation for all three algorithms the results are similar for the standard deviation of hourly precipitation and the skewness of wet hours while all algorithms and experiments lead to an overestimation of the observations s mof tends to produce less bias the improved performance of mof in comparison with mof can again be explained by the additional constraint of binary classes in mof for dry spells the univariate mof and mof algorithms lead to slightly better results in terms of the mae s mof 1 64 mof 1 37 mof 1 00 and mape s mof 4 6 mof 3 9 mof 2 8 this observation does not apply to wet spells where s mof performs better in terms of the mae s mof 0 16 mof 0 31 mof 0 27 and mape s mof 4 6 mof 9 0 mof 7 8 the interpolation has a more pronounced effect with s mof compared to mof and mof while the advanced interpolation leads to better results of reproducing dry spells in s mof int50 mae 1 20 int50s mae 2 76 the simplistic interpolation leads to equally good results in the simulation of wet spells int50 mae 0 21 int50s mae 0 22 in general the interpolation routines have a less pronounced impact on the simulation results with mof and mof compared to s mof all algorithms tend to underestimate the autocorrelation of precipitation however s mof and mof perform better than mof for the lag1 autocorrelation the mae of s mof mof and mof is 0 04 0 07 and 0 05 mape 6 8 11 9 and 8 9 the reason is that mof uses binary classes to simulate the continuity of rainstorms while s mof and mof use the actual precipitation amounts the advanced interpolation leads to better results when simulating the autocorrelation missing data increase the bias in s mof the key difference in the performance of s mof and the univariate algorithms becomes obvious when examining statistics related to the spatial characteristics of the precipitation fields namely the inter site correlations and the continuity ratio both univariate algorithms fail in reproducing the inter site correlations by a pronounced underestimation while the continuity ratio is clearly overestimated for the inter site correlation s mof leads to a mae of 0 02 mof 0 26 mof 0 25 and to a mape of 3 9 mof 57 2 mof 54 9 the differences are equally pronounced for the continuity ratio the lack of skills of the univariate algorithms becomes even more obvious when using scatter plots for the spatial metrics from fig 2 fig s1 in the supplementary material fig 3 shows the results for the separate disaggregation of precipitation for sweden for the extremes unlike in italy the univariate algorithms mof mae 0 14 mape 7 1 and mof mae 0 12 mape 6 6 perform better than s mof mae 0 32 mape 15 4 the same applies to the standard deviation of precipitation and the skewness the reason is that in the significantly larger study area of sweden the candidate vectors are characterized by a higher variability than in italy this is related to the higher heterogeneity of the climate while missing values have a similar negative effect on the statistics as in italy interpolation routines generally lead to a more pronounced bias with s mof compared to mof and mof in particular for the standard deviation the advanced interpolation routine produces less bias with all three algorithms dry spells are comparatively well reproduced by all three algorithms wet spells are better reproduced with s mof compared to mof and mof while the interpolation has generally less impact on the simulation results with mof and mof it produces higher biases with s mof missing data do not significantly impact the simulation results with s mof dry spells are better reproduced with s mof when applying the simplistic interpolation routine the opposite applies to wet spells where the advanced interpolation routine leads to better results with mof and mof the advanced interpolation routine reduces the bias for both dry and wet spells unlike in italy s mof performs worse in simulating the autocorrelation of precipitation compared to mof and mof this can be explained by the increased heterogeneity of the climate and higher gauge distances i e s mof does not find enough candidate vectors that are essentially similar to the vector of the day of disaggregation in italy s mof performed better than the univariate algorithms the advanced interpolation outperforms the simplistic interpolation with all three algorithms as in the case of italy the univariate algorithms have reduced skills in reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation in sweden the issue seems to be less pronounced though this can be explained by the significantly higher distances between sites i e lower inter site correlations the deviations between the observations and the simulations are more pronounced for mof and mof better noticeable with scatter plots fig s2 in the supplementary material fig 4 shows the absolute error for the inter site correlation between all possible pairs of sites and their distances as can be seen with mof the error is higher for closer sites i e the higher the correlation between station pairs the higher the error s mof does not show this characteristic and produces an equally low bias across all station pair distances the effect is much more pronounced in italy than in sweden due to the high inter site correlations in sweden s mof also produces a slightly higher bias for closer sites to better understand the performance in the simulation of dry and wet spells we also plotted their observed and simulated density fig 5 shows the results for italy and all three algorithms full network up to a spell duration of 24 h the patterns for all algorithms are similar longer wet spells tend to be underestimated while longer dry spells tend to be overestimated important to notice is the similar performance of s mof compared to mof and mof its ability to simulate consistent space time precipitation fields does not noticeably impact the simulation of the length of dry and wet spells the results are slightly different for sweden fig 6 the most pronounced difference is the reduced skill of s mof to simulate longer wet spells however as in the case of italy all algorithms tend to underestimate longer wet spells while shorter wet and dry spells are generally well reproduced by all algorithms longer dry spells are overestimated except for s mof which tends to slightly underestimate dry spells above a length of 20 h interestingly the performance of s mof in regard to simulating the length of wet and dry spells appears to be of very good quality when comparing it to the skills of different univariate disaggregation schemes across australia as presented in pui et al 2012 fig 15 and fig 16 in pui et al 2012 where most algorithms show higher biases in particular for wet spells in pui et al 2012 the univariate algorithm leading to the least bias is mof tables 2 and 3 give a summary of other important dry and wet spell characteristics in italy and sweden in italy table 2 the performance of the three algorithms is comparable with similar biases for the different metrics the most remarkable difference is the higher bias of s mof regarding the skewness of dry and wet spells the same applies to sweden table 3 where the differences in reproducing the skewness of dry and wet spells are even more pronounced a larger bias for the standard deviation of dry and wet spell durations can also be detected the numbers for sweden and s mof as provided in table 3 are comparable with the results in müller and haberlandt 2015 who used a different model for simulating high resolution space time precipitation fields see section 1 of this article and müller and haberlandt 2015 for details but at considerably smaller spatial scale maximum site distance of about 200 km seasonal results for the precipitation simulations can be obtained from the supplementary material figs s3 and s4 4 2 temperature the different algorithms and experiments have a less pronounced impact on the simulated temperature fields fig 7 provides an overview of the performance of the three algorithms and all experiments for the separate disaggregation of temperature in italy for the extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelations the results of s mof mof and mof are comparable bias is being introduced by the interpolation routines but the maes are low as in the case of precipitation fig 2 the bias of the interpolation routines is generally lower with the univariate algorithms mof and mof compared to s mof even though the differences are less pronounced compared to the precipitation simulations while the advanced interpolation routine does not significantly improve the results with s mof it performs better with mof and mof the autocorrelation of the temperature is comparatively well reproduced with all three algorithms the bias introduced from missing data and interpolations is almost negligible considering the very low values of the mae as in the case of the precipitation the inter site correlations are underestimated with the two univariate algorithms but to a much lower degree than for precipitation the results are very similar for sweden fig 8 important to notice are the almost similar patterns compared to italy of the mae across the experiments and algorithms for the extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelation the mae is higher for the extremes and the standard deviation in sweden with s mof which can be explained by its larger spatial extent also important to notice is the higher bias when using the advanced interpolation the simple interpolation routine appears to perform better for the autocorrelation and the inter site correlations while the inter site correlations are generally better reproduced with s mof compared to mof and mof the differences are less pronounced in sweden as in the case of precipitation this can be explained with the lower inter site correlations due to the higher spatial distances between sites in general the maes for the temperature are small across all algorithms and experiments table 4 provides an overview of all results mape for s mof mof and mof full network simulated both meteorological variables and study areas split into non spatial and spatial metrics 4 3 separate and joint disaggregation in comparison as explained in the section 3 2 we conducted all experiments twice one time with a separate disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 8 11 and another time jointly i e the same day from the observations was used for the disaggregation of precipitation and temperature eqs 12 and 13 our hypothesis was that a joint disaggregation may lead to a better reproduction of the dry and wet temperatures with s mof fig 9 shows the results mae split into dry and wet temperatures for both study areas what first becomes obvious is that the joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature is not able to significantly improve the dry and wet temperatures the maes are comparable for both approaches in both study areas in general the mae is lower for the dry temperature compared to the wet temperature due to the higher number of dry hours in the observations when simulating the full observation networks in italy a joint disaggregation leads to marginally better results for the dry and wet temperature interpolation routines introduce additional bias the highest bias of simulating dry temperatures is caused by missing values in sweden in contradiction to our aforementioned hypothesis a separate disaggregation even leads to a better reproduction of the dry and wet temperature across algorithms and experiments most importantly the joint disaggregation has a significant impact on the performance of the precipitation and temperature specific statistics already shown in figs 2 3 7 and 8 a noticeable decrease in the performance when conducting a joint disaggregation in italy can be depicted from fig 10 precipitation and fig s5 in the supplementary material temperature which show the mae from both disaggregation strategies in italy for the precipitation fig 10 almost all metrics suffer from a joint disaggregation for the temperature in italy a joint disaggregation likewise decreases the performance a marginal improvement can be detected for the univariate algorithms mof and mof and the inter site correlations for sweden the differences are less pronounced for s mof and precipitation fig s6 in the supplementary material the univariate algorithms mof and mof however lead to significantly higher biases for extremes the standard deviation and the autocorrelation of precipitation in a joint disaggregation the differences for the temperature are less pronounced except for the simple interpolation routine with mof and mof where the bias is significantly higher compared to the advanced interpolation routine fig s7 in the supplementary material the negative impact of the joint disaggregation also becomes noticeable when examining nonexceedance curves of hourly precipitation figs 11 and 12 show the non exceedance curves of hourly precipitation for the separate fig 11 and joint fig 12 disaggregation of precipitation for five selected sites across the italian study area see fig 1 for the selected five sites as can be depicted from fig 11 all three algorithms reproduce the nonexceedance probabilities well a slight overestimation of extremes can be identified for all algorithms all three algorithms produce values below the gauge station measuring accuracy a well known characteristic of disaggregation models the joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature introduces a higher bias in the nonexceedance curves fig 12 while the increased bias for s mof is not particularly pronounced but still recognizable e g site 4 and site 5 upper 5 the deviations are generally more pronounced for the univariate algorithms mof and mof the results are similar for the sweden figs s8 and s9 in the supplementary material the general tendency of a decrease in performance across the algorithms and study areas when applying the joint disaggregation scheme appears to be reasonable the joint algorithm considers both the distances to the precipitation and temperature candidates eqs 12 and 13 i e the algorithm considers the smallest common denominator for both precipitation and temperature however we also examined the inter variable correlation between precipitation and temperature which on average is 0 11 in italy and 0 21 in sweden pearson correlation when using the separate disaggregation in italy the inter variable correlation was underestimated by 42 6 s mof full station network which reduced to a 24 9 underestimation with the joint approach in sweden differences were less pronounced underestimation in separate simulation 25 4 in joint simulation 24 1 however given the overall decrease in performance and the fact that the dry and wet temperatures are not significantly better reproduced a joint disaggregation of precipitation and temperature is not recommended and our original hypothesis of improved simulations of dry and wet temperatures using the same day has to be rejected 5 discussion and conclusions for precipitation s mof generally leads to better results at smaller spatial scale italy compared to very large spatial scales sweden at small spatial scale s mof even outperforms the univariate mof and mof algorithms with the exception of simulating dry spells and a higher bias of the skewness of the dry and wet spell durations s mof performs generally well at small scale as the candidate vectors in the resampling algorithm tend to be similar homogenous climate at small scale with larger spatial scales the climate and precipitation becomes more heterogeneous in space and time i e the daily and hourly snapshots of precipitation have a higher spatial variability leading to higher model biases the univariate algorithms fail at reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation this shortcoming is more pronounced when facing high inter site correlations such as in smaller and more densely gauged study areas as reproducing the spatial characteristics of the precipitation with s mof at very large spatial scales comes along with reduced skills in simulating other precipitation characteristics e g standard deviation and autocorrelation univariate models across such large domains appear to be a good alternative interpolation with the proposed advanced interpolation routine leads to better results for most metrics in future research it may be worth investigating the impact of more sophisticated interpolation routines such as ked for temperature simulations with s mof are generally more robust producing less bias than for precipitation which can be explained by the continuous non intermittent nature of temperature interpolation routines applied to the temperature have less impact on the simulation results and the simplistic interpolation routine leads to good results from a practical point of view different biases produced by s mof have different implications for applications in impact studies at small scale the slight overestimation of precipitation extremes appears to be negligible also for simulating extreme events such as flash floods at larger scale the overestimation of extremes increases here while the simulation of large scale river floods and water balance simulations may be less affected the simulation of flash floods in small catchments may become more problematic s mof may thus be applied at smaller scale when such small scale extreme events are in focus in that context sensitivity studies only using a subset of sites for the disaggregation not shown here revealed a less pronounced bias in simulating extremes the bias in simulating dry and wet spells appears to be acceptable with all algorithms also when applying interpolation however it should be tested what the implications are by applying s mof and univariate alternatives in coupled rainfall runoff frameworks a high bias in the space time simulation of the water balance and spatial extreme events can be expected at small scale when using univariate precipitation models instead of s mof this has for example been demonstrated by müller and haberlandt 2018 who compared univariate and multivariate disaggregation approaches and observed unrealistic flood volumes when ignoring spatial consistency regardless of the different metrics and their implications one must also be aware that the simulated time series will eventually be interpolated for distributed impact modeling which is another source of uncertainty that may increase or decrease the bias from the disaggregation algorithms the bias from the temperature simulations seems to be less problematic however missing data and interpolation routines introduce higher biases also here it is difficult to speculate and sensitivity studies using an exemplary catchment will help for example by using sub daily precipitation and temperature generated at large with higher bias and small scale lower bias to understand the impact of both input datasets it would be interesting for further research to test s mof with different sub daily temporal resolutions e g 3 or 6 h an important finding of the study is that precipitation and temperature should be disaggregated separately a joint disaggregation of both variables does not lead to a significantly better reproduction of dry and wet temperatures and introduces a significantly higher bias in both the precipitation and temperature simulations furthermore mof appears to be an interesting alternative to mof and leads to a reduced bias compared to mof for various statistics the proposed method has some limitations i the parameters of s mof are derived from observations and it is assumed that these parameters remain valid in the future as for the vast majority of disaggregation algorithms pui et al 2012 the assumption of stationarity has been widely discussed in the literature e g luke et al 2017 milly et al 2008 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 argue that any system is characterized by variability that cannot be explained and that physically based stochastic models assuming stationarity remain robust and useful tools for hydrological risk assessment serinaldi and kilsby 2015 state that scientists should be careful when using nonstationary approaches due to the increased complexity and uncertainty and that non stationary approaches are not suitable for the often short observation time series luke et al 2017 show that stationary methods are more robust than non stationary ones unless there is clear information about major physical changes in the river basin as the length of available sub daily observation time series is short in many places around the world the assumption of stationarity appears to be reasonable but should be tested whenever possible in that context further research could look into ways of modifying and applying s mof for future climate projections one of the key challenges behind such an attempt is that the projected increase of hourly precipitation extremes may exceed the expectations from changes in the temperature clausius clapeyron relation lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 this behavior should be taken into account as the future climate will be warmer fragments equating to extreme daily precipitation will be different than in the current climate which is for example related to changing storm dynamics in warming temperatures wasko and sharma 2015 using an averaged temperature anomaly as an additional covariate in selecting the day for resampling may be an avenue to make the model more robust for disaggregating climate projections ii as addressed in section 2 1 s mof mof and other block bootstrap methods have the inherent limitation of discontinuities between blocks as a general feature while considering the day before and after in finding neighbours reduces the risk of generating pronounced artefacts another strategy to cope with the issue could be implementing additional constraints for selecting a suitable day for disaggregation to ensure smoother transitions between blocks such efforts would however increase the number of parameters while facing comparatively short time series thus potentially reducing the prediction power of the model iii the application of s mof is limited to regions where continuous sub daily observations are available in the case of our experiments simultaneous records at all sites were available the algorithm could be modified so that single missing records in the hourly observations vectors are complemented using an interpolation routine however this step can also be considered to be part of the data preparation before applying s mof iv we tested s mof in different precipitation rich climates across different spatial scales disaggregating precipitation with s mof in arid climates may lead to issues as the candidate vectors may become highly diverse i e the algorithm may not find a sufficient number of candidates for the disaggregation however in arid climates correlations between sites may generally be low so that spatial methods are not needed in summary the proposed open source s mof disaggregation algorithm is a straightforward and robust method for generating sub daily precipitation and temperature fields that are consistent in space and time s mof complements the available spatial disaggregation techniques currently available and has potential for various applications in engineering and water resources research declarations of

8463,study region the new york city water supply watersheds study focus this study is a modeling analysis on climate change impact on streamflow using a stochastic weather generator swg a hydrologic model and downscaled future climate scenarios streamflow generated using synthetic time series of precipitation and air temperature from a swg were compared to those simulated from observed historical and projected future weather new hydrologic insights for the region synthetic weather was able to mimic the observed annual streamflow cycle for the six watersheds studied including the seasonal pattern as well as magnitude and occurrence of extreme hydrologic events streamflow simulations using projected climate from 20 global climate models gcm for one of the new york city water supply watersheds indicate the potential for changes in the hydrologic regime in this region the models indicate a shift in the timing of spring melt runoff from a distinct peak in late march and april under historical 1950 2009 conditions towards earlier in the year for mid century 2041 2060 period results indicate that the region may experience an overall increase in mean streamflow in the future due to the combined effect of decreasing spring runoff peak and increasing streamflow during other seasons more importantly the magnitude and frequency of extreme hydrological events are projected to increase under future scenarios these results have implications for future operation and management of the water supply keywords climate change extreme events nyc water supply scenarios water resources 1 introduction the new york city nyc water supply serving over 9 million consumers is currently the largest unfiltered drinking water supply in the united states historically about 90 of this water is delivered from six catskill delaware system of west of hudson woh reservoirs fig 1 matonse and frei 2013 reported increasing trends in total precipitation and in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events in woh watersheds through the year 2012 although conditions since that time have been more similar to mean 20th century values frei and kelly voicu 2017 the northeastern us in general experienced an increase in extreme storms and floods primarily during the warm season in the early 2000s frei et al 2015 and the increase was greater than any other region in the united states horton et al 2014 these trends pose challenges for managing water quality such as increased sediment and nutrient loading and maintaining optimal water quantity to meet consumer demand reservoir storage flood mitigation ecological and other needs large streamflow events are often responsible for water resources problems including a disproportionate transport of nutrients and sediments into receiving water bodies mukundan et al 2013 yoon and raymond 2012 a leading drinking water quality issue involves the impact of extreme events on the concentration of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors raseman et al 2017 for example the level of total trihalomethanes a class of dbp increased above the current maximum allowable contaminant level at some nyc distribution locations during october and november of 2011 in the aftermath of hurricane irene and tropical storm lee although the levels were never out of compliance with regulations in place at that time mukundan and van dreason 2014 other potential challenges to water utilities associated with extreme events include turbidity algal toxins and pathogens changes in source water quality could potentially affect management for compliance with drinking water regulations the primary approach to study climate impacts on water resources has been through the use of global climate model gcm projections of future climate brown et al 2012 the raw gcm projections at a coarser scale several 100 km have biases that are corrected prior to local watershed scale application and impact assessments anandhi et al 2011 the downscaled and bias corrected climate variables are then used as input to a hydrologic model the output of which is used in a water supply system model for climate impact studies matonse et al 2013 this method is called the top down approach which relies on the gcms and downscaling methods used for information on potential impacts of climate change teng et al 2012 reported that the greatest source of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling of climate change comes from gcms another approach used in climate impact modeling is spatial disaggregation of gcms using regional climate models rcms that operates at a finer resolution of about 50 km or lower buytaert et al 2010 however rcms are computationally intensive and complex to implement for a suite of gcms affected by bias of driving gcm and therefore not widely used the new york city department of environmental protection dep is exploring the potential effects of future climate change on the quantity and quality of water in the nyc water supply dep 2014 previous studies by dep matonse et al 2013 zion et al 2011 followed the mostly widely used top down approach with the goal of making an initial estimate of climate change impacts using downscaled gcm output and dep s suite of watershed reservoir and system operation models the main findings included a projected shift in the timing of spring snowmelt from a distinct peak in late march and april to a more consistent distribution between autumn and winter this projected shift was attributed to increased temperatures resulting in less precipitation falling as snow and faster melting of the snowpack zion et al 2011 in previous studies by dep scenarios were derived using a monthly change factor method cfm based simple downscaling of gcm results in which future climate scenarios are generated by either a multiplicative or additive factor applied to the observed meteorological time series anandhi et al 2011 the cfm has a number of disadvantages long term historical patterns of the timing of storm events the frequency and duration of storm events including extreme events inter storm periods and the relative frequencies of events of different magnitudes all remain unchanged since streamflow magnitude depends on antecedent conditions in the basin frei and kelly voicu 2017 the inability to simulate changes in the sequence of precipitation events is a major drawback of the cfm approach while a top down approach can provide general information about potential impacts from available gcm projections it is often insufficient for water managers and decision makers brown et al 2012 for example a top down approach does not incorporate uncertainty associated with the choice of gcm choice of emission scenario and variations in future climate variability to address these and other drawbacks of the cfm based top down approach dep is currently exploring bottom up or vulnerability based methods to explore climate impacts on water resources this approach uses scenarios beyond gcm projections such as stochastic methods to identify conditions under which a water supply system is vulnerable to climatological operational or infrastructural changes brown et al 2011 prudhomme et al 2015 2010 wilby and dessai 2010 brown et al 2012 describe the use of stochastic methods for hazard identification and the use of climate projections to estimate relative probabilities of these hazards for risk assessment in contrast to the top down approach the bottom up approach is expected to identify important scenarios that may not be found in gcm projections that provide only a limited set of future conditions the overall aim of this study is to present initial results of a climate change impact analysis of both mean and extreme hydrological conditions for the new york city water supply basins using a bottom up approach as part of this analysis we apply a stochastic weather generator swg model developed for this region acharya et al 2017 to force a hydrological model in order to simulate basin scale streamflow responses to synthetic weather time series in the woh watersheds hydrologic modeling using historical or future climate provides results that are typically based on only one or a few realizations of the past or future climate using a swg can provide multiple time series of climate that are equally likely to occur and therefore incorporate uncertainty due to climate variability in the analysis kilsby et al 2007 semenov and barrow 1997 while earlier climate change studies have forced a hydrological model with gcms few studies have coupled swg with gcms by using a weather generator we try to understand the occurrence frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events under future climate scenarios uncertainty from gcms is addressed by using a suite of 20 gcms in comparison to few gcms used in earlier studies in addition we highlight the need for non climate model based scenarios in the context of water supply management this study presents an initial framework for climate impact analysis on water resources incorporating a stochastic weather generator and sensitivity surface and is part of an ongoing effort to evaluate the impact of climate change on nyc water supply our approach is demonstrated using one watershed as an example and we intend to expand the scope of this work to other watersheds including specific water quantity and quality issues and management implications 2 methods a general framework for the analysis of climate change impact on water resources using the bottom up approach used in this study is presented in fig 2 the major components of this approach include a swg downscaled future climate scenarios and a watershed model these components are integrated to generate streamflows which describe watershed responses under various climate scenarios streamflow sequences generated using synthetic weather are compared to sequences generated using historical observed weather with regard to seasonal patterns as well as magnitude and occurrence of extreme hydrologic events finally a preliminary application incorporating a swg for climate change impact analysis is demonstrated that includes statistically downscaled gcm based streamflows on a sensitivity surface changes in annual streamflow hydrographs and the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events 2 1 stochastic weather generation in a swg precipitation is simulated in a two step process in which precipitation occurrence wet or dry day is simulated first followed by precipitation amount acharya et al 2017 examined the performance of different weather generator models of varying complexity to simulate daily precipitation characteristics including in the woh region with a focus on extreme events using the swg tool weather generator école de technologie supérieure weagets chen et al 2012 their major conclusions were that a a first order markov chain mc model performs as well as higher orders for simulating precipitation occurrence and b parametric distributions with three parameters skewed normal and mixed exponential work better than two parameter distributions for simulating precipitation magnitude following acharya et al 2017 we employed the first order mc for precipitation occurrence and the skewed normal distribution parameters are mean standard deviation and skew coefficient for precipitation amount the observed and the simulated transition probabilities wet dry day followed by a wet dry day were comparable model parameters were estimated on a biweekly basis throughout the calendar year for any rainy day defined as days with 0 1 mm precipitation a transformed skewed normal distribution is used to generate daily precipitation nicks and gander 1994 1 x 6 g g 2 r μ s 1 1 3 1 g 6 where x is the standard normal variate r is the daily precipitation amount μ s and g are the mean mm standard deviation mm and skew coefficient two random numbers are used to generate x the second number for today is reused as the first number for tomorrow which is then used in eq 1 to compute r for a given day chen et al 2009 daily maximum tmax and minimum air temperatures tmin were also generated using weagets chen et al 2012 in weagets the observed tmax and tmin are reduced to residual elements by subtracting the daily means and dividing by the standard deviations where both the means and standard deviations are conditioned on the wet or dry status of precipitation a first order linear autoregressive model generates the residual series acharya et al 2017 showed that although most swg models evaluated in their study captured the mean of daily precipitation statistics well almost all models underestimated the inter annual variability of monthly and annual precipitation this is because most swgs do not take into account inter annual variability referred to here as the low frequency component of climate variability in this study we corrected for this deficiency using a spectral correction approach chen et al 2010 in which low frequency variability is modeled using the power spectra of the annual time series of precipitation and temperature monthly and yearly precipitation and yearly average temperature are then generated by assigning random phases for each spectral component which maintains the power spectra variances and autocorrelation of the observed series earlier studies have shown that this spectral correction approach performs very well in preserving the low frequency variability of precipitation chen et al 2012 and temperature chen et al 2011 2 2 climate scenarios one of the main components in the assessment of climate change impact on water resources are projected future climate scenarios from gcms that are used to drive hydrologic models in this study we used the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca datasets as described in abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca is a statistical downscaling method that utilizes a training dataset i e an observed time series of meteorology to remove historical biases and convert gcm outputs from their native relatively coarse spatial resolution to a 4 km grid the training dataset for the period 1979 2012 used here abatzoglou 2013 was derived by combining attributes of two datasets temporally rich data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell et al 2004 and spatially rich data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 high spatial resolution of prism and high temporal resolution of nldas 2 are combined using bilinear and climatologically aided interpolation methods the projected daily future climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation downscaled for the grid point near the centroid of one of the study watersheds was used to demonstrate the proposed study framework we found that at stations in our watershed maca biases were not completely corrected we quantified this bias with quantile mapping approach li et al 2010 for 1950 2005 interval and a correction was then applied to gcm projections of future climate 2006 2099 in the quantile mapping approach cumulative density functions cdfs of observed and gcm historical data are prepared from these paired cdfs a transfer function quantile map is prepared for various quantiles and the bias between the observed and the modeled value is calculated as the difference between or ratio only for precipitation of the two quantities a total of 20 cmip5 gcms table 1 based on rcp 8 5 worst case emission scenario for the mid century period 2041 2060 were included in the analysis a more detailed analysis of climate data historical and future projections are discussed in a forthcoming paper gelda et al unpublished all 20 gcms were corrected for bias using observed historical and gcm historical as outlined above therefore we consider observed historical current condition as good reference to compare with future gcms compared to the cfm the timing magnitude and frequency of events are different from the historical period in the maca statistical downscaling method 2 3 the generalized watershed loading function variable source area gwlf vsa hydrology model the gwlf vsa model schneiderman et al 2007 is a lumped parameter hydrology model based on the original gwlf model haith and shoemaker 1987 that simulates daily streamflow at a watershed scale runoff is calculated using the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service scs curve number cn methodology the cn is an empirical parameter for estimating runoff the cn values can range from 30 to 100 depending on the hydrologic soil group land cover type hydrologic condition and antecedent runoff condition rawls et al 1993 the model simulates streamflow contributions from runoff and baseflow daily snowmelt is estimated based on temperature degree day with a daily updating of a single watershed wide snowpack water from infiltration either after rainfall or snowmelt is available for evaporation or is stored in a single groundwater reservoir for slow release as baseflow inputs to gwlf streamflow model include daily precipitation air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity one important modification introduced in gwlf vsa version of the model schneiderman et al 2007 is accounting for surface runoff distribution across the landscape based on a saturation excess interpretation of the scs curve number equation and a topographic index of saturation probability this modification is important since saturation excess is the dominant runoff generating process in the study region frankenberger et al 1999 lyon et al 2004 steenhuis et al 1995 walter et al 2003 the calibrated model has been applied and validated in previous studies in nyc watersheds matonse et al 2011 mukundan et al 2013 in this study we used the same calibrated model set ups from our earlier studies the performance statistics of the gwlf vsa model for a recent simulation period 1982 2010 in woh watersheds is shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and mean absolute error mae values show that the model performs well in simulating streamflow at daily monthly and annual time scales 2 3 1 simulations of historical streamflow in this study we are interested in evaluating the ability of hydrologic model forecasts using synthetic meteorology to reproduce the observed annual streamflow cycle and the magnitude of observed annual maximum daily streamflow values our method is to run the calibrated gwlf vsa for two meteorology time series first the observed historical and second produced by the swg in both cases the model used a single time series of climate variables representative of the centroid of each watershed simulated the two resulting streamflow simulations were then compared to each other the calibrated gwlf vsa watershed model was used to simulate daily streamflow for the predominantly forested six woh watersheds fig 1 for the period from 1950 to 2009 60 years using observed daily precipitation and air temperature tmax and tmin data from the cooperator stations recognized by the national climate data center obtained from the northeast regional climate center the daily precipitation station data were averaged for the entire basin using a thiessen polygon method zion et al 2011 potential biases of model input due to spatial averaging of precipitation were corrected with a constant multiplicative factor estimated in the calibration process solar radiation and relative humidity were computed using mt clim hungerford et al 1989 running et al 1987 a climate interpolation model that estimates solar radiation and relative humidity as functions of air temperature and precipitation in mt clim shortwave radiation is calculated by reducing the theoretical value for a location and day of the year using daily transmittance estimated empirically based on diurnal temperature range and humidity with a further 25 reduction applied on days with precipitation mt clim employs an iterative process to estimate shortwave radiation and humidity a recent study that evaluated mt clim at the global scale showed minimum biases in solar radiation and relative humidity estimates for the northeastern us bohn et al 2013 for simulations using synthetic weather longer time series 10 times observed record of 60 years 1950 2009 of the swg simulated precipitation and air temperature were used as input to the gwlf vsa model to capture the effects of climate variability and to generate longer time series representative of historical streamflow under a wide range of hydrologic conditions statistics parameters in eq 1 of observed and simulated historical daily precipitation for the ashokan reservoir watershed are shown in table 3 2 3 2 simulations of future streamflow projected streamflows for esopus creek watershed that provides major inflows to the ashokan reservoir fig 1 under future conditions were simulated with and without using swg for simulations without swg the gwlf vsa model was run continuously for the period 2006 2099 using climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation from 20 bias corrected gcms our future period of interest is the middle of the century and therefore the swg was used to generate scenarios representative of the mid century 2041 2060 for esopus creek watershed using projected climate for that period as input this approach was taken as uncertainty in gcm projections increase with time to generate precipitation events that occur less frequently a set of twenty 2000 year scenarios representative of the 2041 2060 period were generated from 20 available gcms and used as input to the watershed model another weather time series of comparable length 1980 years representative of observed historical weather was generated using historical weather 1950 2009 as input to the swg the duration of the synthetic series produced by swg is an integer multiple of the duration of the input time series comparisons were thus made between long term simulations of streamflow under historical and mid century period that incorporates both climate change and variability statistics of future precipitation amounts determined from gcms with and without swg for the ashokan reservoir esopus creek watershed are shown in table 3 2 3 3 streamflow sensitivity surface sensitivity surfaces can depict system responses to a range of climate scenarios as an initial application we generated a streamflow sensitivity surface for the esopus creek watershed by changing the observed precipitation p and air temperature t values by a range of values 25 to 25 at 10 increment including no change for p and 1 c to 6 c at 1 c increment for t and using it as input to the calibrated gwlf vsa watershed model a total of 56 time series of streamflow for the period 1950 2009 with combinations of p and t changes were generated mean annual change in simulated streamflow for each combination relative to streamflow simulated using observed historical p and t was used as the response variable 3rd axis with change in p and t as the x and y axis respectively 3 results and discussion daily streamflow simulated using simulated weather qsim s and using observed weather qsim o as input both capture the annual streamflow cycle and extreme values each feature is explored in more detail in the following sections 3 1 comparison of streamflow generated using observed and synthetic weather the bimodal seasonal variation in daily mean streamflow expressed as cm day 1 representing rate of discharge volume per unit watershed area with a primary peak during spring related to snowmelt a low flow regime during summer associated with increased evapotranspiration and a secondary peak during fall winter associated with large precipitation events decreased evapotranspiration and saturated soil conditions was accurately simulated using both observed and synthetic weather fig 3 the annual peaks in streamflow typically occurring near april 10 were generally consistent when using observed and synthetic weather in all six watersheds streamflow during this period is highly influenced by snowmelt runoff and therefore temperature plays a greater role during this period than during the fall winter peak fig 4 compares the magnitude of annual maximum daily flows simulated using observed and synthetic weather the median and the inter quartile range of values overlap for the two sets of simulations inter annual variability within each basin is captured as indicated by a comparison of the box and whisker plots within each basin for which median first quartile and third quartile values are very similar variability between basins is also accurately captured as indicated by a comparison of the box and whisker plots between basins the swg is also capable of producing streamflow events of greater magnitude than events produced using observed weather for all six woh watersheds this is one of the most valuable aspects of using a stochastic model one can include plausible events that did not occur during the time domain of the observational record a swg is thus capable of providing probabilistic information for evaluating impacts on water supply 3 2 streamflow sensitivity to climate change esopus creek watershed the sensitivity surface fig 5 indicates that mean streamflow is approximately linearly related to both mean precipitation and mean temperature the basin s sensitivity to precipitation is 1 5 change in mean streamflow per 1 change in mean precipitation the sensitivity to temperature is 1 change in mean streamflow per 1 c temperature change sensitivity surfaces allow one to view alternative climate scenarios in the context of historical variations for example we show mid century 2041 2060 streamflow simulated using twenty downscaled cmip5 gcms for rcp 8 5 these climate projections indicate a warmer and probably wetter future while future precipitation changes are generally within the range of observed precipitation the expected temperature increase is well outside the observed range for any decade since 1950 most of these model results show mean streamflow rates increasing by between 5 and 20 making average conditions comparable to the wettest decades on record non climate model based scenarios can also be examined for example the drought of 1960s resulted in about 26 decrease in simulated streamflow in the ashokan watershed fig 5 if this drought were to occur in the future under the same precipitation regime and gcm projected average annual change in temperature of 3 4 c increase the decrease in streamflow would be about 32 fig 5 the difference in annual streamflow under these two conditions is represented on the sensitivity surface and is connected by the red dotted line in fig 5 such scenarios can have major implications on water supply management and highlights the need for generating additional scenarios beyond what is projected by the gcms fig 6 shows the mean daily streamflow predicted from historical weather and a range of streamflows for climate change scenarios using the gwlf vsa model climate change scenarios indicate a shift in the timing of streamflow during early winter and spring with early winter flows increasing and spring peak typically observed in late march april decreasing most climate change scenarios indicated higher streamflows from november through february compared to historical period these findings are consistent with shift in the timing of annual streamflow peak observed in streamflow data burns et al 2007 dudley et al 2017 and earlier simulations of climate change using cmip3 scenarios for the region matonse et al 2011 zion et al 2011 these projected changes in hydrology could potentially result in early filling of water supply reservoirs as reported by matonse et al 2013 and may also increase the potential for regional flooding burns et al 2007 we also compared the annual peak daily streamflow magnitude during spring march april and fall winter november december periods and the average daily flows during july august months under historical and future scenarios fig 7 historical scenarios using swg captured natural climate variability during the 1950 2009 period and future scenarios using swg captured both climate variability and uncertainty due to gcms while the magnitude of annual spring peaks are not projected to change drastically with only a slight decrease in median values and overlap in inter quartile range fall winter peaks are projected to increase in the future period considered compared to historical observations average summer flows are projected to show a moderate increase under future scenarios simulated changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrologic events due to climate change for the mid century period is shown in fig 8 as a reference a recent extreme hydrologic event hurricane irene which occurred in august 2011 was a 200 yr event in parts of the esopus creek yoon and raymond 2012 with a peak daily average streamflow of about 14 cm streamflow simulations using synthetic weather representing historical and future conditions show an increase in the probability of extreme hydrological events similar to hurricane irene in the future the magnitude of events of a given return interval is also projected to increase under future conditions fig 8 large storm events often causes a disproportionate transport of nutrients sediment and dissolved organic carbon from the watersheds into water supply reservoirs the results of this study indicate a potential challenge to water quality in the future such as high turbidity in the reservoirs causing increased use of alum for settling the turbidity causing particles and disinfection byproducts formation in the water supply distribution system resulting from export of high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon from the watersheds after large storms as reported by yoon and raymond 2012 here we use the esopus creek watershed as a case study to demonstrate the general direction of climate change in the region magnitude of change and impact on water quality etc are watershed specific analyzing each individual aspect is beyond the scope of this paper our follow up study mukundan et al 2018 indicated an increase in the frequency and magnitude of high stream turbidity events that may demand more frequent operational changes to the water supply compared to current conditions 4 summary and conclusions a first application of a stochastic weather generator to investigate streamflow sensitivity to climate change on the nyc water supply system is presented a stochastic weather generator was tested for its ability to produce a synthetic weather time series that in turn reproduces the observed annual streamflow cycle the gwlf vsa watershed model was used to simulate streamflow using both observed and synthetic weather time series streamflow simulated using the synthetic weather time series were comparable to values simulated using observed long term 1950 2009 weather time series including the seasonal streamflow variation as expected the synthetic weather produced extreme hydrologic events not found in streamflow predicted using observed weather this supports the use of synthetic weather in the evaluation of impacts of extreme events sensitivity surfaces can be used in climate change impact assessment as a means to identify situations conditions to which a system could potentially be vulnerable and needs detailed evaluation for operational infrastructural changes and can facilitate rapid dissemination of complex information related to water quantity quality in an initial application we used streamflow sensitivity surfaces to depict watershed responses to changing climate the basin s sensitivity to precipitation is 1 5 change in mean streamflow per 1 change in mean precipitation the sensitivity to temperature is 1 change in mean streamflow per 1 c temperature change the mean annual streamflow on a sensitivity surface for one nyc watershed shows projected increase in the mid century period based on cmip5 projections this increase is due to the effect of decreases in spring peak flows and increases in streamflow during other seasons in addition the annual streamflow hydrograph was projected to change in the future with streamflow increasing throughout the winter and early spring and a shift in the peak spring runoff earlier into the winter these findings are consistent with earlier studies using historical observations and simulations using cmip3 projections coupling of swg with gcms generated hydrologic scenarios that incorporated climate variability not found in historical record or in gcm projections compared to historical period representing current conditions majority of the scenarios generated using swg indicated an increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events for the future time slice considered 2041 2060 the modeling analysis presented here with regard to the changing magnitude and frequency of extreme events should be interpreted as relative to historical simulations and is limited by the ability of the watershed model to accurately predict the observed daily streamflow peaks although this study assumed stationary land use cover for the study region under future scenarios application in other regions may need to consider changes in land use cover when simulating future scenarios of streamflow decadal scale variability in climate is not generally captured by the gcms further investigation is needed to evaluate how the use of swg incorporates this variability additional research is also needed to generate drought scenarios not found in gcms to evaluate water supply system response in future work we will use multiple scenarios of changing climate in the region to evaluate the vulnerability of the water supply system using an integrated suite of watershed reservoir models and alternative measures of performance of the water supply system the use of a weather generator allows development of scenarios that are comprised of multiple realizations of observed climate from a limited time series of observed weather or of future climate determined from time slices of future weather based on gcms the general approach described here can be broadened to allow evaluation of the potential impact of climate change on water resources in any system the sensitivity surface presented in this study shows the value and need for non climate model based scenarios in climate change impact studies in addition to streamflow variables such as water quality parameters or any other metric of interest can be evaluated on a sensitivity surface acknowledgment we acknowledge the support of mr jordan gass

8463,study region the new york city water supply watersheds study focus this study is a modeling analysis on climate change impact on streamflow using a stochastic weather generator swg a hydrologic model and downscaled future climate scenarios streamflow generated using synthetic time series of precipitation and air temperature from a swg were compared to those simulated from observed historical and projected future weather new hydrologic insights for the region synthetic weather was able to mimic the observed annual streamflow cycle for the six watersheds studied including the seasonal pattern as well as magnitude and occurrence of extreme hydrologic events streamflow simulations using projected climate from 20 global climate models gcm for one of the new york city water supply watersheds indicate the potential for changes in the hydrologic regime in this region the models indicate a shift in the timing of spring melt runoff from a distinct peak in late march and april under historical 1950 2009 conditions towards earlier in the year for mid century 2041 2060 period results indicate that the region may experience an overall increase in mean streamflow in the future due to the combined effect of decreasing spring runoff peak and increasing streamflow during other seasons more importantly the magnitude and frequency of extreme hydrological events are projected to increase under future scenarios these results have implications for future operation and management of the water supply keywords climate change extreme events nyc water supply scenarios water resources 1 introduction the new york city nyc water supply serving over 9 million consumers is currently the largest unfiltered drinking water supply in the united states historically about 90 of this water is delivered from six catskill delaware system of west of hudson woh reservoirs fig 1 matonse and frei 2013 reported increasing trends in total precipitation and in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events in woh watersheds through the year 2012 although conditions since that time have been more similar to mean 20th century values frei and kelly voicu 2017 the northeastern us in general experienced an increase in extreme storms and floods primarily during the warm season in the early 2000s frei et al 2015 and the increase was greater than any other region in the united states horton et al 2014 these trends pose challenges for managing water quality such as increased sediment and nutrient loading and maintaining optimal water quantity to meet consumer demand reservoir storage flood mitigation ecological and other needs large streamflow events are often responsible for water resources problems including a disproportionate transport of nutrients and sediments into receiving water bodies mukundan et al 2013 yoon and raymond 2012 a leading drinking water quality issue involves the impact of extreme events on the concentration of disinfection byproduct dbp precursors raseman et al 2017 for example the level of total trihalomethanes a class of dbp increased above the current maximum allowable contaminant level at some nyc distribution locations during october and november of 2011 in the aftermath of hurricane irene and tropical storm lee although the levels were never out of compliance with regulations in place at that time mukundan and van dreason 2014 other potential challenges to water utilities associated with extreme events include turbidity algal toxins and pathogens changes in source water quality could potentially affect management for compliance with drinking water regulations the primary approach to study climate impacts on water resources has been through the use of global climate model gcm projections of future climate brown et al 2012 the raw gcm projections at a coarser scale several 100 km have biases that are corrected prior to local watershed scale application and impact assessments anandhi et al 2011 the downscaled and bias corrected climate variables are then used as input to a hydrologic model the output of which is used in a water supply system model for climate impact studies matonse et al 2013 this method is called the top down approach which relies on the gcms and downscaling methods used for information on potential impacts of climate change teng et al 2012 reported that the greatest source of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling of climate change comes from gcms another approach used in climate impact modeling is spatial disaggregation of gcms using regional climate models rcms that operates at a finer resolution of about 50 km or lower buytaert et al 2010 however rcms are computationally intensive and complex to implement for a suite of gcms affected by bias of driving gcm and therefore not widely used the new york city department of environmental protection dep is exploring the potential effects of future climate change on the quantity and quality of water in the nyc water supply dep 2014 previous studies by dep matonse et al 2013 zion et al 2011 followed the mostly widely used top down approach with the goal of making an initial estimate of climate change impacts using downscaled gcm output and dep s suite of watershed reservoir and system operation models the main findings included a projected shift in the timing of spring snowmelt from a distinct peak in late march and april to a more consistent distribution between autumn and winter this projected shift was attributed to increased temperatures resulting in less precipitation falling as snow and faster melting of the snowpack zion et al 2011 in previous studies by dep scenarios were derived using a monthly change factor method cfm based simple downscaling of gcm results in which future climate scenarios are generated by either a multiplicative or additive factor applied to the observed meteorological time series anandhi et al 2011 the cfm has a number of disadvantages long term historical patterns of the timing of storm events the frequency and duration of storm events including extreme events inter storm periods and the relative frequencies of events of different magnitudes all remain unchanged since streamflow magnitude depends on antecedent conditions in the basin frei and kelly voicu 2017 the inability to simulate changes in the sequence of precipitation events is a major drawback of the cfm approach while a top down approach can provide general information about potential impacts from available gcm projections it is often insufficient for water managers and decision makers brown et al 2012 for example a top down approach does not incorporate uncertainty associated with the choice of gcm choice of emission scenario and variations in future climate variability to address these and other drawbacks of the cfm based top down approach dep is currently exploring bottom up or vulnerability based methods to explore climate impacts on water resources this approach uses scenarios beyond gcm projections such as stochastic methods to identify conditions under which a water supply system is vulnerable to climatological operational or infrastructural changes brown et al 2011 prudhomme et al 2015 2010 wilby and dessai 2010 brown et al 2012 describe the use of stochastic methods for hazard identification and the use of climate projections to estimate relative probabilities of these hazards for risk assessment in contrast to the top down approach the bottom up approach is expected to identify important scenarios that may not be found in gcm projections that provide only a limited set of future conditions the overall aim of this study is to present initial results of a climate change impact analysis of both mean and extreme hydrological conditions for the new york city water supply basins using a bottom up approach as part of this analysis we apply a stochastic weather generator swg model developed for this region acharya et al 2017 to force a hydrological model in order to simulate basin scale streamflow responses to synthetic weather time series in the woh watersheds hydrologic modeling using historical or future climate provides results that are typically based on only one or a few realizations of the past or future climate using a swg can provide multiple time series of climate that are equally likely to occur and therefore incorporate uncertainty due to climate variability in the analysis kilsby et al 2007 semenov and barrow 1997 while earlier climate change studies have forced a hydrological model with gcms few studies have coupled swg with gcms by using a weather generator we try to understand the occurrence frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events under future climate scenarios uncertainty from gcms is addressed by using a suite of 20 gcms in comparison to few gcms used in earlier studies in addition we highlight the need for non climate model based scenarios in the context of water supply management this study presents an initial framework for climate impact analysis on water resources incorporating a stochastic weather generator and sensitivity surface and is part of an ongoing effort to evaluate the impact of climate change on nyc water supply our approach is demonstrated using one watershed as an example and we intend to expand the scope of this work to other watersheds including specific water quantity and quality issues and management implications 2 methods a general framework for the analysis of climate change impact on water resources using the bottom up approach used in this study is presented in fig 2 the major components of this approach include a swg downscaled future climate scenarios and a watershed model these components are integrated to generate streamflows which describe watershed responses under various climate scenarios streamflow sequences generated using synthetic weather are compared to sequences generated using historical observed weather with regard to seasonal patterns as well as magnitude and occurrence of extreme hydrologic events finally a preliminary application incorporating a swg for climate change impact analysis is demonstrated that includes statistically downscaled gcm based streamflows on a sensitivity surface changes in annual streamflow hydrographs and the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events 2 1 stochastic weather generation in a swg precipitation is simulated in a two step process in which precipitation occurrence wet or dry day is simulated first followed by precipitation amount acharya et al 2017 examined the performance of different weather generator models of varying complexity to simulate daily precipitation characteristics including in the woh region with a focus on extreme events using the swg tool weather generator école de technologie supérieure weagets chen et al 2012 their major conclusions were that a a first order markov chain mc model performs as well as higher orders for simulating precipitation occurrence and b parametric distributions with three parameters skewed normal and mixed exponential work better than two parameter distributions for simulating precipitation magnitude following acharya et al 2017 we employed the first order mc for precipitation occurrence and the skewed normal distribution parameters are mean standard deviation and skew coefficient for precipitation amount the observed and the simulated transition probabilities wet dry day followed by a wet dry day were comparable model parameters were estimated on a biweekly basis throughout the calendar year for any rainy day defined as days with 0 1 mm precipitation a transformed skewed normal distribution is used to generate daily precipitation nicks and gander 1994 1 x 6 g g 2 r μ s 1 1 3 1 g 6 where x is the standard normal variate r is the daily precipitation amount μ s and g are the mean mm standard deviation mm and skew coefficient two random numbers are used to generate x the second number for today is reused as the first number for tomorrow which is then used in eq 1 to compute r for a given day chen et al 2009 daily maximum tmax and minimum air temperatures tmin were also generated using weagets chen et al 2012 in weagets the observed tmax and tmin are reduced to residual elements by subtracting the daily means and dividing by the standard deviations where both the means and standard deviations are conditioned on the wet or dry status of precipitation a first order linear autoregressive model generates the residual series acharya et al 2017 showed that although most swg models evaluated in their study captured the mean of daily precipitation statistics well almost all models underestimated the inter annual variability of monthly and annual precipitation this is because most swgs do not take into account inter annual variability referred to here as the low frequency component of climate variability in this study we corrected for this deficiency using a spectral correction approach chen et al 2010 in which low frequency variability is modeled using the power spectra of the annual time series of precipitation and temperature monthly and yearly precipitation and yearly average temperature are then generated by assigning random phases for each spectral component which maintains the power spectra variances and autocorrelation of the observed series earlier studies have shown that this spectral correction approach performs very well in preserving the low frequency variability of precipitation chen et al 2012 and temperature chen et al 2011 2 2 climate scenarios one of the main components in the assessment of climate change impact on water resources are projected future climate scenarios from gcms that are used to drive hydrologic models in this study we used the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca datasets as described in abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca is a statistical downscaling method that utilizes a training dataset i e an observed time series of meteorology to remove historical biases and convert gcm outputs from their native relatively coarse spatial resolution to a 4 km grid the training dataset for the period 1979 2012 used here abatzoglou 2013 was derived by combining attributes of two datasets temporally rich data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell et al 2004 and spatially rich data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 high spatial resolution of prism and high temporal resolution of nldas 2 are combined using bilinear and climatologically aided interpolation methods the projected daily future climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation downscaled for the grid point near the centroid of one of the study watersheds was used to demonstrate the proposed study framework we found that at stations in our watershed maca biases were not completely corrected we quantified this bias with quantile mapping approach li et al 2010 for 1950 2005 interval and a correction was then applied to gcm projections of future climate 2006 2099 in the quantile mapping approach cumulative density functions cdfs of observed and gcm historical data are prepared from these paired cdfs a transfer function quantile map is prepared for various quantiles and the bias between the observed and the modeled value is calculated as the difference between or ratio only for precipitation of the two quantities a total of 20 cmip5 gcms table 1 based on rcp 8 5 worst case emission scenario for the mid century period 2041 2060 were included in the analysis a more detailed analysis of climate data historical and future projections are discussed in a forthcoming paper gelda et al unpublished all 20 gcms were corrected for bias using observed historical and gcm historical as outlined above therefore we consider observed historical current condition as good reference to compare with future gcms compared to the cfm the timing magnitude and frequency of events are different from the historical period in the maca statistical downscaling method 2 3 the generalized watershed loading function variable source area gwlf vsa hydrology model the gwlf vsa model schneiderman et al 2007 is a lumped parameter hydrology model based on the original gwlf model haith and shoemaker 1987 that simulates daily streamflow at a watershed scale runoff is calculated using the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service scs curve number cn methodology the cn is an empirical parameter for estimating runoff the cn values can range from 30 to 100 depending on the hydrologic soil group land cover type hydrologic condition and antecedent runoff condition rawls et al 1993 the model simulates streamflow contributions from runoff and baseflow daily snowmelt is estimated based on temperature degree day with a daily updating of a single watershed wide snowpack water from infiltration either after rainfall or snowmelt is available for evaporation or is stored in a single groundwater reservoir for slow release as baseflow inputs to gwlf streamflow model include daily precipitation air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity one important modification introduced in gwlf vsa version of the model schneiderman et al 2007 is accounting for surface runoff distribution across the landscape based on a saturation excess interpretation of the scs curve number equation and a topographic index of saturation probability this modification is important since saturation excess is the dominant runoff generating process in the study region frankenberger et al 1999 lyon et al 2004 steenhuis et al 1995 walter et al 2003 the calibrated model has been applied and validated in previous studies in nyc watersheds matonse et al 2011 mukundan et al 2013 in this study we used the same calibrated model set ups from our earlier studies the performance statistics of the gwlf vsa model for a recent simulation period 1982 2010 in woh watersheds is shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and mean absolute error mae values show that the model performs well in simulating streamflow at daily monthly and annual time scales 2 3 1 simulations of historical streamflow in this study we are interested in evaluating the ability of hydrologic model forecasts using synthetic meteorology to reproduce the observed annual streamflow cycle and the magnitude of observed annual maximum daily streamflow values our method is to run the calibrated gwlf vsa for two meteorology time series first the observed historical and second produced by the swg in both cases the model used a single time series of climate variables representative of the centroid of each watershed simulated the two resulting streamflow simulations were then compared to each other the calibrated gwlf vsa watershed model was used to simulate daily streamflow for the predominantly forested six woh watersheds fig 1 for the period from 1950 to 2009 60 years using observed daily precipitation and air temperature tmax and tmin data from the cooperator stations recognized by the national climate data center obtained from the northeast regional climate center the daily precipitation station data were averaged for the entire basin using a thiessen polygon method zion et al 2011 potential biases of model input due to spatial averaging of precipitation were corrected with a constant multiplicative factor estimated in the calibration process solar radiation and relative humidity were computed using mt clim hungerford et al 1989 running et al 1987 a climate interpolation model that estimates solar radiation and relative humidity as functions of air temperature and precipitation in mt clim shortwave radiation is calculated by reducing the theoretical value for a location and day of the year using daily transmittance estimated empirically based on diurnal temperature range and humidity with a further 25 reduction applied on days with precipitation mt clim employs an iterative process to estimate shortwave radiation and humidity a recent study that evaluated mt clim at the global scale showed minimum biases in solar radiation and relative humidity estimates for the northeastern us bohn et al 2013 for simulations using synthetic weather longer time series 10 times observed record of 60 years 1950 2009 of the swg simulated precipitation and air temperature were used as input to the gwlf vsa model to capture the effects of climate variability and to generate longer time series representative of historical streamflow under a wide range of hydrologic conditions statistics parameters in eq 1 of observed and simulated historical daily precipitation for the ashokan reservoir watershed are shown in table 3 2 3 2 simulations of future streamflow projected streamflows for esopus creek watershed that provides major inflows to the ashokan reservoir fig 1 under future conditions were simulated with and without using swg for simulations without swg the gwlf vsa model was run continuously for the period 2006 2099 using climate variables air temperature precipitation relative humidity and solar radiation from 20 bias corrected gcms our future period of interest is the middle of the century and therefore the swg was used to generate scenarios representative of the mid century 2041 2060 for esopus creek watershed using projected climate for that period as input this approach was taken as uncertainty in gcm projections increase with time to generate precipitation events that occur less frequently a set of twenty 2000 year scenarios representative of the 2041 2060 period were generated from 20 available gcms and used as input to the watershed model another weather time series of comparable length 1980 years representative of observed historical weather was generated using historical weather 1950 2009 as input to the swg the duration of the synthetic series produced by swg is an integer multiple of the duration of the input time series comparisons were thus made between long term simulations of streamflow under historical and mid century period that incorporates both climate change and variability statistics of future precipitation amounts determined from gcms with and without swg for the ashokan reservoir esopus creek watershed are shown in table 3 2 3 3 streamflow sensitivity surface sensitivity surfaces can depict system responses to a range of climate scenarios as an initial application we generated a streamflow sensitivity surface for the esopus creek watershed by changing the observed precipitation p and air temperature t values by a range of values 25 to 25 at 10 increment including no change for p and 1 c to 6 c at 1 c increment for t and using it as input to the calibrated gwlf vsa watershed model a total of 56 time series of streamflow for the period 1950 2009 with combinations of p and t changes were generated mean annual change in simulated streamflow for each combination relative to streamflow simulated using observed historical p and t was used as the response variable 3rd axis with change in p and t as the x and y axis respectively 3 results and discussion daily streamflow simulated using simulated weather qsim s and using observed weather qsim o as input both capture the annual streamflow cycle and extreme values each feature is explored in more detail in the following sections 3 1 comparison of streamflow generated using observed and synthetic weather the bimodal seasonal variation in daily mean streamflow expressed as cm day 1 representing rate of discharge volume per unit watershed area with a primary peak during spring related to snowmelt a low flow regime during summer associated with increased evapotranspiration and a secondary peak during fall winter associated with large precipitation events decreased evapotranspiration and saturated soil conditions was accurately simulated using both observed and synthetic weather fig 3 the annual peaks in streamflow typically occurring near april 10 were generally consistent when using observed and synthetic weather in all six watersheds streamflow during this period is highly influenced by snowmelt runoff and therefore temperature plays a greater role during this period than during the fall winter peak fig 4 compares the magnitude of annual maximum daily flows simulated using observed and synthetic weather the median and the inter quartile range of values overlap for the two sets of simulations inter annual variability within each basin is captured as indicated by a comparison of the box and whisker plots within each basin for which median first quartile and third quartile values are very similar variability between basins is also accurately captured as indicated by a comparison of the box and whisker plots between basins the swg is also capable of producing streamflow events of greater magnitude than events produced using observed weather for all six woh watersheds this is one of the most valuable aspects of using a stochastic model one can include plausible events that did not occur during the time domain of the observational record a swg is thus capable of providing probabilistic information for evaluating impacts on water supply 3 2 streamflow sensitivity to climate change esopus creek watershed the sensitivity surface fig 5 indicates that mean streamflow is approximately linearly related to both mean precipitation and mean temperature the basin s sensitivity to precipitation is 1 5 change in mean streamflow per 1 change in mean precipitation the sensitivity to temperature is 1 change in mean streamflow per 1 c temperature change sensitivity surfaces allow one to view alternative climate scenarios in the context of historical variations for example we show mid century 2041 2060 streamflow simulated using twenty downscaled cmip5 gcms for rcp 8 5 these climate projections indicate a warmer and probably wetter future while future precipitation changes are generally within the range of observed precipitation the expected temperature increase is well outside the observed range for any decade since 1950 most of these model results show mean streamflow rates increasing by between 5 and 20 making average conditions comparable to the wettest decades on record non climate model based scenarios can also be examined for example the drought of 1960s resulted in about 26 decrease in simulated streamflow in the ashokan watershed fig 5 if this drought were to occur in the future under the same precipitation regime and gcm projected average annual change in temperature of 3 4 c increase the decrease in streamflow would be about 32 fig 5 the difference in annual streamflow under these two conditions is represented on the sensitivity surface and is connected by the red dotted line in fig 5 such scenarios can have major implications on water supply management and highlights the need for generating additional scenarios beyond what is projected by the gcms fig 6 shows the mean daily streamflow predicted from historical weather and a range of streamflows for climate change scenarios using the gwlf vsa model climate change scenarios indicate a shift in the timing of streamflow during early winter and spring with early winter flows increasing and spring peak typically observed in late march april decreasing most climate change scenarios indicated higher streamflows from november through february compared to historical period these findings are consistent with shift in the timing of annual streamflow peak observed in streamflow data burns et al 2007 dudley et al 2017 and earlier simulations of climate change using cmip3 scenarios for the region matonse et al 2011 zion et al 2011 these projected changes in hydrology could potentially result in early filling of water supply reservoirs as reported by matonse et al 2013 and may also increase the potential for regional flooding burns et al 2007 we also compared the annual peak daily streamflow magnitude during spring march april and fall winter november december periods and the average daily flows during july august months under historical and future scenarios fig 7 historical scenarios using swg captured natural climate variability during the 1950 2009 period and future scenarios using swg captured both climate variability and uncertainty due to gcms while the magnitude of annual spring peaks are not projected to change drastically with only a slight decrease in median values and overlap in inter quartile range fall winter peaks are projected to increase in the future period considered compared to historical observations average summer flows are projected to show a moderate increase under future scenarios simulated changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrologic events due to climate change for the mid century period is shown in fig 8 as a reference a recent extreme hydrologic event hurricane irene which occurred in august 2011 was a 200 yr event in parts of the esopus creek yoon and raymond 2012 with a peak daily average streamflow of about 14 cm streamflow simulations using synthetic weather representing historical and future conditions show an increase in the probability of extreme hydrological events similar to hurricane irene in the future the magnitude of events of a given return interval is also projected to increase under future conditions fig 8 large storm events often causes a disproportionate transport of nutrients sediment and dissolved organic carbon from the watersheds into water supply reservoirs the results of this study indicate a potential challenge to water quality in the future such as high turbidity in the reservoirs causing increased use of alum for settling the turbidity causing particles and disinfection byproducts formation in the water supply distribution system resulting from export of high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon from the watersheds after large storms as reported by yoon and raymond 2012 here we use the esopus creek watershed as a case study to demonstrate the general direction of climate change in the region magnitude of change and impact on water quality etc are watershed specific analyzing each individual aspect is beyond the scope of this paper our follow up study mukundan et al 2018 indicated an increase in the frequency and magnitude of high stream turbidity events that may demand more frequent operational changes to the water supply compared to current conditions 4 summary and conclusions a first application of a stochastic weather generator to investigate streamflow sensitivity to climate change on the nyc water supply system is presented a stochastic weather generator was tested for its ability to produce a synthetic weather time series that in turn reproduces the observed annual streamflow cycle the gwlf vsa watershed model was used to simulate streamflow using both observed and synthetic weather time series streamflow simulated using the synthetic weather time series were comparable to values simulated using observed long term 1950 2009 weather time series including the seasonal streamflow variation as expected the synthetic weather produced extreme hydrologic events not found in streamflow predicted using observed weather this supports the use of synthetic weather in the evaluation of impacts of extreme events sensitivity surfaces can be used in climate change impact assessment as a means to identify situations conditions to which a system could potentially be vulnerable and needs detailed evaluation for operational infrastructural changes and can facilitate rapid dissemination of complex information related to water quantity quality in an initial application we used streamflow sensitivity surfaces to depict watershed responses to changing climate the basin s sensitivity to precipitation is 1 5 change in mean streamflow per 1 change in mean precipitation the sensitivity to temperature is 1 change in mean streamflow per 1 c temperature change the mean annual streamflow on a sensitivity surface for one nyc watershed shows projected increase in the mid century period based on cmip5 projections this increase is due to the effect of decreases in spring peak flows and increases in streamflow during other seasons in addition the annual streamflow hydrograph was projected to change in the future with streamflow increasing throughout the winter and early spring and a shift in the peak spring runoff earlier into the winter these findings are consistent with earlier studies using historical observations and simulations using cmip3 projections coupling of swg with gcms generated hydrologic scenarios that incorporated climate variability not found in historical record or in gcm projections compared to historical period representing current conditions majority of the scenarios generated using swg indicated an increase in frequency and magnitude of extreme hydrological events for the future time slice considered 2041 2060 the modeling analysis presented here with regard to the changing magnitude and frequency of extreme events should be interpreted as relative to historical simulations and is limited by the ability of the watershed model to accurately predict the observed daily streamflow peaks although this study assumed stationary land use cover for the study region under future scenarios application in other regions may need to consider changes in land use cover when simulating future scenarios of streamflow decadal scale variability in climate is not generally captured by the gcms further investigation is needed to evaluate how the use of swg incorporates this variability additional research is also needed to generate drought scenarios not found in gcms to evaluate water supply system response in future work we will use multiple scenarios of changing climate in the region to evaluate the vulnerability of the water supply system using an integrated suite of watershed reservoir models and alternative measures of performance of the water supply system the use of a weather generator allows development of scenarios that are comprised of multiple realizations of observed climate from a limited time series of observed weather or of future climate determined from time slices of future weather based on gcms the general approach described here can be broadened to allow evaluation of the potential impact of climate change on water resources in any system the sensitivity surface presented in this study shows the value and need for non climate model based scenarios in climate change impact studies in addition to streamflow variables such as water quality parameters or any other metric of interest can be evaluated on a sensitivity surface acknowledgment we acknowledge the support of mr jordan gass

8464,study region upper blue nile ethiopia study focus the recent availability of high resolution soil data offers a better representation of spatially varying hydrologic parameters and could help in building accurate models despite the release of the afsis 250 m resolution soil data in 2015 its benefits in improving streamflow prediction accuracy is yet to be evaluated the focus of this study is to evaluate the improvement in prediction accuracy of an uncalibrated hydrologic model built using the recently released afsis 250 m soil database in comparison to four other soil databases which are under use for the last decade new hydrological insights for the region limited streamflow data availability has been a major impediment to assessing water resources potential of watersheds recently the africa soil information service afsis provided 250 m resolution datasets with soil properties for up to six soil depth layers the objective of this study is to evaluate the flow prediction accuracy gains from the afsis 250 m if any in comparison to previously availed databases using un calibrated swat soil and water assessment tool hydrologic models the performance of the un calibrated models was evaluated using streamflow at two of the gauging stations evapotranspiration output from the respective models was also compared to remote sensing derived evapotranspiration estimates mod16 et and alexi only marginal improvements in streamflow simulation were achieved by using the most detailed afsis soil a satisfactory agreement was found in most of the area between swat simulated et

uniqueness of model parameters so called equifinality beven and freer 2001 and the parameters dependence on objective functions madsen 2003 renders parameters obtained through regionalization less

porporato et al 2004 schaake et al 1996 yaseef et al 2010 soil moisture is one of these components crucial to accurately quantify streamflow koster et al 2010 along with moisture flux in the land

understanding of water balance components at the small scale a comparison study conducted over two adjacent watersheds in the lake basin under consideration indicated that the watershed

ghana and tanzania through use of small scale irrigation approaches one approach to the project involves evaluation of water resources potential for small scale irrigation using biophysical models identification of the water resources is vital to scale up small scale irrigation in these countries customarily regionalization techniques are used to estimate the water resources potential in these regions due to unavailability of streamflow observations kim and kaluarachchi 2008 tekleab et al 2011 wale et al 2009 the present study was conducted in lake tana subbasin 12 00 n 37 15 e in ethiopia the lake basin has a drainage area of approximately 16 000 km2 fig 1 several hydrologic modeling studies were conducted in the lake tana subbasin alemayehu et al 2010 ayana et al 2015 chebud and

headwater to the blue nile basin where numerous water resources development activities are underway the lake tana region is dominated by tropical highland monsoon climate while most of the rain 70 90 occurs between june and september conway and schipper 2011 mohamed et al 2005 the major rivers flowing into the lake tana are the gilgel abay the rib the gumera and the megech figure gilgel abay has a catchment area of 5004 km2 of which 2025 km2 is gauged and gumera has 1893 km2 of which 1595 km2 is gauged these two watersheds are reported to have a longer period and more accurately recorded streamflow data than rib and megech dile and srinivasan 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 spatial data the spatial data used in setting up the hydrological models are topography land use and soil data in addition evapotranspiration estimates are also used foe spatial comparison of model et estimates 2 2 1 1 topography a 250 m srtm dem is used to delineate the watershed based on predefined streams and a 1 km by 1 km grid representing the subbasins the dem resolution is considered adequate due to the watershed discretization approach that we applied as outlined in subsequent sections 2 2 1 2 land use land

soil properties such as sand silt and clay fractions coarse fragments and organic carbon for up to six soil depth layers vågen et al 2010 soil information in the afsis database are used to generate detailed soil properties using the saxton and rawls 2006 pedo transfer function the afsis soil database is compiled from the africa soil profiles database and the afsis sentinel site database covering a temporal span of 1950 2012 the data is provided at a 250 m and 1 km spatial resolution leenaars et al 2014 the dsmw soil database is compiled from over 600 national soil maps and over 11 000 ancillary map reynolds et al 2000 sombroek 1990 it includes soil properties such as ph organic carbon content water storage capacity and other derived soil properties and it has base material from fao unesco soil map of the world at an original scale of 1 5 million provided at a 3 grid the hwsd is a 30 arc second raster database that combines regional and national updates of soil information worldwide with the information contained within the dsmw the hwsd data presents standardized soil parameters for top 0 to 30 cm and deeper soil profiles 30 to 100 cm the global distribution of the

ethiopian national meteorological services agency for the period of 1990 2015 the swat model weather data generator arnold et al 2012 was prepared using observed weather data at the bahir dar meteorological gauging station fig 1 to complete missing data in the rainfall and maximum minimum temperature and generate data for relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed the missing data ranges between 1 6 in maksegnit station to 19 0 in addiz zemen station dile and srinivasan 2014 streamflow data at the gilgel abay and gumera river gauging stations fig 1 are provided by ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity for the 1990 2007 time span 2 3 hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat model is applied to evaluate the five soil databases based on their streamflow prediction performance swat is a physically based model developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in watersheds with varying soil land use and management conditions neitsch et al 2011 swat has been applied to the highlands of ethiopia and demonstrated satisfactory results ayana et al 2015 betrie et al 2011 dile et al 2016 dile and srinivasan 2014 easton et al 2010 setegn et al 2008 2009 setegn et al 2010 customarily swat disaggregates a river basin into subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus hrus are lumped land areas within the subbasin comprised of unique land cover soil and management combinations such representation neither show the interaction between the hrus arnold et al 2010 nor is suitable to overlay model output for comparison with gridded land surface data products derived from satellite observations therefore we applied a grid based discretization scheme described in rathjens et al 2015 the grid based approach enhances the spatial representation of hydrologic and transport processes rathjens and oppelt 2012 swat grid model is setup for each soil database using predefined 1 km by 1 km grid and applied to a 250 m shuttle rader topographic mission srtm digital elevation model dem use of high resolution swat grid avoids potential loss of spatial information and may yield improved simulation results rathjens and oppelt 2012 in fact the use of smaller sub watersheds instead of grid cells may provide similar results but incorporating raster data e g dem into the sub watershed approach may require data transformation from a simple grid geometry to a patchy geometry of irregular polygons rathjens and oppelt 2012 as such a grid based approach facilitates integrating grid inputs e g dem or validation of model simulations using gridded biophysical parameters e g imagery derived et soil moisture biomass etc the 1 km2 predefined watersheds result in large number of subbasins and hence computationally demanding a dominant hru option was chosen in defining the hrus to increase the computational efficiency including land management practices that improves simulations of biophysical processes detailed land management practices similar to dile and srinivasan 2014 was implemented 2 4 model evaluation a swat grid model was simulated from 1998 to 2007 with an eight year warm up period to allow all hydrological stocks to balance from their initial state the performance of the models was evaluated at two of the gauging stations using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 exploiting the potential of our swat grid approach to overlay model output for comparison with gridded land surface data products we compared the spatial distribution of modeled et to remote sensing derived et the swat grid model enables the comparison of modeled et with remote sensing et the total monthly simulated et for the best performing soil data was compared to the total monthly et estimate of mod16 and alexi at grid level to assess any spatial similarity between the estimates the long term mean model et and remote sensing based et were evaluated by calculating a pixel level coefficient of determination 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of streamflow simulation evaluation of the streamflow simulation with different soil types fig 2 suggests that afsis soil provided better simulation fig 2a and fig a1 a b at a monthly time step afsis hwsd hwsd3 and mowr soils provided very good representation of streamflow simulation for gilgel abay watershed based on general performance ratings moriasi et al 2007 for example the rsr was between 0 00 and 0 50 nse was more than 0 75 and pbias was 10 fig 2 presents the simulated and observed mean monthly streamflow for the time period from 1998 to 2007 while for gumera watershed afsis and mowr soils resulted in very good representation of streamflow simulations with dsmw fig 2b provided unsatisfactory performance based on nse and pbias goodness of fit criteria for both watersheds table a2 perhaps the poor simulation performance for the dsmw is related to its coarser spatial resolution i e 5 5 km kumar and merwade 2009 reported that swat underestimates streamflow with coarser resolution input that could be appropriate for global scale studies fao r 2000 the mowr fig 2e soil data resulted in comparable nse but higher pbias of overestimation compared to simulations with the afsis data whereas the hwsd yields lower nse and marginally better or comparable pbias the hwsd3 has a lower nse but pbias substantially degraded especially for gumera watershed over estimating flow table 1a summarizes results of the goodness of fit evaluations for simulations with the different soils the simulation of the model using different soil datasets was evaluated during the wet june september and dry october may season table a3 the model performance was generally better during the wet season in all the soil datasets except dsmw soil database evaluation of the hydrographs suggested that simulations with afsis captured the pattern of observed streamflow for the gilgel abay and gumera watersheds fig 2 the best and dsmw the worst generally most of the simulations showed underestimations of the observed peak simulations with the afsis soil resulted in the least error 20 followed by simulations using the mowr soil 22 for the gilgel abay river gauging station the highest error 68 of simulating the peak streamflow for the gilgel abay river was found with the dsmw soil while in the gumera watershed generally high error was observed in simulating the peaks the hwsd3 soil data had the least error of peak streamflow simulation 46 and afsis and mowr each had an error of 54 the high error in simulating the peak flows in the gumera river may also be related to flooding problems around the river gauging station smec 2007 based on the goodness of fit evaluation guidelines and pattern of the hydrographs the mowr soil data provided the second best simulation after afsis table a2 3 2 water balance estimation evaluation of water balance components fig 3 showed dsmw and hwsd soils overestimate et both in comparison to satellite and climatological data based point et estimate at weather station locations evapotranspiration estimates by afsis hwsd3 and mowr are comparable the proportion of rainfall converted to surface runoff was comparable in model simulations with afsis and mowr for gilgel abay watershed surface runoff to rainfall ratio was respectively 44 and 42 for simulations with afsis and mowr while for gumera watershed the surface runoff to rainfall ratio was 38 and 36 for afsis and mowr soil respectively based on the simulations using afsis and mowr datasets a fifth of the streamflow in both watersheds was contributed by groundwater the dsmw and hwsd3 data estimated a negligible groundwater contribution for both watersheds the reliability of dsmw is questioned on previous studies in that the source maps widely varied in reliability scales and methodologies zöbler 1986 the spatial distribution of the soil moisture modeled using afsis hwsd and mowr soils is presented in fig 4 in both wet and dry seasons afsis model soil water estimates were comparably higher the largest disparity is in mean dry season soil moisture estimate afsis soil based model resulted in soil water estimate of 200 and 280 of the mowr and hwsd soil based models respectively wet season soil moisture from afsis soil based model was 68 higher than mowr soil based model and 225 of that of hwsd soil based model over croplands the afsis model exhibited less soil water spatial variation with 78 of the cropland having soil water ranging from 125 to 300 mm in spatial terms the northern and north western headwaters of the subbasin exhibited lower soil water for all soil database the water balance components for the two watersheds showed considerable difference such differences that arise from the soil representation approaches are generally difficult to balance out bossa et al 2012 nevertheless the water balance estimates with the afsis soil simulations were consistent with previous modeling practices for example the simulated average annual et for gilgel abay gummera watershed using the afsis soil was 540 mm 557 mm which is in agreement with the literature setegne et al 2008 and dile srinivasa 2014 setegn et al 2008 and dile and srinivasan 2014 estimated that the average annual et for gumera were 618 mm and 616 mm and wyld of 788 mm and 816 mm respectively similarly mamo and jain 2013 estimated average annual wyld of 35 52 m3 sec which is comparable to the 38 38 m3 sec simulated using afsis soil data 3 3 impact of soil representation on model performance and water balance the impact of soil spatial extent representation in a hydrologic model is well documented in the literature becker and braun 1999 dodd and lauenroth 1997 woods et al 1997 yeakley et al 1998 this is because most of the parameters that dictate the hydrologic process in swat grid are derived from the soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity relationships with soil water content moreover texture based pedo transfer functions saxton et al 1986 used in estimating the soil water characteristics introduces uncertainties this is because these functions are based on soil properties in the us and have proven difficult to assemble and apply over a broad range of soil types and moisture regimes saxton et al 1986 these functions are based on soil properties in the us and have proven difficult to assemble and apply over a broad range of soil types and moisture regimes saxton and rawls 2006 thus a certain level of uncertainty associated to these functions could potentially limit the benefits of using afsis soil data the hydrologic soil group are considerably different among the five soil datasets fig 5 and table a1 the soil hydrologic group d was found the most dominant in afsis 97 hwsd 79 hwsd3 84 and mowr 76 soil datasets only the dsmw soil dataset had a proportional spatial distribution of soil hydrologic group c and d which was 57 and 43 respectively in the other four soil datasets the proportion of soil hydrologic group c was less than 20 the high proportion of soil hydrologic group d in the afsis dataset represents high runoff potential because of very slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet the soil hydrologic group d consist significant amount of clay soils that have a high shrink swell potential high water table a clay layer at or near the surface and shallow over nearly impervious material these soils have a very slow rate of water transmission this could partly explain the better agreement in peak flows that the afsis soil exhibited compared to the other soil datasets afsis had 1645 distinct soil types for the study area in the broad textural classification the top layer 50 cm falls in to two categories clay and clay loam however characteristics pertinent to hydrologic processes e g coarse fragment bulk density available water content hydraulic conductivity vary considerably across the six layers which this leads to a varying partitioning fig 3 of the water balance components livneh et al 2015 the other soil datasets had much lower representation hwsd hwsd3 and mowr has 789 26 and 17 distinct soil types respectively dsmw being the coarsest resolution 5 5 km had only 6 distinct soil types afsis and hwsd soil datasets provided soil characteristics for six layers the ability of providing data at different layers makes model calibration robust since it allows modifying model parameters at different depth profile for example esco soil evaporation compensation factor is a sensitive parameter in swat which determines the soil evaporative demand having several layers of data will provide the edge to fine tune this parameter at different layers thus soil databases with greater spatial detail may help to estimate the spatial variation in evapotranspiration across the landscape thus soil data bases with greater spatial detail could help map the spatial variation in evapotranspiration across the landscape the afsis soil database shows a clay dominated top layer having low hydraulic conductivity overall across the six layers afsis exhibited a comparably higher hydraulic conductivity ranging from 1 to 2 4 mm hr the hwsd soil with rather dominantly clay loam texture has on average 1 2 mm hr hydraulic conductivity for its two top layers which is translated into a lower baseflow contribution fig 3 much of the water is thus lost in evapotranspiration at a rate comparable to open water evaporation from the lake tana kebede et al 2006 3 4 comparison of simulated and remotely sensed et the spatial variation of et estimates from the various sources are shown in fig 6 simulated et is not often evaluated at landscape scale due to non availability of observed actual evapotranspiration data most of the available remote sensing et products are validated at varying success rates and could not replicate ground based observation to evaluate model simulated et products however evaluation of mod16 and alexi et products showed relatively good correlation with ground based measurements kim et al 2012 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 under different field conditions di et al 2015 mecikalski et al 1999 sun et al 2007 tang et al 2015 results indicated that for the wet season june october modeled et showed good agreement r2 0 5 with mod16 in about 74 percent of the lake subbasin area fig 5a during the dry season november may the correlation is poor over much of the land area fig 5b over the lake water surface the agreement is maximum r2 0 75 with swat grid and mod16 estimates of 120 mm and 145 mm for the wet season and 170 mm and 160 mm for the dry period respectively alexi et estimates are higher r2 0 5 over 60 percent of the lake subbasin area for both the wet and dry seasons fig 5c and d the results are consistent with previous study in the wider blue nile river basin jung et al 2017 the poor agreement observed in some portion of the landscape may be related to difference in the source data used in swat grid et simulation and generation of mod16 and alexi et for example yang et al 2013 argued inconsistency on the use of meteorological and albedo data would result in discrepancy in et estimation similarly there is a large disparity between the land cover data used for remote sensing based et estimation and the swat grid model majority of the disagreement between swat grid et and remote sensing et occurred on corn forest range and pasture land the land cover used in the remote sensing et classify much of the area as savannas and woody savanna swat grid et over lake tana showed very good agreement with mod16 et for the dry season and a modest agreement in the wet season perhaps the good agreement over the lake is related to absence of cloud cover over the lake during the dry season mod16 et estimates are derived using cloud free pixels meaning cloudy pixels are temporally filled mu et al 2011a moreover accurate land cover representation over the lake contributed for the agreement since alexis has no et estimate over the lake comparison was not made with the swat grid et fig 7 the swat et estimate is based on the penman monteith equation and hence its accuracy is dependent on the areal representativeness of the climatological data provided to the model similarly the mod16 is derived from an array of remotely sensed data e g land cover type leaf area index and albedo and non satellite data e g nasa s merra daily meteorological reanalysis data which are subject to uncertainties in their production under such circumstances a direct value comparison using for example a scatter plot mean range etc and summary statistics are preferred methods to test whether the mod16 et estimate shows similar characteristics as a whole to the set of simulated swat grid et bennett et al 2013 fig 8 presents a value comparison on the mean monthly et values using scatterplots on individual monthly mean value basis mod 16 underestimates et in the wet season may oct and over estimates et in the dry season nevertheless the seasonal variation of et is consistent for both mod 16 and swat grid on both watersheds mod16 consistently over estimate et with characteristically larger difference in the dry season mainly on november and december for both watersheds annual average ets shows good agreement for gumera watershed 44 8 mm for swat grid versus 44 1 mm for mod16 and a modest discrepancy for gilgel abay 45 3 mm for swat grid and 54 4 mm for mod16 4 conclusion this study used five soil data sets to explore whether the newly released afsis soil data provides a better representation of hydrological processes in comparison to previously released global local datasets results suggest that five of the soil datasets exhibit a varying level of performance in simulating the streamflow the afsis 250 m soil data is much superior to the fao s digital soil map of the world the best nse was found with simulations using the afsis soil nevertheless the improvements in streamflow simulation achieved using the most detailed afsis soil are only marginal the nse improvement was just 1 whereas the pbias has improved by about 21 in comparison to a model built using the mowr soil data the hydrological response of swat grid for calculated soil parameters is reported to be significant romanowicz et al 2005 the simulations with afsis soil dataset was comparable to the mowr soil dataset archived for the upper blue nile basin water resources master plan mowr 1998 the et and groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq simulated with the two datasets were similar the two datasets also simulated higher et for gumera watershed than gilgel abay watershed and vice versa for groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq the gilgel abay river generally has a sustained baseflow which supports the finding from this study the afsis soil database improves previously available global soil datasets and thereby enhances hydrologic modeling robustness to an extent that excels currently available soil dataset prepared for river basin studies this suggests that when detailed local soil dataset is not available the afsis soil dataset could be used to simulate hydrological variables with reasonable accuracy chaplot 2005a simulations with afsis data provided minor error in estimating the peak streamflow evaluation of the model performance during the wet season and dry season suggested that streamflow estimations were better during the wet season in most of the soils since most of streamflow generated during the wet season use of afsis soil may warrant better estimation of the streamflow for various uses e g irrigation moreover since the afsis soil has 250 m resolution and provides soil physical and chemical properties data for up to six layers it will be a valuable resource for simulating biophysical processes that require detailed soil information e g crop growth since simulations with afsis soil data replicated observed streamflows better remotely sensed mod16 et and alexi et were used to explore if the spatial variation of evapotranspiration process were identical although there were differences in the assumptions of the input data for modeled et and remotely sensed et estimations satisfactory agreement were found in most of the area between swat grid simulated et and mod16 et during the wet seasons while over the lake tana strong agreement was observed during the dry season this is because of the presence of clear sky during the dry season which affects accuracy of remotely sensed data mod16 et was better than alexi et in replicating swat simulated et this study concluded that afsis and while mod16 are of high resolution and more comparable to swat grid estimates alexi et are seasonally more consistent and comparable to swat estimates over wide land cover types rigorous evaluation of the dataset in varying landscapes and geographic regions is recommended before specific application authors contribution essayas ayana conceptualization methodology

8464,study region upper blue nile ethiopia study focus the recent availability of high resolution soil data offers a better representation of spatially varying hydrologic parameters and could help in building accurate models despite the release of the afsis 250 m resolution soil data in 2015 its benefits in improving streamflow prediction accuracy is yet to be evaluated the focus of this study is to evaluate the improvement in prediction accuracy of an uncalibrated hydrologic model built using the recently released afsis 250 m soil database in comparison to four other soil databases which are under use for the last decade new hydrological insights for the region limited streamflow data availability has been a major impediment to assessing water resources potential of watersheds recently the africa soil information service afsis provided 250 m resolution datasets with soil properties for up to six soil depth layers the objective of this study is to evaluate the flow prediction accuracy gains from the afsis 250 m if any in comparison to previously availed databases using un calibrated swat soil and water assessment tool hydrologic models the performance of the un calibrated models was evaluated using streamflow at two of the gauging stations evapotranspiration output from the respective models was also compared to remote sensing derived evapotranspiration estimates mod16 et and alexi only marginal improvements in streamflow simulation were achieved by using the most detailed afsis soil a satisfactory agreement was found in most of the area between swat simulated et and mod16 et during the wet seasons whereas alexi et products are seasonally more consistent and comparable to swat estimates over wide land cover types robust evaluation of these datasets in different landscapes and geographic regions is warranted before a specific application keywords afsis soil swat grid mod16 et alexi lake tana 1 introduction hydrological models are critical tools in assessing water resources potential of watersheds limited flow data availability is a major impediment in calibrating and validating hydrological models ungauged and or poorly gauged watersheds mainly rely on regional information transferred from gauged watersheds of similar characteristics bárdossy 2006 such approaches are doubtful stähli et al 2011 as they base on models calibrated to a glittering mathematical optimum that is too often associated with a hydrological optimum andréassian et al 2012 literature indicates that parameter uncertainty kuczera and mroczkowski 1998 non uniqueness of model parameters so called equifinality beven and freer 2001 and the parameters dependence on objective functions madsen 2003 renders parameters obtained through regionalization less reliable and unrealistic when used beyond the calibration period the partitioning of precipitation into the different water balance components is dependent on the soil database livneh et al 2015 porporato et al 2004 schaake et al 1996 yaseef et al 2010 soil moisture is one of these components crucial to accurately quantify streamflow koster et al 2010 along with moisture flux in the land

understanding of water balance components at the small scale a comparison study conducted over two adjacent watersheds in the lake basin under consideration indicated that the watershed characteristics could be uniquely defined and represented by a hydrologic model due to the differences in the soils worqlul et al 2018 robust data collection and interpolation techniques can be

2013 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm made available the 30 m resolution dem in september 2015 globally for example substantial improvement in the definition of drainage networks and stream

et al 2016 showed that soil type related crop yield variability generally outweighs variability in crop yield due to weather which is often considered the key factor in determining crop production wösten et al 1999 discussed that original data used to develop much of the existing 1 km soil data are usually fragmented do not cover the entire area under study show different degrees of detail have varying reliability and are held in different institutes scattered throughout the world recently the africa soil information service afsis provided 250 m and one kilometer resolution datasets to the existing soil database the afsis project compiled the africa soil profiles legacy database and afsis sentinel site database to generate a series of spatial predictions of soil properties using random forest algorithm the new database is reported to yield average decreases of 15 75 in root mean squared error rmse across soil properties soil organic carbon ph sand silt clay bulk density cation exchange capacity etc and depths hengl et al 2015 whether these improvements translate to the improvement in accuracy of hydrologic processes have never been evaluated high resolution soil data provides a higher number of hydrologic units in the watershed discretization process compared to a coarse resolution data despite computational requirement the challenge in data preparation model setup and calibration geza and mccray 2008 high resolution soil data can greatly enhance predicting water quantity and quality chaplot 2005a this study uses the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model arnold et al 2012 built for two relatively data rich watersheds gilgel abay and gumera in the blue nile basin of ethiopia to evaluate streamflow prediction accuracy improvement in using the 250 m resolution afsis soil data as compared to the previously used global and local soil data the swat modeled et are then compared to remote sensing derived et to explore the significance

development project called innovative laboratory for small scale irrigation ilssi 1 1 http ilssi tamu edu about was launched with an aim to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers in ethiopia ghana and tanzania through use of small scale irrigation approaches one approach to the project involves evaluation of water resources potential for small scale irrigation using biophysical models identification of the water resources is vital to scale up small scale irrigation in these countries customarily regionalization techniques are used to estimate the water resources potential in these regions due to unavailability of streamflow observations kim and kaluarachchi 2008 tekleab et al 2011 wale et al 2009 the present study was conducted in lake tana subbasin 12 00 n 37 15 e in ethiopia the lake basin has a drainage area of approximately 16 000 km2 fig 1 several hydrologic modeling studies were conducted in the lake tana subbasin alemayehu et al 2010 ayana et al 2015 chebud and melesse 2009 dessie et al 2015 dile and srinivasan 2014 kebede et al 2006 minale and rao 2011 rientjes et al 2011 setegn et al 2008 2009 wale et al 2009 worqlul et al 2015 the lake tana subbasin is a headwater to the blue nile basin where numerous water resources development activities are underway the lake tana region is dominated by tropical highland monsoon climate while most of the rain 70 90 occurs between june and september conway and schipper 2011 mohamed et al 2005 the major rivers flowing into the lake tana are the gilgel abay the rib the gumera and the megech figure gilgel abay has a catchment area of 5004 km2 of which 2025 km2 is gauged and gumera has 1893 km2 of which 1595 km2 is gauged these two watersheds are reported to have a longer period and more accurately recorded streamflow data than rib and megech dile and srinivasan 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 spatial data the spatial data used in setting up the hydrological models are topography land use and soil data in addition evapotranspiration estimates are also used foe spatial comparison of model et estimates 2 2 1 1 topography a 250 m srtm dem is used to delineate the watershed based on predefined streams and a 1 km by 1 km grid representing the subbasins the dem resolution is considered adequate due to the watershed discretization approach that we applied as outlined in subsequent sections 2 2 1 2 land use land

mowr 1998 2 2 1 3 soil the five soil databases are afsis 250 m hengl et al 2015 the digital soil map of the world dsmw fao r 2000 iuss working group w 2006 the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao i isric i et al 2009 hwsd with data gaps filled from fao s dsmw hereafter referred to as hwsd3 and the abay upper blue nile basin master plan study soil map mowr 1998 the afsis data includes grids of soil properties such as sand silt and clay fractions coarse fragments and organic carbon for up to six soil depth layers vågen et al 2010 soil information in the afsis database are used to generate detailed soil properties using the saxton and rawls 2006 pedo transfer function the afsis soil database is compiled from the africa soil profiles database and the afsis sentinel site database covering a temporal span of 1950 2012 the data is provided at a 250 m and 1 km spatial resolution leenaars et al 2014 the dsmw soil database is compiled from over 600 national soil maps and over 11 000 ancillary map reynolds et al 2000 sombroek 1990 it includes soil properties such as ph organic carbon content water storage capacity and other derived soil properties and it has base material from fao unesco soil map of the world at an original scale of 1 5 million provided at a 3 grid the hwsd is a 30 arc second raster database that combines regional and national updates of soil information worldwide with the information contained within the dsmw the hwsd data presents standardized soil parameters for top 0 to 30 cm and deeper soil profiles 30 to 100 cm the global distribution of the profile for the hwsd data is uneven and there are often gaps in the measured data the hwsd3 data is similar to the hwsd data where gaps are filled using the original fao s dsmw soil database the soil data in swat is used to represent the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil that govern the movement of water physical characteristics include maximum rooting depth maximum crack volume bulk density available water capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity texture percentage of clay silt and sand rock fragment content and soil albedo and erodibility factor these physical properties

2013 some of these studies are specific to the region alemayehu et al 2017 alemu et al 2014 bastiaanssen et al 2014 jung et al 2017 two evapotranspiration data sets are selected for comparison with the swat grid simulated evapotranspiration et at spatial scale modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer et mod16 data is provided by the modis global evapotranspiration project http www ntsg umt edu the 1 km land surface et data designated as mod16 is generated using mu et al 2011b algorithm using the penman montheith equation monteith 1965 the data for the year 2000 2014 is generated for the nile basin initiative project at 8 days monthly and annual intervals the second data set used in the spatial evaluation of et is atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi alexi uses thermal infrared tir remote sensing to estimate et at 5 10 km spatial resolution anderson et al 1997 is available daily since 2002 the data is aggregated to long term mean monthly et values the mod 16 product is selected due to the grid size similarity to our swat grid setup and also availability of et estimate over the lake the coarser alexi et estimates are selected to explore the comparability of estimates at aggregated level 2 2 2 hydro meteorological data daily rainfall and maximum minimum temperature observations from nine climatic stations in the lake tana basin fig 1 is provided by the ethiopian national meteorological services agency for the period of 1990 2015 the swat model weather data generator arnold et al 2012 was prepared using observed weather data at the bahir dar meteorological gauging station fig 1 to complete missing data in the rainfall and maximum minimum temperature and generate data for relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed the missing data ranges between 1 6 in maksegnit station to 19 0 in addiz zemen station dile and srinivasan 2014 streamflow data at the gilgel abay and gumera river gauging stations fig 1 are provided by ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity for the 1990 2007 time span 2 3 hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat model is applied to evaluate the five soil databases based on their streamflow prediction performance swat is a physically based model developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in watersheds with varying soil land use and management conditions neitsch et al 2011 swat has been applied to the highlands of ethiopia and demonstrated satisfactory results ayana et al 2015 betrie et al 2011 dile et al 2016 dile and srinivasan 2014 easton et al 2010 setegn et al 2008 2009 setegn et al 2010 customarily swat disaggregates a river basin into subbasins and hydrologic response units hrus hrus are lumped land areas within the subbasin comprised of unique land cover soil and management combinations such representation neither show the interaction between the hrus arnold et al 2010 nor is suitable to overlay model output for comparison with gridded land surface data products derived from satellite observations therefore we applied a grid based discretization scheme described in rathjens et al 2015 the grid based approach enhances the spatial representation of hydrologic and transport processes rathjens and oppelt 2012 swat grid model is setup for each soil database using predefined 1 km by 1 km grid and applied to a 250 m shuttle rader topographic mission srtm digital elevation model dem use of high resolution swat grid avoids potential loss of spatial information and may yield improved simulation results rathjens and oppelt 2012 in fact the use of smaller sub watersheds instead of grid cells may provide similar results but incorporating raster data e g dem into the sub watershed approach may require data transformation from a simple grid geometry to a patchy geometry of irregular polygons rathjens and oppelt 2012 as such a grid based approach facilitates integrating grid inputs e g dem or validation of model simulations using gridded biophysical parameters e g imagery derived et soil moisture biomass etc the 1 km2 predefined watersheds result in large number of subbasins and hence computationally demanding a dominant hru option was chosen in defining the hrus to increase the computational efficiency including land management practices that improves simulations of biophysical processes detailed land management practices similar to dile and srinivasan 2014 was implemented 2 4 model evaluation a swat grid model was simulated from 1998 to 2007 with an eight year warm up period to allow all hydrological stocks to balance from their initial state the performance of the models was evaluated at two of the gauging stations using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 exploiting the potential of our swat grid approach to overlay model output for comparison with gridded land surface data products we compared the spatial distribution of modeled et to remote sensing derived et the swat grid model enables the comparison of modeled et with remote sensing et the total monthly simulated et for the best performing soil data was compared to the total monthly et estimate of mod16 and alexi at grid level to assess any spatial similarity between the estimates the long term mean model et and remote sensing based et were evaluated by calculating a pixel level coefficient of determination 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of streamflow simulation evaluation of the streamflow simulation with different soil types fig 2 suggests that afsis soil provided better simulation fig 2a and fig a1 a b at a monthly time step afsis hwsd hwsd3 and mowr soils provided very good representation of streamflow simulation for gilgel abay watershed based on general performance ratings moriasi et al 2007 for example the rsr was between 0 00 and 0 50 nse was more than 0 75 and pbias was 10 fig 2 presents the simulated and observed mean monthly streamflow for the time period from 1998 to 2007 while for gumera watershed afsis and mowr soils resulted in very good representation of streamflow simulations with dsmw fig 2b provided unsatisfactory performance based on nse and pbias goodness of fit criteria for both watersheds table a2 perhaps the poor simulation performance for the dsmw is related to its coarser spatial resolution i e 5 5 km kumar and merwade 2009 reported that swat underestimates streamflow with coarser resolution input that could be appropriate for global scale studies fao r 2000 the mowr fig 2e soil data resulted in comparable nse but higher pbias of overestimation compared to simulations with the afsis data whereas the hwsd yields lower nse and marginally better or comparable pbias the hwsd3 has a lower nse but pbias substantially degraded especially for gumera watershed over estimating flow table 1a summarizes results of the goodness of fit evaluations for simulations with the different soils the simulation of the model using different soil datasets was evaluated during the wet june september and dry october may season table a3 the model performance was generally better during the wet season in all the soil datasets except dsmw soil database evaluation of the hydrographs suggested that simulations with afsis captured the pattern of observed streamflow for the gilgel abay and gumera watersheds fig 2 the best and dsmw the worst generally most of the simulations showed underestimations of the observed peak simulations with the afsis soil resulted in the least error 20 followed by simulations using the mowr soil 22 for the gilgel abay river gauging station the highest error 68 of simulating the peak streamflow for the gilgel abay river was found with the dsmw soil while in the gumera watershed generally high error was observed in simulating the peaks the hwsd3 soil data had the least error of peak streamflow simulation 46 and afsis and mowr each had an error of 54 the high error in simulating the peak flows in the gumera river may also be related to flooding problems around the river gauging station smec 2007 based on the goodness of fit evaluation guidelines and pattern of the hydrographs the mowr soil data provided the second best simulation after afsis table a2 3 2 water balance estimation evaluation of water balance components fig 3 showed dsmw and hwsd soils overestimate et both in comparison to satellite and climatological data based point et estimate at weather station locations evapotranspiration estimates by afsis hwsd3 and mowr are comparable the proportion of rainfall converted to surface runoff was comparable in model simulations with afsis and mowr for gilgel abay watershed surface runoff to rainfall ratio was respectively 44 and 42 for simulations with afsis and mowr while for gumera watershed the surface runoff to rainfall ratio was 38 and 36 for afsis and mowr soil respectively based on the simulations using afsis and mowr datasets a fifth of the streamflow in both watersheds was contributed by groundwater the dsmw and hwsd3 data estimated a negligible groundwater contribution for both watersheds the reliability of dsmw is questioned on previous studies in that the source maps widely varied in reliability scales and methodologies zöbler 1986 the spatial distribution of the soil moisture modeled using afsis hwsd and mowr soils is presented in fig 4 in both wet and dry seasons afsis model soil water estimates were comparably higher the largest disparity is in mean dry season soil moisture estimate afsis soil based model resulted in soil water estimate of 200 and 280 of the mowr and hwsd soil based models respectively wet season soil moisture from afsis soil based model was 68 higher than mowr soil based model and 225 of that of hwsd soil based model over croplands the afsis model exhibited less soil water spatial variation with 78 of the cropland having soil water ranging from 125 to 300 mm in spatial terms the northern and north western headwaters of the subbasin exhibited lower soil water for all soil database the water balance components for the two watersheds showed considerable difference such differences that arise from the soil representation approaches are generally difficult to balance out bossa et al 2012 nevertheless the water balance estimates with the afsis soil simulations were consistent with previous modeling practices for example the simulated average annual et for gilgel abay gummera watershed using the afsis soil was 540 mm 557 mm which is in agreement with the literature setegne et al 2008 and dile srinivasa 2014 setegn et al 2008 and dile and srinivasan 2014 estimated that the average annual et for gumera were 618 mm and 616 mm and wyld of 788 mm and 816 mm respectively similarly mamo and jain 2013 estimated average annual wyld of 35 52 m3 sec which is comparable to the 38 38 m3 sec simulated using afsis soil data 3 3 impact of soil representation on model performance and water balance the impact of soil spatial extent representation in a hydrologic model is well documented in the literature becker and braun 1999 dodd and lauenroth 1997 woods et al 1997 yeakley et al 1998 this is because most of the parameters that dictate the hydrologic process in swat grid are derived from the soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity relationships with soil water content moreover texture based pedo transfer functions saxton et al 1986 used in estimating the soil water characteristics introduces uncertainties this is because these functions are based on soil properties in the us and have proven difficult to assemble and apply over a broad range of soil types and moisture regimes saxton et al 1986 these functions are based on soil properties in the us and have proven difficult to assemble and apply over a broad range of soil types and moisture regimes saxton and rawls 2006 thus a certain level of uncertainty associated to these functions could potentially limit the benefits of using afsis soil data the hydrologic soil group are considerably different among the five soil datasets fig 5 and table a1 the soil hydrologic group d was found the most dominant in afsis 97 hwsd 79 hwsd3 84 and mowr 76 soil datasets only the dsmw soil dataset had a proportional spatial distribution of soil hydrologic group c and d which was 57 and 43 respectively in the other four soil datasets the proportion of soil hydrologic group c was less than 20 the high proportion of soil hydrologic group d in the afsis dataset represents high runoff potential because of very slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet the soil hydrologic group d consist significant amount of clay soils that have a high shrink swell potential high water table a clay layer at or near the surface and shallow over nearly impervious material these soils have a very slow rate of water transmission this could partly explain the better agreement in peak flows that the afsis soil exhibited compared to the other soil datasets afsis had 1645 distinct soil types for the study area in the broad textural classification the top layer 50 cm falls in to two categories clay and clay loam however characteristics pertinent to hydrologic processes e g coarse fragment bulk density available water content hydraulic conductivity vary considerably across the six layers which this leads to a varying partitioning fig 3 of the water balance components livneh et al 2015 the other soil datasets had much lower representation hwsd hwsd3 and mowr has 789 26 and 17 distinct soil types respectively dsmw being the coarsest resolution 5 5 km had only 6 distinct soil types afsis and hwsd soil datasets provided soil characteristics for six layers the ability of providing data at different layers makes model calibration robust since it allows modifying model parameters at different depth profile for example esco soil evaporation compensation factor is a sensitive parameter in swat which determines the soil evaporative demand having several layers of data will provide the edge to fine tune this parameter at different layers thus soil databases with greater spatial detail may help to estimate the spatial variation in evapotranspiration across the landscape thus soil data bases with greater spatial detail could help map the spatial variation in evapotranspiration across the landscape the afsis soil database shows a clay dominated top layer having low hydraulic conductivity overall across the six layers afsis exhibited a comparably higher hydraulic conductivity ranging from 1 to 2 4 mm hr the hwsd soil with rather dominantly clay loam texture has on average 1 2 mm hr hydraulic conductivity for its two top layers which is translated into a lower baseflow contribution fig 3 much of the water is thus lost in evapotranspiration at a rate comparable to open water evaporation from the lake tana kebede et al 2006 3 4 comparison of simulated and remotely sensed et the spatial variation of et estimates from the various sources are shown in fig 6 simulated et is not often evaluated at landscape scale due to non availability of observed actual evapotranspiration data most of the available remote sensing et products are validated at varying success rates and could not replicate ground based observation to evaluate model simulated et products however evaluation of mod16 and alexi et products showed relatively good correlation with ground based measurements kim et al 2012 ruhoff et al 2013 velpuri et al 2013 under different field conditions di et al 2015 mecikalski et al 1999 sun et al 2007 tang et al 2015 results indicated that for the wet season june october modeled et showed good agreement r2 0 5 with mod16 in about 74 percent of the lake subbasin area fig 5a during the dry season november may the correlation is poor over much of the land area fig 5b over the lake water surface the agreement is maximum r2 0 75 with swat grid and mod16 estimates of 120 mm and 145 mm for the wet season and 170 mm and 160 mm for the dry period respectively alexi et estimates are higher r2 0 5 over 60 percent of the lake subbasin area for both the wet and dry seasons fig 5c and d the results are consistent with previous study in the wider blue nile river basin jung et al 2017 the poor agreement observed in some portion of the landscape may be related to difference in the source data used in swat grid et simulation and generation of mod16 and alexi et for example yang et al 2013 argued inconsistency on the use of meteorological and albedo data would result in discrepancy in et estimation similarly there is a large disparity between the land cover data used for remote sensing based et estimation and the swat grid model majority of the disagreement between swat grid et and remote sensing et occurred on corn forest range and pasture land the land cover used in the remote sensing et classify much of the area as savannas and woody savanna swat grid et over lake tana showed very good agreement with mod16 et for the dry season and a modest agreement in the wet season perhaps the good agreement over the lake is related to absence of cloud cover over the lake during the dry season mod16 et estimates are derived using cloud free pixels meaning cloudy pixels are temporally filled mu et al 2011a moreover accurate land cover representation over the lake contributed for the agreement since alexis has no et estimate over the lake comparison was not made with the swat grid et fig 7 the swat et estimate is based on the penman monteith equation and hence its accuracy is dependent on the areal representativeness of the climatological data provided to the model similarly the mod16 is derived from an array of remotely sensed data e g land cover type leaf area index and albedo and non satellite data e g nasa s merra daily meteorological reanalysis data which are subject to uncertainties in their production under such circumstances a direct value comparison using for example a scatter plot mean range etc and summary statistics are preferred methods to test whether the mod16 et estimate shows similar characteristics as a whole to the set of simulated swat grid et bennett et al 2013 fig 8 presents a value comparison on the mean monthly et values using scatterplots on individual monthly mean value basis mod 16 underestimates et in the wet season may oct and over estimates et in the dry season nevertheless the seasonal variation of et is consistent for both mod 16 and swat grid on both watersheds mod16 consistently over estimate et with characteristically larger difference in the dry season mainly on november and december for both watersheds annual average ets shows good agreement for gumera watershed 44 8 mm for swat grid versus 44 1 mm for mod16 and a modest discrepancy for gilgel abay 45 3 mm for swat grid and 54 4 mm for mod16 4 conclusion this study used five soil data sets to explore whether the newly released afsis soil data provides a better representation of hydrological processes in comparison to previously released global local datasets results suggest that five of the soil datasets exhibit a varying level of performance in simulating the streamflow the afsis 250 m soil data is much superior to the fao s digital soil map of the world the best nse was found with simulations using the afsis soil nevertheless the improvements in streamflow simulation achieved using the most detailed afsis soil are only marginal the nse improvement was just 1 whereas the pbias has improved by about 21 in comparison to a model built using the mowr soil data the hydrological response of swat grid for calculated soil parameters is reported to be significant romanowicz et al 2005 the simulations with afsis soil dataset was comparable to the mowr soil dataset archived for the upper blue nile basin water resources master plan mowr 1998 the et and groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq simulated with the two datasets were similar the two datasets also simulated higher et for gumera watershed than gilgel abay watershed and vice versa for groundwater contribution to streamflow gwq the gilgel abay river generally has a sustained baseflow which supports the finding from this study the afsis soil database improves previously available global soil datasets and thereby enhances hydrologic modeling robustness to an extent that excels currently available soil dataset prepared for river basin studies this suggests that when detailed local soil dataset is not available the afsis soil dataset could be used to simulate hydrological variables with reasonable accuracy chaplot 2005a simulations with afsis data provided minor error in estimating the peak streamflow evaluation of the model performance during the wet season and dry season suggested that streamflow estimations were better during the wet season in most of the soils since most of streamflow generated during the wet season use of afsis soil may warrant better estimation of the streamflow for various uses e g irrigation moreover since the afsis soil has 250 m resolution and provides soil physical and chemical properties data for up to six layers it will be a valuable resource for simulating biophysical processes that require detailed soil information e g crop growth since simulations with afsis soil data replicated observed streamflows better remotely sensed mod16 et and alexi et were used to explore if the spatial variation of evapotranspiration process were identical although there were differences in the assumptions of the input data for modeled et and remotely sensed et estimations satisfactory agreement were found in most of the area between swat grid simulated et and mod16 et during the wet seasons while over the lake tana strong agreement was observed during the dry season this is because of the presence of clear sky during the dry season which affects accuracy of remotely sensed data mod16 et was better than alexi et in replicating swat simulated et this study concluded that afsis and while mod16 are of high resolution and more comparable to swat grid estimates alexi et are seasonally more consistent and comparable to swat estimates over wide land cover types rigorous evaluation of the dataset in varying landscapes and geographic regions is recommended before specific application authors contribution essayas ayana conceptualization methodology
