4400,vegetation is the most important component of terrestrial ecosystem reflecting the quality of ecological environment in this study non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope were applied to analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage precipitation temperature and drought during the period 1981 2015 in the yarlung zangbo river basin yzrb based on gimms ndvi3g chirpsv2 0 china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd and cru ts 4 03 scpdsi datasets the pearson correlation analysis and geostatistical methods were adopted to investigate the correlations between climatic variables and vegetation coverage as well as the time lag effects for different vegetation types the results showed that the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage is generally characterized as increasing from upper to lower reaches the northwestern region of lower reaches showed a greening trend in vegetation while degradation of vegetation was detected in southeastern region the vegetation in the upper and middle reaches was significantly positively correlated with precipitation and drought while a significantly negative correlation was detected between vegetation and temperature in the middle reaches and southeast region of the lower reaches as well as vegetation and precipitation in the lower reaches one month lag effect of precipitation and temperature on vegetation appeared in the upper reaches while no lag for precipitation and one month lag for temperature were detected in the middle reaches and both precipitation and temperature showed no lag effect on vegetation in southeast region of the lower reaches the vegetation types in the yzrb were mainly consisted of meadow alpine vegetation shrubs and grassland in which the growth of shrubs was relatively better than other vegetation types all the four vegetation types showed a slightly greening trend which were positively correlated with precipitation and drought while showed a negative correlation with temperature the findings help to better understand the mechanism of vegetation dynamics and provide references for ecosystem monitoring and assessment in the yzrb keywords vegetation coverage climatic variables spatiotemporal variabilities time lag effects yarlung zangbo river 1 introduction with the rapidly increasing demand for global water resources and the large scale deterioration of the ecological environment in the qinghai tibetan plateau changes and impact mechanisms in water conservation functions of ecosystems have attracted great attention zamani sabzi et al 2019 li et al 2020 luo et al 2020 vegetation as one of the most important components in the terrestrial ecosystem plays a fundamental role in regulating energy exchange carbon cycles and climate change as well as hydrological process through transpiration surface albedo and roughness bégué et al 2011 eekhout et al 2020 chen et al 2020a which is the evidence of biological responses to natural changes baldi et al 2008 swaffer et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 as such changes in vegetation activity are commonly considered as the indicators of global environmental changes at various spatiotemporal scales de jong et al 2011 chen et al 2014 2020a liu et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2020 and understanding the changes in vegetation coverage is a crucial reference for stakeholders e g natural resource managers policy makers and ecologists due to the projecting future vegetation growth trends climate change and ecosystem evolution neigh et al 2008 piao et al 2014 in the 1960s the advent of space remote sensing technology greatly improved the defects and difficulties of the traditional environmental monitoring technology can provide spatiotemporally explicit datasets li et al 2020 at the same time the emergence of weather radar satellite and reanalysis products can also provide situ data that is not subject to geographical restrictions and can be used to make up for the deficiency of ground observation liu et al 2018 zheng and jia 2020 at present large scale and high precision remote sensing datasets have become a powerful tool for the study on vegetation change guillevic et al 2002 huete et al 2002 white et al 2005 sims et al 2006 after a long period of practice the satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been proven to be a successful indicator for monitoring vegetation activities groten 2007 neigh et al 2008 piao et al 2014 huang et al 2020 long term ndvi datasets became available in the early 1980s and since then the response of vegetation activities to environmental change has garnered a considerable amount of attention bao et al 2014 generally the effects of climate change on vegetation activity are complicated due to the spatiotemporal variations of climate and eco environmental conditions among different regions hou et al 2015 drought is associated with hydroclimatic conditions and can inhibit vegetation growth reduce productivity and produce regional vegetation die off events chen et al 2020b which has a negative effect on agricultural activities yang et al 2020 demonstrated that the agricultural drought loss rate can be simulated in most agricultural areas of china and is strongly correlated with precipitation and temperature climatic variables have significant impacts on the changes of vegetation in different regions especially in arid and semi arid regions zhong et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 the yarlung zangbo river yzr is one of the highest rivers in the world and is the longest plateau river in china the basin is located in the alpine qinghai tibetan plateau which is an important area for global biodiversity and ecological landscape protection located in the alpine region with arid and semi arid climate which means that the ecohydrological functions of the yzrb are more sensitive to climate change and vegetation dynamics and the ecosystem is much more fragile at the same time based on the particularity of the qinghai tibetan plateau understanding its role in the global climate and environmental change has gained increasing scientific attention in light of global warming in the twenty first century cui and graf 2009 zhu et al 2016 previous studies show that the yzrb has been subjected to an array of natural environment changes such as local climate variability geological disasters and reduction of biodiversity li et al 2013 however most of the current researches are generally difficult to fully reflect the characteristics of long term changes in vegetation coverage due to short time series and poor data continuity and almost all the efforts focused exclusively on the exploration of the effects of climate change on total vegetation coverage at the basin or provincial scale for the same period ignoring the fact that the water and heat conditions influence not only the current but also the future vegetation dynamics peng et al 2021 by contrast the time lag effects of climatic change on vegetation especially for different vegetation types in alpine regions are rarely considered and little known which increases the uncertainty of the results to this end it is necessary to understand the long term change patterns of the vegetation activities in the yzrb and their responses to natural changes by continuous long term data series the present study was conducted to address the urgent need to analyze spatiotemporal variations in terrestrial vegetation activities and their responses to climatic change in the yzrb during the period 1981 2015 more specifically the aims of this study are 1 to investigate the long term interannual and seasonal variations of vegetation coverage by using the gimms ndvi datasets 2 to correspondingly analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation temperature and drought by using the chirpsv2 0 dataset china meteorological forcing dataset self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi dataset respectively and 3 to estimate the relationships between natural climatic variables temperature precipitation and drought and vegetation at pixel scale as well as explore the time lag effects and distinguish different vegetation types the findings of this study could help fill in gaps in our knowledge on the time lag effects of climatic change on vegetation in ecohydrologically sensitive alpine regions and serve as a fundamental reference for projecting vegetation growth trends environmental changes and ecosystem evolution in the yzrb which are necessary to comprehensively assess the ecological security of the yzrb 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river basin yzrb 82 00 97 07 e 28 00 31 16 n is located in the south of the qinghai tibetan plateau with an

long and basin area of 240 480 km2 yao et al 2010 li et al 2013 which plays an important role in the ecological protection of southwest china the yzrb is characterized as great difference in terrain with an elevation range of 133 7141 m which extends to the gangdisê mountains in the north and to the himalayas in the south the yzrb has five major tributaries which are rich in natural hydropower resources including the dogxung zangbo nianchu lhasa nyang and parlung zangbo rivers the basin is characterized as uneven spatiotemporal distribution of climatic variables the average annual precipitation over the basin is 428 7 mm liu et al 2018 reaching a maximum of more than 4 000 mm in the southeast region of the basin the annual average temperature of the basin is 5 92 li et al 2013 exceeding 30 for monthly average temperature in some parts of the southeast region in the basin the rainfall season occurs from june to september during the period of indian summer monsoon when the temperature is also higher than other months different climate types exist in the yzrb including alpine temperate semiarid plateau temperate semiarid and tropical and subtropical monsoon given the complex topography and climatic conditions the ecosystems in the yzrb are fragile and sensitive to climate change yang et al 2021 2 2 data description 2 2 1 ndvi dataset the third generation global inventory modeling and mapping studies ndvi gimms ndvi3g dataset from 1981 to 2015 was used in this study the data was derived from avhrr sensors at a spatial resolution of 8 km and half month intervals https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms which is famous for its high quality yang et al 2021 and has been carefully corrected to minimize various disadvantageous effects such as calibration loss orbital drift and volcanic eruptions which was verified by using stable desert control points de jong et al 2011 and to further reduce the effects of cloud cover scan angle and solar zenith angle monthly ndvi dataset was developed from the two ndvi images of each month by applying the maximum value composite method then the vegetation coverages in growing season may september and four seasons were calculated by averaging monthly ndvi during the period for each year gimms ndvi3g is currently considered as one of the best datasets available for analyzing long term variations of vegetation in addition previous study has shown that the applicability of this dataset in the qinghai tibet plateau is higher than other datasets beck and goetz 2012 it has shown to facilitate accurate investigation on real characteristics of changes in vegetation activities eisfelder et al 2012 bao et al 2014 2 2 2 climate datasets the analysis of variation in climatic variables across the study area is based on the precipitation temperature and drought covering the period 1981 2015 previous researches typically considered the on sited measured data to present the spatiotemporal variation of climate which reduce the representativeness of the spatial heterogeneity in this study the precipitation data is obtained from the chirpsv2 0 dataset https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 which is developed by the climate hazards group of california the chirpsv2 0 dataset covers the period 1981 near present with various temporal daily monthly and spatial 0 05 0 25 resolutions at the global scale the temperature data is collected by china meteorological forcing dataset http westdc westgis ac cn a set of meteorological reanalysis data produced by combing remote sensing and radar grid data with on site measured data which has 3 hours daily monthly and annual temporal intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 1 from 1981 to 2018 across china in addition the scpdsi data is obtained from the climatic research unit ts 4 03 https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought with globally 0 5 spatial resolution during the period 1901 near present these climate datasets have relatively high accuracy and some studies have also confirmed the reliability of chirpsv2 0 ban et al 2020 cmfd sun et al 2016b yang et al 2021 and scpdsi datasets niu et al 2020 in alpine regions they have been widely utilized by climatic and bio geophysical scientists to study changes in climate chen et al 2011 land surface and energy and to evaluate the mechanics of changes in vegetation activities shen et al 2015 temperature precipitation and drought were taken as the climatic indicators in this study to maintain consistency with the temporal and spatial resolution of the gimms ndvi3g dataset the monthly average temperature scpdsi and cumulative precipitation datasets were resampled to 8 km spatial resolution and calculated the mean temperature mean drought severity and accumulated precipitation in the growing season respectively the above data processes were accomplished by the code of python scripts in the arcgis environment 2 2 3 other datasets the maps of administrative boundary vegetation type and digital elevation model dem were provided by the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the administrative boundaries of seven cities regions in the yzrb were extracted from china municipal administrative zoning map in 2015 the map of vegetation type with 1 km spatial resolution was obtained from the digitized 1 1000000 vegetation map of china which was released in 2001 including eight main vegetation type groups across the study area the 90 m dem data was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which had the advantages of free access and high accuracy 3 methodology 3 1 maximum value composites maximum value composites mvc is a method to obtain low time resolution data through synthesis it is commonly used in current researches especially for vegetation growth the mvc method can reduce the interferences of cloud cover atmosphere and solar attitude angle so as to obtain more accurate values the expression is as follows 1 ndv i i m a x n d v i i j in which ndv i i means the ndvi value of month i ndv i i j is the ndvi value of period j in month i 3 2 mann kendall trend test and sen s slope in order to detect the temporal trends of vegetation and climatic variables for a long term and their corresponding significance the non parametric sen s slope and mann kendall trend test mk were applied in this study developed by mann mann 1945 and kendall kendall 1990 the mk trend test is one method to measure the significance of trends in a time series of samples which is recommended by world meteorological organization wmo for the trend significance test in climatology studies and is gradually used in the trend detection of hydrological variables due to its low sensitivity to the outliers no requirements for the samples to conform a certain distribution and allowance for the existence of missing values the sen s slope is another non parametric method allows missing values and has no requirements for data to conform a certain distribution the trend steepness is measured by the median of slope qmed sen 1968 it is usually applied to quantify the true slope of mk trend test da silva et al 2015 joshi et al 2016 in this study the sen s slope was used to measure the slope magnitude and the mk trend test was applied to determine the significance at different levels the results were calculated by matlab code and the formulas are listed in table 1 3 3 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is a commonly used analysis method in statistics at present pearson correlation coefficient can effectively express the degree and direction of correlation and reflect the relationships between different elements pearson 1920 in this study partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the precipitation temperature and drought the correlation coefficients of monthly data were used to detect the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation the calculation equations 2 and 3 of the pearson correlation analysis are as follows 2 r i 1 i n x i x y i y i 1 i n x i x 2 i 1 i n y i y 2 i 1 2 3 n 3 r 12 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 in which r is the correlation coefficient of two elements x and y are the average values of the two elements in the time series n is the number of years or months r 12 3 is the correlation coefficient of the first and second elements when the third element is controlled r 12 r 13 and r 23 are the correlation coefficients of the corresponding two elements respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage in the yzrb 4 1 1 changes in vegetation coverage at basin scale according to the results of related researches wei et al 2020 xiong et al 2020 may to september of each year was set as the vegetation growing season for the yzrb the maximum value composites method was used to generate monthly vegetation coverage based on half month ndvi images to reduce noise in the data the interannual variations of average growing season and seasonal vegetation coverage at the entire yzrb scale are illustrated in fig 2 the vegetation coverage in growing season was distributed in the range of 0 32 0 38 with an increasing trend before 2000 and began to decrease after 2000 which was close to that in summer june august followed by that in autumn september november from 0 28 to 0 32 there was not much difference between the values of vegetation coverage in spring march may and winter december february in the following year which was ranged from 0 20 to 0 24 4 1 2 changes in vegetation coverage at pixel scale the spatial distributions of multi year mean values of vegetation coverage for the growing season and four seasons as well as their trend were detected by the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope thus the results were shown in fig 3 the vegetation coverage values were divided into five grades with an interval of 0 2 corresponding to five different levels the larger the value the better the vegetation condition the vegetation distribution in the yzrb has obvious spatial heterogeneity and seasonal differences overall the vegetation in the basin tended to be greener gradually from west to east and reached the maximum value in medog county in the southeast the area with low vegetation coverage in the growing season values less than 0 2 accounted for 30 26 of the basin which was mainly distributed in the regions covered by grassland meadow and alpine vegetation in the upper and middle reaches of the yzr as well as glaciers and permanent snow in the headwater and northeast of the basin the medium and low vegetation coverage area in the growing season values between 0 2 and 0 4 was distributed in the whole basin especially for the middle reaches accounting for 38 84 of the basin while the moderate vegetation coverage values between 0 4 and 0 6 in the growing season existed in the grassland and unused land in the middle and lower reaches of the yzr accounting for 21 72 of the total area in the eastern and southeastern regions of the basin the vegetation coverage in the growing season was generally better than that in other regions 5 23 of the vegetation coverage in the whole basin was between 0 6 and 0 8 and of which 3 95 was above 0 8 shrubs coniferous and broadleaf forest were widely distributed in these regions compared with the spatial distributions of vegetation coverage in growing season and four seasons the vegetation in summer was closer and the value was a little higher than that in growing season while that in autumn was generally slightly lower than summer with the vegetation coverage mainly between 0 0 and 0 4 more than 50 of the total areas in spring and winter were covered by low vegetation coverage despite all this the vegetation coverage of the broadleaf forest areas in medog county in the southeast of the basin always maintain above 0 8 showing a relatively good vegetation growth state according to the spatial distributions of annual trend in vegetation coverage for growing season only 32 03 of the pixels passed the significance level test of α 0 05 the vegetation coverage changes in the yzrb revealed that 15 97 of the total areas in the upper and middle reaches had a relatively stable vegetation state with the annual increment ranged from 0 001 to 0 001 both the greening and browning trend were mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches 6 11 of the pixels with the high vegetation coverages showed a significant browning trend 9 91 of the areas became greener during the period 1981 2015 for the four seasons the spatial distributions of vegetation coverage change in summer were similar to that in growing season whereas with relatively smaller areas passed the significance test in the other seasons the areas with stable vegetation were larger than growing season and summer in general the areas with vegetation coverage less than 0 4 showed a good consistency with the areas where vegetation coverage remained stable for some specific areas the broadleaf forests in the medog county in the southeastern region of the basin remained stable in spring and autumn while presented a trend of degradation in growing season summer and winter 4 2 spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables in the yzrb 4 2 1 changes in climatic variables at basin scale the average algorithm was used to calculate average temperature and drought index while the summation algorithm was used for the calculation of total precipitation in the growing season to investigate the spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables from 1981 to 2015 fig 4 the average temperature and precipitation of the basin in the growing season showed an overall upward trend from 1981 to 2015 and both presented a turning point around 2000 before the turning point the average temperature fluctuated in the range of 6 0 5 and then showed an upward trend the average precipitation before 2000 was significantly lower than that after 2000 and the precipitation in the growing season shows a downward trend after 2000 considering the drought conditions the values of scpdsi below 0 indicate different degrees of drought conversely values greater than 0 present different degrees of wetness the larger the value the wetter the area table 2 the annual values of the scpdsi in the growing season at the basin scale during the period 1981 2015 were generally between 1 and 1 which was correspond to the normal state it tended to be dry during the period 1981 1985 then showed the trend of humidification from 1986 to 2000 and became aridity after 2000 which was generally consistent with the variabilities of precipitation in the basin 4 2 2 changes in climatic variables at pixel scale fig 5 illustrates the spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables at pixel scale the multi year average temperature across the yzrb was in the range of 9 19 28 52 which was mainly below 10 in the growing season the total precipitation in the growing season was mainly below 800 mm except for the southeastern region the western part was relatively wetter than the eastern region in the southeast of the basin the slight drought could be detected referring to the spatial distribution of multi year average scpdsi the maximum values of the average temperature and total precipitation in the growing season were 28 52 and 3228 0 mm respectively appeared in the medog county of the southeastern region furthermore the slopes of changing trend in climatic variables during the period 1981 2015 showed that a significantly upward trend at the significance level of α 0 05 except for the decreasing scpdsi in the headwater region of the basin the temperature in the upper reaches increased faster than that in other regions with a maximum increment of 0 18 yr and a relatively high variability of temperature appeared in the western part of nyingchi city in the lower reaches for precipitation only some areas in the middle reaches passed the significance test and showed a significantly increasing trend with the maximum increment of 12 24 mm yr in addition the headwater region showed a trend of aridification while the middle reaches presented a humid trend 4 2 3 relationships among climatic variables in the yzrb considering the spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation temperature and drought fig 5 as well as the partial correlation coefficients of drought with temperature and precipitation fig 6 across the basin the significantly positive correlation was detected in the relationship between drought and precipitation in which more than 65 65 of the basin area showed the correlation coefficient higher than 0 5 at the significance level of 0 01 while the partial correlation coefficient between drought and temperature was mainly distributed on the range of 0 3 0 3 and failed to pass the 0 1 significance test the partial correlation coefficients between drought and temperature precipitation in the basin showed obvious spatial heterogeneity from the upper to lower reaches the drought was mainly controlled by temperature with a significant negative effect in the headwater region the significant positive correlation between drought and precipitation in the middle reaches was particularly obvious while a gentle positive correlation was distributed in the lower reaches whereas little significant relationship between drought and temperature existed in the middle and lower reaches 4 3 impacts of climatic variables on vegetation coverage in the yzrb 4 3 1 correlation analysis between climatic variables and vegetation coverage the correlation coefficients and the p values between vegetation coverage and precipitation temperature drought across the yzrb were exhibited in fig 7 which indicated that the climatic variables had significant influences on the variations of vegetation coverage in growing season across the basin with large spatial heterogeneities as for the correlation between vegetation coverage and precipitation fig 7a 61 88 of the basin showed positive correlation coefficients in which 28 51 of the total area passed the 0 1 significance test mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches only 3 16 of the basin area scattered in the lower reaches showed a significant negative correlation between vegetation coverage and precipitation in terms of the relationship between vegetation coverage and temperature fig 7b 46 27 of the total basin areas were negatively correlated in which 21 93 of the total basin area showed significant negative correlation mainly distributed in the middle reaches and the southeastern region of the basin the areas with significant positive correlation between vegetation coverage and temperature also accounted for 40 77 of the total basin area and mainly located in the headwater region and western region of the lower reaches as for the correlation between vegetation coverage and drought more than 65 96 of the basin area exhibited positive correlation in which 30 15 of the basin area in the middle reaches passed the significance test whereas only 2 40 of the whole basin showed a significant negative correlation between vegetation coverage and drought fig 7c affected by the warm and humid airflow from the indian ocean the more precipitation the more humid and then the better the vegetation coverage in the basin the increase of temperature was disadvantageous to the growth of vegetation to a certain extent in the middle reaches of the basin under the barrier effects of the mountains the vegetation coverage in the southeastern region of the lower reaches showed unique characteristics the vegetation coverage presented a gentle negative correlation with temperature and precipitation while showed a slight positive correlation with drought future climate change patterns and their influence on ecosystems in the yzrb have received a great deal of concerns liu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 especially for the global warming and humidification climate which has great impacts on the variations of vegetation 4 3 2 time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage the previous studies in the yzrb mainly focused on the impacts of climatic variables on vegetation during the same period however the growth of vegetation is a long term and slow accumulation process the changes of climate will not quickly cause the changes of vegetation to a great degree investigating the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation is meaningful for current studies the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage at basin scale were firstly investigated at time lags of 0 3 months respectively fig 8 the best correlations of vegetation coverage in response to both temperature and precipitation were one month lag with correlation coefficients of 0 87 for temperature and 0 83 for precipitation respectively which were about 0 1 higher than that when the time lag effect was not considered the spatial distributions of time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage were also investigated across the yzrb as shown in fig 9 the vegetation in the upper and middle reaches which accounted for 45 83 of the whole basin showed the greatest correlation with temperature in one month lag the regions with no lag effect of temperature on vegetation coverage accounted for 22 45 of total basin area the vegetation coverage was mainly related to the temperature of the corresponding month showing a weak negative correlation in the tropical rain forest area covered by broadleaf forest of the southeastern region in the coniferous forest and shrubs regions at the junction of broadleaf forest to grassland which are located in the lower reaches the time lags of 2 or 3 months mainly occurred in response of vegetation to temperature as for the response of vegetation coverage to precipitation the upstream region was dominated by one month lag while the middle and downstream regions mainly showed no lag effect except for the same coniferous forest and shrubs regions in the downstream with 2 3 months lag similar to the result obtained by the response of vegetation to temperature at basin scale the time lags of precipitation to vegetation were mainly consisted of one month and no time lag accounting for 38 23 and 31 66 of the total basin area respectively while 2 and 3 months lags only occupied 5 53 of the total basin area the areas covered by glaciers and permanent snow accounted for 26 19 of total basin area were not considered in the time lag effect analysis in this study 5 discussion 5 1 responses of vegetation to climatic variables for different vegetation types the yarlung zangbo river is one of the rivers with the highest altitude in the world and the longest plateau river in china the relationship and time lag effects between climatic variables and vegetation coverage in the yzrb were investigated in detail which are very important for well understanding the ecohydrological processes in alpine regions the greening trend across the yzrb was detected in this study and the result showed that the vegetation coverage in the growing season increased at the rate of 3 7 10 4 yr at basin scale was consistent with the results had been reported by many previous studies cong et al 2013 xu et al 2014 hou et al 2015 yang et al 2015 however the previous study has implied that hydrological sensitivity was much diverse among vegetation types chen et al 2020a how do the different vegetation types response to climatic variables to further discuss the different responses the vegetation in the yzrb was grouped into 8 types referring to the digitized 1 1000000 vegetation map of china fig 10 a coniferous forest 6 75 broadleaf forest 3 29 shrubs 16 57 grassland 14 20 meadow 29 27 alpine vegetation 21 99 cultivated vegetation 2 70 and others 5 23 four major vegetation types meadow alpine vegetation shrubs and grassland which accounted for more than 10 of the basin area respectively were considered in this study after manually deleting some outliers the frequency distribution histogram of vegetation coverage fig 10b and the violin plots of the changing trend in vegetation fig 10c for four vegetation types in the growing season were analyzed the results demonstrate that the growth of shrubs is relatively better than other vegetation types and the vegetation coverage fall in the range of 0 0 8 which is mainly concentrated on the range of 0 2 0 6 the vegetation coverage of shrubs is relatively even and the change is positive in most areas while there are also some areas with the degrading trend in contrast the vegetation coverage of meadows alpine vegetation and grassland are mainly between 0 and 0 6 in which most of the peak is around 0 2 showing a greening trend the slopes of vegetation change in meadow and grassland are slightly lower than alpine vegetation the above obtained results are generally consistent with the study on alpine vegetation in the qinghai tibet plateau xu et al 2014 however cui and graf 2009 found that grassland on the qinghai tibet plateau was degrading the reasons for the different results are referred that linear trends in time series with low values are difficult to pass the significance level due to potential noise especially for the sparsely vegetated regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau xu et al 2014 furthermore the degradation was mainly observed in the headwater areas of the yangtze and yellow rivers cui and graf 2009 where do not belong to the study area in this study and a local or small scale phenomenon could not be investigated by gimms ndvi3g dataset because of the limitation of spatial resolution 64 km2 per pixel 5 2 correlations between climatic variables and vegetation for different vegetation types the violin plots of correlation coefficients between vegetation and precipitation temperature drought for four vegetation types in the growing season across the yzrb are shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficients of vegetation with precipitation and drought for four vegetation types are mainly positive and the grassland is more relevant than meadow and alpine vegetation that is greater than shrubs considering the relationship between vegetation and temperature other three vegetation types are mainly negative correlation except for alpine vegetation compared the results with the studies at global scale chen et al 2020a in china xu et al 2014 the qinghai tibet plateau sun et al 2016a the mongolian plateau bao et al 2014 the qilian mountains yang et al 2021 the yarlung zangbo river basin sun et al 2019 the american alaska pastick et al 2019 and the european alps filippa et al 2019 both similarities and differences exist among the current and previous studies all the studies show a greening trend at the regional or basin scale for recent several decades in most areas of china the changes of vegetation were significantly positively correlated with temperature and not associated with precipitation xu et al 2014 cong et al 2013 found that vegetation is more significantly affected by temperature than precipitation especially for the growing season in china sun et al 2016a found that the structure and function of alpine grassland ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau were largely shaped by temperature bao et al 2014 got the conclusion that precipitation in the growing season was a key factor controlling vegetation dynamics in the mongolian plateau furthermore warming temperature promoted incremental greening with the elevation below 1500 m and the snow prevented the vegetation development in alpine regions across the alps filippa et al 2019 pastick et al 2019 found that warming permafrost landscapes in the alaska showed significantly browning trend because of the evaporative demand and surface waters gains in this study the obviously spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between vegetation and climate was presented from upstream to downstream and the temperature mainly inhibited the vegetation growth given that the particularity of the yzrb as a typical alpine basin the relationships between vegetation coverage and climatic variables are complex the correlation between vegetation coverage and temperature in the basin is attributed to vary with aridity that the positive correlation exists in the arid region while the negative correlation is detected in the semi arid region reflecting different effects of snow melting processes on vegetation growth sun et al 2019 meanwhile the significant positive correlation between vegetation and precipitation can be explained by the limited precipitation due to the continental plateau climate and the barrier effect of the mountains sang et al 2016 the differences in the conclusions of the above mentioned studies may due to the different study periods and data sources as well as the study areas where may be influenced by the barriers of mountains and the monsoon 5 3 limitation the yzrb is monitored by only a small number of meteorological and hydrological gauging stations mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches due to complex terrain and difficulty in data acquisition in the depopulated zone of the upstream reaches which is a typical ungauged basin the precisions of remote sensing datasets were firstly assessed before using by comparing the applicability of temperature precipitation and drought which were derived from these datasets across the yzrb in previous studies to ensure the accuracy of calculation and results despite all that there was still inevitable uncertainty in our application of remote sensing datasets furthermore the plant phenology characteristics were barely considered in this study which may lead to ignore the differences between all types of vegetation in the selection and analysis of the growing season therefore more comprehensive and specific research could be conducted based on this study in the next step 6 conclusions in this study non parametric trend test methods sen s slope and mann kendall trend tests were firstly applied to analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage

ecological environment in the qinghai tibetan plateau changes and impact mechanisms in water conservation functions of ecosystems have attracted great attention zamani sabzi et al 2019 li et al 2020 luo et al 2020 vegetation as one of the most important components in the terrestrial ecosystem plays a fundamental role in regulating energy exchange carbon cycles and climate change as well as hydrological process through transpiration surface albedo and roughness bégué et al 2011 eekhout et al 2020 chen et al 2020a which is the evidence of biological responses to natural changes baldi et al 2008 swaffer et al 2019 cheng et al 2020 as such changes in vegetation activity are commonly considered as the indicators of global environmental changes at various spatiotemporal scales de jong et al 2011 chen et al 2014 2020a liu et al 2019 2020 huang et al 2020 and understanding the changes in vegetation coverage is a crucial reference for stakeholders e g natural resource managers policy makers and ecologists due to the projecting future vegetation growth trends climate change and ecosystem evolution neigh et al 2008 piao et al 2014 in the 1960s the advent of space remote sensing technology greatly improved the defects and difficulties of the traditional environmental monitoring technology can provide spatiotemporally explicit datasets li et al 2020 at the same time the emergence of weather radar satellite and reanalysis products can also provide situ data that is not subject to geographical restrictions and can be used to make up for the deficiency of ground observation liu et al 2018 zheng and jia 2020 at present large scale and high precision remote sensing datasets have become a powerful tool for the study on vegetation change guillevic et al 2002 huete et al 2002 white et al 2005 sims et al 2006 after a long period of practice the satellite based normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been proven to be a successful indicator for monitoring vegetation activities groten 2007 neigh et al 2008 piao et al 2014 huang et al 2020 long term ndvi datasets became available in the early 1980s and since then the response of vegetation activities to environmental change has garnered a considerable amount of attention bao et al 2014 generally the effects of climate change on vegetation activity are complicated due to the spatiotemporal variations of climate and eco environmental conditions among different regions hou et al 2015 drought is associated with hydroclimatic conditions and can inhibit vegetation growth reduce productivity and produce regional vegetation die off events chen et al 2020b which has a negative effect on agricultural activities yang et al 2020 demonstrated that the agricultural drought loss rate can be simulated in most agricultural areas of china and is strongly correlated with precipitation and temperature climatic variables have significant impacts on the changes of vegetation in different regions especially in arid and semi arid regions zhong et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 the yarlung zangbo river yzr is one of the highest rivers in the world and is the longest plateau river in china the basin is located in the alpine qinghai tibetan plateau which is an important area for global biodiversity and ecological landscape protection located in the alpine region with arid and semi arid climate which means that the ecohydrological functions of the yzrb are more sensitive to climate change and vegetation dynamics and the ecosystem is much more fragile at the same time based on the particularity of the qinghai tibetan plateau understanding its role in the global climate and environmental change has gained increasing scientific attention in light of global warming in the twenty first century cui and graf 2009 zhu et al 2016 previous studies show that the yzrb has been subjected to an array of natural environment changes such as local climate variability geological disasters and reduction of biodiversity li et al 2013 however most of the current researches are generally difficult to fully reflect the characteristics of long term changes in vegetation coverage due to short time series and poor data continuity and almost all the efforts focused exclusively on the exploration of the effects of climate change on total vegetation coverage at the basin or provincial scale for the same period ignoring the fact that the water and heat conditions influence not only the current but also the future vegetation dynamics peng et al 2021 by contrast the time lag effects of climatic change on vegetation especially for different vegetation types in alpine regions are rarely considered and little known which increases the uncertainty of the results to this end it is necessary to understand the long term change patterns of the vegetation activities in the yzrb and their responses to natural changes by continuous long term data series the present study was conducted to address the urgent need to analyze spatiotemporal variations in terrestrial vegetation activities and their responses to climatic change in the yzrb during the period 1981 2015 more specifically the aims of this study are 1 to investigate the long term interannual and seasonal variations of vegetation coverage by using the gimms ndvi datasets 2 to correspondingly analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation temperature and drought by using the chirpsv2 0 dataset china meteorological forcing dataset self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi dataset respectively and 3 to estimate the relationships between natural climatic variables temperature precipitation and drought and vegetation at pixel scale as well as explore the time lag effects and distinguish different vegetation types the findings of this study could help fill in gaps in our knowledge on the time lag effects of climatic change on vegetation in ecohydrologically sensitive alpine regions and serve as a fundamental reference for projecting vegetation growth trends environmental changes and ecosystem evolution in the yzrb which are necessary to comprehensively assess the ecological security of the yzrb 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yarlung zangbo river basin yzrb 82 00 97 07 e 28 00 31 16 n is located in the south of the qinghai tibetan plateau with an

long and basin area of 240 480 km2 yao et al 2010 li et al 2013 which plays an important role in the ecological protection of southwest china the yzrb is characterized as great difference in terrain with an elevation range of 133 7141 m which extends to the gangdisê mountains in the north and to the himalayas in the south the yzrb has five major tributaries which are rich in natural hydropower resources including the dogxung zangbo nianchu lhasa nyang and parlung zangbo rivers the basin is characterized as uneven spatiotemporal distribution of climatic variables the average annual precipitation over the basin is 428 7 mm liu et al 2018 reaching a maximum of more than 4 000 mm in the southeast region of the basin the annual average temperature of the basin is 5 92 li et al 2013 exceeding 30 for monthly average temperature in some parts of the southeast region in the basin the rainfall season occurs from june to september during the period of indian summer monsoon when the temperature is also higher than other months different climate types exist in the yzrb including alpine temperate semiarid plateau temperate semiarid and tropical and subtropical monsoon given the complex topography and climatic conditions the ecosystems in the yzrb are fragile and sensitive to climate change yang et al 2021 2 2 data description 2 2 1 ndvi dataset the third generation global inventory modeling and mapping studies ndvi gimms ndvi3g dataset from 1981 to 2015 was used in this study the data was derived from avhrr sensors at a spatial resolution of 8 km and half month intervals https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms which is famous for its high quality yang et al 2021 and has been carefully corrected to minimize various disadvantageous effects such as calibration loss orbital drift and volcanic eruptions which was verified by using stable desert control points de jong et al 2011 and to further reduce the effects of cloud cover scan angle and solar zenith angle monthly ndvi dataset was developed from the two ndvi images of each month by applying the maximum value composite method then the vegetation coverages in growing season may september and four seasons were calculated by averaging monthly ndvi during the period for each year gimms ndvi3g is currently considered as one of the best datasets available for analyzing long term variations of vegetation in addition previous study has shown that the applicability of this dataset in the qinghai tibet plateau is higher than other datasets beck and goetz 2012 it has shown to facilitate accurate investigation on real characteristics of changes in vegetation activities eisfelder et al 2012 bao et al 2014 2 2 2 climate datasets the analysis of variation in climatic variables across the study area is based on the precipitation temperature and drought covering the period 1981 2015 previous researches typically considered the on sited measured data to present the spatiotemporal variation of climate which reduce the representativeness of the spatial heterogeneity in this study the precipitation data is obtained from the chirpsv2 0 dataset https data chc ucsb edu products chirps 2 0 which is developed by the climate hazards group of california the chirpsv2 0 dataset covers the period 1981 near present with various temporal daily monthly and spatial 0 05 0 25 resolutions at the global scale the temperature data is collected by china meteorological forcing dataset http westdc westgis ac cn a set of meteorological reanalysis data produced by combing remote sensing and radar grid data with on site measured data which has 3 hours daily monthly and annual temporal intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 1 from 1981 to 2018 across china in addition the scpdsi data is obtained from the climatic research unit ts 4 03 https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought with globally 0 5 spatial resolution during the period 1901 near present these climate datasets have relatively high accuracy and some studies have also confirmed the reliability of chirpsv2 0 ban et al 2020 cmfd sun et al 2016b yang et al 2021 and scpdsi datasets niu et al 2020 in alpine regions they have been widely utilized by climatic and bio geophysical scientists to study changes in climate chen et al 2011 land surface and energy and to evaluate the mechanics of changes in vegetation activities shen et al 2015 temperature precipitation and drought were taken as the climatic indicators in this study to maintain consistency with the temporal and spatial resolution of the gimms ndvi3g dataset the monthly average temperature scpdsi and cumulative precipitation datasets were resampled to 8 km spatial resolution and calculated the mean temperature mean drought severity and accumulated precipitation in the growing season respectively the above data processes were accomplished by the code of python scripts in the arcgis environment 2 2 3 other datasets the maps of administrative boundary vegetation type and digital elevation model dem were provided by the resource and environmental science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn the administrative boundaries of seven cities regions in the yzrb were extracted from china municipal administrative zoning map in 2015 the map of vegetation type with 1 km spatial resolution was obtained from the digitized 1 1000000 vegetation map of china which was released in 2001 including eight main vegetation type groups across the study area the 90 m dem data was derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which had the advantages of free access and high accuracy 3 methodology 3 1 maximum value composites maximum value composites mvc is a method to obtain low time resolution data through synthesis it is commonly used in current researches especially for vegetation growth the mvc method can reduce the interferences of cloud cover atmosphere and solar attitude angle so as to obtain more accurate values the expression is as follows 1 ndv i i m a x n d v i i j in which ndv i i means the ndvi value of month i ndv i i j is the ndvi value of period j in month i 3 2 mann kendall trend test and sen s slope in order to detect the temporal trends of vegetation and climatic variables for a long term and their corresponding significance the non parametric sen s slope and mann kendall trend test mk were applied in this study developed by mann mann 1945 and kendall kendall 1990 the mk trend test is one method to measure the significance of trends in a time series of samples which is recommended by world meteorological organization wmo for the trend significance test in climatology studies and is gradually used in the trend detection of hydrological variables due to its low sensitivity to the outliers no requirements for the samples to conform a certain distribution and allowance for the existence of missing values the sen s slope is another non parametric method allows missing values and has no requirements for data to conform a certain distribution the trend steepness is measured by the median of slope qmed sen 1968 it is usually applied to quantify the true slope of mk trend test da silva et al 2015 joshi et al 2016 in this study the sen s slope was used to measure the slope magnitude and the mk trend test was applied to determine the significance at different levels the results were calculated by matlab code and the formulas are listed in table 1 3 3 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is a commonly used analysis method in statistics at present pearson correlation coefficient can effectively express the degree and direction of correlation and reflect the relationships between different elements pearson 1920 in this study partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the precipitation temperature and drought the correlation coefficients of monthly data were used to detect the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation the calculation equations 2 and 3 of the pearson correlation analysis are as follows 2 r i 1 i n x i x y i y i 1 i n x i x 2 i 1 i n y i y 2 i 1 2 3 n 3 r 12 3 r 12 r 13 r 23 1 r 13 2 1 r 23 2 in which r is the correlation coefficient of two elements x and y are the average values of the two elements in the time series n is the number of years or months r 12 3 is the correlation coefficient of the first and second elements when the third element is controlled r 12 r 13 and r 23 are the correlation coefficients of the corresponding two elements respectively 4 results and analysis 4 1 spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage in the yzrb 4 1 1 changes in vegetation coverage at basin scale according to the results of related researches wei et al 2020 xiong et al 2020 may to september of each year was set as the vegetation growing season for the yzrb the maximum value composites method was used to generate monthly vegetation coverage based on half month ndvi images to reduce noise in the data the interannual variations of average growing season and seasonal vegetation coverage at the entire yzrb scale are illustrated in fig 2 the vegetation coverage in growing season was distributed in the range of 0 32 0 38 with an increasing trend before 2000 and began to decrease after 2000 which was close to that in summer june august followed by that in autumn september november from 0 28 to 0 32 there was not much difference between the values of vegetation coverage in spring march may and winter december february in the following year which was ranged from 0 20 to 0 24 4 1 2 changes in vegetation coverage at pixel scale the spatial distributions of multi year mean values of vegetation coverage for the growing season and four seasons as well as their trend were detected by the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope thus the results were shown in fig 3 the vegetation coverage values were divided into five grades with an interval of 0 2 corresponding to five different levels the larger the value the better the vegetation condition the vegetation distribution in the yzrb has obvious spatial heterogeneity and seasonal differences overall the vegetation in the basin tended to be greener gradually from west to east and reached the maximum value in medog county in the southeast the area with low vegetation coverage in the growing season values less than 0 2 accounted for 30 26 of the basin which was mainly distributed in the regions covered by grassland meadow and alpine vegetation in the upper and middle reaches of the yzr as well as glaciers and permanent snow in the headwater and northeast of the basin the medium and low vegetation coverage area in the growing season values between 0 2 and 0 4 was distributed in the whole basin especially for the middle reaches accounting for 38 84 of the basin while the moderate vegetation coverage values between 0 4 and 0 6 in the growing season existed in the grassland and unused land in the middle and lower reaches of the yzr accounting for 21 72 of the total area in the eastern and southeastern regions of the basin the vegetation coverage in the growing season was generally better than that in other regions 5 23 of the vegetation coverage in the whole basin was between 0 6 and 0 8 and of which 3 95 was above 0 8 shrubs coniferous and broadleaf forest were widely distributed in these regions compared with the spatial distributions of vegetation coverage in growing season and four seasons the vegetation in summer was closer and the value was a little higher than that in growing season while that in autumn was generally slightly lower than summer with the vegetation coverage mainly between 0 0 and 0 4 more than 50 of the total areas in spring and winter were covered by low vegetation coverage despite all this the vegetation coverage of the broadleaf forest areas in medog county in the southeast of the basin always maintain above 0 8 showing a relatively good vegetation growth state according to the spatial distributions of annual trend in vegetation coverage for growing season only 32 03 of the pixels passed the significance level test of α 0 05 the vegetation coverage changes in the yzrb revealed that 15 97 of the total areas in the upper and middle reaches had a relatively stable vegetation state with the annual increment ranged from 0 001 to 0 001 both the greening and browning trend were mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches 6 11 of the pixels with the high vegetation coverages showed a significant browning trend 9 91 of the areas became greener during the period 1981 2015 for the four seasons the spatial distributions of vegetation coverage change in summer were similar to that in growing season whereas with relatively smaller areas passed the significance test in the other seasons the areas with stable vegetation were larger than growing season and summer in general the areas with vegetation coverage less than 0 4 showed a good consistency with the areas where vegetation coverage remained stable for some specific areas the broadleaf forests in the medog county in the southeastern region of the basin remained stable in spring and autumn while presented a trend of degradation in growing season summer and winter 4 2 spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables in the yzrb 4 2 1 changes in climatic variables at basin scale the average algorithm was used to calculate average temperature and drought index while the summation algorithm was used for the calculation of total precipitation in the growing season to investigate the spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables from 1981 to 2015 fig 4 the average temperature and precipitation of the basin in the growing season showed an overall upward trend from 1981 to 2015 and both presented a turning point around 2000 before the turning point the average temperature fluctuated in the range of 6 0 5 and then showed an upward trend the average precipitation before 2000 was significantly lower than that after 2000 and the precipitation in the growing season shows a downward trend after 2000 considering the drought conditions the values of scpdsi below 0 indicate different degrees of drought conversely values greater than 0 present different degrees of wetness the larger the value the wetter the area table 2 the annual values of the scpdsi in the growing season at the basin scale during the period 1981 2015 were generally between 1 and 1 which was correspond to the normal state it tended to be dry during the period 1981 1985 then showed the trend of humidification from 1986 to 2000 and became aridity after 2000 which was generally consistent with the variabilities of precipitation in the basin 4 2 2 changes in climatic variables at pixel scale fig 5 illustrates the spatiotemporal variabilities of climatic variables at pixel scale the multi year average temperature across the yzrb was in the range of 9 19 28 52 which was mainly below 10 in the growing season the total precipitation in the growing season was mainly below 800 mm except for the southeastern region the western part was relatively wetter than the eastern region in the southeast of the basin the slight drought could be detected referring to the spatial distribution of multi year average scpdsi the maximum values of the average temperature and total precipitation in the growing season were 28 52 and 3228 0 mm respectively appeared in the medog county of the southeastern region furthermore the slopes of changing trend in climatic variables during the period 1981 2015 showed that a significantly upward trend at the significance level of α 0 05 except for the decreasing scpdsi in the headwater region of the basin the temperature in the upper reaches increased faster than that in other regions with a maximum increment of 0 18 yr and a relatively high variability of temperature appeared in the western part of nyingchi city in the lower reaches for precipitation only some areas in the middle reaches passed the significance test and showed a significantly increasing trend with the maximum increment of 12 24 mm yr in addition the headwater region showed a trend of aridification while the middle reaches presented a humid trend 4 2 3 relationships among climatic variables in the yzrb considering the spatiotemporal variabilities of precipitation temperature and drought fig 5 as well as the partial correlation coefficients of drought with temperature and precipitation fig 6 across the basin the significantly positive correlation was detected in the relationship between drought and precipitation in which more than 65 65 of the basin area showed the correlation coefficient higher than 0 5 at the significance level of 0 01 while the partial correlation coefficient between drought and temperature was mainly distributed on the range of 0 3 0 3 and failed to pass the 0 1 significance test the partial correlation coefficients between drought and temperature precipitation in the basin showed obvious spatial heterogeneity from the upper to lower reaches the drought was mainly controlled by temperature with a significant negative effect in the headwater region the significant positive correlation between drought and precipitation in the middle reaches was particularly obvious while a gentle positive correlation was distributed in the lower reaches whereas little significant relationship between drought and temperature existed in the middle and lower reaches 4 3 impacts of climatic variables on vegetation coverage in the yzrb 4 3 1 correlation analysis between climatic variables and vegetation coverage the correlation coefficients and the p values between vegetation coverage and precipitation temperature drought across the yzrb were exhibited in fig 7 which indicated that the climatic variables had significant influences on the variations of vegetation coverage in growing season across the basin with large spatial heterogeneities as for the correlation between vegetation coverage and precipitation fig 7a 61 88 of the basin showed positive correlation coefficients in which 28 51 of the total area passed the 0 1 significance test mainly distributed in the upper and middle reaches only 3 16 of the basin area scattered in the lower reaches showed a significant negative correlation between vegetation coverage and precipitation in terms of the relationship between vegetation coverage and temperature fig 7b 46 27 of the total basin areas were negatively correlated in which 21 93 of the total basin area showed significant negative correlation mainly distributed in the middle reaches and the southeastern region of the basin the areas with significant positive correlation between vegetation coverage and temperature also accounted for 40 77 of the total basin area and mainly located in the headwater region and western region of the lower reaches as for the correlation between vegetation coverage and drought more than 65 96 of the basin area exhibited positive correlation in which 30 15 of the basin area in the middle reaches passed the significance test whereas only 2 40 of the whole basin showed a significant negative correlation between vegetation coverage and drought fig 7c affected by the warm and humid airflow from the indian ocean the more precipitation the more humid and then the better the vegetation coverage in the basin the increase of temperature was disadvantageous to the growth of vegetation to a certain extent in the middle reaches of the basin under the barrier effects of the mountains the vegetation coverage in the southeastern region of the lower reaches showed unique characteristics the vegetation coverage presented a gentle negative correlation with temperature and precipitation while showed a slight positive correlation with drought future climate change patterns and their influence on ecosystems in the yzrb have received a great deal of concerns liu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 especially for the global warming and humidification climate which has great impacts on the variations of vegetation 4 3 2 time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage the previous studies in the yzrb mainly focused on the impacts of climatic variables on vegetation during the same period however the growth of vegetation is a long term and slow accumulation process the changes of climate will not quickly cause the changes of vegetation to a great degree investigating the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation is meaningful for current studies the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage at basin scale were firstly investigated at time lags of 0 3 months respectively fig 8 the best correlations of vegetation coverage in response to both temperature and precipitation were one month lag with correlation coefficients of 0 87 for temperature and 0 83 for precipitation respectively which were about 0 1 higher than that when the time lag effect was not considered the spatial distributions of time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage were also investigated across the yzrb as shown in fig 9 the vegetation in the upper and middle reaches which accounted for 45 83 of the whole basin showed the greatest correlation with temperature in one month lag the regions with no lag effect of temperature on vegetation coverage accounted for 22 45 of total basin area the vegetation coverage was mainly related to the temperature of the corresponding month showing a weak negative correlation in the tropical rain forest area covered by broadleaf forest of the southeastern region in the coniferous forest and shrubs regions at the junction of broadleaf forest to grassland which are located in the lower reaches the time lags of 2 or 3 months mainly occurred in response of vegetation to temperature as for the response of vegetation coverage to precipitation the upstream region was dominated by one month lag while the middle and downstream regions mainly showed no lag effect except for the same coniferous forest and shrubs regions in the downstream with 2 3 months lag similar to the result obtained by the response of vegetation to temperature at basin scale the time lags of precipitation to vegetation were mainly consisted of one month and no time lag accounting for 38 23 and 31 66 of the total basin area respectively while 2 and 3 months lags only occupied 5 53 of the total basin area the areas covered by glaciers and permanent snow accounted for 26 19 of total basin area were not considered in the time lag effect analysis in this study 5 discussion 5 1 responses of vegetation to climatic variables for different vegetation types the yarlung zangbo river is one of the rivers with the highest altitude in the world and the longest plateau river in china the relationship and time lag effects between climatic variables and vegetation coverage in the yzrb were investigated in detail which are very important for well understanding the ecohydrological processes in alpine regions the greening trend across the yzrb was detected in this study and the result showed that the vegetation coverage in the growing season increased at the rate of 3 7 10 4 yr at basin scale was consistent with the results had been reported by many previous studies cong et al 2013 xu et al 2014 hou et al 2015 yang et al 2015 however the previous study has implied that hydrological sensitivity was much diverse among vegetation types chen et al 2020a how do the different vegetation types response to climatic variables to further discuss the different responses the vegetation in the yzrb was grouped into 8 types referring to the digitized 1 1000000 vegetation map of china fig 10 a coniferous forest 6 75 broadleaf forest 3 29 shrubs 16 57 grassland 14 20 meadow 29 27 alpine vegetation 21 99 cultivated vegetation 2 70 and others 5 23 four major vegetation types meadow alpine vegetation shrubs and grassland which accounted for more than 10 of the basin area respectively were considered in this study after manually deleting some outliers the frequency distribution histogram of vegetation coverage fig 10b and the violin plots of the changing trend in vegetation fig 10c for four vegetation types in the growing season were analyzed the results demonstrate that the growth of shrubs is relatively better than other vegetation types and the vegetation coverage fall in the range of 0 0 8 which is mainly concentrated on the range of 0 2 0 6 the vegetation coverage of shrubs is relatively even and the change is positive in most areas while there are also some areas with the degrading trend in contrast the vegetation coverage of meadows alpine vegetation and grassland are mainly between 0 and 0 6 in which most of the peak is around 0 2 showing a greening trend the slopes of vegetation change in meadow and grassland are slightly lower than alpine vegetation the above obtained results are generally consistent with the study on alpine vegetation in the qinghai tibet plateau xu et al 2014 however cui and graf 2009 found that grassland on the qinghai tibet plateau was degrading the reasons for the different results are referred that linear trends in time series with low values are difficult to pass the significance level due to potential noise especially for the sparsely vegetated regions such as the qinghai tibet plateau xu et al 2014 furthermore the degradation was mainly observed in the headwater areas of the yangtze and yellow rivers cui and graf 2009 where do not belong to the study area in this study and a local or small scale phenomenon could not be investigated by gimms ndvi3g dataset because of the limitation of spatial resolution 64 km2 per pixel 5 2 correlations between climatic variables and vegetation for different vegetation types the violin plots of correlation coefficients between vegetation and precipitation temperature drought for four vegetation types in the growing season across the yzrb are shown in fig 11 the correlation coefficients of vegetation with precipitation and drought for four vegetation types are mainly positive and the grassland is more relevant than meadow and alpine vegetation that is greater than shrubs considering the relationship between vegetation and temperature other three vegetation types are mainly negative correlation except for alpine vegetation compared the results with the studies at global scale chen et al 2020a in china xu et al 2014 the qinghai tibet plateau sun et al 2016a the mongolian plateau bao et al 2014 the qilian mountains yang et al 2021 the yarlung zangbo river basin sun et al 2019 the american alaska pastick et al 2019 and the european alps filippa et al 2019 both similarities and differences exist among the current and previous studies all the studies show a greening trend at the regional or basin scale for recent several decades in most areas of china the changes of vegetation were significantly positively correlated with temperature and not associated with precipitation xu et al 2014 cong et al 2013 found that vegetation is more significantly affected by temperature than precipitation especially for the growing season in china sun et al 2016a found that the structure and function of alpine grassland ecosystems in the qinghai tibet plateau were largely shaped by temperature bao et al 2014 got the conclusion that precipitation in the growing season was a key factor controlling vegetation dynamics in the mongolian plateau furthermore warming temperature promoted incremental greening with the elevation below 1500 m and the snow prevented the vegetation development in alpine regions across the alps filippa et al 2019 pastick et al 2019 found that warming permafrost landscapes in the alaska showed significantly browning trend because of the evaporative demand and surface waters gains in this study the obviously spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between vegetation and climate was presented from upstream to downstream and the temperature mainly inhibited the vegetation growth given that the particularity of the yzrb as a typical alpine basin the relationships between vegetation coverage and climatic variables are complex the correlation between vegetation coverage and temperature in the basin is attributed to vary with aridity that the positive correlation exists in the arid region while the negative correlation is detected in the semi arid region reflecting different effects of snow melting processes on vegetation growth sun et al 2019 meanwhile the significant positive correlation between vegetation and precipitation can be explained by the limited precipitation due to the continental plateau climate and the barrier effect of the mountains sang et al 2016 the differences in the conclusions of the above mentioned studies may due to the different study periods and data sources as well as the study areas where may be influenced by the barriers of mountains and the monsoon 5 3 limitation the yzrb is monitored by only a small number of meteorological and hydrological gauging stations mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches due to complex terrain and difficulty in data acquisition in the depopulated zone of the upstream reaches which is a typical ungauged basin the precisions of remote sensing datasets were firstly assessed before using by comparing the applicability of temperature precipitation and drought which were derived from these datasets across the yzrb in previous studies to ensure the accuracy of calculation and results despite all that there was still inevitable uncertainty in our application of remote sensing datasets furthermore the plant phenology characteristics were barely considered in this study which may lead to ignore the differences between all types of vegetation in the selection and analysis of the growing season therefore more comprehensive and specific research could be conducted based on this study in the next step 6 conclusions in this study non parametric trend test methods sen s slope and mann kendall trend tests were firstly applied to analyze the spatiotemporal variabilities of vegetation coverage precipitation temperature and drought in the yzrb during the period 1981 2015 respectively then the pearson correlation analysis and geostatistical methods were used to investigate the responses and time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage in addition the responses of different vegetation types to climatic variables and their correlations were further discussed the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial distribution of long term average vegetation coverages is generally characterized as increasing from upper and middle reaches to lower reaches the low value areas of vegetation coverage in the upper and middle reaches relatively remained stable in recent four decades while the northern region of the lower reaches showed a greening trend of vegetation and degradation of vegetation was detected in the southeastern region of the lower reaches 2 the vegetation in the upper reaches was significantly positive correlation with precipitation and temperature in the middle reaches the vegetation was significantly positive correlation with precipitation and drought while significantly negative correlation with temperature the vegetation in the lower reaches was slightly negative correlation with precipitation whereas positive and negative correlations with temperature were detected in northwest and southeast regions respectively 3 the time lag effects of climatic variables on vegetation coverage across the yzrb are generally characterized as one month lag for precipitation and temperature in the upper reaches no lag for precipitation and one month lag for temperature were detected in the middle reaches both precipitation and temperature showed no month lag effect on vegetation coverage in the southeast region of the lower reaches while 2 3 months lag was detected in the transition area of broadleaf forest to grassland 4 the vegetation types in the yzrb were mainly consisted of meadow alpine vegetation shrubs and grassland in which the growth of shrubs was relatively better than other vegetation types all the vegetation types showed a slightly greening trend during the period 1981 2015 which were positively correlated with precipitation and drought while showed a negative correlation with temperature credit authorship contribution statement depeng zuo conceptualization methodology writing

of reporting rain gauges in europe south america and africa are declining dramatically lorenz and kunstmann 2012 despite the increased coverage and spatio temporal resolution of satellite rainfall

mtit giuli et al 1991 giuli et al 1999 one of the favourable algorithms is the operational real time rainfall retrieval algorithm namely the package rainlink developed by overeem et al 2016a rainlink

are driven by microwave link data between telephone towers since the wides spread introduction of underground fibre optic cable networks for telecommunication between telephone towers overeem et al 2016a 2016b especially in china the majority of link data have become unavailable from commercial cellular communication companies therefore the algorithms for estimating rainfall from this type of microwave link data between telephone towers present too many challenges or are no longer feasible the connection between the user terminal and the serving base station i e telephone tower during communication is developed as a time division long term evolution td lte network and is not replaced by underground fibre optic cables to reflect the coverage and interference of the td lte network measurement report mr data has been widely used in practical network evaluation and optimisation for instructing the user terminal to trigger events such as handover chowdhury et al 2011 he et al 2013

data collection is controlled by the operation and maintenance centre radio every 15 min miit the ministry of industry and information technology of the people s republic of china 2015 the key fields in the mr data file refer to the reference signal receiving quality power rsrp which is the absolute signal strength of the lte reference signal in dbm i e absolute signal strength compared to a reference level of 1 mw as the rsrp consists of the reference signal transmission power antenna gain of the base station and propagation loss and antenna gain of the terminal it is used to measure the coverage of the lte cell on the downlink i e from the base transceiver station to user equipment if the rsrp measurement results are categorized into different ranges the proportions of each range can be determined by the quotient of the number of samples within the threshold range and the total number of samples the proportion of weak coverage samples e g with rsrp 110 dbm can be used to evaluate the performance of the td lte network changes to the proportions can be attributed to changing propagation losses including the impact on microwave attenuation due to rainfall then it is possible to establish a relationship between the rainfall rate and proportions of rsrp from the mr data which is the focus of our study this paper is organized as follows first descriptions of the rain gauge mr runoff and pan evaporation data are given in a case study next the methodology for deriving rainfall rate from the mr data the interpolation for rain gauge data and the hydrological model for simulating runoff are described subsequently the verification results illustrating the effectiveness of the rainfall retrieval algorithm and its limitations and applicability to other regions are presented finally conclusions are provided 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and gauges data andunshui river basin a tributary of the dongjiang river basin is located in the rural area of huidong county huizhou city china figure 1 and has an area of 385 km2 there are six automatic rain gauge stations each with 30 min rainfall data series over two months may and august 2019 the 30 min streamflow data for these two months were obtained from the jiuzhou gauge station which is located at the outlet of the andunshui river basin the mean areal rainfall was estimated by the thiessen polygon method based on the six automatic rain gauge stations and was then taken as the rainfall in this study the potential evaporation with 30 min time steps was measured at the jiuzhou station all rainfall evaporation and runoff data were provided by the bureau of hydrology huizhou city guangdong province 2 2 mr data from td lte network the mr data is recorded in xml files and from the td lte mr data acquisition system from the mr data the reporting range of rsrp is defined from 120 to 60 dbm with a resolution of 1 db or 2 db the proportions of each range are often analysed to determine the td lte network coverage via commercial cellular communication companies in this study this will be used to estimate rainfall there are four lte cells on the downlink in the study area monitored by china mobile communications group guangdong huizhou branch the proportions of rsrp are obtained from these four lte cells although the mr data is recorded every 15 min it was converted into 30 min data series via the arithmetic mean function of the two records during the 30 min from the available rainfall and runoff gauge data the changes in rsrp can indicate path averaged rainfall horizontal while the path delay of global positioning system gps signals can help evaluate precipitable water vapour vertical liou et al 2001 yeh et al 2016 thus the gps signals data from four telephone towers in the study area have also been collected to improve rainfall estimation 3 methodology the process of determining rainfall from the mr data starts with wet rainy dry non rainy classification once the rainy and non rainy time intervals have been classified the relationship between the amount of areal rainfall and the proportion of the rsrp ranges from the mr data during the raining time interval can be determined for rainfall estimation after rainfall estimation from the mr data through the determined relationship a hydrological model is employed to prove the applicability of estimating rainfall from the mr data during runoff simulations the proportions of rsrp from the td lte network are often correlated with each other and generally lower the efficiency for wet dry classification and rainfall estimation hence the principal variables from the proportions of rsrp require determining principal component analysis pca is used as a dimensionality reduction method for selecting the principal variables the entire process of the work presented herein is shown in figure 2 3 1 the principal component analysis pca method for variable selection there are initially 51 variables 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data and one gps signal parameter for the study area as only two months of data are available for testing the contribution of the mr data for rainfall estimation the driving parameters of the estimation model should be reduced through variable selection pca is a multivariate statistical technique introduced by pearson 1901 that transforms or orthogonally projects a larger series of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components pcs without losing too much information aitchison 1983 pca can be taken as a tool for reducing the high dimensionality of the original data while maintaining its variance more details of the pca method can be found in jolliffe 2002 pca has been widely used in various hydrological sciences and engineering problems including defining the ecological hydrology of river chang et al 2009 sustainability evaluation for biomass supply chain synthesis how and lam 2018 and estimation of reservoir water saturation and water temperature asante okyere et al 2020 ren et al 2020 thus in our study pca was used to reduce the initial 51 variables for wet dry period classification and rainfall estimation 3 2 support vector classification svc model for a wet dry period classification the main idea of the svc model is to find a hyperplane in the data that is non linearly transformed into a higher dimensional space through kernel methods suykens and vandewalle 1999 the optimal separating hyperplane between the two closest points on either side of the line is maximised to distinguish between classes by applying a kernel trick boser et al 1992 and penalty term the svc model has been applied in wet dry classification chen et al 2010 under climate change scenarios in water quality assessment through data reduction singh et al 2011 tiyasha et al 2020 in real time water level prediction zhao et al 2020 and so on as there are two classes i e wet 0 1 mm and dry 0 1 mm in wet dry period classification the binary svc algorithm was adopted here to improve rainfall estimation 3 3 artificial neural networks ann method for rainfall estimation ann was implemented successfully in predicting and assessing hydrology hamed et al 2004 güclü and dursun 2008 atasoy et al 2013 tiyasha et al 2020 due to its robustness and capability for dealing with nonlinear and complex problems ann comprises a group of processing elements where each typical subgroup makes independent computations and passes their results to the next subgroup which may perform in the same way the network is often divided into three layers i e subgroups of the processing elements the three layers are the input layer the hidden or intermediate layer and the output layer the input layer comprises the variables selected by the pca method while the output layer outputs the rainfall simulation 3 4 misdc runoff hydrological model for runoff simulation the modello idrologico semi distribuito in continuo misdc is a lumped hydrological model developed by brocca et al 2011 this conceptual model incorporates a two layer continuous hydrological model characterized by a component simulating the temporal pattern of soil moisture and a semi distributed event based rainfall runoff component for simulating river discharge time series camici et al 2020 by coupling these two components models through an experimentally derived relationship the structure of the misdc model was derived to simulate the rainfall runoff transformation brocca et al 2011 and the process of transferring the surface and subsurface runoff to the catchment outlet is simulated via the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph gupta et al 1980 the misdc model has been widely and successfully applied in many different contexts including the mountainous catchment at an hourly time scale brocca et al 2013 barbetta et al 2017 loizu et al 2018 cislaghi et al 2020 thus we consider the misdc model suitable for the purpose of our study 3 5 the performance criteria for the wet dry period classification rainfall estimation and runoff simulation the classification error ce is often used for classification criteria and is employed to describe the performance of the svc model 1 ce 1 n n where n is the number of correct classifications and n is the total number of classifications the root mean squared error rmse is used to measure the goodness of fit of the ann method for rainfall estimation 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i 2 where qo i is the ith observation runoff and qs i is the ith simulation runoff from the hydrological model smaller values of cn and rmse correspond to better model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 one of the most popular criteria used in hydrological modelling is adopted here to quantitatively demonstrate the performance of the misdc hydrological model 3 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i 2 larger values of nse correspond to better model performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 the selected variables for the wet dry period classification based on the two months may and august 2019 of 30 min rainfall and mr data there are a total of 2 593 records available for this study some measurements are left out there are 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data as components in each record if these components are input into the svc model one by one for classifying the wet dry period the ce value vs the number of components can be determined the 10 k cross validation method was used to test the svc model all records were used as both training and testing samples and the results are shown in figure 3 a it was observed that the first eight components from pca can cumulatively account for over 90 of the total correct classification i e the ce values are less than 0 1 specifically the average ce values are 0 028 and 0 08 for the training and testing samples respectively thus the first eight components from pca based on the mr data are selected for the wet dry period classification as the gps signals can help evaluate the precipitable water vapour from the vertical path both the gps signals and the 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data are utilized for deriving components via the pca method subsequently all components were input into the svc model with the 10 k cross validation method and the corresponding results of average ce values are shown in figure 3 b it can be found that there are no significant differences between figure 3 a and figure 3 b indicating that the addition of gps signals cannot significantly improve the performances of the wet dry period classification if there are only gps signals for classifying wet dry periods via the svc model the average ce values for both the training and testing samples are approximately 0 31 the information contained in the gps signals can achieve the most accurate classification of the wet dry period however the first eight components of pca from the proportions of rsrp were used to drive the svc model for the wet dry period classification due to their higher accuracy and relative concision 4 2 rainfall estimation via the ann model a total of 402 wet periods were found from the observed data to determine the principal variables for rainfall estimation 50 components i e the variables derived from the mr data via the pca method were input into the rainfall estimation model i e ann that is the newff function with tansig purelin and trainrp parameter values in matlab the 10 k cross validation method was also used to determine the number of components for input variables and hidden nodes for the ann parameter the average rmse values during both the calibration and validation periods vs the number of components are shown in figure 4 when the rmse was taken as the criteria for assessing the performance of the rainfall estimation model it can be found that the first 18 pca components cumulatively contribute the most to the rainfall estimation where the change point of the rmse values can be found therefore these first 18 components derived by the pca method were selected for driving the rainfall estimation ann model the number of nodes in the hidden layer determines the total number of parameters i e the weights of the ann model to be calibrated and can impact the accuracy of rainfall simulation the increased number of nodes in the hidden layer indicates an increase in the total parameters of the ann model to determine the number of hidden nodes in ann the average rmse values in both the calibration and validation periods vs the number of hidden nodes in ann were obtained through the 10 k cross validation method as shown in figure 5 it can be found that the seven hidden nodes in ann can enable good performance for rainfall estimation with lower rmse values during both the calibration and validation periods to avoid overfitting of the ann model limited by our available data sets the number of nodes in the hidden layer was as seven therefore the first eight components were selected as variables for the wet dry period classification via the svc model the first 18 components from the pca were taken as the input variables of the ann model with the structure of seven nodes in the hidden layer when the classification results from the svc were input into the rainfall estimation ann model as shown in figure 2 the average rmse values of rainfall estimation are 1 027 mm and 1 893 mm for the calibration and validation periods respectively using the 10 k cross validation method to determine the applicability of the rainfall retrieval process during runoff simulations the first 60 of the wet and dry records were taken as training samples for classification while the remaining 40 were taken as testing samples the ec values are 0 018 and 0 102 for the training and testing samples respectively there were 402 wet periods from the observed data and 480 wet periods can be found from the classification results by the svc model it is interesting to find that all 402 wet periods could be determined while 78 wet periods were misclassified by the svc model 63 of wet periods occurred between 4 00 and 16 00 however 50 of misclassification can be found during this period the highest number of misclassifications occurred at approximately 10 00 and 22 00 shown in figure 6 this might be attributed to the peak times of cell phone use the lowest occurred from 12 00 to 14 00 i e lunchtime according to the rainfall retrieval process rainfall estimation should be conducted based on the results of wet dry period classification the first 60 of wet records from the svc classification model were taken as training samples for ann and the remaining 40 were taken as testing samples the results of rainfall estimation from the ann model are shown in figure 7 i e the newff function with 7 1 tansig purelin trainrp parameters values in matlab the rmse values are 0 911 mm and 0 931 mm for the training calibration and testing validation periods respectively the rainfall estimation error is mainly attributed to misclassifications from the svc model as shown in figure 7 the accuracy of wet period classification is important for improving the accuracy of rainfall estimation although large rainfall values appear to be underestimated due to few large value records for training and testing as shown in figure 7 a and 7 b the accuracies of the ann model driven by the main components from mr data are acceptable 4 3 the effects of the estimated rainfall from mr data on runoff simulation a predominant application of rainfall monitoring estimation is in hydrological models for runoff process simulations to aid flood forecasting or water resources management and thus the estimated rainfall by ann model was input into the misdc runoff hydrological model to evaluate its effects according to the variation in the discharge series during may and august 2019 for the intended study area 44 m3 s i e the average discharge during the observed period was set as the threshold for extracting the flood events 39 flood events were found during the two months the lumped misdc runoff hydrological model was calibrated via the observed rainfall areal rainfall and runoff data from the gauge stations then the runoff simulation could be obtained as shown in figure 8 a1 with an nse value of 0 967 the scatter plot between the observed and simulated runoff is shown in figure 8 a2 the calibrated misdc runoff hydrological model can simulate runoff with acceptable accuracy 0 8 even the magnitudes of runoff exceed 370 m3 s however most runoff between 200 m3 s and 370 m3 s is underestimated by the misdc model while runoff between 50 m3 s and 200 m3 s is slightly overestimated if the estimated rainfall is input into the calibrated misdc model its runoff simulation can also be obtained as shown in figure 8 b1 and b2 the nse value is 0 934 and is lower than that from the observed data shown in figure 8 a1 taking the runoff simulation from the observed rainfall data as a reference the differences between these simulations can reflect the effects of the estimated rainfall from mr data on runoff simulation shown in figure 8 b2 the details of the rainfall retrieval process can be found in the last paragraph in section 4 2 some rainfall events have been significantly underestimated by the ann model lower than line 1 1 shown in figure 7 and their corresponding runoffs are also underestimated to the observed runoff shown in figure 8 b2 especially the runoff from 120 to 350 m3 s all wet periods were incorporated by the svc classification for the rainfall estimation ann model and lower rainfall estimation corresponded to lower runoff simulation it is found that most runoff estimation is lower from the estimated rainfall than from observed rainfall this can be attributed to the effect of rainfall estimation on the runoff simulation 5 conclusion mr data from the td lte mr data acquisition system can potentially be used for rainfall estimation real time mr data provided by the communication company offers great opportunities for monitoring rainfall at high temporal and spatial scales without additional cost the purpose of mr data is to reflect the coverage and interference of the td lte network i e the services for the customer and is an indicator of the microwave link between the telephone tower and cell phone or mobile terminal differing from current rainfall retrieval algorithms based on the radio connection between telephone towers the methods of estimating rainfall in our study based on the mr data will not be replaced by the development of underground fibre optic cable networks the mr data is just the proportion of weak coverage samples and can still be used to estimate rainfall owing to the distribution of proportions directly impacted by the rainfall based attenuation mr data during may and august 2019 from the huizhou branch of china mobile communications group guangdong were converted to rainfall through our proposed framework and models which were calibrated via local observed rainfall and runoff data the promising results of the estimated rainfall and its corresponding simulated runoff have proven that the mr data and our proposed models can provide a new method of monitoring rainfall and simulating runoff there are still several improvements to be conducted in future studies the major error in rainfall estimation occurs for wet dry period classification another wet dry classification algorithm or merging of different rainfall sources e g satellite rainfall data if available on time might improve the accuracy of wet dry period classification the structure of the rainfall estimation ann model might be further optimized via dropout to prevent neural networks from overfitting long mr data sets from different places in different seasons should be adopted to further evaluate the accuracy of rainfall estimation and to determine the factors that impact the effectiveness of the proposed method credit authorship contribution statement dedi liu

be determined by the quotient of the number of samples within the threshold range and the total number of samples the proportion of weak coverage samples e g with rsrp 110 dbm can be used to evaluate the performance of the td lte network changes to the proportions can be attributed to changing propagation losses including the impact on microwave attenuation due to rainfall then it is possible to establish a relationship between the rainfall rate and proportions of rsrp from the mr data which is the focus of our study this paper is organized as follows first descriptions of the rain gauge mr runoff and pan evaporation data are given in a case study next the methodology for deriving rainfall rate from the mr data the interpolation for rain gauge data and the hydrological model for simulating runoff are described subsequently the verification results illustrating the effectiveness of the rainfall retrieval algorithm and its limitations and applicability to other regions are presented finally conclusions are provided 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and gauges data andunshui river basin a tributary of the dongjiang river basin is located in the rural area of huidong county huizhou city china figure 1 and has an area of 385 km2 there are six automatic rain gauge stations each with 30 min rainfall data series over two months may and august 2019 the 30 min streamflow data for these two months were obtained from the jiuzhou gauge station which is located at the outlet of the andunshui river basin the mean areal rainfall was estimated by the thiessen polygon method based on the six automatic rain gauge stations and was then taken as the rainfall in this study the potential evaporation with 30 min time steps was measured at the jiuzhou station all rainfall evaporation and runoff data were provided by the bureau of hydrology huizhou city guangdong province 2 2 mr data from td lte network the mr data is recorded in xml files and from the td lte mr data acquisition system from the mr data the reporting range of rsrp is defined from 120 to 60 dbm with a resolution of 1 db or 2 db the proportions of each range are often analysed to determine the td lte network coverage via commercial cellular communication companies in this study this will be used to estimate rainfall there are four lte cells on the downlink in the study area monitored by china mobile communications group guangdong huizhou branch the proportions of rsrp are obtained from these four lte cells although the mr data is recorded every 15 min it was converted into 30 min data series via the arithmetic mean function of the two records during the 30 min from the available rainfall and runoff gauge data the changes in rsrp can indicate path averaged rainfall horizontal while the path delay of global positioning system gps signals can help evaluate precipitable water vapour vertical liou et al 2001 yeh et al 2016 thus the gps signals data from four telephone towers in the study area have also been collected to improve rainfall estimation 3 methodology the process of determining rainfall from the mr data starts with wet rainy dry non rainy classification once the rainy and non rainy time intervals have been classified the relationship between the amount of areal rainfall and the proportion of the rsrp ranges from the mr data during the raining time interval can be determined for rainfall estimation after rainfall estimation from the mr data through the determined relationship a hydrological model is employed to prove the applicability of estimating rainfall from the mr data during runoff simulations the proportions of rsrp from the td lte network are often correlated with each other and generally lower the efficiency for wet dry classification and rainfall estimation hence the principal variables from the proportions of rsrp require determining principal component analysis pca is used as a dimensionality reduction method for selecting the principal variables the entire process of the work presented herein is shown in figure 2 3 1 the principal component analysis pca method for variable selection there are initially 51 variables 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data and one gps signal parameter for the study area as only two months of data are available for testing the contribution of the mr data for rainfall estimation the driving parameters of the estimation model should be reduced through variable selection pca is a multivariate statistical technique introduced by pearson 1901 that transforms or orthogonally projects a larger series of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components pcs without losing too much information aitchison 1983 pca can be taken as a tool for reducing the high dimensionality of the original data while maintaining its variance more details of the pca method can be found in jolliffe 2002 pca has been widely used in various hydrological sciences and engineering problems including defining the ecological hydrology of river chang et al 2009 sustainability evaluation for biomass supply chain synthesis how and lam 2018 and estimation of reservoir water saturation and water temperature asante okyere et al 2020 ren et al 2020 thus in our study pca was used to reduce the initial 51 variables for wet dry period classification and rainfall estimation 3 2 support vector classification svc model for a wet dry period classification the main idea of the svc model is to find a hyperplane in the data that is non linearly transformed into a higher dimensional space through kernel methods suykens and vandewalle 1999 the optimal separating hyperplane between the two closest points on either side of the line is maximised to distinguish between classes by applying a kernel trick boser et al 1992 and penalty term the svc model has been applied in wet dry classification chen et al 2010 under climate change scenarios in water quality assessment through data reduction singh et al 2011 tiyasha et al 2020 in real time water level prediction zhao et al 2020 and so on as there are two classes i e wet 0 1 mm and dry 0 1 mm in wet dry period classification the binary svc algorithm was adopted here to improve rainfall estimation 3 3 artificial neural networks ann method for rainfall estimation ann was implemented successfully in predicting and assessing hydrology hamed et al 2004 güclü and dursun 2008 atasoy et al 2013 tiyasha et al 2020 due to its robustness and capability for dealing with nonlinear and complex problems ann comprises a group of processing elements where each typical subgroup makes independent computations and passes their results to the next subgroup which may perform in the same way the network is often divided into three layers i e subgroups of the processing elements the three layers are the input layer the hidden or intermediate layer and the output layer the input layer comprises the variables selected by the pca method while the output layer outputs the rainfall simulation 3 4 misdc runoff hydrological model for runoff simulation the modello idrologico semi distribuito in continuo misdc is a lumped hydrological model developed by brocca et al 2011 this conceptual model incorporates a two layer continuous hydrological model characterized by a component simulating the temporal pattern of soil moisture and a semi distributed event based rainfall runoff component for simulating river discharge time series camici et al 2020 by coupling these two components models through an experimentally derived relationship the structure of the misdc model was derived to simulate the rainfall runoff transformation brocca et al 2011 and the process of transferring the surface and subsurface runoff to the catchment outlet is simulated via the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph gupta et al 1980 the misdc model has been widely and successfully applied in many different contexts including the mountainous catchment at an hourly time scale brocca et al 2013 barbetta et al 2017 loizu et al 2018 cislaghi et al 2020 thus we consider the misdc model suitable for the purpose of our study 3 5 the performance criteria for the wet dry period classification rainfall estimation and runoff simulation the classification error ce is often used for classification criteria and is employed to describe the performance of the svc model 1 ce 1 n n where n is the number of correct classifications and n is the total number of classifications the root mean squared error rmse is used to measure the goodness of fit of the ann method for rainfall estimation 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i 2 where qo i is the ith observation runoff and qs i is the ith simulation runoff from the hydrological model smaller values of cn and rmse correspond to better model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 one of the most popular criteria used in hydrological modelling is adopted here to quantitatively demonstrate the performance of the misdc hydrological model 3 nse 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o i 2 larger values of nse correspond to better model performance 4 results and discussion 4 1 the selected variables for the wet dry period classification based on the two months may and august 2019 of 30 min rainfall and mr data there are a total of 2 593 records available for this study some measurements are left out there are 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data as components in each record if these components are input into the svc model one by one for classifying the wet dry period the ce value vs the number of components can be determined the 10 k cross validation method was used to test the svc model all records were used as both training and testing samples and the results are shown in figure 3 a it was observed that the first eight components from pca can cumulatively account for over 90 of the total correct classification i e the ce values are less than 0 1 specifically the average ce values are 0 028 and 0 08 for the training and testing samples respectively thus the first eight components from pca based on the mr data are selected for the wet dry period classification as the gps signals can help evaluate the precipitable water vapour from the vertical path both the gps signals and the 50 proportions of rsrp from mr data are utilized for deriving components via the pca method subsequently all components were input into the svc model with the 10 k cross validation method and the corresponding results of average ce values are shown in figure 3 b it can be found that there are no significant differences between figure 3 a and figure 3 b indicating that the addition of gps signals cannot significantly improve the performances of the wet dry period classification if there are only gps signals for classifying wet dry periods via the svc model the average ce values for both the training and testing samples are approximately 0 31 the information contained in the gps signals can achieve the most accurate classification of the wet dry period however the first eight components of pca from the proportions of rsrp were used to drive the svc model for the wet dry period classification due to their higher accuracy and relative concision 4 2 rainfall estimation via the ann model a total of 402 wet periods were found from the observed data to determine the principal variables for rainfall estimation 50 components i e the variables derived from the mr data via the pca method were input into the rainfall estimation model i e ann that is the newff function with tansig purelin and trainrp parameter values in matlab the 10 k cross validation method was also used to determine the number of components for input variables and hidden nodes for the ann parameter the average rmse values during both the calibration and validation periods vs the number of components are shown in figure 4 when the rmse was taken as the criteria for assessing the performance of the rainfall estimation model it can be found that the first 18 pca components cumulatively contribute the most to the rainfall estimation where the change point of the rmse values can be found therefore these first 18 components derived by the pca method were selected for driving the rainfall estimation ann model the number of nodes in the hidden layer determines the total number of parameters i e the weights of the ann model to be calibrated and can impact the accuracy of rainfall simulation the increased number of nodes in the hidden layer indicates an increase in the total parameters of the ann model to determine the number of hidden nodes in ann the average rmse values in both the calibration and validation periods vs the number of hidden nodes in ann were obtained through the 10 k cross validation method as shown in figure 5 it can be found that the seven hidden nodes in ann can enable good performance for rainfall estimation with lower rmse values during both the calibration and validation periods to avoid overfitting of the ann model limited by our available data sets the number of nodes in the hidden layer was as seven therefore the first eight components were selected as variables for the wet dry period classification via the svc model the first 18 components from the pca were taken as the input variables of the ann model with the structure of seven nodes in the hidden layer when the classification results from the svc were input into the rainfall estimation ann model as shown in figure 2 the average rmse values of rainfall estimation are 1 027 mm and 1 893 mm for the calibration and validation periods respectively using the 10 k cross validation method to determine the applicability of the rainfall retrieval process during runoff simulations the first 60 of the wet and dry records were taken as training samples for classification while the remaining 40 were taken as testing samples the ec values are 0 018 and 0 102 for the training and testing samples respectively there were 402 wet periods from the observed data and 480 wet periods can be found from the classification results by the svc model it is interesting to find that all 402 wet periods could be determined while 78 wet periods were misclassified by the svc model 63 of wet periods occurred between 4 00 and 16 00 however 50 of misclassification can be found during this period the highest number of misclassifications occurred at approximately 10 00 and 22 00 shown in figure 6 this might be attributed to the peak times of cell phone use the lowest occurred from 12 00 to 14 00 i e lunchtime according to the rainfall retrieval process rainfall estimation should be conducted based on the results of wet dry period classification the first 60 of wet records from the svc classification model were taken as training samples for ann and the remaining 40 were taken as testing samples the results of rainfall estimation from the ann model are shown in figure 7 i e the newff function with 7 1 tansig purelin trainrp parameters values in matlab the rmse values are 0 911 mm and 0 931 mm for the training calibration and testing validation periods respectively the rainfall estimation error is mainly attributed to misclassifications from the svc model as shown in figure 7 the accuracy of wet period classification is important for improving the accuracy of rainfall estimation although large rainfall values appear to be underestimated due to few large value records for training and testing as shown in figure 7 a and 7 b the accuracies of the ann model driven by the main components from mr data are acceptable 4 3 the effects of the estimated rainfall from mr data on runoff simulation a predominant application of rainfall monitoring estimation is in hydrological models for runoff process simulations to aid flood forecasting or water resources management and thus the estimated rainfall by ann model was input into the misdc runoff hydrological model to evaluate its effects according to the variation in the discharge series during may and august 2019 for the intended study area 44 m3 s i e the average discharge during the observed period was set as the threshold for extracting the flood events 39 flood events were found during the two months the lumped misdc runoff hydrological model was calibrated via the observed rainfall areal rainfall and runoff data from the gauge stations then the runoff simulation could be obtained as shown in figure 8 a1 with an nse value of 0 967 the scatter plot between the observed and simulated runoff is shown in figure 8 a2 the calibrated misdc runoff hydrological model can simulate runoff with acceptable accuracy 0 8 even the magnitudes of runoff exceed 370 m3 s however most runoff between 200 m3 s and 370 m3 s is underestimated by the misdc model while runoff between 50 m3 s and 200 m3 s is slightly overestimated if the estimated rainfall is input into the calibrated misdc model its runoff simulation can also be obtained as shown in figure 8 b1 and b2 the nse value is 0 934 and is lower than that from the observed data shown in figure 8 a1 taking the runoff simulation from the observed rainfall data as a reference the differences between these simulations can reflect the effects of the estimated rainfall from mr data on runoff simulation shown in figure 8 b2 the details of the rainfall retrieval process can be found in the last paragraph in section 4 2 some rainfall events have been significantly underestimated by the ann model lower than line 1 1 shown in figure 7 and their corresponding runoffs are also underestimated to the observed runoff shown in figure 8 b2 especially the runoff from 120 to 350 m3 s all wet periods were incorporated by the svc classification for the rainfall estimation ann model and lower rainfall estimation corresponded to lower runoff simulation it is found that most runoff estimation is lower from the estimated rainfall than from observed rainfall this can be attributed to the effect of rainfall estimation on the runoff simulation 5 conclusion mr data from the td lte mr data acquisition system can potentially be used for rainfall estimation real time mr data provided by the communication company offers great opportunities for monitoring rainfall at high temporal and spatial scales without additional cost the purpose of mr data is to reflect the coverage and interference of the td lte network i e the services for the customer and is an indicator of the microwave link between the telephone tower and cell phone or mobile terminal differing from current rainfall retrieval algorithms based on the radio connection between telephone towers the methods of estimating rainfall in our study based on the mr data will not be replaced by the development of underground fibre optic cable networks the mr data is just the proportion of weak coverage samples and can still be used to estimate rainfall owing to the distribution of proportions directly impacted by the rainfall based attenuation mr data during may and august 2019 from the huizhou branch of china mobile communications group guangdong were converted to rainfall through our proposed framework and models which were calibrated via local observed rainfall and runoff data the promising results of the estimated rainfall and its corresponding simulated runoff have proven that the mr data and our proposed models can provide a new method of monitoring rainfall and simulating runoff there are still several improvements to be conducted in future studies the major error in rainfall estimation occurs for wet dry period classification another wet dry classification algorithm or merging of different rainfall sources e g satellite rainfall data if available on time might improve the accuracy of wet dry period classification the structure of the rainfall estimation ann model might be further optimized via dropout to prevent neural networks from overfitting long mr data sets from different places in different seasons should be adopted to further evaluate the accuracy of rainfall estimation and to determine the factors that impact the effectiveness of the proposed method credit authorship contribution statement dedi liu

4402,soil evaporation plays an important role in non productive water loss and local climate regulation the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in surface soil water from that in precipitation is used to indicate the integrative results of the soil evaporation process but the distinction between the slope of the soil water evaporation line sel and line conditioned excess lc excess as individual indicators has not been identified furthermore spatial variability and interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation on soil evaporation in arid and semi arid grasslands remain poorly understood we established 3 west to east sampling transects along with increasing precipitation and decreasing aridity index gradients in grasslands of the tibetan tp 1500 km loess lp 600 km and inner mongolia mp 1200 km plateaus slope of sel and weighted mean lc excess were calculated according to the δd and δ18o in soil water which was extracted from soils collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m along with soil profiles during the vigorous growing season we found that lc excess appeared relatively more robust than slope in representing soil evaporation process because lc excess was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage while slope was regulated only by evaporation fractionation factors soil evaporation as indicated by lc excess exhibited decreasing trends from west to east and was controlled by relative humidity in tp and by vegetation coverage in lp and mp our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in tp and vegetation restoration in lp and mp keywords soil evaporation stable isotope soil water evaporation line lc excess grass transect 1 introduction grasslands account for nearly 30 of the earth s land surface and cover about 40 of total land area in china berdugo et al 2020 grasslands in the tibetan tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateau locating in arid and semi arid zones together account for about 78 of the total grassland area in china zhou et al 2014 grasslands sustain the livelihoods of large populations and their gross primary productivity is highly related to ecohydrological processes chen et al 2019 however nearly 90 of these grasslands have been degraded to some extent due to climate change or over grazing xu et al 2014 in grasslands soil water plays an important role in water availability and nutrient supply for plants growth and in climate regulation mccoll et al 2017 δd and δ18o in soil water are widely used as ideal tracers of ecohydrological processes since they reflect the long term integrated results of rain infiltration plants transpiration and soil evaporation etc fig 1 a rain infiltration can change the isotopic composition and soil residual water storage by mixing with pre event soil water sprenger et al 2016 root water uptake for plants transpiration does not typically alter the isotopic composition of soil water although some halophytes or woody xerophytes change δd of soil water dawson and ehleringer 1991 ellsworth and williams 2007 soil evaporation results in soil water becoming enriched in heavy isotopes by lighter i e 1h2 16o water isotopes evaporating from the liquid phase and diffusing to gaseous phase at faster speeds than heavier i e 1h2 18o and hd16o water isotopes fig 1a in addition if groundwater recharge dew formation or hydraulic redistribution occur the isotopic composition and soil residual water storage also can be changed liu et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 2019 soil evaporation can increase non productive soil water loss and adjust local climate by cooling the surface or increasing concentrations of atmospheric water vapor hirschi et al 2011 long term high soil evaporation leads to the distinct isotopic signals between soil water and precipitation and the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water deviating from that in precipitation fig 1b this deviation is described by the slope of soil water evaporation line sel allison 1982 deuterium excess d excess gat 1996 and line conditioned excess lc excess landwehr and coplen 2006 which is generally used for indicating the long term integrated soil evaporation effects of mixed source waters formed by multiple rainfall events sel is defined as a regression line fitted by δd and δ18o in soil water allison 1982 d excess and lc excess are defined as a function of the slope and intercept of global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl dansgaard 1964 respectively however lc excess or d excess and slope of sel are often separately used to indicate the integrative results of soil evaporation process of mixed source water over a period of time while their distinction has been identified limitedly landwehr and coplen 2006 rothfuss et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 landwehr and coplen 2006 demonstrated that use of lc excess is more advantageous over d excess for indicating soil evaporation fractionation signals some studies only used slope of sel for reflecting soil evaporation effects and found slope was mainly regulated by evaporation fractionation factors related to temperature relative humidity and diffusion coefficient etc gibson et al 2008 rothfuss et al 2015 most studies used lc excess which was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage for reflecting soil evaporation effects and only showed slope of sel as auxiliary data while their relationship and differences were not investigated hasselquist et al 2018 sprenger et al 2017 in theory lc excess or d excess and slope of sel are controlled by soil evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage which are influenced by the interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation moreover most research on how climate soil and vegetation affect lc excess or d excess and slope of sel have been tested at a single site using multiple samplings gaj and mcdonnell 2019 hasselquist et al 2018 oerter et al 2014 but research from multiple sites are limited gibson et al 2008 sprenger et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 found lc excess of soil water among five long term experimental forest catchments along with a temperature and wetness gradient was different due to soil evaporation fractionation and dominated by volume of antecedent precipitation and temperature and higher beneath conifer trees than that beneath heather shrubs gibson et al 2008 estimated global distributions of slope of sel in shallow soil water with a steady state isotope balance model and found they exhibited a latitudinal trend related to seasonal temperature and humidity therefore we established one sampling grass transect with 10 sampling sites each in the tibetan tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateau from west to east coinciding with the increasing precipitation decreasing aridity gradients and variable soil and vegetation types lc excess d excess and slope of sel were calculated based on soil samples collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m at every site in our study we test the following hypothesizes 1 lc excess is more robust than slope of sel and d excess in representing the long term integrative results of soil evaporation process due to its high sensitivity to soil residual water storage and soil evaporation fractionation factors and 2 soil evaporation indicated by lc excess is controlled by climate in tp due to its sensitivity to climate change and by vegetation in lp and mp due to vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling transects in the tibet loess and inner mongolia plateaus we established sampling transects in three grassland areas tibet tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateaus tp has a severe continental climate with high variability the area is cold and arid in the northwest and warm and humid in the southeast chen et al 2015 lp has a typical arid and semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate and an extremely fragmented hilly loess landscape yue et al 2019 most areas in the mp are classified as arid or semi arid continental climate cheng et al 2016 sampling transects were established from west to east in tp 1500 km lp 600 km and mp 1200 km respectively for each transect 10 sampling sites were selected at an interval of about 60 150 km from west to east numbered from 01 to 10 fig 2 from west to east there is a significant increasing trend in annual average precipitation map in all three transects annual average relative humidity rh in tp and lp and annual average temperature mat in lp there is a significant decreasing trend in aridity index ai in all three transects and annual potential evapotranspiration pet in tp table 1 soil types in the three transects include loamy sand loam sandy loam and silty loam and grassland types include desert steppe typical steppe and meadow steppe 2 2 soil sampling and isotopic analysis of soil water soil sampling and vegetation surveys were conducted once at each site during the vigorous growing season in july and august in 2018 tp 26 july 03 august lp 12 august 20 august mp 05 july 14 july at each site of our tp lp and mp transects a 100 100 m2 sampling area was selected for soil sampling and vegetation surveys and eight quadrats 1 1 m2 were randomly established in the sampling area there were no surface waters such as streams and lakes within 3 km of sampling areas for soil water isotope samples four of eight quadrats in the 100 100 m2 sampling area were randomly chosen and one soil core per quadrat were taken on a sunny day at 0 100 cm depth with a hand auger each soil core was divided into 10 cm intervals for δd and δ18o isotopic analyses all samples were stored in a refrigerator at 15 to 20 c until soil water extraction soil water was extracted with a cryogenic vacuum distillation system west et al 2006 with extraction time of 0 5 1 5 h depending on soil water content extraction efficiency of water from soil samples was higher than 98 0 indicating that extraction was effective in obtaining un fractionated water samples west et al 2006 δd and δ18o of water samples were analyzed using an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system model dlt 100 los gatos research wen et al 2012 spectral contamination detection and correction were used and analytical precision of liquid water isotope analyzer was 0 3 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o 2 3 calculations of lc excess d excess slope of soil water evaporation line and source values lc excess is calculated using the following equation landwehr and coplen 2006 1 lc excess δ d a δ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of lmwl at each site a negative lc excess value indicates that soil water may have undergone some isotopic enrichment due to fractionation during soil evaporation sprenger et al 2016 d excess is calculated using the following equation dansgaard 1964 2 d excess δ d 8 δ 18 o d excess values of soil water will be 10 because of kinetic fractionation sprenger et al 2017 use of lc excess is more advantageous over d excess for indicating soil evaporation fractionation signals because mean lc excess of precipitation input is equal to 0 while d excess varies with δ18o and may be 10 landwehr and coplen 2006 weighted mean lc excess and d excess were obtained by weighting soil water content of each layer and using the following equations 3 d e x c e s s mean i 1 4 j 1 10 θ ij δ d ij j 1 10 θ ij 4 8 i 1 4 j 1 10 θ ij δ 18 o ij j 1 10 θ

replicates section 2 2 j is a layer in the soil profile soil water evaporation line sel is defined as the linear regression between δd and δ18o values in soil water taken from a depth profile allison 1982 5 δ d m δ 18 o n where m and n represent the slope and intercept of sel for tracing the isotopic composition of precipitation from which soil water originated the source value of soil water was calculated by the intersection points of sel with lmwl evaristo et al 2015 when there was significant difference between sel and lmwl 6 δ 18 o int e r sec t n b a m 7 δ d int e r sec t a δ 18 o int e r sec t b where m and n represent the slope and intercept of sel and a and b represent the slope and intercept of lmwl the calculated source value indicated the long term mixed source water prior to sampling namely the mixture of multiple precipitations this method is not suitable for samples collected immediately after rainfall because the sel formed by these samples is similar to lmwl note that long term direct measurements of precipitation isotopes were rarely available for the sampling sites due to their locations being far away from the hydrological monitoring station only individual observed precipitation isotopic data were obtained from the literature table s1 in gar county tp01 lhasa nearby tp07 naqu tp08 bomi nearby tp10 lanzhou nearby lp01 linfen lp09 taiyuan nearby lp10 erenhot mp01 otinday sandland nearby mp04 and xilingol league mp05 for consistency δd and δ18o of monthly precipitation for each site within the three transects were simulated using longitude latitude and elevation according to the method of bowen et al 2005 and lmwl was fitted with the simulated values the observed lmwl was fitted with the literature data simulated and observed slopes and intercepts of lmwl were compared based on the univariate analysis of a general linear model for model validation simulated results were usable because no significant differences were shown for slopes or intercepts between simulated and observed results p 0 05 table s1 δd and δ18o of observed soil water simulated precipitation as well as groundwater data sources shown in supporting information source values and fitted sel and lmwl were plotted in the dual plots to show the relationships among soil water precipitation and groundwater in tp fig s1 lp fig s2 and mp fig s3 2 4 ancillary

between water demand and supply and determines runoff and evapotranspiration rates arora 2002 vegetation variables included vegetation coverage and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which reflect the ability of plants to regulate soil water storage vegetation coverage was obtained by averaging vegetation coverage from the eight quadrats 1 1 m2 randomly established in the 100 100 m2 sampling area at every site vegetation coverage within quadrats was estimated after dividing the quadrat into 100 grids 0 1 0 1 m2 visually assessing coverage and calculating percentage of grids with vegetation field assessment was corrected using photos of quadrats li et al 2015 ndvi is particularly sensitive to lai and chlorophyll density and can be used for estimating transpiration hu et al 2018 the modis ndvi product mod13a3 which has a spatial resolution of 250 m and time resolution of 16 days was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa website https modis gsfc nasa gov data soil hydraulic properties included soil bulk density bd soil texture contents of clay silt and sand and saturated soil water content sswc which influence soil water storage

measured by weighing soil samples before and after oven drying for 24 h at 105 c a composite soil sample from 5 to 7 subsamples collected with a soil auger at 0 10 cm depth was used to analyze soil particle size in each quadrat soil particle size distributions were measured using a laser diffractometer mastersizer 2000 malvern inc after water extraction soil samples were oven dried 105 c 48 h and soil water content swc was calculated as swc cm3 cm3 fresh weight dry weight dry weight soil bulk density saturated soil water content sswc cm3 cm3 was simulated using the rosetta 3 which was used for estimating soil hydraulic parameters with hierarchical pedotransfer functions zhang and schaap 2017 relative soil water content rswc was estimated with the equation rswc swc sswc and reflected the soil residual water storage vegetation vegetation coverage and soil soil bulk density contents of clay silt and sand variables were measured and shared as part of the functional trait database of terrestrial ecosystems in china china trait he et al 2019 2 5 statistical analysis pearson correlations were calculated to describe the relationships among lc excess d excess slope climate ta rn ws rh vpd ai and p soil bd and contents of clay silt and sand and vegetation vegetation coverage and ndvi variables in each transect table s2 redundancy analysis rda was used to explore the relative contributions of climate soil and vegetation variables to lc excess d excess and slope of sel in each transect during rda analysis influencing variables with low correlation between variables and lc excess d excess and slope were gradually artificially eliminated based on collinearity and total explanation of spatial variability the univariate analysis of a general linear model was used for comparing the difference between the relationship between δd and δ18o in groundwater and lmwl pearson correlation coefficients and rda analysis were calculated using the r studio 3 5 0 and univariate analysis of a general linear model was conducted with spss 22 0 software structural equation modeling sem is a multivariate statistical method which can be used to assess causal relationships between exploratory variables by introducing some intermediate variables hu and si 2014 sem was constructed to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of specific climate soil and vegetation variables on lc excess d excess and slope in each transect at first the hypothesized causal relationships among variables were build based on prior knowledge of how climate soil and vegetation variables affect lc excess d excess and slope in each transect then we fitted the hypothesized model with the measured data and removed the non significant relationships with stepwise regression the final model that best fit our data was selected and sem models were evaluated using the chi square χ2 test p 0 05 the goodness of fit gfi index 0 8 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea index 0 001 stepwise regression was conducted with spss 22 0 software and the significance level for the tests was p 0 05 sem models were developed with amos 22 0 0 software 3 results 3 1 distributions of lc excess d excess and evaporation line slope of soil water in three transects figs 3 and 4 showed distributions from west to east of weighted mean lc excess weighted mean d excess and slope reflecting a deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from that in precipitation and their relationships in three grass transects lc excess and d excess fluctuated with a significant increasing trend p 0 05 in the three transects the slope had an increasing trend in tp p 0 05 and lp p 0 13 transects and relatively little variability in mp transect from western to eastern site there was a significant correlation between lc excess and slope and d excess and slope in tp p 0 001 and lp p 0 05 transects and no significant relationship in mp transect there was a significant correlation between lc excess and d excess in three grass transects 3 2 influencing factors of the relationship between δd and δ18o 3 2 1 tibet plateau transect the rda explained 91 6 80 6 and 83 4 of the spatial variability in respectively lc excess fig 5 a d excess fig s4a and slope fig 6 a in the tp transect specifically climate variables including rh and ws mainly explained the spatial variation in lc excess while rh explained d excess and rh vpd ai and precipitation explained slope the results of sem showed that 87 9 84 9 and 85 3 of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5b d excess fig s4b and slope fig 6b was explained respectively main influencing factors were similar for the three parameters and rh had the largest significantly positive influence on their spatial variation the effects of bd that was controlled by rh and vegetation coverage that was controlled by rh ta and bd were not significant 3 2 2 loess plateau transect rda explained 91 0 87 8 and 73 1 of the spatial variability in respectively lc excess fig 5c d excess fig s4c and slope fig 6c in the lp transect the positive interaction effect between climate rn ws and ai and vegetation vegetation coverage variables explained the largest fraction of the spatial variation in lc excess and d excess followed by vegetation coverage rh and ai were the main controlling factors for slope results of the sem models showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess fig 5d d excess fig s4d and slope fig 6d was 94 1 93 5 and 90 7 respectively positive effects of vegetation coverage that was controlled by ws and sand content on lc excess and d excess were largest followed by negative effects of net radiation the effects of bulk density that was controlled by ws were smallest and the direct effects of ai were not significant positive effects of the aridity index dominated variability in slope followed by positive effects of bd the effects of ndvi that was controlled by rn were not significant 3 2 3 inner mongolia plateau transect rda explained 86 3 91 9 and 15 4 respectively of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5e d excess fig s4e and slope fig 6e p 0 05 in the mp transect the largest fraction of the spatial variability in lc excess and d excess was explained by the positive interaction effect between climate ta rn ws and rh and vegetation vegetation coverage followed by vegetation coverage and bulk density slope did not have a significant influencing variable results of the sem models further showed that 89 1 90 5 and 25 7 of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5f d excess fig s4f and slope fig 6f was explained respectively spatial variability in lc excess and d excess were mainly determined by the positive effects of vegetation coverage that was controlled by ws and rh the direct effects of ws and bulk density on lc excess were not significant while the effects of bulk density on d excess were significant slope did not exhibit a significant influencing factor 4 discussion 4 1 indicator of the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl in theory if the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from that in precipitation is the mixed results of different precipitation signals after different evaporation fractionation trajectories lc excess and slope of sel in soil water can indicate long term integrated soil evaporation results of mixed precipitation fig 1b sprenger et al 2017 2018 in other words when soil source water is local precipitation plotting along the lmwl in dual isotope space this deviation from lmwl is only determined by soil evaporation lc excess and slope of sel has been demonstrated to reflect water evaporation in rivers or lakes bowen et al 2018 qiu et al 2016 and reflect soil evaporation in bare soils grasslands or forests when rainfall is unique recharge source evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 in our three grass transects the main soil source water is local precipitation as indicated by the source values of soil water which were within the range of precipitation isotopic data figs s1 s3 although recent rain infiltration may result in an increase in lc excess and slope of sel sprenger et al 2017 these dilution effects were not dominant in the spatial variability of lc excess and slope of sel as shown by the sem models for the three transects fig 5 fig s4 and fig 6 our results showed that lc excess appeared relatively robust compared to slope of sel based on the craig and gordon model and isotope mass balance lc excess is determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage and slope is only dominated by evaporation fractionation factors benettin et al 2018 gibson et al 2016 results of the sem models showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess and slope were similar in tp fig 5b and 6b and in lp fig 5d and 6d with a significant correlation fig 4a and 4b however results of the sem models further showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess was obviously higher than slope in mp fig 5f and 6f with no significant relationship fig 4c the above results were also supported by pearson correlation coefficients for relationships between rswc indicating soil residual water storage and lc excess or slope in tp lp and mp table 2 as the residual water storage decreasing due to soil evaporation the intensive soil tension increased equilibrium fractionation and caused isotope values to plot along with sel gaj and mcdonnell 2019 namely a gradual decrease in lc excess while the slope staying constant in mp a significant decreasing trends p 0 05 of rswc from east to west may cause an increasing soil tension this can lead to a gradual decrease in lc excess while the slope stays constant with a decreasing in rswc due to soil evaporation however rswc had no significant trends in tp and lp p 0 05 and thus evaporation fractionation factors rather than rswc dominated the spatial variability in lc excess and slope 4 2 the limitations of lc excess and slope of sel reflecting soil evaporation if soil water can be recharged by other processes besides rain infiltration such as groundwater recharge dew formation or hydraulic redistribution use of lc excess and slope of sel reflecting soil evaporation may be affected since these processes can affect soil water fractionation effects and soil residual water storage liu et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 2019 on the one hand if δd and δ18o in source waters of these recharge processes plot along the lmwl their effects on lc excess and slope of sel are similar to those of precipitation and the deviation of δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl is still determined by soil evaporation on the other hand if δd and δ18o in source waters of these processes deviate from lmwl the deviation of δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl is not only controlled by soil evaporation but also by the mixture between soil water and these source waters unfortunately in our study there are no in situ observed data on groundwater recharge dew formation and hydraulic redistribution across our three grass transects with 10 sampling sites each in tp 1500 km lp 600 km and mp 1200 km and the effects of these processes on representative of lc excess and slope of sel for soil evaporation need further verification herein we only discussed the possible effects of these processes on lc excess and slope of sel according to the existing references in our three grass transects in theory groundwater may recharge to soil water by hydraulic redistribution via plant roots capillary rise or vapor diffusion in arid and semiarid areas chen et al 2013 chen and wang 2017 priyadarshini et al 2016 the dominant herbaceous vegetation was shallow rooted with 76 of root biomass in the surface soil 0 50 cm except for mp01 with 64 based on our in situ measurement however groundwater sourced from external water deviating from lmwl still may recharge to soil water in some areas although our sites characterized with deep groundwater levels and shallow roots especially in lp04 05 or mp01 05 it was possible that slope was overestimated and lc excess was underestimated due to the recharge of groundwater locating below the lmwl to subsoil water by capillary rise or vapor diffusion in our tp transect groundwater levels are 32 5 m in the west jian et al 2007 and groundwater recharging to soil water is negligible since groundwater levels are deep and far away from the surface soil 1 m zhang et al 2019 groundwater levels are 4 17 m in the middle liu et al 2018 and 3 95 4 80 m in the east dai et al 2019 groundwater recharging to soil water may be more likely to occur during the wet season from june to september due to the higher groundwater level dai et al 2019 liu et al 2018 groundwater isotopes during the wet season were similar to the weighted mean local precipitation isotopes δp in the tp06 and tp07 of middle while they were more negative than δp in the tp04 and tp05 of middle and more positive than δp in the east fig s1 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the middle n 40 and east n 12 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the tp04 and tp05 of middle and more enriched precipitation in the east respectively according to the source values of soil water although groundwater may be soil source water in the tp04 and tp05 lc excess and slope was still determined by soil evaporation of mixed source water in our lp transect groundwater levels are 9 4 10 5 m in the west tan et al 2017 3 50 m in the middle he et al 2015 and no data in the east however yasuda et al 2013 found that soil water can be recharged by the upwelling of deep circulating groundwater in liudaogo basin nearby ordos basin which locates in the north of the middle with recharge ratio recharge precipitation of 0 309 0 942 during the wet season due to the higher groundwater level and stronger evapotranspiration groundwater isotopes were more negative than δp in the west and east while they were similar to the δp in the middle fig s2 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the west n 109 middle n 95 and east n 13 but note that some δd and δ18o in groundwater in the lp04 and lp05 sites nearby ordos basin were below the lmwl chen et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the west and east and have other source water besides precipitation in lp04 and lp05 subsoil water in the lp04 and lp05 sites may be recharged by groundwater locating below the lmwl and that may cause lc excess decreasing and slope increasing and even the spike in slope in lp05 in our mp transect groundwater levels are 2 m in the west zhan et al 2017 4 15 m in the middle yang et al 2009 and 2 9 m in the east fu et al 2016 the existing studies showed that soil water in dali lake and hulun lake which locates in xilin hot basin during april to september ma et al 2014 and in erenhot basin during april to august zhan et al 2017 can be recharged by the deep circulating groundwater groundwater isotopes were more negative than δp in the west and middle while they were similar to the δp in the east fig s3 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the west n 75 middle n 18 and east n 66 but δd and δ18o in groundwater in mp01 03 of erenhot basin and mp04 05 of xilin hot basin were slightly below the lmwl yang et al 2009 zhan et al 2017 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the west and middle but have other source water besides precipitation in mp01 05 subsoil water in mp01 05 may be recharged by groundwater locating below the lmwl and cause relatively little variability in slope from west to east fig 3 however lc excess and slope were dominated by soil evaporation since rswc had a significant decreasing trends and lc excess can be mainly explained by vegetation coverage with 89 1 in theory dew can recharge to soil water by atmospheric water vapor mainly condensing on the soil particles surface at 0 5 cm depths due to air relative humidity reaching saturation guo and han 2002 meng and wen 2016 or water vapor of groundwater evaporation near plant roots due to the low temperature layer near the surface zhang et al 2015 although the amount of dew was less than that of precipitation soil evaporation indicated by lc excess and slope of sel may be overestimated when dew locating below the lmwl can largely recharge to soil water or underestimated when dew locating above the lmwl can largely recharge to soil water according to the existing studies dew water accounted for about 12 5 16 5 of precipitation in august and september wang et al 2012 in the middle of our tp transect soil water at 0 5 cm depths or near plant roots may be recharged by dew although the increase in rswc lc excess and slope at 0 100 cm may be the reason of precipitation input r2 between precipitation and rswc lc excess or slope were 0 90 0 89 and 0 92 respectively in the middle of tp in the middle of our lp transect dew water accounted for about 6 0 15 0 in a whole year and there was the lowest amount approximately 2 mm in summer zhang et al 2015 in the middle of our mp transect dew water only accounted for about 3 61 4 72 in a whole year moreover δd and δ18o in dew plotted along below or above the lmwl depending on whether its water vapor sources are similar to that of precipitation he and richards 2015 liu et al 2020 zhu and jiang 2016 however the data of dew formation was shortage in west and east in our tp lp and mp transect and need further verification 4 3 interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation on lc excess in the three transects our results showed that the weighted mean lc excess had a significant increasing trend and soil evaporation indicated by lc excess which was greater when lc excess was more negative had a significant decline trend from west to east fig 3 with different primary influencing factors in the three transects in our tp transect relative humidity directly controlled the variation in soil evaporation fig 5b which can affect the vapor gradient between the soil and the atmosphere rothfuss et al 2015 although the direct effects of vegetation coverage and soil bulk density on soil evaporation were not significant vegetation coverage was controlled by relative humidity and temperature that can affect plants transpiration and photosynthesis baldocchi 2019 and soil bulk density was controlled by relative humidity that can affect soil organic carbon density by regulating microbial decomposition zhao et al 2019 meanwhile vegetation coverage also was affected by soil bulk density that can affect water retention and the preservation of nutrients zhao et al 2019 in comparison vegetation coverage directly controlled the variation in soil evaporation in our lp fig 5d and mp fig 5f transect which can generate a microclimate with higher relative humidity lower ground temperature and lower radiation input feng et al 2014 in lp net radiation and bulk density also controlled the variation in soil evaporation since net radiation can affect available energy between the soil and atmosphere kool et al 2014 and bulk density can affect the water vapor diffusion gaj and mcdonnell 2019 in addition vegetation coverage was controlled by wind speed and sand content in lp and by wind speed and relative humidity in mp wind speed can affect transpiration and photosynthesis baldocchi 2019 and sand content can affect water retention and the preservation of nutrients zhao et al 2019 meanwhile soil bulk density in lp was controlled by wind speed that can affect erosion processes zhao et al 2019 however the shortage of information on soil variables at 10 100 cm soil depth was disadvantageous to our ability to interpret effects of soil variables on evaporation tibetan plateau is an ecologically fragile region and it is sensitive to climate change due to its special geographical location chen et al 2015 in tp vpd a strong indicator of atmospheric demand is expected to increase by 10 38 in the future ding et al 2018 air temperature has shown an increasing trend of 0 3 0 4 per 10 years chen et al 2015 variability in these climatic factors may increase atmospheric demand and lead to an increase in the deficit of soil available water after intensified soil evaporation in comparison vegetation coverage can be greatly increased with restoration efforts of the grain for green project in loess plateau deng et al 2014 or with fencing in inner mongolia plateau yao et al 2018 soil evaporation may decrease with increasing vegetation restoration but increasing root water uptake may lead to soil desiccation feng et al 2014 in future soil evaporation might increase in response to the increasing atmospheric demand in tp and decrease in response to the increasing vegetation restoration in lp and mp a suitable ratio between soil evaporation and plant transpiration need to be found for improving soil water availability in arid and semi arid regions 5 conclusions we showed that the efficacy of lc excess to represent the long term integrative results of the soil evaporation process may be more robust than that of slope of sel due to the high sensitivity of lc excess to soil residual water storage and soil water evaporation fractionation factors moreover our results showed that soil evaporation indicated by the weighted mean lc excess had a significant decline trend from west to east in the three transects based on rda and sem the significant and positive effects of relative humidity on the spatial variation in soil evaporation process were the largest in the tp transect and the positive effects of vegetation coverage were the largest in the lp and mp transects our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in tp and vegetation restoration in lp and mp credit authorship contribution statement sidan lyu conceptualization methodology

4402,soil evaporation plays an important role in non productive water loss and local climate regulation the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in surface soil water from that in precipitation is used to indicate the integrative results of the soil evaporation process but the distinction between the slope of the soil water evaporation line sel and line conditioned excess lc excess as individual indicators has not been identified furthermore spatial variability and interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation on soil evaporation in arid and semi arid grasslands remain poorly understood we established 3 west to east sampling transects along with increasing precipitation and decreasing aridity index gradients in grasslands of the tibetan tp 1500 km loess lp 600 km and inner mongolia mp 1200 km plateaus slope of sel and weighted mean lc excess were calculated according to the δd and δ18o in soil water which was extracted from soils collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m along with soil profiles during the vigorous growing season we found that lc excess appeared relatively more robust than slope in representing soil evaporation process because lc excess was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage while slope was regulated only by evaporation fractionation factors soil evaporation as indicated by lc excess exhibited decreasing trends from west to east and was controlled by relative humidity in tp and by vegetation coverage in lp and mp our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in tp and vegetation restoration in lp and mp keywords soil evaporation stable isotope soil water evaporation line lc excess grass transect 1 introduction grasslands account for nearly 30 of the earth s land surface and cover about 40 of total land area in china berdugo et al 2020 grasslands in the tibetan tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateau locating in arid and semi arid zones together account for about 78 of the total grassland area in china zhou et al 2014 grasslands sustain the livelihoods of large populations and their gross primary productivity is highly related to ecohydrological processes chen et al 2019 however nearly 90 of these grasslands have been degraded to some extent due to climate change or over grazing xu et al 2014 in grasslands soil water plays an important role in water availability and nutrient supply for plants growth and in climate regulation mccoll et al 2017 δd and δ18o in soil water are widely used as ideal tracers of ecohydrological processes since they reflect the long term integrated results of rain infiltration plants transpiration and soil evaporation etc fig 1 a rain infiltration can change the isotopic composition and soil residual water storage by mixing with pre event soil water sprenger et al 2016 root water uptake for plants transpiration does not typically alter the isotopic composition of soil water although some halophytes or woody xerophytes change δd of soil water dawson and ehleringer 1991 ellsworth and williams 2007 soil evaporation results in soil water becoming enriched in heavy isotopes by lighter i e 1h2 16o water isotopes evaporating from the liquid phase and diffusing to gaseous phase at faster speeds than heavier i e 1h2 18o and hd16o water isotopes fig 1a in addition if groundwater recharge dew formation or hydraulic redistribution occur the isotopic composition and soil residual water storage also can be changed liu et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 2019 soil evaporation can increase non productive soil water loss and adjust local climate by cooling the surface or increasing concentrations of atmospheric water vapor hirschi et al 2011 long term high soil evaporation leads to the distinct isotopic signals between soil water and precipitation and the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water deviating from that in precipitation fig 1b this deviation is described by the slope of soil water evaporation line sel allison 1982 deuterium excess d excess gat 1996 and line conditioned excess lc excess landwehr and coplen 2006 which is generally used for indicating the long term integrated soil evaporation effects of mixed source waters formed by multiple rainfall events sel is defined as a regression line fitted by δd and δ18o in soil water allison 1982 d excess and lc excess are defined as a function of the slope and intercept of global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl dansgaard 1964 respectively however lc excess or d excess and slope of sel are often separately used to indicate the integrative results of soil evaporation process of mixed source water over a period of time while their distinction has been identified limitedly landwehr and coplen 2006 rothfuss et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 landwehr and coplen 2006 demonstrated that use of lc excess is more advantageous over d excess for indicating soil evaporation fractionation signals some studies only used slope of sel for reflecting soil evaporation effects and found slope was mainly regulated by evaporation fractionation factors related to temperature relative humidity and diffusion coefficient etc gibson et al 2008 rothfuss et al 2015 most studies used lc excess which was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage for reflecting soil evaporation effects and only showed slope of sel as auxiliary data while their relationship and differences were not investigated hasselquist et al 2018 sprenger et al 2017 in theory lc excess or d excess and slope of sel are controlled by soil evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage which are influenced by the interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation moreover most research on how climate soil and vegetation affect lc excess or d excess and slope of sel have been tested at a single site using multiple samplings gaj and mcdonnell 2019 hasselquist et al 2018 oerter et al 2014 but research from multiple sites are limited gibson et al 2008 sprenger et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 found lc excess of soil water among five long term experimental forest catchments along with a temperature and wetness gradient was different due to soil evaporation fractionation and dominated by volume of antecedent precipitation and temperature and higher beneath conifer trees than that beneath heather shrubs gibson et al 2008 estimated global distributions of slope of sel in shallow soil water with a steady state isotope balance model and found they exhibited a latitudinal trend related to seasonal temperature and humidity therefore we established one sampling grass transect with 10 sampling sites each in the tibetan tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateau from west to east coinciding with the increasing precipitation decreasing aridity gradients and variable soil and vegetation types lc excess d excess and slope of sel were calculated based on soil samples collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m at every site in our study we test the following hypothesizes 1 lc excess is more robust than slope of sel and d excess in representing the long term integrative results of soil evaporation process due to its high sensitivity to soil residual water storage and soil evaporation fractionation factors and 2 soil evaporation indicated by lc excess is controlled by climate in tp due to its sensitivity to climate change and by vegetation in lp and mp due to vegetation restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling transects in the tibet loess and inner mongolia plateaus we established sampling transects in three grassland areas tibet tp loess lp and inner mongolia mp plateaus tp has a severe continental climate with high variability the area is cold and arid in the northwest and warm and humid in the southeast chen et al 2015 lp has a typical arid and semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate and an extremely fragmented hilly loess landscape yue et al 2019 most areas in the mp are classified as arid or semi arid continental climate cheng et al 2016 sampling transects were established from west to east in tp 1500 km lp 600 km and mp 1200 km respectively for each transect 10 sampling sites were selected at an interval of about 60 150 km from west to east numbered from 01 to 10 fig 2 from west to east there is a significant increasing trend in annual average precipitation map in all three transects annual average relative humidity rh in tp and lp and annual average temperature mat in lp there is a significant decreasing trend in aridity index ai in all three transects and annual potential evapotranspiration pet in tp table 1 soil types in the three transects include loamy sand loam sandy loam and silty loam and grassland types include desert steppe typical steppe and meadow steppe 2 2 soil sampling and isotopic analysis of soil water soil sampling and vegetation surveys were conducted once at each site during the vigorous growing season in july and august in 2018 tp 26 july 03 august lp 12 august 20 august mp 05 july 14 july at each site of our tp lp and mp transects a 100 100 m2 sampling area was selected for soil sampling and vegetation surveys and eight quadrats 1 1 m2 were randomly established in the sampling area there were no surface waters such as streams and lakes within 3 km of sampling areas for soil water isotope samples four of eight quadrats in the 100 100 m2 sampling area were randomly chosen and one soil core per quadrat were taken on a sunny day at 0 100 cm depth with a hand auger each soil core was divided into 10 cm intervals for δd and δ18o isotopic analyses all samples were stored in a refrigerator at 15 to 20 c until soil water extraction soil water was extracted with a cryogenic vacuum distillation system west et al 2006 with extraction time of 0 5 1 5 h depending on soil water content extraction efficiency of water from soil samples was higher than 98 0 indicating that extraction was effective in obtaining un fractionated water samples west et al 2006 δd and δ18o of water samples were analyzed using an isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system model dlt 100 los gatos research wen et al 2012 spectral contamination detection and correction were used and analytical precision of liquid water isotope analyzer was 0 3 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o 2 3 calculations of lc excess d excess slope of soil water evaporation line and source values lc excess is calculated using the following equation landwehr and coplen 2006 1 lc excess δ d a δ 18 o b where a and b represent the slope and intercept of lmwl at each site a negative lc excess value indicates that soil water may have undergone some isotopic enrichment due to fractionation during soil evaporation sprenger et al 2016 d excess is calculated using the following equation dansgaard 1964 2 d excess δ d 8 δ 18 o d excess values of soil water will be 10 because of kinetic fractionation sprenger et al 2017 use of lc excess is more advantageous over d excess for indicating soil evaporation fractionation signals because mean lc excess of precipitation input is equal to 0 while d excess varies with δ18o and may be 10 landwehr and coplen 2006 weighted mean lc excess and d excess were obtained by weighting soil water content of each layer and using the following equations 3 d e x c e s s mean i 1 4 j 1 10 θ ij δ d ij j 1 10 θ ij 4 8 i 1 4 j 1 10 θ ij δ 18 o ij j 1 10 θ

replicates section 2 2 j is a layer in the soil profile soil water evaporation line sel is defined as the linear regression between δd and δ18o values in soil water taken from a depth profile allison

sampling namely the mixture of multiple precipitations this method is not suitable for samples collected immediately after rainfall because the sel formed by these samples is similar to lmwl note that long term direct measurements of precipitation isotopes were rarely available for the sampling sites due to their locations being far away from the hydrological monitoring station only individual observed precipitation isotopic data were obtained from the literature table s1 in gar county tp01 lhasa nearby tp07 naqu tp08 bomi nearby tp10 lanzhou nearby lp01 linfen lp09 taiyuan nearby lp10

intercepts of lmwl were compared based on the univariate analysis of a general linear model for model validation simulated results were usable because no significant differences were shown for slopes

reflect the ability of plants to regulate soil water storage vegetation coverage was obtained by averaging vegetation coverage from the eight quadrats 1 1 m2 randomly established in the 100 100 m2 sampling area at every site vegetation coverage within quadrats was estimated after dividing the quadrat into 100 grids 0 1 0 1 m2 visually assessing coverage and calculating percentage of grids with vegetation field assessment was corrected using photos of quadrats li et al 2015 ndvi is particularly sensitive to lai and chlorophyll density and can be used for estimating transpiration hu et al 2018 the modis ndvi product mod13a3 which has a spatial resolution of 250 m and time resolution of 16 days was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa website https modis gsfc nasa gov data soil hydraulic properties included soil bulk density bd soil texture contents of clay silt and sand and saturated soil water content sswc which influence soil water storage

measured by weighing soil samples before and after oven drying for 24 h at 105 c a composite soil sample from 5 to 7 subsamples collected with a soil auger at 0 10 cm depth was used to analyze soil

vpd ai and p soil bd and contents of clay silt and sand and vegetation vegetation coverage and ndvi variables in each transect table s2 redundancy analysis rda was used to explore the relative contributions of climate soil and vegetation variables to lc excess d excess and slope of sel in each transect during rda analysis influencing variables with low correlation between variables and lc excess d excess and slope were gradually artificially eliminated based on collinearity and total explanation of spatial variability the univariate analysis of a general linear model was used for comparing the difference between the relationship between δd and δ18o in groundwater and lmwl pearson correlation coefficients and rda analysis were calculated using the r studio 3 5 0 and univariate analysis of a general linear model was conducted with spss 22 0 software structural equation modeling sem is a multivariate statistical method which can be used to assess causal relationships between exploratory variables by introducing some intermediate variables hu and si 2014 sem was constructed to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of specific climate soil and vegetation variables on lc excess d excess and slope in each transect at first the hypothesized causal relationships among variables were build based on prior knowledge of how climate soil and vegetation variables affect lc excess d excess and slope in each transect then we fitted the hypothesized model with the measured data and removed the non significant relationships with stepwise regression the final model that best fit our data was selected and sem models were evaluated using the chi square χ2 test p 0 05 the goodness of fit gfi index 0 8 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea index 0 001 stepwise regression was conducted with spss 22 0 software and the significance level for the tests was p 0 05 sem models were developed with amos 22 0 0 software 3 results 3 1 distributions of lc excess d excess and evaporation line slope of soil water in three transects figs 3 and 4 showed distributions from west to east of weighted mean lc excess weighted mean d excess and slope reflecting a deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from that in precipitation and their relationships in three grass transects lc excess and d excess fluctuated with a significant increasing trend p 0 05 in the three transects the slope had an increasing trend in tp p 0 05 and lp p 0 13 transects and relatively little variability in mp transect from western to eastern site there was a significant correlation between lc excess and slope and d excess and slope in tp p 0 001 and lp p 0 05 transects and no significant relationship in mp transect there was a significant correlation between lc excess and d excess in three grass transects 3 2 influencing factors of the relationship between δd and δ18o 3 2 1 tibet plateau transect the rda explained 91 6 80 6 and 83 4 of the spatial variability in respectively lc excess fig 5 a d excess fig s4a and slope fig 6 a in the tp transect specifically climate variables including rh and ws mainly explained the spatial variation in lc excess while rh explained d excess and rh vpd ai and precipitation explained slope the results of sem showed that 87 9 84 9 and 85 3 of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5b d excess fig s4b and slope fig 6b was explained respectively main influencing factors were similar for the three parameters and rh had the largest significantly positive influence on their spatial variation the effects of bd that was controlled by rh and vegetation coverage that was controlled by rh ta and bd were not significant 3 2 2 loess plateau transect rda explained 91 0 87 8 and 73 1 of the spatial variability in respectively lc excess fig 5c d excess fig s4c and slope fig 6c in the lp transect the positive interaction effect between climate rn ws and ai and vegetation vegetation coverage variables explained the largest fraction of the spatial variation in lc excess and d excess followed by vegetation coverage rh and ai were the main controlling factors for slope results of the sem models showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess fig 5d d excess fig s4d and slope fig 6d was 94 1 93 5 and 90 7 respectively positive effects of vegetation coverage that was controlled by ws and sand content on lc excess and d excess were largest followed by negative effects of net radiation the effects of bulk density that was controlled by ws were smallest and the direct effects of ai were not significant positive effects of the aridity index dominated variability in slope followed by positive effects of bd the effects of ndvi that was controlled by rn were not significant 3 2 3 inner mongolia plateau transect rda explained 86 3 91 9 and 15 4 respectively of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5e d excess fig s4e and slope fig 6e p 0 05 in the mp transect the largest fraction of the spatial variability in lc excess and d excess was explained by the positive interaction effect between climate ta rn ws and rh and vegetation vegetation coverage followed by vegetation coverage and bulk density slope did not have a significant influencing variable results of the sem models further showed that 89 1 90 5 and 25 7 of the spatial variability in lc excess fig 5f d excess fig s4f and slope fig 6f was explained respectively spatial variability in lc excess and d excess were mainly determined by the positive effects of vegetation coverage that was controlled by ws and rh the direct effects of ws and bulk density on lc excess were not significant while the effects of bulk density on d excess were significant slope did not exhibit a significant influencing factor 4 discussion 4 1 indicator of the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl in theory if the deviation of the relationship between δd and δ18o in soil water from that in precipitation is the mixed results of different precipitation signals after different evaporation fractionation trajectories lc excess and slope of sel in soil water can indicate long term integrated soil evaporation results of mixed precipitation fig 1b sprenger et al 2017 2018 in other words when soil source water is local precipitation plotting along the lmwl in dual isotope space this deviation from lmwl is only determined by soil evaporation lc excess and slope of sel has been demonstrated to reflect water evaporation in rivers or lakes bowen et al 2018 qiu et al 2016 and reflect soil evaporation in bare soils grasslands or forests when rainfall is unique recharge source evaristo et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 in our three grass transects the main soil source water is local precipitation as indicated by the source values of soil water which were within the range of precipitation isotopic data figs s1 s3 although recent rain infiltration may result in an increase in lc excess and slope of sel sprenger et al 2017 these dilution effects were not dominant in the spatial variability of lc excess and slope of sel as shown by the sem models for the three transects fig 5 fig s4 and fig 6 our results showed that lc excess appeared relatively robust compared to slope of sel based on the craig and gordon model and isotope mass balance lc excess is determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage and slope is only dominated by evaporation fractionation factors benettin et al 2018 gibson et al 2016 results of the sem models showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess and slope were similar in tp fig 5b and 6b and in lp fig 5d and 6d with a significant correlation fig 4a and 4b however results of the sem models further showed that the percent of explained spatial variability in lc excess was obviously higher than slope in mp fig 5f and 6f with no significant relationship fig 4c the above results were also supported by pearson correlation coefficients for relationships between rswc indicating soil residual water storage and lc excess or slope in tp lp and mp table 2 as the residual water storage decreasing due to soil evaporation the intensive soil tension increased equilibrium fractionation and caused isotope values to plot along with sel gaj and mcdonnell 2019 namely a gradual decrease in lc excess while the slope staying constant in mp a significant decreasing trends p 0 05 of rswc from east to west may cause an increasing soil tension this can lead to a gradual decrease in lc excess while the slope stays constant with a decreasing in rswc due to soil evaporation however rswc had no significant trends in tp and lp p 0 05 and thus evaporation fractionation factors rather than rswc dominated the spatial variability in lc excess and slope 4 2 the limitations of lc excess and slope of sel reflecting soil evaporation if soil water can be recharged by other processes besides rain infiltration such as groundwater recharge dew formation or hydraulic redistribution use of lc excess and slope of sel reflecting soil evaporation may be affected since these processes can affect soil water fractionation effects and soil residual water storage liu et al 2020 zhan et al 2017 2019 on the one hand if δd and δ18o in source waters of these recharge processes plot along the lmwl their effects on lc excess and slope of sel are similar to those of precipitation and the deviation of δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl is still determined by soil evaporation on the other hand if δd and δ18o in source waters of these processes deviate from lmwl the deviation of δd and δ18o in soil water from lmwl is not only controlled by soil evaporation but also by the mixture between soil water and these source waters unfortunately in our study there are no in situ observed data on groundwater recharge dew formation and hydraulic redistribution across our three grass transects with 10 sampling sites each in tp 1500 km lp 600 km and mp 1200 km and the effects of these processes on representative of lc excess and slope of sel for soil evaporation need further verification herein we only discussed the possible effects of these processes on lc excess and slope of sel according to the existing references in our three grass transects in theory groundwater may recharge to soil water by hydraulic redistribution via plant roots capillary rise or vapor diffusion in arid and semiarid areas chen et al 2013 chen and wang 2017 priyadarshini et al 2016 the dominant herbaceous vegetation was shallow rooted with 76 of root biomass in the surface soil 0 50 cm except for mp01 with 64 based on our in situ measurement however groundwater sourced from external water deviating from lmwl still may recharge to soil water in some areas although our sites characterized with deep groundwater levels and shallow roots especially in lp04 05 or mp01 05 it was possible that slope was overestimated and lc excess was underestimated due to the recharge of groundwater locating below the lmwl to subsoil water by capillary rise or vapor diffusion in our tp transect groundwater levels are 32 5 m in the west jian et al 2007 and groundwater recharging to soil water is negligible since groundwater levels are deep and far away from the surface soil 1 m zhang et al 2019 groundwater levels are 4 17 m in the middle liu et al 2018 and 3 95 4 80 m in the east dai et al 2019 groundwater recharging to soil water may be more likely to occur during the wet season from june to september due to the higher groundwater level dai et al 2019 liu et al 2018 groundwater isotopes during the wet season were similar to the weighted mean local precipitation isotopes δp in the tp06 and tp07 of middle while they were more negative than δp in the tp04 and tp05 of middle and more positive than δp in the east fig s1 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the middle n 40 and east n 12 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the tp04 and tp05 of middle and more enriched precipitation in the east respectively according to the source values of soil water although groundwater may be soil source water in the tp04 and tp05 lc excess and slope was still determined by soil evaporation of mixed source water in our lp transect groundwater levels are 9 4 10 5 m in the west tan et al 2017 3 50 m in the middle he et al 2015 and no data in the east however yasuda et al 2013 found that soil water can be recharged by the upwelling of deep circulating groundwater in liudaogo basin nearby ordos basin which locates in the north of the middle with recharge ratio recharge precipitation of 0 309 0 942 during the wet season due to the higher groundwater level and stronger evapotranspiration groundwater isotopes were more negative than δp in the west and east while they were similar to the δp in the middle fig s2 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the west n 109 middle n 95 and east n 13 but note that some δd and δ18o in groundwater in the lp04 and lp05 sites nearby ordos basin were below the lmwl chen et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the west and east and have other source water besides precipitation in lp04 and lp05 subsoil water in the lp04 and lp05 sites may be recharged by groundwater locating below the lmwl and that may cause lc excess decreasing and slope increasing and even the spike in slope in lp05 in our mp transect groundwater levels are 2 m in the west zhan et al 2017 4 15 m in the middle yang et al 2009 and 2 9 m in the east fu et al 2016 the existing studies showed that soil water in dali lake and hulun lake which locates in xilin hot basin during april to september ma et al 2014 and in erenhot basin during april to august zhan et al 2017 can be recharged by the deep circulating groundwater groundwater isotopes were more negative than δp in the west and middle while they were similar to the δp in the east fig s3 however there was no significant difference between δd and δ18o relationship in groundwater and lmwl in the west n 75 middle n 18 and east n 66 but δd and δ18o in groundwater in mp01 03 of erenhot basin and mp04 05 of xilin hot basin were slightly below the lmwl yang et al 2009 zhan et al 2017 therefore primary source water of groundwater may be more depleted precipitation in the west and middle but have other source water besides precipitation in mp01 05 subsoil water in mp01 05 may be recharged by groundwater locating below the lmwl and cause relatively little variability in slope from west to east fig 3 however lc excess and slope were dominated by soil evaporation since rswc had a significant decreasing trends and lc excess can be mainly explained by vegetation coverage with 89 1 in theory dew can recharge to soil water by atmospheric water vapor mainly condensing on the soil particles surface at 0 5 cm depths due to air relative humidity reaching saturation guo and han 2002 meng and wen 2016 or water vapor of groundwater evaporation near plant roots due to the low temperature layer near the surface zhang et al 2015 although the amount of dew was less than that of precipitation soil evaporation indicated by lc excess and slope of sel may be overestimated when dew locating below the lmwl can largely recharge to soil water or underestimated when dew locating above the lmwl can largely recharge to soil water according to the existing studies dew water accounted for about 12 5 16 5 of precipitation in august and september wang et al 2012 in the middle of our tp transect soil water at 0 5 cm depths or near plant roots may be recharged by dew although the increase in rswc lc excess and slope at 0 100 cm may be the reason of precipitation input r2 between precipitation and rswc lc excess or slope were 0 90 0 89 and 0 92 respectively in the middle of tp in the middle of our lp transect dew water accounted for about 6 0 15 0 in a whole year and there was the lowest amount approximately 2 mm in summer zhang et al 2015 in the middle of our mp transect dew water only accounted for about 3 61 4 72 in a whole year moreover δd and δ18o in dew plotted along below or above the lmwl depending on whether its water vapor sources are similar to that of precipitation he and richards 2015 liu et al 2020 zhu and jiang 2016 however the data of dew formation was shortage in west and east in our tp lp and mp transect and need further verification 4 3 interaction effects of climate soil and vegetation on lc excess in the three transects our results showed that the weighted mean lc excess had a significant increasing trend and soil evaporation indicated by lc excess which was greater when lc excess was more negative had a significant decline trend from west to east fig 3 with different primary influencing factors in the three transects in our tp transect relative humidity directly controlled the variation in soil evaporation fig 5b which can affect the vapor gradient between the soil and the atmosphere rothfuss et al 2015 although the direct effects of vegetation coverage and soil bulk density on soil evaporation were not significant vegetation coverage was controlled by relative humidity and temperature that can affect plants transpiration and photosynthesis baldocchi 2019 and soil bulk density was controlled by relative humidity that can affect soil organic carbon density by regulating microbial decomposition zhao et al 2019 meanwhile vegetation coverage also was affected by soil bulk density that can affect water retention and the preservation of nutrients zhao et al 2019 in comparison vegetation coverage directly controlled the variation in soil evaporation in our lp fig 5d and mp fig 5f transect which can generate a microclimate with higher relative humidity lower ground temperature and lower radiation input feng et al 2014 in lp net radiation and bulk density also controlled the variation in soil evaporation since net radiation can affect available energy between the soil and atmosphere kool et al 2014 and bulk density can affect the water vapor diffusion gaj and mcdonnell 2019 in addition vegetation coverage was controlled by wind speed and sand content in lp and by wind speed and relative humidity in mp wind speed can affect transpiration and photosynthesis baldocchi 2019 and sand content can affect water retention and the preservation of nutrients zhao et al 2019 meanwhile soil bulk density in lp was controlled by wind speed that can affect erosion processes zhao et al 2019 however the shortage of information on soil variables at 10 100 cm soil depth was disadvantageous to our ability to interpret effects of soil variables on evaporation tibetan plateau is an ecologically fragile region and it is sensitive to climate change due to its special geographical location chen et al 2015 in tp vpd a strong indicator of atmospheric demand is expected to increase by 10 38 in the future ding et al 2018 air temperature has shown an increasing trend of 0 3 0 4 per 10 years chen et al 2015 variability in these climatic factors may increase atmospheric demand and lead to an increase in the deficit of soil available water after intensified soil evaporation in comparison vegetation coverage can be greatly increased with restoration efforts of the grain for green project in loess plateau deng et al 2014 or with fencing in inner mongolia plateau yao et al 2018 soil evaporation may decrease with increasing vegetation restoration but increasing root water uptake may lead to soil desiccation feng et al 2014 in future soil evaporation might increase in response to the increasing atmospheric demand in tp and decrease in response to the increasing vegetation restoration in lp and mp a suitable ratio between soil evaporation and plant transpiration need to be found for improving soil water availability in arid and semi arid regions 5 conclusions we showed that the efficacy of lc excess to represent the long term integrative results of the soil evaporation process may be more robust than that of slope of sel due to the high sensitivity of lc excess to soil residual water storage and soil water evaporation fractionation factors moreover our results showed that soil evaporation indicated by the weighted mean lc excess had a significant decline trend from west to east in the three transects based on rda and sem the significant and positive effects of relative humidity on the spatial variation in soil evaporation process were the largest in the tp transect and the positive effects of vegetation coverage were the largest in the lp and mp transects our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in tp and vegetation restoration in lp and mp credit authorship contribution statement sidan lyu conceptualization methodology

4403,climate variability influences both water quantity and quality in lakes and rivers e g shifts in salinity caused by changes in the evaporation precipitation ratio however knowledge about climate and human influences on water quality in some regions is scarce which causes uncertainty when evaluating water resources and developing water management plans we measured the chemical composition and stable isotope values δd and δ18o in water samples from the ili balkhash basin arid central asia to investigate factors that control hydrologic processes in the area and explore how the arid environment influences local hydrochemistry and water resources isotope values in lake waters 24 1 δd and 1 5 δ18o are enriched relative to river waters 84 6 δd and 12 4 δ18o indicating that lake waters experience intense evaporation in the upstream ili river waters with lowest δd and δ18o values are supplied mainly by glacial ice and snow melt whereas lower reaches of the river are affected increasingly by evaporation and human water extraction waters of the ili river and other small rivers that drain to lake balkhash are chemically similar and of the ca hco3 type gibbs diagrams indicate that mineral weathering is the key process that controls river water chemistry on average carbonate and silicate weathering contribute 55 1 and 26 7 respectively to the total dissolved ion load in the river waters illustrating the strong control that regional geology exerts on streamwater chemistry in contrast lake waters are characterized as na cl type which results mainly from evaporation and some evaporite dissolution weathering in the area is controlled by climate i e precipitation and temperature moreover a negative correlation between lake water total dissolved solids and d excess and a systematic increase in chemical concentrations and stable isotope values downstream in the ili river reflect the fact that arid climate conditions promote evaporation and affect water quality pca analysis and mass balance calculation of water chemistry suggests that humans contribute only 6 6 of the major ion load to waters which display increasing concentrations in the middle and downstream regions there effects of human mediated weathering and transport of salts from agricultural irrigation are reinforced by higher temperatures and evaporation keywords ili balkhash basin arid central asia hydrochemistry climate effects anthropogenic impact 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions cover approximately one third of the world s land area and are inhabited by almost 400 million people williams 1999 in these dry regions lakes and rivers are important water resources but are sensitive to natural and human induced changes in their watersheds ongoing climate change and increasing human pressures there will negatively affect future water availability central asia is considered a hot spot for climate change karthe et al 2017 and regional climate models suggest that temperature there will continue to increase in the 21st century at a rate faster than the average global increase mannig et al 2013 shahgedanova 2016 this is expected to have serious consequences for the region s water resources because rivers in central asia begin in the mountains where 90 of total runoff originates viviroli and weingartner 2004 climate variability affects not only water quantity but also water quality e g higher salinity results from evaporative concentration of dissolved ions moreover human mediated hydrologic alterations in central asia e g agricultural irrigation frequently occur in downstream parts of catchments where they can cause water quality impairment karthe et al 2017 under conditions of intensifying water scarcity there has been a tendency to treat water quantity and water quality issues independently or to dismiss considerations of water quality entirely this approach ignores the importance of water quality in determining how much water is available for specific uses declines in water quality reduce the usable water quantity as surely as does drought to develop management plans for times of water scarcity therefore both hydrologic and geochemical data are essential the ili balkhash basin located in central asia is characterized by an arid climate the ili river emerges from the tianshan mountains in china and flows into lake balkhash kazakhstan the river is fed mainly by snow and glacier meltwaters in mountain areas 60 of the total runoff and provides 78 of the total inflow to the lake propastin 2012 lake balkhash is one of the largest lakes in the world and has become increasingly saline as water input has declined because of higher temperatures and human water diversion for agricultural irrigation climate changes and human activities may also contribute to water quality degradation previous studies were devoted to water level fluctuations and salt formation in the lake and hydrological changes of the ili river kezer and matsuyama 2006 dzhetimov et al 2013 duan et al 2020 few studies have investigated the water chemistry in different segments of the ili river and in the lake no research has attempted to distinguish between natural climate and human mediated effects on surface waters in the region this study was designed to 1 identify and describe spatial variations in hydrochemistry of the ili balkhash basin and 2 distinguish and quantify the influences of climate and human activities on hydrochemical conditions our findings will contribute to formulation of a sound water resources management plan for this arid region 2 study area lake balkhash is a large hydrologically closed and slightly saline lake in southwest kazakhstan fig 1 it is the third largest inland lake in asia with a mean surface area of 1 7 104 km2 and a volume of 87 7 km3 propastin 2012 the lake has a length of 605 km and its water level ranged between 340 5 and 344 4 m asl during the gauged period 1980 2000 propastin 2012 the lake receives 84 of its input water from river inflows sala et al 2020 of the total river inflow 78 comes from the ili river which plays a critical role in influencing lake water level and hydrochemistry remaining hydrologic input comes from the other rivers i e the karatal aksu lepsy and ayaguz rivers propastin 2012 the ili river originates at the confluence of the tekes and kunes rivers in xinjiang china fig 1b it is a transboundary river and has a length of 1237 km with upstream middle and downstream reaches separated by the sandaohezi and ili rail hydrologic stations fig 1b the headwaters of the river are fed by precipitation and melting snow and ice in the tianshan mountains the ili balkhash basin is one of the largest endorheic regions in arid central asia it occupies an area of 50 0 104 km2 with 85 of the drainage area in kazakhstan and 15 in china propastin 2012 climate throughout the basin is highly continental and arid to semi arid with an annual mean precipitation of 110 mm and annual mean temperature of 17 5 c duan et al 2020 the chinese part of the basin corresponds to the ili autonomous kazakh prefecture hereafter referred to as the ili prefecture which is home to 4 62 million people the kazakhstan part corresponds to the almaty oblast region and almaty city the former capital of kazakhstan that is home to 3 3 million people thevs et al 2017 residential distribution is characterized by scattered rural settlements and a few large cities such as yining almaty taldykorgan the capital of almaty oblast and balkhash the main economic activity in the basin is agriculture supplemented by industrial metallurgy in taldykorgan and balkhash and animal farms agricultural irrigation in the basin consumes the greatest quantity of water thevs et al 2017 the ili river basin hosts the largest irrigated area in the basin where there has been a rapid increase in irrigated cropland which is distributed on the ili delta and in smaller valleys that extend from the northern slopes of the trans ili alatau and southern slopes of dzungarian alatau qi et al 2019 the basin is overlain mainly by sedimentary rocks which are composed of carbonates silicates and alluvium fig 1c carbonate rocks are spread widely throughout the basin and are particularly abundant around the upstream section of the ili river and on the north side of the lake silicate rocks exist mainly in the middle of the basin along the middle and lower reaches of the ili river the downstream aksu and lepsy rivers and the upper and middle reaches of the karatal river magmatic rocks and metamorphic rocks are spread widely throughout the drainage basin but distributed mainly north of the lake the area south of the lake is dominated by alluvial and aeolian sediments mainly siliceous and clays mainly green chlorites and hydromicas accumulate abundantly along the western and northern shorelines 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and measurements we collected 63 water samples from 26 locations along the ili river eight sites in lake balkhash and 29 sites in other rivers that discharge into the lake fig 1 in the field we measured temperature ph and total dissolved solids tds with an ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde yellow springs usa concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were determined by acid titration water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter samples for cation na ca2 mg2 and k analysis were preserved with nitric acid hno3 to prevent precipitation or adsorption to the container wall subsamples of water were transferred into pre cleaned polyethylene containers for analysis of nh4 cl so4 2 and stable isotopes δd and δ18o cation concentrations were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes prodigy usa concentrations of cl and so4 2 were detected by ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 usa and nh4 was measured with a skalar san plus continuous flow analyzer switzerland oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were analyzed with a water vapor isotope analyzer lgr dlt 100 usa lgr standards with known isotope values were analyzed after every six water samples to check instrument performance stable isotope values δd and δ18o are reported in standard delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analytical precision for δd and δ18o was 1 0 and 0 1 respectively 3 2 piper and gibbs models a piper model is designed to reveal the dominant cations and anions and differences in the chemistries of the waters and to help understand sources of dissolved ions in waters the model is a trilinear diagram wherein percent concentrations in meq l 1 of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 are plotted in two triangular fields which are then projected onto a central diamond field piper 1944 we used gw chart version 1 30 0 to construct these diagrams and investigate hydrochemical characteristics a gibbs diagram was used to identify the key processes that control composition of dissolved solids in waters i e atmospheric precipitation rock weathering and evaporation gibbs 1970 ratios of cations na na ca2 and anions cl cl hco3 were each plotted against tds 3 3 ion ratios end member analysis and mass balance calculation ratios of major ions were used to analyze relationships among major elements and understand geochemical processes data for the ratios in the world s large rivers were obtained from han and liu 2004 data for the three component end members i e carbonates silicates and evaporites were obtained from gaillardet et al 1999 we quantified contributions to river water chemistry from precipitation anthropogenic inputs and multiple rock weathering sources with no obvious evaporite deposits in the river basin fig 1c we modified an equation that models the budget for any element x in river waters galy and france lanord 1999 dalai et al 2002 liu et al 2013 li et al 2019 as follows 1 x riv x atm x carb x sil x anth where the subscripts indicate contributions to river water riv from atmospheric input atm carbonate weathering carb silicate weathering sil and anthropogenic activities anth several assumptions enable use of this budget equation a cl in excess of atmospheric origin is considered to be anthropogenic and balanced by na b anthropogenic inputs of cations such as ca2 and mg2 are not significant c na and k from carbonate weathering are insignificant d so4 2 may be derived from both sulfide oxidation and atmospheric emissions of so2 the equation above was therefore modified as follows 2 cl riv cl atm cl anth

dissolved ion load in rivers can be calculated from the chemical composition of rainwater and snow ice melt in the region dalai et al 2002 the cl atm in this study was assumed to be 0 016 mmol l 1 which was obtained from the water sample taken from a high altitude mountain area that had the lowest concentrations of tds and cl and most negative isotope values and was thought to be uncontaminated by human activities ion concentrations supplied by atmospheric input x atm were obtained using the following equation 8 x atm x cl rain clatm the x cl ratios in rain i e x cl rain were calculated using the mean ion concentrations in precipitation in the tianshan mountains during 2003 2004 data from zhao et al 2008 the proportion of atmospheric input can be calculated as 9 xatm na atm k atm 2

of its low proportion 2 0 of the total cations so4 anth is generally derived from industrial sewage and acid rain the latter a consequence of widespread and intense coal combustion because this area is characterized by relatively low precipitation and is not highly industrialized it is likely that anthropogenic ion inputs to the rivers through atmospheric deposition and industrial sewage are negligible na and cl concentrations in two samples from irrigation canals had concentrations much higher than values recorded at the reference site in the mountains which are uncontaminated by human activities na and cl therefore were selected to evaluate anthropogenic inputs to estimate the relative contributions of mg2 and ca2 to the river waters from silicate weathering we used average values

extent of interaction between water and dissolved mineral phases sis of water samples were determined using the phreeqc model parkhurst and appelo 2013 and were calculated as si log10 iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the solubility product of the mineral stuyfzand 1989 if si 0 the solution is supersaturated and is prone to mineral precipitation or crystallization whereas waters with si 0 are undersaturated and minerals are likely to remain dissolved an si 0 indicates minerals are in equilibrium with the solution 3 5 isotope analysis the linear relationship between δd and δ18o in precipitation around the world is known as the global meteoric water line gmwl defined as δd 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 in this study local meteoric water line lmwl was determined by isotope data in precipitation of the neighboring regions including urumqi omsk tashkent fig 1a and tianshan mountains in china the data were obtained from the iaea wmo global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip www naweb iaea org and previously study wang et al 2016 dansgaard 1964 introduced the use of deuterium excess d excess which is unrelated to the isotopic composition of the initial water to assess the effect of evaporation meredith et al 2009 huang and pang 2012 the value is defined as d excess δd 8 δ18o and averages 10 for global precipitation when a water body undergoes evaporation d excess decreases and salinity increases making the two variables negatively correlated huang and pang 2012 3 6 statistical analysis arc map v 10 2 was used to prepare a map of the study area fig 1 basin area was modified from the hydrosheds database the digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission strm using the digital geologic map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 we simplified the distribution of rock types fig 1c grapher v 15 0 was used to plot all x and y graphs and bar charts water sample data were entered into an spss v18 0 statistical platform to carry out multivariate statistical analyses parametric statistical methods were used to calculate the ranges arithmetic means and standard deviations of hydrochemical variables the pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the strength of relationships between variables in this area we set a p value of 0 05 to indicate statistical significance pca with varimax rotation was conducted to interpret the hydrochemical response to human activities kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were performed to examine the suitability of the data for pca pca of the normalized dataset extracted the principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 in this study a factor correlation coefficient 0 60 was considered significant and to have a major influence on water quality the factor scores calculated by a regression method were used to investigate spatial variations in anthropogenic impacts in the basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 major ion components tds values in ili river waters ranged from 91 3 to 608 0 mg l 1 with a mean of 288 8 mg l 1 table 1 compared to the global average for rivers meybeck and ragu 2012 the ili river has relatively higher tds which likely reflects the arid to semi arid environment average concentrations mmol l 1 of anions and cations in the ili river waters were ordered as follows hco3 co3 2 so4 2 cl and ca2 na mg2 k hco3 accounted for 62 0 of total anions ca2 contributed 42 3 of total cations and ca2 plus mg2 accounted for 60 0 of total cations concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the ili river are more than fivefold the global average meybeck and ragu 2012 tds concentrations became progressively higher downstream in the river i e average tds values ranging from 162 7 mg l 1 in the upstream reaches to 332 8 mg l 1 in the middle reaches and 363 9 mg l 1 in the downstream reaches tds concentrations in other river waters ranged from 107 0 to 604 0 mg l 1 with a mean value of 263 0 mg l 1 table 1 hco3 and co3 2 accounted for 80 9 of total anions ca2 contributed 41 7 of total cations and ca2 plus mg2 accounted for 59 2 chemical compositions in other rivers were relatively homogenous and similar to that in the ili river implying similar hydrochemical processes concentrations mmol l 1 of anions and cations in waters of lake balkhash were ranked in the order cl so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and na mg2 k ca2 on average na was the most abundant cation with a proportion of 74 2 and cl and so4 2 were the most abundant anions with proportions of 44 4 and 30 3 respectively the mean content of tds in the lake was much higher than the mean value in the rivers with elevated concentrations of mg2 na cl and so4 2 being the major cause for the high tds the markedly different ion concentrations in lake and river waters indicate that different factors control the water chemistries 4 2 characterization of major ion composition on the cation plot of the piper ternary diagram fig 2 most river water samples lie in the lower left corner indicating the dominance of calcium lake waters had relatively higher proportions of na and k the anion diagram showed that most river water samples fell in the lower left corner near the apex of co3 2 and hco3 the lake waters fell near the middle of the diagram and were more enriched in cl and so4 2 the central diamond of the piper diagram showed the overall characteristics of the water chemistry in these samples dominance of alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 over alkali metals na and k and dominance of weak acids hco3 over strong acids cl and so4 2 in river waters and the reverse in lake waters most of the river waters can be classified as ca hco3 type while lake waters were na cl type generally the chemical composition of the water from the basin was similar to that encountered in tajikistan farther south wu et al 2020 suggesting that similar hydrochemical processes occur in both arid environments hydrochemical evolution from lower salinity ca hco3 type to higher salinity na so4 cl type was observed from the source region to downstream samples in the ili river implying changes in the factors that control major ions along the hydrologic flow paths additionally two samples 9 and 10 from the irrigation canals along the middle ili river fell into the ca na hco3 cl class they had significantly higher tds 569 5 mg l 1 na 3 0 mmol l 1 cl 2 0 mmol l 1 and so4 2 concentrations 1 3 mmol l 1 this is likely related to human activities e g application of fertilizers in agricultural fields and evaporation of irrigation waters 4 3 isotope values in waters the lmwl was calculated to be δd 7 1 δ18o 1 5 with a significant linear correlation between δd and δ18o values r2 0 93 fig 3 a both slope 7 1 and intercept 1 5 of the lmwl were smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl in the tianshan mountains china craig 1961 wang et al 2016 but higher than those of lels for highly arid environments meredith et al 2009 this trend is often observed in arid regions where rainfall can undergo evaporation as it falls to the ground through dry air isotope values in river waters averaged 84 6 for δd and 12 4 for δ18o whereas in the lake waters δd and δ18o 24 1 and 1 5 respectively were less negative table 1 isotope values for most river waters fell close to the lmwl fig 3a suggesting that they are derived mainly from precipitation lake and some river waters were relatively enriched in the heavier isotopes and fell between the lmwl and evaporation line el in nearby tajikistan mischke et al 2010 indicating these waters are substantially modified by evaporation the δd and δ18o values in the ili river increased from upstream 77 9 and 11 4 respectively to downstream 73 5 for δd 10 6 for δ18o this could be a consequence of different hydrological conditions in the upstream and downstream segments of the river upstream waters especially headwaters come from precipitation with relatively negative isotope value whereas downstream waters have slightly heavier isotope values and fall between the lmwl and el fig 3a indicating modification by evaporation this inference is supported by the positive relationship between δ18o values and chloride concentrations in the waters fig 3b highly evaporated lake waters possess higher concentrations of cl and have greater isotope values lying in the upper right corner precipitation and glacier meltwaters in the tianshan mountains are 18o depleted and have low cl values aizen et al 2005 zhao et al 2008 wang et al 2016 falling in the lower left corner headwater samples from the ili river had the most negative δ18o values and low chloride concentrations similar to those reported for precipitation and glacier meltwater thus these samples resemble meteoric water mixed with glacial snow meltwater higher δ18o values and chloride concentrations in the downstream ili river locating in the middle of the diagram reflect some evaporation spatial differences in chloride concentrations in the ili river may also be related to mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activities as suggested by higher cl concentrations in samples 9 and 10 collected in irrigation canals 4 4 processes that control major ion concentrations in waters the main ion and tds concentrations in waters from the ili balkhash basin were plotted on a gibbs diagram to explore processes that generate these water chemistries fig 4 most of the river waters were characterized by moderate tds concentrations and low ratios of cl cl hco3 0 003 0 7 and na na ca2 0 1 0 7 suggesting dominance of rock weathering and evaporation water samples from the middle and downstream reaches of the ili river however were characterized by relatively higher tds concentrations and a broad range of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 showing that the downstream water becomes enriched in dissolved salts by evaporation which is also reflected by the increasing δd and δ18o values downstream fig 3a some higher ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 in river waters may also result from preferential removal of ca2 and hco3 via calcite precipitation this is supported by lower isotopic values fig 3b and supersaturated calcite values si 0 average value of 0 5 and the significant negative correlation between ca2 mg2 and si for calcite r 0 34 p 0 05 n 55 ions in the lake water plotted within the evaporation field with much higher tds concentrations and ratios of cl cl hco3 0 7 0 8 and na na ca2 1 such ratios reflected mainly evaporation which leads to a build up of ions such as na mg2 so4 2 and cl in solution while precipitation of caco3 reduces hco3 and ca2 in the waters wahed et al 2014 compared with the inflow river waters percentages of ca2 and hco3 in the lake water were relatively lower fig 2 the si values of calcite 0 5 1 1 aragonite 0 4 1 0 and dolomite 1 7 2 8 for the lake water samples indicated they exceed saturation which is also supported by precipitation of carbonates in the lake and leads to the mineralogy of the lake sediments being dominated by calcite and dolomite sala et al 2020 the arid environment in the study area is conducive to evaporation and consequent concentration of major ions and stable isotopes in the lake waters the lake waters however are undersaturated with respect to the minerals gypsum 1 5 to 1 1 anhydrite 1 4 to 1 8 and halite 5 8 to 4 7 suggesting possible dissolution of salts in the lake sediments various rock weathering processes yield different combinations of dissolved ions that in part control the local hydrochemistry ion ratios in water samples from the study area were used to explore the origins of the major ions produced by rock weathering fig 5 water samples from the rivers were located near the carbonate silicate and evaporite end members fig 5a indicating that weathering of these three rock types plays an important role in the dissolved ion budget the relatively high ratios of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 na k fig 5b and 5c and thus low ratio of na k tz where tz ca2 mg2 na k in the rivers confirms that carbonate weathering plays a crucial role in local hydrogeochemistry more than weathering of silicates and dissolution of evaporites carbonates are generally more soluble than silicates and are thus more susceptible to weathering under natural conditions pant et al 2018 the chemical composition of rivers that drain carbonate terrains show ion distributions similar to those of the world s large rivers han and liu 2004 liu et al 2013 and display a mixing trend of the three end members which include limestone dolomite and silicate sources fig 5d in contrast the hydrochemistry of samples from the lake are strongly influenced by evaporite dissolution but also reflect contributions from silicate weathering which is illustrated by the location of plots near the evaporite and silicate end members and lower ratios of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 na k fig 5a c there was considerable excess na relative to cl in river waters with an average molar na cl ratio of 3 6 fig 5e and high ratios of na k cl mean 3 9 this suggests that on average the contribution of na and k from re dissolved marine salt and evaporite dissolution was less than that from silicate weathering such as weathering of sodium and potassium alumino silicates dalai et al 2002 li et al 2014 the na cl molar ratios in lake waters fall close to the 1 1 line fig 5e and thus na k cl was lower mean 1 9 indicating substantial production of cl and some na and k from the dissolution of evaporites high so4 2 relative to cl in river waters fig 5f indicates that if evaporites are a source of so4 2 to these waters then their composition is dominated by gypsum anhydrite rather than halite dalai et al 2002 alternatively oxidative weathering of pyrites can contribute so4 2 when waters have so4 2 ca2 dalai et al 2002 while high so4 2 ca2 average 15 2 in lake waters fig 5g provide evidence that so4 2 is supplied by oxidation of pyrite which is present in the nearby desert these ion ratios display considerable spatial differences in the ili river upstream samples are located near the carbonate end member displaying a carbonate dominant signature i e calcite and dolomite minerals figs 5a and 5d this is also seen in the high ratio of hco3 na k and value of hco3 ca2 close to 2 in most samples from the upper ili river figs 5c and 5h most downstream samples plotted toward the silicate end members and had lower ratios of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 na k fig 5b d suggesting increasing contributions from silicate weathering 4 5 contributions of different sources to major ions in rivers using the forward mass balance approach eqs 1 13 we evaluated the ionic contributions to the river waters resulting from four sources fig 6 ionic contributions from atmospheric precipitation were 4 0 21 2 average 10 3 for the ili river and 3 9 28 5 average 13 8 for other rivers anthropogenic contributions averaged 9 0 and 4 4 to the ili and other rivers respectively average xsil values were 23 2 13 5 44 5 and 29 7 16 1 54 8 to the ili river and other rivers respectively the proportions of cations from carbonate were also determined the ili river had xcarb of 37 1 75 4 with an average of 57 9 the xcarb for other rivers was 29 7 69 1 with an average of 52 6 in general relative contributions of ions to the rivers are in order from highest to lowest carbonate silicate atmosphere anthropogenic input reflecting the relative importance of carbonate and silicate weathering for the ili river contributions from carbonate weathering and atmospheric input decreased from the upper to the lower reaches whereas contributions from silicate weathering and human activities increased 4 6 factors influencing water chemistry 4 6 1 climate impacts onwater chemistry mineral weathering appears to exert the largest control on river water chemistry in our study region figs 4 5 and 6 the contributions of different rock weathering were generally consistent with the spatial distribution of predominant minerals figs 1c and 6 demonstrating that streamwater chemistry is controlled largely by the mineralogical nature of the exposed local rock moreover runoff is considered to be an important factor that influences rock weathering compared with the ili river lower mean annual runoff values for the other rivers kezer and matsuyama 2006 duan et al 2020 may account for their slightly lower tds concentrations table 1 which reflect lower weathering rates associated with the lower runoff values this is observed in other rivers around the world gaillardet et al 1999 but other variables such as soil cover may sometimes be important under low runoff conditions oliva et al 2003 in the individual watersheds lower solute concentrations in the upper ili river with higher discharge are likely attributed to increased dilution by greater precipitation white and blum 1995 across the whole basin mean annual precipitation map in the southern mountainous regions is generally greater than in the northern low altitude desert regions mean annual temperature varies as a function of altitude and vegetation cover with temperature generally decreasing at higher altitudes and vegetation cover increasing from the mountains to the plains and desert regions kezer and matsuyama 2006 duan et al 2020 tds in water samples were negatively correlated with altitude r 0 334 p 0 01 n 63 higher solute concentrations and greater isotope values in samples from lowland rivers figs 3 and 4 with high temperatures and low rainfall as well as reduced runoff are mainly the result of temperature related evaporation similarly samples from the lake have elevated concentrations of tds and lower d excess of 12 3 fig 7 reflecting that lake waters are modified substantially by evaporation both empirical measurements and calculated potential evapotranspiration in the ili river watershed indicate an increasing trend from the upstream to lower reaches thevs et al 2017 evaporation thus plays an important role in concentrating solutes in downstream river water and lake water 4 6 2 human impacts on water chemistry we carried out a pca to identify spatial differences in human impacts on hydrochemistry in the study area table 2 fig 8 the kmo value of 0 76 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test p 0 00 df 36 χ2 694 17 indicated that pca was useful in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset xu et al 2020 as a result two pcs were extracted explaining about 85 10 of the total variance table 2 the rotated factor loadings for each variable showed that pc1 accounting for about 71 70 of the total variance had high loadings on ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 tds and nh4 suggesting these ions in waters were largely influenced not only by natural processes but also by anthropogenic inputs mondal et al 2010 yang et al 2016 the strongly positive pc2 loadings for co3 2 and hco3 indicated natural source e g rock weathering which was also confirmed by its negative loading with nh4 in the score plot of pc1 vs pc2 fig 8 upstream ili river samples plotted in the upper left corner of the graph corresponding to rock weathering the samples from the middle to lower reaches of the ili river and from other rivers displayed a general increase in the effects of pc1 but low pc2 loadings with increases in nh4 as a consequence of stronger human impact on water ionic composition in the middle lower part of the basin including the delta of the ili river in comparison with the mean nh4 value in the river waters somewhat higher concentrations were observed in several water samples collected near dense settlements or farms particularly waters in tashkarasu county fig 1 where there is a large irrigated area this is consistent with higher concentrations of tds and major ions such as na and cl figs 2 and 3 correspondingly human contributions to major ions in river waters increased reaching 20 near tashkarasu county fig 6 this confirmed that irrigated agriculture influences input of nitrate and major ions almaty oblast is one of the largest agricultural districts in kazakhstan with intensive farm activities spitsyna and spitsyna 2007 nurzhanova et al 2013 that directly alter the chemistry of surface waters generally relatively lower levels of human influence on hydrochemical composition were recorded in the upstream ili river as shown by pca and mass balance calculations figs 6 and 8 this may be explained by the fact that ions in the upstream reaches are diluted by higher precipitation and runoff in the downstream basin however lower runoff is a consequence of high water use and greater evaporation is attributed to higher temperature both of which lead to ion enrichment and reinforcement of human influence on the hydrogeochemistry moreover conversion of grassland shrubland and barren land to irrigated cropland along with reservoir construction could promote evaporation sterling et al 2013 such hydrologic alterations contribute to changes in hydrogeochemistry 5 conclusions water resources in arid central asia are important for aquatic ecosystem function and economic development increasing scarcity of water and declining river lake water quality exacerbate social economic and environmental problems in this study major ion and stable isotope data in water samples from the ili balkhash basin in central asia were analyzed to investigate the natural climate and geology and anthropogenic factors that influence the hydrochemistry of surface waters in the region in general river water was characterized by lower stable isotope values relative to lake water isotope values in the ili river water displayed a gradient from lower values upstream to higher values downstream the major ion chemistry of the river waters is the ca hco3 type and the dissolved cation load in the rivers originates mostly from carbonate weathering 55 1 and silicate weathering 26 7 in contrast to river waters lake waters are dominated by the na cl type a consequence of intense evaporation and some evaporite dissolution differences in dissolved ion loads to rivers are attributable to spatial variability in bedrock type weathering products runoff precipitation temperature and evaporation human impacts had minimal impact on the chemical composition of upstream waters in the study area 6 6 but had a greater effect on middle and downstream reaches similar results have been reported from the amu darya wu et al 2020 and tarim rivers xiao et al 2015 we suspect that water quality deterioration and water supply shortages caused by a combination of climate change and human activities will become increasingly serious problems in arid central asia credit authorship contribution statement beibei shen formal analysis methodology writing original draft jinglu wu

4403,climate variability influences both water quantity and quality in lakes and rivers e g shifts in salinity caused by changes in the evaporation precipitation ratio however knowledge about climate and human influences on water quality in some regions is scarce which causes uncertainty when evaluating water resources and developing water management plans we measured the chemical composition and stable isotope values δd and δ18o in water samples from the ili balkhash basin arid central asia to investigate factors that control hydrologic processes in the area and explore how the arid environment influences local hydrochemistry and water resources isotope values in lake waters 24 1 δd and 1 5 δ18o are enriched relative to river waters 84 6 δd and 12 4 δ18o indicating that lake waters experience intense evaporation in the upstream ili river waters with lowest δd and δ18o values are supplied mainly by glacial ice and snow melt whereas lower reaches of the river are affected increasingly by evaporation and human water extraction waters of the ili river and other small rivers that drain to lake balkhash are chemically similar and of the ca hco3 type gibbs diagrams indicate that mineral weathering is the key process that controls river water chemistry on average carbonate and silicate weathering contribute 55 1 and 26 7 respectively to the total dissolved ion load in the river waters illustrating the strong control that regional geology exerts on streamwater chemistry in contrast lake waters are characterized as na cl type which results mainly from evaporation and some evaporite dissolution weathering in the area is controlled by climate i e precipitation and temperature moreover a negative correlation between lake water total dissolved solids and d excess and a systematic increase in chemical concentrations and stable isotope values downstream in the ili river reflect the fact that arid climate conditions promote evaporation and affect water quality pca analysis and mass balance calculation of water chemistry suggests that humans contribute only 6 6 of the major ion load to waters which display increasing concentrations in the middle and downstream regions there effects of human mediated weathering and transport of salts from agricultural irrigation are reinforced by higher temperatures and evaporation keywords ili balkhash basin arid central asia hydrochemistry climate effects anthropogenic impact 1 introduction arid and semi arid regions cover approximately one third of the world s land area and are inhabited by almost 400 million people williams 1999 in these dry regions lakes and rivers are important water resources but are sensitive to natural and human induced changes in their watersheds ongoing climate change and increasing human pressures there will negatively affect future water availability central asia is considered a hot spot for climate change karthe et al 2017 and regional climate models suggest that temperature there will continue to increase in the 21st century at a rate faster than the average global increase mannig et al 2013 shahgedanova 2016 this is expected to have serious consequences for the region s water resources because rivers in central asia begin in the mountains where 90 of total runoff originates viviroli and weingartner 2004 climate variability affects not only water quantity but also water quality e g higher salinity results from evaporative concentration of dissolved ions moreover human mediated hydrologic alterations in central asia e g agricultural irrigation frequently occur in downstream parts of catchments where they can cause water quality impairment karthe et al 2017 under conditions of intensifying water scarcity there has been a tendency to treat water quantity and water quality issues independently or to dismiss considerations of water quality entirely this approach ignores the importance of water quality in determining how much water is available for specific uses declines in water quality reduce the usable water quantity as surely as does drought to develop management plans for times of water scarcity therefore both hydrologic and geochemical data are essential the ili balkhash basin located in central asia is characterized by an arid climate the ili river emerges from the tianshan mountains in china and flows into lake balkhash kazakhstan the river is fed mainly by snow and glacier meltwaters in mountain areas 60 of the total runoff and provides 78 of the total inflow to the lake propastin 2012 lake balkhash is one of the largest lakes in the world and has become increasingly saline as water input has declined because of higher temperatures and human water diversion for agricultural irrigation climate changes and human activities may also contribute to water quality degradation previous studies were devoted to water level fluctuations and salt formation in the lake and hydrological changes of the ili river kezer and matsuyama 2006 dzhetimov et al 2013 duan et al 2020 few studies have investigated the water chemistry in different segments of the ili river and in the lake no research has attempted to distinguish between natural climate and human mediated effects on surface waters in the region this study was designed to 1 identify and describe spatial variations in hydrochemistry of the ili balkhash basin and 2 distinguish and quantify the influences of climate and human activities on hydrochemical conditions our findings will contribute to formulation of a sound water resources management plan for this arid region 2 study area lake balkhash is a large hydrologically closed and slightly saline lake in southwest kazakhstan fig 1 it is the third largest inland lake in asia with a mean surface area of 1 7 104 km2 and a volume of 87 7 km3 propastin 2012 the lake has a length of 605 km and its water level ranged between 340 5 and 344 4 m asl during the gauged period 1980 2000 propastin 2012 the lake receives 84 of its input water from river inflows sala et al 2020 of the total river inflow 78 comes from the ili river which plays a critical role in influencing lake water level and hydrochemistry remaining hydrologic input comes from the other rivers i e the karatal aksu lepsy and ayaguz rivers propastin 2012 the ili river originates at the confluence of the tekes and kunes rivers in xinjiang china fig 1b it is a transboundary river and has a length of 1237 km with upstream middle and downstream reaches separated by the sandaohezi and ili rail hydrologic stations fig 1b the headwaters of the river are fed by precipitation and melting snow and ice in the tianshan mountains the ili balkhash basin is one of the largest endorheic regions in arid central asia it occupies an area of 50 0 104 km2 with 85 of the drainage area in kazakhstan and 15 in china propastin 2012 climate throughout the basin is highly continental and arid to semi arid with an annual mean precipitation of 110 mm and annual mean temperature of 17 5 c duan et al 2020 the chinese part of the basin corresponds to the ili autonomous kazakh prefecture hereafter referred to as the ili prefecture which is home to 4 62 million people the kazakhstan part corresponds to the almaty oblast region and almaty city the former capital of kazakhstan that is home to 3 3 million people thevs et al 2017 residential distribution is characterized by scattered rural settlements and a few large cities such as yining almaty taldykorgan the capital of almaty oblast and balkhash the main economic activity in the basin is agriculture supplemented by industrial metallurgy in taldykorgan and balkhash and animal farms agricultural irrigation in the basin consumes the greatest quantity of water thevs et al 2017 the ili river basin hosts the largest irrigated area in the basin where there has been a rapid increase in irrigated cropland which is distributed on the ili delta and in smaller valleys that extend from the northern slopes of the trans ili alatau and southern slopes of dzungarian alatau qi et al 2019 the basin is overlain mainly by sedimentary rocks which are composed of carbonates silicates and alluvium fig 1c carbonate rocks are spread widely throughout the basin and are particularly abundant around the upstream section of the ili river and on the north side of the lake silicate rocks exist mainly in the middle of the basin along the middle and lower reaches of the ili river the downstream aksu and lepsy rivers and the upper and middle reaches of the karatal river magmatic rocks and metamorphic rocks are spread widely throughout the drainage basin but distributed mainly north of the lake the area south of the lake is dominated by alluvial and aeolian sediments mainly siliceous and clays mainly green chlorites and hydromicas accumulate abundantly along the western and northern shorelines 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and measurements we collected 63 water samples from 26 locations along the ili river eight sites in lake balkhash and 29 sites in other rivers that discharge into the lake fig 1 in the field we measured temperature ph and total dissolved solids tds with an ysi exo2 multi parameter sonde yellow springs usa concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 were determined by acid titration water samples were passed through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter samples for cation na ca2 mg2 and k analysis were preserved with nitric acid hno3 to prevent precipitation or adsorption to the container wall subsamples of water were transferred into pre cleaned polyethylene containers for analysis of nh4 cl so4 2 and stable isotopes δd and δ18o cation concentrations were determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes prodigy usa concentrations of cl and so4 2 were detected by ion chromatography dionex ics 2000 usa and nh4 was measured with a skalar san plus continuous flow analyzer switzerland oxygen and hydrogen isotopes

values δd and δ18o are reported in standard delta notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analytical precision for δd and δ18o was 1 0 and 0 1 respectively 3 2 piper and gibbs models a piper model is designed to reveal the dominant cations and anions and differences in the chemistries of the waters and to help understand sources of dissolved ions in waters the model is a trilinear diagram wherein percent concentrations in meq l 1 of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 are plotted in two triangular fields which are then projected onto a central diamond field piper 1944 we used gw chart version 1 30 0 to construct these diagrams and investigate hydrochemical characteristics a gibbs diagram was used to identify the key processes that control composition of dissolved solids in waters i e atmospheric precipitation rock weathering and evaporation gibbs 1970 ratios of cations na na ca2 and anions cl cl hco3 were each plotted against tds 3 3 ion ratios end member analysis and mass balance calculation ratios of major ions were used to analyze relationships among major elements and understand geochemical processes data for the ratios in the world s large rivers were obtained from han and liu 2004 data for the three component end members i e carbonates silicates and evaporites were obtained from gaillardet et al 1999 we quantified contributions to river water chemistry from precipitation anthropogenic inputs and multiple rock weathering sources with no obvious evaporite deposits in the river basin fig 1c we modified an equation that models the budget for any element x in river waters galy and france lanord 1999 dalai et al 2002 liu et al 2013 li et al 2019 as follows 1 x riv x atm x carb x sil x anth where the subscripts indicate contributions to river water riv from atmospheric input atm carbonate weathering carb silicate weathering sil and anthropogenic activities anth several assumptions enable use of this budget equation a cl in excess of atmospheric origin is considered to be anthropogenic and balanced by na b anthropogenic inputs of cations such as ca2 and mg2 are not significant c na and k from carbonate weathering are insignificant d so4 2 may be derived from both sulfide oxidation and atmospheric emissions of so2 the equation above was therefore modified as follows 2 cl riv cl atm cl anth

dissolved ion load in rivers can be calculated from the chemical composition of rainwater and snow ice melt in the region dalai et al 2002 the cl atm in this study was assumed to be 0 016 mmol l 1 which was obtained from the water sample taken from a high altitude mountain area that had the lowest concentrations of tds and cl and most negative isotope values and was thought to be uncontaminated by human activities ion concentrations supplied by atmospheric input x atm were obtained using the following equation 8 x atm x cl rain clatm the x cl ratios in rain i e x cl rain were calculated using the mean ion concentrations in precipitation in the tianshan mountains during 2003 2004 data from zhao et al 2008 the proportion of atmospheric input can be calculated as 9 xatm na atm k atm 2 mg atm 2 ca atm na riv k riv 2 ca riv 2 mg riv 100 na cl k and so4 2 are commonly related with human activities kaushal et al 2017 li et al 2019 k anth in this study may however be negligible because of its low proportion 2 0 of the total cations so4 anth is generally derived from industrial sewage and acid rain the latter a consequence of widespread and intense coal combustion because this area is characterized by relatively low precipitation and is not highly industrialized it is likely that anthropogenic ion inputs to the rivers through atmospheric deposition and industrial sewage are negligible na and cl concentrations in two samples from irrigation canals had concentrations much higher than values recorded at the reference site in the mountains which are uncontaminated by human activities na and cl therefore were selected to evaluate anthropogenic inputs to estimate the relative contributions of mg2 and ca2 to the river waters from silicate weathering we used average values in the world s rivers from silicate weathering ca na sol 0 4 and mg k sol 0 5 galy and france lanord 1999 accordingly ca sil and mg sil can be written as 10 ca sil na sil ca na sol 0 4 na sil 11 mg

extent of interaction between water and dissolved mineral phases sis of water samples were determined using the phreeqc model parkhurst and appelo 2013 and were calculated as si log10 iap k where iap is the ion activity product and k is the solubility product of the mineral stuyfzand 1989 if si 0 the solution is supersaturated and is prone to mineral precipitation or crystallization whereas waters with si 0 are undersaturated and minerals are likely to remain dissolved an si 0 indicates minerals are in equilibrium with the solution 3 5 isotope analysis the linear relationship between δd and δ18o in precipitation around the world is known as the global meteoric water line gmwl defined as δd 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 in this study local meteoric water line lmwl was determined by isotope data in precipitation of the neighboring regions including urumqi omsk tashkent fig 1a and tianshan mountains in china the data were obtained from the iaea wmo global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip www naweb iaea org and previously study wang et al 2016 dansgaard 1964 introduced the use of deuterium excess d excess which is unrelated to the isotopic composition of the initial water to assess the effect of evaporation meredith et al 2009 huang and pang 2012 the value is defined as d excess δd 8 δ18o and averages 10 for global precipitation when a water body undergoes evaporation d excess decreases and salinity increases making the two variables negatively correlated huang and pang 2012 3 6 statistical analysis arc map v 10 2 was used to prepare a map of the study area fig 1 basin area was modified from the hydrosheds database the digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission strm using the digital geologic map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 we simplified the distribution of rock types fig 1c grapher v 15 0 was used to plot all x and y graphs and bar charts water sample data were entered into an spss v18 0 statistical platform to carry out multivariate statistical analyses parametric statistical methods were used to calculate the ranges arithmetic means and standard deviations of hydrochemical variables the pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the strength of relationships between variables in this area we set a p value of 0 05 to indicate statistical significance pca with varimax rotation was conducted to interpret the hydrochemical response to human activities kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were performed to examine the suitability of the data for pca pca of the normalized dataset extracted the principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 in this study a factor correlation coefficient 0 60 was considered significant and to have a major influence on water quality the factor scores calculated by a regression method were used to investigate spatial variations in anthropogenic impacts in the basin 4 results and discussion 4 1 major ion components tds values in ili river waters ranged from 91 3 to 608 0 mg l 1 with a mean of 288 8 mg l 1 table 1 compared to the global average for rivers meybeck and ragu 2012 the ili river has relatively higher tds which likely reflects the arid to semi arid environment average concentrations mmol l 1 of anions and cations in the ili river waters were ordered as follows hco3 co3 2 so4 2 cl and ca2 na mg2 k hco3 accounted for 62 0 of total anions ca2 contributed 42 3 of total cations and ca2 plus mg2 accounted for 60 0 of total cations concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the ili river are more than fivefold the global average meybeck and ragu 2012 tds concentrations became progressively higher downstream in the river i e average tds values ranging from 162 7 mg l 1 in the upstream reaches to 332 8 mg l 1 in the middle reaches and 363 9 mg l 1 in the downstream reaches tds concentrations in other river waters ranged from 107 0 to 604 0 mg l 1 with a mean value of 263 0 mg l 1 table 1 hco3 and co3 2 accounted for 80 9 of total anions ca2 contributed 41 7 of total cations and ca2 plus mg2 accounted for 59 2 chemical compositions in other rivers were relatively homogenous and similar to that in the ili river implying similar hydrochemical processes concentrations mmol l 1 of anions and cations in waters of lake balkhash were ranked in the order cl so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and na mg2 k ca2 on average na was the most abundant cation with a proportion of 74 2 and cl and so4 2 were the most abundant anions with proportions of 44 4 and 30 3 respectively the mean content of tds in the lake was much higher than the mean value in the rivers with elevated concentrations of mg2 na cl and so4 2 being the major cause for the high tds the markedly different ion concentrations in lake and river waters indicate that different factors control the water chemistries 4 2 characterization of major ion composition on the cation plot of the piper ternary diagram fig 2 most river water samples lie in the lower left corner indicating the dominance of calcium lake waters had relatively higher proportions of na and k the anion diagram showed that most river water samples fell in the lower left corner near the apex of co3 2 and hco3 the lake waters fell near the middle of the diagram and were more enriched in cl and so4 2 the central diamond of the piper diagram showed the overall characteristics of the water chemistry in these samples dominance of alkaline earth metals ca2 and mg2 over alkali metals na and k and dominance of weak acids hco3 over strong acids cl and so4 2 in river waters and the reverse in lake waters most of the river waters can be classified as ca hco3 type while lake waters were na cl type generally the chemical composition of the water from the basin was similar to that encountered in tajikistan farther south wu et al 2020 suggesting that similar hydrochemical processes occur in both arid environments hydrochemical evolution from lower salinity ca hco3 type to higher salinity na so4 cl type was observed from the source region to downstream samples in the ili river implying changes in the factors that control major ions along the hydrologic flow paths additionally two samples 9 and 10 from the irrigation canals along the middle ili river fell into the ca na hco3 cl class they had significantly higher tds 569 5 mg l 1 na 3 0 mmol l 1 cl 2 0 mmol l 1 and so4 2 concentrations 1 3 mmol l 1 this is likely related to human activities e g application of fertilizers in agricultural fields and evaporation of irrigation waters 4 3 isotope values in waters the lmwl was calculated to be δd 7 1 δ18o 1 5 with a significant linear correlation between δd and δ18o values r2 0 93 fig 3 a both slope 7 1 and intercept 1 5 of the lmwl were smaller than those of the gmwl and the lmwl in the tianshan mountains china craig 1961 wang et al 2016 but higher than those of lels for highly arid environments meredith et al 2009 this trend is often observed in arid regions where rainfall can undergo evaporation as it falls to the ground through dry air isotope values in river waters averaged 84 6 for δd and 12 4 for δ18o whereas in the lake waters δd and δ18o 24 1 and 1 5 respectively were less negative table 1 isotope values for most river waters fell close to the lmwl fig 3a suggesting that they are derived mainly from precipitation lake and some river waters were relatively enriched in the heavier isotopes and fell between the lmwl and evaporation line el in nearby tajikistan mischke et al 2010 indicating these waters are substantially modified by evaporation the δd and δ18o values in the ili river increased from upstream 77 9 and 11 4 respectively to downstream 73 5 for δd 10 6 for δ18o this could be a consequence of different hydrological conditions in the upstream and downstream segments of the river upstream waters especially headwaters come from precipitation with relatively negative isotope value whereas downstream waters have slightly heavier isotope values and fall between the lmwl and el fig 3a indicating modification by evaporation this inference is supported by the positive relationship between δ18o values and chloride concentrations in the waters fig 3b highly evaporated lake waters possess higher concentrations of cl and have greater isotope values lying in the upper right corner precipitation and glacier meltwaters in the tianshan mountains are 18o depleted and have low cl values aizen et al 2005 zhao et al 2008 wang et al 2016 falling in the lower left corner headwater samples from the ili river had the most negative δ18o values and low chloride concentrations similar to those reported for precipitation and glacier meltwater thus these samples resemble meteoric water mixed with glacial snow meltwater higher δ18o values and chloride concentrations in the downstream ili river locating in the middle of the diagram reflect some evaporation spatial differences in chloride concentrations in the ili river may also be related to mineral dissolution and anthropogenic activities as suggested by higher cl concentrations in samples 9 and 10 collected in irrigation canals 4 4 processes that control major ion concentrations in waters the main ion and tds concentrations in waters from the ili balkhash basin were plotted on a gibbs diagram to explore processes that generate these water chemistries fig 4 most of the river waters were characterized by moderate tds concentrations and low ratios of cl cl hco3 0 003 0 7 and na na ca2 0 1 0 7 suggesting dominance of rock weathering and evaporation water samples from the middle and downstream reaches of the ili river however were characterized by relatively higher tds concentrations and a broad range of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 showing that the downstream water becomes enriched in dissolved salts by evaporation which is also reflected by the increasing δd and δ18o values downstream fig 3a some higher ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 in river waters may also result from preferential removal of ca2 and hco3 via calcite precipitation this is supported by lower isotopic values fig 3b and supersaturated calcite values si 0 average value of 0 5 and the significant negative correlation between ca2 mg2 and si for calcite r 0 34 p 0 05 n 55 ions in the lake water plotted within the evaporation field with much higher tds concentrations and ratios of cl cl hco3 0 7 0 8 and na na ca2 1 such ratios reflected mainly evaporation which leads to a build up of ions such as na mg2 so4 2 and cl in solution while precipitation of caco3 reduces hco3 and ca2 in the waters wahed et al 2014 compared with the inflow river waters percentages of ca2 and hco3 in the lake water were relatively lower fig 2 the si values of calcite 0 5 1 1 aragonite 0 4 1 0 and dolomite 1 7 2 8 for the lake water samples indicated they exceed saturation which is also supported by precipitation of carbonates in the lake and leads to the mineralogy of the lake sediments being dominated by calcite and dolomite sala et al 2020 the arid environment in the study area is conducive to evaporation and consequent concentration of major ions and stable isotopes in the lake waters the lake waters however are undersaturated with respect to the minerals gypsum 1 5 to 1 1 anhydrite 1 4 to 1 8 and halite 5 8 to 4 7 suggesting possible dissolution of salts in the lake sediments various rock weathering processes yield different combinations of dissolved ions that in part control the local hydrochemistry ion ratios in water samples from the study area were used to explore the origins of the major ions produced by rock weathering fig 5 water samples from the rivers were located near the carbonate silicate and evaporite end members fig 5a indicating that weathering of these three rock types plays an important role in the dissolved ion budget the relatively high ratios of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 na k fig 5b and 5c and thus low ratio of na k tz where tz ca2 mg2 na k in the rivers confirms that carbonate weathering plays a crucial role in local hydrogeochemistry more than weathering of silicates and dissolution of evaporites carbonates are generally more soluble than silicates and are thus more susceptible to weathering under natural conditions pant et al 2018 the chemical composition of rivers that drain carbonate terrains show ion distributions similar to those of the world s large rivers han and liu 2004 liu et al 2013 and display a mixing trend of the three end members which include limestone dolomite and silicate sources fig 5d in contrast the hydrochemistry of samples from the lake are strongly influenced by evaporite dissolution but also reflect contributions from silicate weathering which is illustrated by the location of plots near the evaporite and silicate end members and lower ratios of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 na k fig 5a c there was considerable excess na relative to cl in river waters with an average molar na cl ratio of 3 6 fig 5e and high ratios of na k cl mean 3 9 this suggests that on average the contribution of na and k from re dissolved marine salt and evaporite dissolution was less than that from silicate weathering such as weathering of sodium and potassium alumino silicates dalai et al 2002 li et al 2014 the na cl molar ratios in lake waters fall close to the 1 1 line fig 5e and thus na k cl was lower mean 1 9 indicating substantial production of cl and some na and k from the dissolution of evaporites high so4 2 relative to cl in river waters fig 5f indicates that if evaporites are a source of so4 2 to these waters then their composition is dominated by gypsum anhydrite rather than halite dalai et al 2002 alternatively oxidative weathering of pyrites can contribute so4 2 when waters have so4 2 ca2 dalai et al 2002 while high so4 2 ca2 average 15 2 in lake waters fig 5g provide evidence that so4 2 is supplied by oxidation of pyrite which is present in the nearby desert these ion ratios display considerable spatial differences in the ili river upstream samples are located near the carbonate end member displaying a carbonate dominant signature i e calcite and dolomite minerals figs 5a and 5d this is also seen in the high ratio of hco3 na k and value of hco3 ca2 close to 2 in most samples from the upper ili river figs 5c and 5h most downstream samples plotted toward the silicate end members and had lower ratios of ca2 mg2 na k and hco3 na k fig 5b d suggesting increasing contributions from silicate weathering 4 5 contributions of different sources to major ions in rivers using the forward mass balance approach eqs 1 13 we evaluated the ionic contributions to the river waters resulting from four sources fig 6 ionic contributions from atmospheric precipitation were 4 0 21 2 average 10 3 for the ili river and 3 9 28 5 average 13 8 for other rivers anthropogenic contributions averaged 9 0 and 4 4 to the ili and other rivers respectively average xsil values were 23 2 13 5 44 5 and 29 7 16 1 54 8 to the ili river and other rivers respectively the proportions of cations from carbonate were also determined the ili river had xcarb of 37 1 75 4 with an average of 57 9 the xcarb for other rivers was 29 7 69 1 with an average of 52 6 in general relative contributions of ions to the rivers are in order from highest to lowest carbonate silicate atmosphere anthropogenic input reflecting the relative importance of carbonate and silicate weathering for the ili river contributions from carbonate weathering and atmospheric input decreased from the upper to the lower reaches whereas contributions from silicate weathering and human activities increased 4 6 factors influencing water chemistry 4 6 1 climate impacts onwater chemistry mineral weathering appears to exert the largest control on river water chemistry in our study region figs 4 5 and 6 the contributions of different rock weathering were generally consistent with the spatial distribution of predominant minerals figs 1c and 6 demonstrating that streamwater chemistry is controlled largely by the mineralogical nature of the exposed local rock moreover runoff is considered to be an important factor that influences rock weathering compared with the ili river lower mean annual runoff values for the other rivers kezer and matsuyama 2006 duan et al 2020 may account for their slightly lower tds concentrations table 1 which reflect lower weathering rates associated with the lower runoff values this is observed in other rivers around the world gaillardet et al 1999 but other variables such as soil cover may sometimes be important under low runoff conditions oliva et al 2003 in the individual watersheds lower solute concentrations in the upper ili river with higher discharge are likely attributed to increased dilution by greater precipitation white and blum 1995 across the whole basin mean annual precipitation map in the southern mountainous regions is generally greater than in the northern low altitude desert regions mean annual temperature varies as a function of altitude and vegetation cover with temperature generally decreasing at higher altitudes and vegetation cover increasing from the mountains to the plains and desert regions kezer and matsuyama 2006 duan et al 2020 tds in water samples were negatively correlated with altitude r 0 334 p 0 01 n 63 higher solute concentrations and greater isotope values in samples from lowland rivers figs 3 and 4 with high temperatures and low rainfall as well as reduced runoff are mainly the result of temperature related evaporation similarly samples from the lake have elevated concentrations of tds and lower d excess of 12 3 fig 7 reflecting that lake waters are modified substantially by evaporation both empirical measurements and calculated potential evapotranspiration in the ili river watershed indicate an increasing trend from the upstream to lower reaches thevs et al 2017 evaporation thus plays an important role in concentrating solutes in downstream river water and lake water 4 6 2 human impacts on water chemistry we carried out a pca to identify spatial differences in human impacts on hydrochemistry in the study area table 2 fig 8 the kmo value of 0 76 and the significance of bartlett s sphericity test p 0 00 df 36 χ2 694 17 indicated that pca was useful in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset xu et al 2020 as a result two pcs were extracted explaining about 85 10 of the total variance table 2 the rotated factor loadings for each variable showed that pc1 accounting for about 71 70 of the total variance had high loadings on ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 tds and nh4 suggesting these ions in waters were largely influenced not only by natural processes but also by anthropogenic inputs mondal et al 2010 yang et al 2016 the strongly positive pc2 loadings for co3 2 and hco3 indicated natural source e g rock weathering which was also confirmed by its negative loading with nh4 in the score plot of pc1 vs pc2 fig 8 upstream ili river samples plotted in the upper left corner of the graph corresponding to rock weathering the samples from the middle to lower reaches of the ili river and from other rivers displayed a general increase in the effects of pc1 but low pc2 loadings with increases in nh4 as a consequence of stronger human impact on water ionic composition in the middle lower part of the basin including the delta of the ili river in comparison with the mean nh4 value in the river waters somewhat higher concentrations were observed in several water samples collected near dense settlements or farms particularly waters in tashkarasu county fig 1 where there is a large irrigated area this is consistent with higher concentrations of tds and major ions such as na and cl figs 2 and 3 correspondingly human contributions to major ions in river waters increased reaching 20 near tashkarasu county fig 6 this confirmed that irrigated agriculture influences input of nitrate and major ions almaty oblast is one of the largest agricultural districts in kazakhstan with intensive farm activities spitsyna and spitsyna 2007 nurzhanova et al 2013 that directly alter the chemistry of surface waters generally relatively lower levels of human influence on hydrochemical composition were recorded in the upstream ili river as shown by pca and mass balance calculations figs 6 and 8 this may be explained by the fact that ions in the upstream reaches are diluted by higher precipitation and runoff in the downstream basin however lower runoff is a consequence of high water use and greater evaporation is attributed to higher temperature both of which lead to ion enrichment and reinforcement of human influence on the hydrogeochemistry moreover conversion of grassland shrubland and barren land to irrigated cropland along with reservoir construction could promote evaporation sterling et al 2013 such hydrologic alterations contribute to changes in hydrogeochemistry 5 conclusions water resources in arid central asia are important for aquatic ecosystem function and economic development increasing scarcity of water and declining river lake water quality exacerbate social economic and environmental problems in this study major ion and stable isotope data in water samples from the ili balkhash basin in central asia were analyzed to investigate the natural climate and geology and anthropogenic factors that influence the hydrochemistry of surface waters in the region in general river water was characterized by lower stable isotope values relative to lake water isotope values in the ili river water displayed a gradient from lower values upstream to higher values downstream the major ion chemistry of the river waters is the ca hco3 type and the dissolved cation load in the rivers originates mostly from carbonate weathering 55 1 and silicate weathering 26 7 in contrast to river waters lake waters are dominated by the na cl type a consequence of intense evaporation and some evaporite dissolution differences in dissolved ion loads to rivers are attributable to spatial variability in bedrock type weathering products runoff precipitation temperature and evaporation human impacts had minimal impact on the chemical composition of upstream waters in the study area 6 6 but had a greater effect on middle and downstream reaches similar results have been reported from the amu darya wu et al 2020 and tarim rivers xiao et al 2015 we suspect that water quality deterioration and water supply shortages caused by a combination of climate change and human activities will become increasingly serious problems in arid central asia credit authorship contribution statement beibei shen formal analysis methodology writing original draft jinglu wu

4404,the storm water management model swmm widely used by engineers to design or analyse stormwater networks allows to model the so called low impact development lid controls which reduce the flow conveyed to traditional networks but values for lid control parameters are often unknown furthermore it is not always easy to link the cross section materials to those provided by the model particularly in the soil layer this article provides a global sensitivity analysis for the pp type of lid control in order to support practitioners in calibration tasks the analysis explores what factors are the most influential and which can be fixed while calibrating a model in particular flow volume and peak are studied but the analysis also explores the influence of storm length and drain layer which is optional at the end the most influential parameters and those that can be neglected are presented showing that we can focus on quite less parameters than initially given when calibrating a pp model in swmm keywords permeable pavement swmm low impact development suds sensitivity analysis calibration 1 introduction sustainability issues are gaining increasing attention from society biswas 2020 and authorities are encouraged to consider environmental dimensions of their practices stormwater projects being no exception geyler et al 2019 in that context sustainable urban drainage systems suds or low impact development controls lid controls are techniques that provide an improved rainwater management at source in order to get the hydrological behaviour of urbanised land closer to predeveloped situation permeable pavement pp is one type of such lid technique characterised by generating a porous but at the same time accessible surface for pedestrians and vehicles pps consist of several porous layers laid over the natural soil with a cover layer of pavement at the top allowing water to flow through the layers are usually referred to from the top down pavement bedding base subbase and subgrade natural soil layers the section may also include one or more geotextile layers and one or multiple drains in any case there is no unique layout or cross section as solutions adopted by practitioners are usually multiple depending on the structural and hydrological requirements of a given application rodríguez rojas et al 2020 kuruppu et al 2019 woods ballard et al 2015 mullaney and lucke 2014 scholz and grabowiecki 2007 but also adapted to local materials and conditions for stormwater designing purposes or to forecast the response of a given network facing predicted weather events it is common for practitioners to rely on mathematical models there are several available models for the analysis of the pps widely detailed in kaykhosravi et al 2018 but few allow for an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling of lids incorporated within catchments being storm water management model swmm one of them hence swmm is a powerful instrument to carry out different studies related to various types of lid andres domenech et al 2018 including pp several studies use swmm for analysing lids effects on urban flooding qin et al 2013 hydrologic response of an urban catchment under different scenarios palla and gnecco 2015 or prioritising sites and types for lid practices liao et al 2018 song and chung 2017 besides swmm being recommended for preliminary and detailed design objectives it is also one of the most popular models among scientists kaykhosravi et al 2018 similarly to other types of lid present in swmm pps are defined by overlapping several layers surface pavement soil storage and drain fig 1 a illustrates the layer layout but in order to run the model it is necessary to fix the parameters defined in each of the layers see table 1 it is then when allocating values to the parameters provided by swmm that doubts arise about which may be those that fit better to the real pavement characteristics this is due to the lack of information on the physical properties of the materials used or alternatively because the layout see figs 1b d as an example do not match predefined layers in the swmm lid model with such difficulties it is of great value knowing in advance which are the most influential parameters during model calibration in essence while setting up and using numerical simulation models sensitivity analysis sa methods are invaluable tools iooss and lemaître 2015 in hydrological modelling the most frequent reason for conducting sa is to select the most sensitive parameters to vary during model calibration gupta and razavi 2018 global approaches are required to perform a valid sa when models feature nonlinearities and interactions saltelli et al 2019 although there are three main obstacles to perform such analysis the computation time the number of inputs and the size of the input space pujol 2009 various sa have recently been carried out on pps based on hydrus model costa et al 2020 brunetti et al 2018 turco et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 but the analysed parameters or inputs differ from those used in swmm also several sa have been carried out previously in swmm a detailed list can be found in niazi et al 2017 but few have carried out such an analysis focusing just on lid controls and its parameters panos et al 2020 xu et al 2019 leimgruber et al 2018 peng and stovin 2017 krebs et al 2016 and most of them did it as a previous step before calibrating a certain model randall et al 2020 are the only ones that explored the pp but they did not use a global sa as they explored parameter variability for three cross sections used in their study in addition they focused on the underdrain flow exclusively besides pps have two particular characteristics that differentiate them from other types of lid controls rossman 2015 the pavement layer is used exclusively in this type of lid control and moreover it is the only one where the soil layer is optional thus the analysis of pp lid type would be of great value since none of the previous studies provided a general vision for pps in swmm not just valid for a particular case but as a universal instrument for all real cases that may emerge when calibrating pps in swmm if that data may be available it could potentially be used directly by practitioners to improve the quality and efficiency of their swmm modelling therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of multiple factors on the hydrological response of pps in both short and long term modelling scenarios by using the rainfall runoff model swmm the problem is addressed in the following way first minimum and maximum values were set for explored parameters then considered cases are defined in terms of analysis length optional layers and analysed outputs finally sensitivity indices and their confidence intervals are calculated for each case consequently the objectives set for the study are a to check if there are differences between parameter sensitivities for the several cases studied b to identify negligible and most influential parameters and c to compare those parameters with the ones identified on previous sa studies 2 methodology this section describes the methodology used in the three fundamental steps followed 1 characterise the variance based sa 2 characterise the lid model defined in swmm and 3 define the terms in which sa is performed 2 1 variance based sensitivity analysis the sobol method is a variance based sensitivity method sobol 1990 which decomposes the model output variance into relative contributions from individual parameters and parameter interactions as shown in eq 1 as a result the sensitivity of a given parameter is quantified by the ratio of its contribution to the output variance which ranges from 0 to 1 shin et al 2013 the first term of the equation indicates the addition of the variance for each factor i named v i y being these variances exclusive to that factor the second term indicates the variance due to combinations of two factors i and j named v ij y and so on 1 v y i 1 k v i y i j k v ij y v 12 k y those v i y terms constitute the main effect or the variance of the average output when the input factor x i is fixed the second one constitutes the second order effect or the variance of the average output when the input factors x i and x j are fixed thus if we consider how much of the total variance is due to main effect we can define the first order index given in eq 2 which represents the main effect contribution of each input factor to the variance of the output saltelli et al 2008 higher ranking indices may be defined in the same way such as second order indices or s ij 2 s i v i y v y in case we consider the total contribution of the factor x i to the output variance we also have to consider the interactions of x i with other factors which accounts not only for the main effect but also the higher order effects that will be the total effect of the factor x i hence total index s t i can be defined as shown in eq 3 total effect will give then how much the output variance is reduced on average when factor x i is fixed 3 s t i 1 v i y v y in practice when k is large only the main effects and the total effects are computed obtaining a good information on the model sensitivities in addition s i and s ti are closely linked to a couple of extremely significant sensitivity settings in the calibration context factor fixing and factor prioritisation ratto et al 2007 factor fixing refers to the identification of those input factors if any which have no influence on the model output and therefore can be fixed to any value within their feasible range but with negligible implications on the output factor prioritisation describes the ordering of the input factors according to their relative influence on the model output sarrazin et al 2016 first order index being zero s i 0 is a necessary but insufficient condition to identify the factor x i as non relevant and fix it in such case the factor may be involved in interactions with other factors so there might be higher order terms saltelli et al 2008 instead s i 0 is a good value to qualify a factor as influential as a factor prioritisation setting on the other hand total indices are suitable for the factor fixing setting saltelli et al 2008 being s t i 0 a necessary and sufficient condition in order to fix x i as a noninfluential factor if s t i 0 then x i can be fixed at any value within its range of uncertainty without appreciably affecting the value of the output variance v y as s ti 0 01 is generally used as a threshold for factor fixing sarrazin et al 2016 both obtained s t i and s i values are rounded to the second decimal for additive models and under the assumption of orthogonal input factors s ti and s i are equal and the sum of all s i and thus all s ti is 1 for non additive models interactions exist s ti is greater than s i and the sum of all s i is less than 1 and also the sum of all s ti is greater than 1 by analysing the difference between s ti and s i the impact of the interactions between parameter x i and the other parameters can be determined for calculating both s i and s t i the procedure suggested by saltelli 2002 has been used at the cost of n k 2 simulations being n the base sample samples are generated with the latin hypercube sampling method mckay and beckman 1979 although commonly suggested n value in literature is 1000 sarrazin et al 2016 found that high n values n 1000 are necessary for sensitivity indices to converge however they found that much lower n is enough when the goal is factor prioritisation or fixing as the objective of the article is factor prioritisation and factor fixing a value of n 2000 is used and confidence intervals are calculated confidence intervals for the sensitivity indices are estimated with the bootstrap technique efron 1979 a confidence interval of 95 is given for the sensitivity indices where limits are computed with the basic method davison and hinkley 1997 for that purpose a number of 1000 replicates is considered enough archer et al 1997 2 2 storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for single event or long term continuous simulation where lid units can be modelled and added to a certain subcatchment rossman and huber 2016a conceptually a generic lid unit can be represented by a number of vertical layers rossman 2010 combined to create the various lid controls pp type lid control combines surface pavement soil storage and drain layers fig 2 being soil and drain layers optional in this article a square subcatchment of 100 m2 has been generated for the simulations all occupied by a lid control of the pp type as illustrated in fig 2 pp can receive water from precipitation i or inflows q 0 from other areas that water on the surface can evaporate e 1 infiltrate to pavement layer f 1 or flow out from the pavement as runoff q 1 water in the pavement layer can also evaporate e 4 or percolate to the soil layer f 4 something similar happens in the soil layer beneath water can percolate to storage layer f 2 or evaporate e 2 in the storage layer water can exfiltrate to native soil f 3 evaporate e 3 or be directed to another area or conveyance through the drain q 3 in this article q 0 will not be considered and regarding the analysed outputs covered in section 2 3 4 outflow from the pp will be the sum of q 1 and q 3 the hydrologic performance of the lid control is modelled by solving simple mass balance equations given in the eqs 4 7 that express the change in water volume in each layer over time as the difference between the inflow water flux rate and the outflow flux rate rossman 2010 the flux terms q e and f in these equations are functions of the current water content in the various layers d i and θ i and specific site and soil characteristics both d i and θ i represent stored water first one as depth mm and second one as moisture content volume of water total volume of soil d i are layer thicknesses and ϕ i are layer porosities the rest of parameters are specified in the table 1 presented in section 2 3 3 as they are model parameters 4 d d 1 dt i q 0 e 1 f 1 q 1 5 d 4 1 f 4 d θ 4 dt f 1 e 4 f 4 6 d 2 d θ 2 dt f 4 e 2 f 2 7 ϕ 3 d d 3 dt f 2 e 3 f 3 q 3 evaporation rates are calculated based on potential evaporation e o t detailed in section 2 3 1 evaporation on the top layer or surface will be the minimum of e o t and available water for layers below evaporation will be the minimum of available water and the fraction of potential evaporation that did not materialise in the upper layers water flow from surface is computed with manning eq 8 infiltration to pavement layer depends on available water volume on the surface layer as shown in eq 9 percolation from pavement layer is the pavement permeability as shown in eq 10 percolation from soil layer is calculated with eq 11 which will occur only if water content is higher than field capacity in that case percolation is modelled using darcy s law flow from drain eq 12 is computed as flow from an orifice being h 3 the hydraulic head seen by the underdrain exfiltration to native soil is the seepage rate of the storage layer as shown in eq 13 8 q 1 1 49 w s 1 2 a n d 1 d 1 5 3 9 f 1

time step to determine how an inflow hydrograph to the lid unit is converted into some combination of runoff hydrograph sub surface storage sub surface drainage and infiltration into the surrounding native soil certain limitations are imposed on the above mentioned water volumes defined by the capacity of each layer in terms of available space to keep water or present water volume more details about the equations to compute moisture balance in each layer can be found on rossman and huber 2016b 2 3 model settings and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 climatological data this study is undertaken with data gathered in donostia san sebastián spain located facing the bay of biscay in an area with an atlantic climate data from two weather stations has been gathered one of them is igeldo weather station 43 19 0 n 2 0 0 w with a large historical data and the other one is miramon weather station 43 17 20 n 1 58 16 w a newer weather station with 10 min time interval accessible data the sensitivity analysis is conducted studying the hydraulic response of the pp facing two kinds of events short term and long term as it is common for practitioners to check the performance of the network for a certain event which is also a simple method for lid volumetric design purposes a 100 years return period and 6 h rainfall event has been considered for the short term analysis woods ballard et al 2015 a synthetic single event is generated from data available at the igeldo weather station based on the idf curves representing a return period of 100 years the precipitation depth for a 6 h duration storm is 90 7 mm the design storm has been set with the alternating block method chow 2010 considering 15 min steps the aforementioned method does not address a continuous scenario in which one storm may follow another and the system may not have time to drain henceforth its potential to handle a new event will be limited that is why the performance for the system facing continuous events should also be examined as 5 years is considered the minimum period required for securing sensitivity analysis results that are stable in subcatchments shin et al 2013 that period is also considered as sufficient for the defined subcatchment for the long term analysis 5 years series recorded at the miramon weather station have been gathered both temperature and precipitation collected in 10 min intervals fig 3 shows gathered time series but with daily precipitation and average daily temperature data to improve the visibility average rainfall is 1507 mm year with 196 days per year with measured rainfall and average temperature is 14 2 c potential evaporation in the long term is computed from daily maximum and minimum data based on the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and the latitude for the long term the considered time steps for computing runoff when modelling have been 2 30 min for wet weather and 10 00 min for dry weather for the short term time step for both cases has been 1 00 min reporting time step is 5 00 min for short term and 10 00 min for long term 2 3 2 selected optional layers for lid control as mentioned before there are two optional layers in the pp type lid control soil layer and drain the soil layer or bedding layer beneath the pavement fine gravel or clean sand in practice is a common layer for permeable interlocking pavers in order to laying the pavers on a evener surface than the one given by bigger gravel although soil layer is not always placed randall et al 2020 kayhanian et al 2019 tennis et al 2004 soil layer has not been considered as an optional layer thus two cases are studied one with drain option deactivated named as so and a second one with drain activated labelled as sodr 2 3 3 selected input parameters for lid control the inputs or parameters given to swmm which are used to compute the mentioned water balances to get the outputs are listed on the table 1 the table also indicates which parameters have been used in the following sa vegetation volume fraction from the surface layer which refers to the volume occupied by stems and leaves over the surface rossman 2015 has been excluded from the sa as it is very unusual case in pps this parameter is general for all lid control types parameters that reduce permeability in the long term such as clogging factor regeneration interval and regeneration fraction have not been considered in the storage layer the parameter that considers the reduction of the seepage rate has not been considered either clogging factor finally the parameters that control the opening and closing of the drain have not been considered open level closed level and control curve all those values have been ignored while calculating pp performance table 1 also gives the range for each parameter value while performing the sa maximum and minimum are given considering a uniform distribution most parameter ranges are taken from the swmm manuals rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016b some are modified such as surface berm height subh top value which is set to 150 mm as it is common value for the curb height which might work as a berm another revised value is surface roughness suro as values given by the manual are considered typical for traditional pavements therefore as pervious pavements are more rough than traditional ones unfinished concrete value of 0 02 is used as a high value for roughness chow 1959 another modified value is the surface slope susl a top value of 10 is selected as it is not usual to design higher slopes mainly because of accessibility issues in spain for example the different regional regulations do not exceed 8 in general and allow slopes of up to 12 for ramps alonso lópez 2010 the soil layer and its parameters are probably the most unknown to practitioners since they are defined with soil parameters such as wilting point or suction head some soil parameters are also changed soil thickness soth for example in that sense as mentioned in the introduction it is considered that there is a wide variety of cross sections that can be modelled in many different ways for that reason a maximum thickness of 200 mm is considered woods ballard et al 2015 field capacity sofc and wilting point sowp are also modified as it is considered that those materials may be clean gravel sand type therefore a 0 06 0 20 range is considered for the first parameter and 0 01 0 05 for the second one pardossi et al 2009 in the storage layer seepage rate is also modified considering it up to 1000 mm h woods ballard et al 2015 in the drain layer the flow coefficient drfc is considered up to 1000 zhang and guo 2015 it should be noted that the offset value from the drain layer is not given in mm but as a percentage of the total thickness of the storage layer although swmm contains some parameters related to the lid control in a subcatchment such as subcatchment area surface width per unit initially saturated impervious area treated and pervious area treated these parameters have not been considered in the sa since the study focused on studying specifically the lid control and its parameters 2 3 4 hydrological outputs and data treatment when carrying out a sensitivity analysis it is essential to define its objective in advance i e which variable or model result is going to be analysed sa results may vary depending on targeted output each target function is insensitive to some often different parameters particularly for those models with more than a handful of parameters shin et al 2013 the aim of this study is to explore the impact of design parameters on the hydraulic response of the pp to this end the outputs analysed are those related with the generated outflow from the pp site outflow volume and outflow peak for that purpose outflow will be the sum of q 1 and q 3 from fig 2 that is superficial runoff and drain outflow all outflow data managed by the pp used to evaluate sensitivity indices is obtained from the report file generated by swmm data related to the volumes is read from the lid performance summary section data relative to peak flows is collected from the same file but in this case from the node inflow summary as runoff and drain flows are diverted in the model to a couple of nodes for that purpose by evaluating a total of two outputs across four cases sixteen indices are calculated for each lid parameter a first order one s i and a total effect one s ti for each parameter as analysed input output cases are multiple values are compared graphically the data has been gathered with the version 5 1 015 of swmm epa 1971 the analysis of the data has been carried out using the open source programming language r r core team 2020 for modelling purposes swmmr package has been used which interfaces the swmm with r leutnant et al 2019 for the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity package has been used iooss et al 2020 and for sample generating the pse package chalom et al 2017 3 results and discussion the results are presented into several sections first some general data description is given later 1 differences between short and long term are discussed 2 the influence of the drain layer is analysed and 3 differences between selected outputs are discussed at the end 4 global analysis is performed although a total of 164 000 simulations are done across various cases while performing the global sa and in addition the 1 in 100 years storm is simulated for the short term analysis few outflow values are computed on average just 0 93 of the simulations produced any outflow in particular the short term analysis created any outflow five times more than the long term which appears to be intuitive since the short term precipitation is higher something similar happened with the optional layers sodr created outflow almost eight times the so option did that also appears to be intuitive since active drainage layer allows underdrain flow the most remarkable aspect of this data is that it shows how effective can pp be reducing the contribution to the stormwater network no matter how the pp is designed the reason for that is that rain intensity is usually lower than pavement permeability and its storage capacity allows infiltration to native soil before flow is diverted from the drain once sa is performed some s i values are found to be close to zero but negative that is consistent with previous findings as saltelli et al 2008 described negative signs due to numerical errors in the estimates when analytical sensitivity indices are close to zero in addition obtained confidence intervals were very large in all modelling scenarios as convergence was not obtained for calculated sensitivity indices to avoid those negative values and high confidence intervals sample size should be increased until convergence which is considered unnecessary for factor fixing and prioritisation also the methodology used to obtain confidence intervals yielded negative values or indices higher than one as those are considered meaningless those values are not represented on the figures before proceeding with a global discussion considering all the cases conducted at the end of this section three previous analyses have been performed from the calculated indices for those mentioned reviews plots with values for first order indices s and total effect indices st are created for that purpose table 2 is also built giving the sum of all indices across cases values from that table will be discussed in the next sections in addition that table confirms that the model is nonadditive as the sum of s i is smaller than one for all cases also the sum of s ti is greater than one for all considered cases 3 1 analysis of short or long term influence regarding to the analysis of storm length some differences arise between short term and long term the fig 4 and values from table 2 show that long term outflows are much more influenced by single parameters without considering any interactions for the short term 4 5 of the variance can be explained on average by one parameter soth on the other hand for the long term outflow 48 5 of its variance can be explained on average by two variables soth and stsr in summary parameter interaction plays a significant role on the short term 3 2 analysis of drain influence if the sensitivity indices are examined according to whether the drain layer is active or not the individual influence of parameters is similar to the previous case as shown in fig 5 and values from table 2 outflow variance in the so case is explained on as average by one variable soth in a 32 while in the sodr case is explained by two variables soth and stsr in a 21 that means that interactions are more relevant when drain layer is active which seems reasonable as outflow is also controlled by the drain parameters and overall influence of the soth is reduced in that sense the number of parameters that may be fixed without affecting the outflow with a s t 0 increases in the so case however it is interesting how these parameters differ from case to case for the so case all parameters other than soth and sofc may be fixed in the soil layer on the contrary for sodr case almost all parameters may be fixed in the pavement layer that shows that when drain layer is active other soil parameters different from thickness have also influence in the outflow which also accounts for drain flow but when drain layer is not active and outflow accounts just for runoff soil layer parameters loose its influence and pavement layer parameters influence is notable that appears to be intuitive since pavement parameters control runoff or at what extent there will be infiltration to the layers below 3 3 analysis of peak or volume influence with regard to the output values fig 6 and values from table 2 show that on average 35 2 of the outflow variance is explained by two parameters for the outflow volume but that value decreases to the 18 8 when the analysed output is the peak flow while the variables remain the same soth and stsr also interactions play a smaller role on the volume outflow than in the peak flow it is also interesting to see how the number of values which can be fixed without affecting the output is higher for the runoff volume for runoff peak the are three parameters with a s t 0 while for the volume there are six which includes all the previous three 3 4 general analysis finally all cases are compared at once in fig 7 which is also used to identify the most important parameters and those that can be neglected or fixed when calibrating the model no matter what input output case we consider those parameters are summarised in table 3 the graph clearly shows that only two parameters have a influence by themselves on the evaluated outputs soth and stsr alone can explain as average 26 5 of the output variance on the contrary there are clearly three parameters that do not affect the output variance sosh sowp and suro first two parameters will be the most obvious candidates for the influential ones and last three will be set as the ones without any influence if examined by layer surface parameters have no influence individually on the contrary subh presents high interactions with other parameters thus it can be considered as the most influential parameter of this layer on the other hand susl presents quite low interactions in just one case so it will be considered as having low influence it seems consistent subh being the most influential parameter as it can restrict the output level and consequently the generated runoff and infiltration to layers below with regard to the pavement layer something similar happens with the individual influence since all parameters show a first order index equal to zero if total indices are examined and thus interactions pais is clearly the most influential parameter the other three parameters present moderate interactions enough not to be considered as non influential to rank the other three parameters the number of cases with the total effect index greater than zero and its value are checked hence the most influential parameter is path followed by pape and finally pavr none has been considered as non influential at all although pavr could be considered as such in most of the cases again it seems reasonable pais being the most influential as it controls the open space that water has on surface to penetrate into the pavement section before other parameters can have any influence the soil layer the one with highest number of parameters contains the most influential parameter by itself alone soth this layer has also two parameters with no influence in the output sosh and sowp there is a third one socs that presents low interactions in just one case as the number of parameters is high in this layer this last parameter will also be considered as non influential other three parameters show moderate interactions variable over cases sofc clearly interacts more than sopo and soco in this layer as opposed to the other layers there is no a clear physical explanation for soth being the most influential one an explanation may be that the layer thickness controls how water can percolate into lower layers and thus controls the amount of water on the surface that can turn into runoff the storage layer contains the second most influencing parameter overall stsr however its individual influence arises when the drain layer is active the other two storage parameters present moderate and high interactions so they can not be fixed these interactions are also for the activated drain layer option indicating that storage layer parameters have influence mainly in the drain outflow stth would be the most influential of both and stvr the least here again it seems reasonable stsr to be the most influential as it would control outflow and thus water level on the layer before there is outflow from the drain and other two parameters can have its role the last layer the only one considered as optional has no parameters influencing by themselves on the contrary all parameters show interactions the most influential would be drof followed by drfe and drfc here it also seems a reasonable outcome as the drain offset controls the flow presence on the drain table 3 summarises for each layer the most influential parameters those with little influence and those that its value can be fixed the table is the main objective of this article and will provide practitioners calibrating a real pavement or designing a new one a helpful tool to focus their efforts on the most important parameters fig 7 can also be used for that purpose the data is given as a general tool for runoff control purposes no matter if the simulation is done in the long term short term or if drain optional layer is checked the most influential parameters are given in the first column and those parameters that have less influence including interactions with other parameters are given in the second one the last column gives those parameters which value can be fixed and influence neglected it is recommended to start with the most influential one and if necessary to follow with those who have less influence as mentioned in the introduction randall et al 2020 are the only ones that studied pp but they performed a one at a time oat sa for three cross sections focusing on their study but not as a general tool they performed the sa for a short term event and studied the underdrain flow peak and volume without considering the runoff however soth is not identified as an influential parameter if values from fig 4 are analysed in detail it can be seen that for the short term and sodr case none of the parameters has s i 0 not even the soth that may explain the difference rest of the parameters seem to fit well with findings from randall et al 2020 therefore their findings are in line with the values obtained here 4 conclusion although pp is studied here and some other lid types previously were it would be advisable for future research to analyse the sensitivity of lid modules that have not yet been studied rain barrel rooftoop disconnection rain garden and vegetative swale the parameters that reduce the permeability of the different layers have not been analysed in this article as that case may be related to the ageing of the pavement it would be interesting to study how clogging may affect to other parameters similarly the parameters associated with the assignment of lids to the subcatchment have not been studied as those are the same for all lid types thus it would also be interesting to examine their influence on the model output moreover as the soil layer parameters are quite unknown particularly when applied to pps its properties should be further investigated as it can not be characterised as a natural soil also the study has been carried out with the data associated to a certain climate so other rainfall could yield different results it is recommended to study the influence of other rainfall regimes in the model results show that in general and regardless the type of storm analysed or whether the drain is active there are a few parameters that control the value of the outflow from a pp site there are certain differences among cases but the influential negligible parameters are similar consequently the most influential ones are berm height impervious surface fraction of pavement soil thickness storage seepage rate and drain offset on the contrary surface roughness soil suction head soil wilting point and soil conductivity slope have negligible influence on the outflow thus the most sensitive and non influential swmm parameters corresponding to the pp type lid control are identified in this article although further research is needed the parameter list given in this article may still be a helpful tool for practitioners while calibrating a pp as data is given as a general tool not specific to a case considering long term performance and most useful parameters for urban stormwater design credit authorship contribution

4404,the storm water management model swmm widely used by engineers to design or analyse stormwater networks allows to model the so called low impact development lid controls which reduce the flow conveyed to traditional networks but values for lid control parameters are often unknown furthermore it is not always easy to link the cross section materials to those provided by the model particularly in the soil layer this article provides a global sensitivity analysis for the pp type of lid control in order to support practitioners in calibration tasks the analysis explores what factors are the most influential and which can be fixed while calibrating a model in particular flow volume and peak are studied but the analysis also explores the influence of storm length and drain layer which is optional at the end the most influential parameters and those that can be neglected are presented showing that we can focus on quite less parameters than initially given when calibrating a pp model in swmm keywords permeable pavement swmm low impact development suds sensitivity analysis calibration 1 introduction sustainability issues are gaining increasing attention from society biswas 2020 and authorities are encouraged to consider environmental dimensions of their practices stormwater projects being no exception geyler et al 2019 in that context sustainable urban drainage systems suds or low impact development controls lid controls are techniques that provide an improved rainwater management at source in order to get the hydrological behaviour of urbanised land closer to predeveloped situation permeable pavement pp is one type of such lid technique characterised by generating a porous but at the same time accessible surface for pedestrians and vehicles pps consist of several porous layers laid over the natural soil with a cover layer of pavement at the top allowing water to flow through the layers are usually referred to from the top down pavement bedding base subbase and subgrade natural soil layers the section may also include one or more geotextile layers and one or multiple drains in any case there is no unique layout or cross section as solutions adopted by practitioners are usually multiple depending on the structural and hydrological requirements of a given application rodríguez rojas et al 2020 kuruppu et al 2019 woods ballard et al 2015 mullaney and lucke 2014 scholz and grabowiecki 2007 but also adapted to local materials and conditions for stormwater designing purposes or to forecast the response of a given network facing predicted weather events it is common for practitioners to rely on mathematical models there are several available models for the analysis of the pps widely detailed in kaykhosravi et al 2018 but few allow for an integrated hydrological hydraulic modelling of lids incorporated within catchments being storm water management model swmm one of them hence swmm is a powerful instrument to carry out different studies related to various types of lid andres domenech et al 2018 including pp several studies use swmm for analysing lids effects on urban flooding qin et al 2013 hydrologic response of an urban catchment under different scenarios palla and gnecco 2015 or prioritising sites and types for lid practices liao et al 2018 song and chung 2017 besides swmm being recommended for preliminary and detailed design objectives it is also one of the most popular models among scientists kaykhosravi et al 2018 similarly to other types of lid present in swmm pps are defined by overlapping several layers surface pavement soil storage and drain fig 1 a illustrates the layer layout but in order to run the model it is necessary to fix the parameters defined in each of the layers see table 1 it is then when allocating values to the parameters provided by swmm that doubts arise about which may be those that fit better to the real pavement characteristics this is due to the lack of information on the physical properties of the materials used or alternatively because the layout see figs 1b d as an example do not match predefined layers in the swmm lid model with such difficulties it is of great value knowing in advance which are the most influential parameters during model calibration in essence while setting up and using numerical simulation models sensitivity analysis sa methods are invaluable tools iooss and lemaître 2015 in hydrological modelling the most frequent reason for conducting sa is to select the most sensitive parameters to vary during model calibration gupta and razavi 2018 global approaches are required to perform a valid sa when models feature nonlinearities and interactions saltelli et al 2019 although there are three main obstacles to perform such analysis the computation time the number of inputs and the size of the input space pujol 2009 various sa have recently been carried out on pps based on hydrus model costa et al 2020 brunetti et al 2018 turco et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 but the analysed parameters or inputs differ from those used in swmm also several sa have been carried out previously in swmm a detailed list can be found in niazi et al 2017 but few have carried out such an analysis focusing just on lid controls and its parameters panos et al 2020 xu et al 2019 leimgruber et al 2018 peng and stovin 2017 krebs et al 2016 and most of them did it as a previous step before calibrating a certain model randall et al 2020 are the only ones that explored the pp but they did not use a global sa as they explored parameter variability for three cross sections used in their study in addition they focused on the underdrain flow exclusively besides pps have two particular characteristics that differentiate them from other types of lid controls rossman 2015 the pavement layer is used exclusively in this type of lid control and moreover it is the only one where the soil layer is optional thus the analysis of pp lid type would be of great value since none of the previous studies provided a general vision for pps in swmm not just valid for a particular case but as a universal instrument for all real cases that may emerge when calibrating pps in swmm if that data may be available it could potentially be used directly by practitioners to improve the quality and efficiency of their swmm modelling therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of multiple factors on the hydrological response of pps in both short and long term modelling scenarios by using the rainfall runoff model swmm the problem is addressed in the following way first minimum and maximum values were set for explored parameters then considered cases are defined in terms of analysis length optional layers and analysed outputs finally sensitivity indices and their confidence intervals are calculated for each case consequently the objectives set for the study are a to check if there are differences between parameter sensitivities for the several cases studied b to identify negligible and most influential parameters and c to compare those parameters with the ones identified on previous sa studies 2 methodology this section describes the methodology used in the three fundamental steps followed 1 characterise the variance based sa 2 characterise the lid model defined in swmm and 3 define the terms in which sa is performed 2 1 variance based sensitivity analysis the sobol method is a variance based sensitivity method sobol 1990 which decomposes the model output variance into relative contributions from individual parameters and parameter interactions as shown in eq 1 as a result the sensitivity of a given parameter is quantified by the ratio of its contribution to the output variance which ranges from 0 to 1 shin et al 2013 the first term of the equation indicates the addition of the variance for each factor i named v i y being these variances exclusive to that factor the second term indicates the variance due to combinations of two factors i and j named v ij y and so on 1 v y i 1 k v i y i j k v ij y v 12 k y those v i y terms constitute the main effect or the variance of the average output when the input factor x i is fixed the second one constitutes the second order effect or the variance of the average output when the input factors x i and x j are fixed thus if we consider how much of the total variance is due to main effect we can define the first order index given in eq 2 which represents the main effect contribution of each input factor to the variance of the output saltelli et al 2008 higher ranking indices may be defined in the same way such as second order indices or s ij 2 s i v i y v y in case we consider the total contribution of the factor x i to the output variance we also have to consider the interactions of x i with other factors which accounts not only for the main effect but also the higher order effects that will be the total effect of the factor x i hence total index s t i can be defined as shown in eq 3 total effect will give then how much the output variance is reduced on average when factor x i is fixed 3 s t i 1 v i y v y in practice when k is large only the main effects and the total effects are computed obtaining a good information on the model sensitivities in addition s i and s ti are closely linked to a couple of extremely significant sensitivity settings in the calibration context factor fixing and factor prioritisation ratto et al 2007 factor fixing refers to the identification of those input factors if any which have no influence on the model output and therefore can be fixed to any value within their feasible range but with negligible implications on the output factor prioritisation describes the ordering of the input factors according to their relative influence on the model output sarrazin et al 2016 first order index being zero s i 0 is a necessary but insufficient condition to identify the factor x i as non relevant and fix it in such case the factor may be involved in interactions with other factors so there might be higher order terms saltelli et al 2008 instead s i 0 is a good value to qualify a factor as influential as a factor prioritisation setting on the other hand total indices are suitable for the factor fixing setting saltelli et al 2008 being s t i 0 a necessary and sufficient condition in order to fix x i as a noninfluential factor if s t i 0 then x i can be fixed at any value within its range of uncertainty without appreciably affecting the value of the output variance v y as s ti 0 01 is generally used as a threshold for factor fixing sarrazin et al 2016 both obtained s t i and s i values are rounded to the second decimal for additive models and under the assumption of orthogonal input factors s ti and s i are equal and the sum of all s i and thus all s ti is 1 for non additive models interactions exist s ti is greater than s i and the sum of all s i is less than 1 and also the sum of all s ti is greater than 1 by analysing the difference between s ti and s i the impact of the interactions between parameter x i and the other parameters can be determined for calculating both s i and s t i the procedure suggested by saltelli 2002 has been used at the cost of n k 2 simulations being n the base sample samples are generated with the latin hypercube sampling method mckay and beckman 1979 although commonly suggested n value in literature is 1000 sarrazin et al 2016 found that high n values n 1000 are necessary for sensitivity indices to converge however they found that much lower n is enough when the goal is factor prioritisation or fixing as the objective of the article is factor prioritisation and factor fixing a value of n 2000 is used and confidence intervals are calculated confidence intervals for the sensitivity indices are estimated with the bootstrap technique efron 1979 a confidence interval of 95 is given for the sensitivity indices where limits are computed with the basic method davison and hinkley 1997 for that purpose a number of 1000 replicates is considered enough archer et al 1997 2 2 storm water management model swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model used for single event or long term continuous simulation where lid units can be modelled and added to a certain subcatchment rossman and huber 2016a conceptually a generic lid unit can be represented by a number of vertical layers rossman 2010 combined to create the various lid controls pp type lid control combines surface pavement soil storage and drain layers fig 2 being soil and drain layers optional in this article a square subcatchment of 100 m2 has been generated for the simulations all occupied by a lid control of the pp type as illustrated in fig 2 pp can receive water from precipitation i or inflows q 0 from other areas that water on the surface can evaporate e 1 infiltrate to pavement layer f 1 or flow out from the pavement as runoff q 1 water in the pavement layer can also evaporate e 4 or percolate to the soil layer f 4 something similar happens in the soil layer beneath water can percolate to storage layer f 2 or evaporate e 2 in the storage layer water can exfiltrate to native soil f 3 evaporate e 3 or be directed to another area or conveyance through the drain q 3 in this article q 0 will not be considered and regarding the analysed outputs covered in section 2 3 4 outflow from the pp will be the sum of q 1 and q 3 the hydrologic performance of the lid control is modelled by solving simple mass balance equations given in the eqs 4 7 that express the change in water volume in each layer over time as the difference between the inflow water flux rate and the outflow flux rate rossman 2010 the flux terms q e and f in these equations are functions of the current water content in the various layers d i and θ i and specific site and soil characteristics both d i and θ i represent stored water first one as depth mm and second one as moisture content volume of water total volume of soil d i are layer thicknesses and ϕ i are layer porosities the rest of parameters are specified in the table 1 presented in section 2 3 3 as they are model parameters 4 d d 1 dt i q 0 e 1 f 1 q 1 5 d 4 1 f 4 d θ 4 dt f 1 e 4 f 4 6 d 2 d θ 2 dt f 4 e 2 f 2 7 ϕ 3 d d 3 dt f 2 e 3 f 3 q 3 evaporation rates are calculated based on potential evaporation e o t detailed in section 2 3 1 evaporation on the top layer or surface will be the minimum of e o t and available water for layers below evaporation will be the minimum of available water and the fraction of potential evaporation that did not materialise in the upper layers water flow from surface is computed with manning eq 8 infiltration to pavement layer depends on available water volume on the surface layer as shown in eq 9 percolation from pavement layer is the pavement permeability as shown in eq 10 percolation from soil layer is calculated with eq 11 which will occur only if water content is higher than field capacity in that case percolation is modelled using darcy s law flow from drain eq 12 is computed as flow from an orifice being h 3 the hydraulic head seen by the underdrain exfiltration to native soil is the seepage rate of the storage layer as shown in eq 13 8 q 1 1 49 w s 1 2 a n d 1 d 1 5 3 9 f 1

time step to determine how an inflow hydrograph to the lid unit is converted into some combination of runoff hydrograph sub surface storage sub surface drainage and infiltration into the surrounding native soil certain limitations are imposed on the above mentioned water volumes defined by the capacity of each layer in terms of available space to keep water or present water volume more details about the equations to compute moisture balance in each layer can be found on rossman and huber 2016b 2 3 model settings and sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 climatological data this study is undertaken with data gathered in donostia san sebastián spain located facing the bay of biscay in an area with an atlantic climate data from two weather stations has been gathered one of them is igeldo weather station 43 19 0 n 2 0 0 w with a large historical data and the other one is miramon weather station 43 17 20 n 1 58 16 w a newer weather station with 10 min time interval accessible data the sensitivity analysis is conducted studying the hydraulic response of the pp facing two kinds of events short term and long term as it is common for practitioners to check the performance of the network for a certain event which is also a simple method for lid volumetric design purposes a 100 years return period and 6 h rainfall event has been considered for the short term analysis woods ballard et al 2015 a synthetic single event is generated from data available at the igeldo weather station based on the idf curves representing a return period of 100 years the precipitation depth for a 6 h duration storm is 90 7 mm the design storm has been set with the alternating block method chow 2010 considering 15 min steps the aforementioned method does not address a continuous scenario in which one storm may follow another and the system may not have time to drain henceforth its potential to handle a new event will be limited that is why the performance for the system facing continuous events should also be examined as 5 years is considered the minimum period required for securing sensitivity analysis results that are stable in subcatchments shin et al 2013 that period is also considered as sufficient for the defined subcatchment for the long term analysis 5 years series recorded at the miramon weather station have been gathered both temperature and precipitation collected in 10 min intervals fig 3 shows gathered time series but with daily precipitation and average daily temperature data to improve the visibility average rainfall is 1507 mm year with 196 days per year with measured rainfall and average temperature is 14 2 c potential evaporation in the long term is computed from daily maximum and minimum data based on the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 and the latitude for the long term the considered time steps for computing runoff when modelling have been 2 30 min for wet weather and 10 00 min for dry weather for the short term time step for both cases has been 1 00 min reporting time step is 5 00 min for short term and 10 00 min for long term 2 3 2 selected optional layers for lid control as mentioned before there are two optional layers in the pp type lid control soil layer and drain the soil layer or bedding layer beneath the pavement fine gravel or clean sand in practice is a common layer for permeable interlocking pavers in order to laying the pavers on a evener surface than the one given by bigger gravel although soil layer is not always placed randall et al 2020 kayhanian et al 2019 tennis et al 2004 soil layer has not been considered as an optional layer thus two cases are studied one with drain option deactivated named as so and a second one with drain activated labelled as sodr 2 3 3 selected input parameters for lid control the inputs or parameters given to swmm which are used to compute the mentioned water balances to get the outputs are listed on the table 1 the table also indicates which parameters have been used in the following sa vegetation volume fraction from the surface layer which refers to the volume occupied by stems and leaves over the surface rossman 2015 has been excluded from the sa as it is very unusual case in pps this parameter is general for all lid control types parameters that reduce permeability in the long term such as clogging factor regeneration interval and regeneration fraction have not been considered in the storage layer the parameter that considers the reduction of the seepage rate has not been considered either clogging factor finally the parameters that control the opening and closing of the drain have not been considered open level closed level and control curve all those values have been ignored while calculating pp performance table 1 also gives the range for each parameter value while performing the sa maximum and minimum are given considering a uniform distribution most parameter ranges are taken from the swmm manuals rossman 2015 rossman and huber 2016b some are modified such as surface berm height subh top value which is set to 150 mm as it is common value for the curb height which might work as a berm another revised value is surface roughness suro as values given by the manual are considered typical for traditional pavements therefore as pervious pavements are more rough than traditional ones unfinished concrete value of 0 02 is used as a high value for roughness chow 1959 another modified value is the surface slope susl a top value of 10 is selected as it is not usual to design higher slopes mainly because of accessibility issues in spain for example the different regional regulations do not exceed 8 in general and allow slopes of up to 12 for ramps alonso lópez 2010 the soil layer and its parameters are probably the most unknown to practitioners since they are defined with soil parameters such as wilting point or suction head some soil parameters are also changed soil thickness soth for example in that sense as mentioned in the introduction it is considered that there is a wide variety of cross sections that can be modelled in many different ways for that reason a maximum thickness of 200 mm is considered woods ballard et al 2015 field capacity sofc and wilting point sowp are also modified as it is considered that those materials may be clean gravel sand type therefore a 0 06 0 20 range is considered for the first parameter and 0 01 0 05 for the second one pardossi et al 2009 in the storage layer seepage rate is also modified considering it up to 1000 mm h woods ballard et al 2015 in the drain layer the flow coefficient drfc is considered up to 1000 zhang and guo 2015 it should be noted that the offset value from the drain layer is not given in mm but as a percentage of the total thickness of the storage layer although swmm contains some parameters related to the lid control in a subcatchment such as subcatchment area surface width per unit initially saturated impervious area treated and pervious area treated these parameters have not been considered in the sa since the study focused on studying specifically the lid control and its parameters 2 3 4 hydrological outputs and data treatment when carrying out a sensitivity analysis it is essential to define its objective in advance i e which variable or model result is going to be analysed sa results may vary depending on targeted output each target function is insensitive to some often different parameters particularly for those models with more than a handful of parameters shin et al 2013 the aim of this study is to explore the impact of design parameters on the hydraulic response of the pp to this end the outputs analysed are those related with the generated outflow from the pp site outflow volume and outflow peak for that purpose outflow will be the sum of q 1 and q 3 from fig 2 that is superficial runoff and drain outflow all outflow data managed by the pp used to evaluate sensitivity indices is obtained from the report file generated by swmm data related to the volumes is read from the lid performance summary section data relative to peak flows is collected from the same file but in this case from the node inflow summary as runoff and drain flows are diverted in the model to a couple of nodes for that purpose by evaluating a total of two outputs across four cases sixteen indices are calculated for each lid parameter a first order one s i and a total effect one s ti for each parameter as analysed input output cases are multiple values are compared graphically the data has been gathered with the version 5 1 015 of swmm epa 1971 the analysis of the data has been carried out using the open source programming language r r core team 2020 for modelling purposes swmmr package has been used which interfaces the swmm with r leutnant et al 2019 for the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity package has been used iooss et al 2020 and for sample generating the pse package chalom et al 2017 3 results and discussion the results are presented into several sections first some general data description is given later 1 differences between short and long term are discussed 2 the influence of the drain layer is analysed and 3 differences between selected outputs are discussed at the end 4 global analysis is performed although a total of 164 000 simulations are done across various cases while performing the global sa and in addition the 1 in 100 years storm is simulated for the short term analysis few outflow values are computed on average just 0 93 of the simulations produced any outflow in particular the short term analysis created any outflow five times more than the long term which appears to be intuitive since the short term precipitation is higher something similar happened with the optional layers sodr created outflow almost eight times the so option did that also appears to be intuitive since active drainage layer allows underdrain flow the most remarkable aspect of this data is that it shows how effective can pp be reducing the contribution to the stormwater network no matter how the pp is designed the reason for that is that rain intensity is usually lower than pavement permeability and its storage capacity allows infiltration to native soil before flow is diverted from the drain once sa is performed some s i values are found to be close to zero but negative that is consistent with previous findings as saltelli et al 2008 described negative signs due to numerical errors in the estimates when analytical sensitivity indices are close to zero in addition obtained confidence intervals were very large in all modelling scenarios as convergence was not obtained for calculated sensitivity indices to avoid those negative values and high confidence intervals sample size should be increased until convergence which is considered unnecessary for factor fixing and prioritisation also the methodology used to obtain confidence intervals yielded negative values or indices higher than one as those are considered meaningless those values are not represented on the figures before proceeding with a global discussion considering all the cases conducted at the end of this section three previous analyses have been performed from the calculated indices for those mentioned reviews plots with values for first order indices s and total effect indices st are created for that purpose table 2 is also built giving the sum of all indices across cases values from that table will be discussed in the next sections in addition that table confirms that the model is nonadditive as the sum of s i is smaller than one for all cases also the sum of s ti is greater than one for all considered cases 3 1 analysis of short or long term influence regarding to the analysis of storm length some differences arise between short term and long term the fig 4 and values from table 2 show that long term outflows are much more influenced by single parameters without considering any interactions for the short term 4 5 of the variance can be explained on average by one parameter soth on the other hand for the long term outflow 48 5 of its variance can be explained on average by two variables soth and stsr in summary parameter interaction plays a significant role on the short term 3 2 analysis of drain influence if the sensitivity indices are examined according to whether the drain layer is active or not the individual influence of parameters is similar to the previous case as shown in fig 5 and values from table 2 outflow variance in the so case is explained on as average by one variable soth in a 32 while in the sodr case is explained by two variables soth and stsr in a 21 that means that interactions are more relevant when drain layer is active which seems reasonable as outflow is also controlled by the drain parameters and overall influence of the soth is reduced in that sense the number of parameters that may be fixed without affecting the outflow with a s t 0 increases in the so case however it is interesting how these parameters differ from case to case for the so case all parameters other than soth and sofc may be fixed in the soil layer on the contrary for sodr case almost all parameters may be fixed in the pavement layer that shows that when drain layer is active other soil parameters different from thickness have also influence in the outflow which also accounts for drain flow but when drain layer is not active and outflow accounts just for runoff soil layer parameters loose its influence and pavement layer parameters influence is notable that appears to be intuitive since pavement parameters control runoff or at what extent there will be infiltration to the layers below 3 3 analysis of peak or volume influence with regard to the output values fig 6 and values from table 2 show that on average 35 2 of the outflow variance is explained by two parameters for the outflow volume but that value decreases to the 18 8 when the analysed output is the peak flow while the variables remain the same soth and stsr also interactions play a smaller role on the volume outflow than in the peak flow it is also interesting to see how the number of values which can be fixed without affecting the output is higher for the runoff volume for runoff peak the are three parameters with a s t 0 while for the volume there are six which includes all the previous three 3 4 general analysis finally all cases are compared at once in fig 7 which is also used to identify the most important parameters and those that can be neglected or fixed when calibrating the model no matter what input output case we consider those parameters are summarised in table 3 the graph clearly shows that only two parameters have a influence by themselves on the evaluated outputs soth and stsr alone can explain as average 26 5 of the output variance on the contrary there are clearly three parameters that do not affect the output variance sosh sowp and suro first two parameters will be the most obvious candidates for the influential ones and last three will be set as the ones without any influence if examined by layer surface parameters have no influence individually on the contrary subh presents high interactions with other parameters thus it can be considered as the most influential parameter of this layer on the other hand susl presents quite low interactions in just one case so it will be considered as having low influence it seems consistent subh being the most influential parameter as it can restrict the output level and consequently the generated runoff and infiltration to layers below with regard to the pavement layer something similar happens with the individual influence since all parameters show a first order index equal to zero if total indices are examined and thus interactions pais is clearly the most influential parameter the other three parameters present moderate interactions enough not to be considered as non influential to rank the other three parameters the number of cases with the total effect index greater than zero and its value are checked hence the most influential parameter is path followed by pape and finally pavr none has been considered as non influential at all although pavr could be considered as such in most of the cases again it seems reasonable pais being the most influential as it controls the open space that water has on surface to penetrate into the pavement section before other parameters can have any influence the soil layer the one with highest number of parameters contains the most influential parameter by itself alone soth this layer has also two parameters with no influence in the output sosh and sowp there is a third one socs that presents low interactions in just one case as the number of parameters is high in this layer this last parameter will also be considered as non influential other three parameters show moderate interactions variable over cases sofc clearly interacts more than sopo and soco in this layer as opposed to the other layers there is no a clear physical explanation for soth being the most influential one an explanation may be that the layer thickness controls how water can percolate into lower layers and thus controls the amount of water on the surface that can turn into runoff the storage layer contains the second most influencing parameter overall stsr however its individual influence arises when the drain layer is active the other two storage parameters present moderate and high interactions so they can not be fixed these interactions are also for the activated drain layer option indicating that storage layer parameters have influence mainly in the drain outflow stth would be the most influential of both and stvr the least here again it seems reasonable stsr to be the most influential as it would control outflow and thus water level on the layer before there is outflow from the drain and other two parameters can have its role the last layer the only one considered as optional has no parameters influencing by themselves on the contrary all parameters show interactions the most influential would be drof followed by drfe and drfc here it also seems a reasonable outcome as the drain offset controls the flow presence on the drain table 3 summarises for each layer the most influential parameters those with little influence and those that its value can be fixed the table is the main objective of this article and will provide practitioners calibrating a real pavement or designing a new one a helpful tool to focus their efforts on the most important parameters fig 7 can also be used for that purpose the data is given as a general tool for runoff control purposes no matter if the simulation is done in the long term short term or if drain optional layer is checked the most influential parameters are given in the first column and those parameters that have less influence including interactions with other parameters are given in the second one the last column gives those parameters which value can be fixed and influence neglected it is recommended to start with the most influential one and if necessary to follow with those who have less influence as mentioned in the introduction randall et al 2020 are the only ones that studied pp but they performed a one at a time oat sa for three cross sections focusing on their study but not as a general tool they performed the sa for a short term event and studied the underdrain flow peak and volume without considering the runoff however soth is not identified as an influential parameter if values from fig 4 are analysed in detail it can be seen that for the short term and sodr case none of the parameters has s i 0 not even the soth that may explain the difference rest of the parameters seem to fit well with findings from randall et al 2020 therefore their findings are in line with the values obtained here 4 conclusion although pp is studied here and some other lid types previously were it would be advisable for future research to analyse the sensitivity of lid modules that have not yet been studied rain barrel rooftoop disconnection rain garden and vegetative swale the parameters that reduce the permeability of the different layers have not been analysed in this article as that case may be related to the ageing of the pavement it would be interesting to study how clogging may affect to other parameters similarly the parameters associated with the assignment of lids to the subcatchment have not been studied as those are the same for all lid types thus it would also be interesting to examine their influence on the model output moreover as the soil layer parameters are quite unknown particularly when applied to pps its properties should be further investigated as it can not be characterised as a natural soil also the study has been carried out with the data associated to a certain climate so other rainfall could yield different results it is recommended to study the influence of other rainfall regimes in the model results show that in general and regardless the type of storm analysed or whether the drain is active there are a few parameters that control the value of the outflow from a pp site there are certain differences among cases but the influential negligible parameters are similar consequently the most influential ones are berm height impervious surface fraction of pavement soil thickness storage seepage rate and drain offset on the contrary surface roughness soil suction head soil wilting point and soil conductivity slope have negligible influence on the outflow thus the most sensitive and non influential swmm parameters corresponding to the pp type lid control are identified in this article although further research is needed the parameter list given in this article may still be a helpful tool for practitioners while calibrating a pp as data is given as a general tool not specific to a case considering long term performance and most useful parameters for urban stormwater design credit authorship contribution
