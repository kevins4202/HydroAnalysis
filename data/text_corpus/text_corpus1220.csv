6100,the award finalized by the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt 2007a b final order of the cauvery water disputes tribunal ministry of water resources govt of india new delhi for water sharing among the co basin states of the cauvery river basin in india was analyzed and compared with the results obtained by using a model proposed by garg and azad 2018 j hydrol 560 pp 289 300 by analyzing the same data that was used by the tribunal the comparison of the model results for a real basin with the results of the altogether different approach like the tribunal award was made to serve two purposes i establishing confidence in the applicability of the model which otherwise might be considered as some mathematical jargons by the authors without having adequate connect with the realities ii analyse the tribunal award for its rationality and to draw general inferences the analysis of the tribunal award led to some new insights on the water sharing among co basin states namely i it is demonstrated that it would not be proper to reduce the allocation of water to a co basin states for distress year in proportion to its allocation for the normal year to ensure an equitable distribution among co basin states ii it is also revealed that the static allocation even for normal yield of the basin as a whole should not be made among co basin states because it is possible that the normal yield of the basin as a whole may not synchronize with the normal yield of co basin states iii the study defied the general perception that the inclusion of groundwater in overall water availability of the basin will lead to reduction in share of the surface water for co basin states having relatively more groundwater potential as compared to other co basin states the study indicated that the cwdt 2007a b award failed to ensure an equitable water sharing among co basin states even for a year with normal yield in the cauvery basin as a whole the results of the model demonstrated different allocations to different co basin states depending upon the hydrological conditions of the individual co basin states for the normal yield of the cauvery basin as a whole against the static allocation of water recommended by the tribunal the model recommended that the water allocation be varied from 380 thousand million cubic feet tmc to 399 4 tmc for tamil nadu from 278 1 tmc to 315 2 tmc for karnataka from 42 5 tmc to 45 2 tmc for kerala and from 5 6 tmc to 6 2 tmc for pondicherry depending upon the hydrological conditions of the co basin states during a normal yield of the cauvery basin against the static values of water allocation proposed by the tribunal of 419 tmc for tamil nadu 270 tmc for karnataka 30 tmc for kerala and 7 tmc for pondicherry for the normal yield of the cauvery basin further the study showed that if groundwater is also included along with surface water for water allocation among co basin states then the model allocated 3 5tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under the normal hydrologic condition of the cauvery basin prima facie it is against general perception that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water as groundwater potential of tamil nadu co basin state is relatively higher than other co basin states it can be safely concluded from the study that the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 has the potential to resolve the transboundary water allocation problems and the model is flexible to include any number of demand and supply side variables along with their weights in a rational manner keywords system dynamics cauvery river dispute water sharing model water allocation water conflicts cauvery conflict 1 introduction the ever increasing demands as well as the skewed distribution of water both temporally and spatially has resulted in the sharing of limited water resources becoming a focal point of conflicts in particular the scarcity of water can be directly linked to conflicts among co basin states nations garg and hassan 2007 menzel and matovelle 2010 existing literature on the subject demonstrates that water conflicts are based on the concept of scarcity induces disputes westing 1986 homer dixon 1994 gleick 1993 richards and singh 1997 hall and hall 1998 several studies corriea and de silva 1999 yoffe and ward 1999 gleick 2000 wolf et al 2003 have explored the potential role of water resources as a catalyst of conflict among nations or states the traditional approaches to conflict resolution normally rely on classical game theory parrachino et al 2006 madani 2010 and or outside mediation an excellent review of different approaches was presented by wolf 2002 and dinar et al 2007 however these approaches achieved limited success and mostly resulted in a legal battle among stakeholders for example a perusal of some major river disputes such as narmada 1979 krishna 1976 and cauvery 2007 disputes of india revealed that the traditional approach of negotiations among co basin states could not resolve the problems of water sharing even after spending many years and were ultimately referred to the tribunals by the government of india for its resolution these tribunals award mostly relied on a vague interpretation of objectives of ensuring equitable and reasonable allocations among co basin states while resolving the water sharing disputes all the tribunal awards suffered from problems of rigidities inefficiencies and inequities which are typically associated with traditional water allocation system adopted by these tribunals the tribunals could not ensure equitable and reasonable water allocation among co basin states because of their inherent difficulties in objectively defining and formulating equitable and reasonable allocations naturally in the absence of an established formulation for the water allocation among stakeholders it had given ample scopes for subjectivities in decision making for water allocation and certainly led to different outcomes under different court settings all these tribunals gave a static allocation of water among co basin states for the adopted water availability of the basin without considering the hydrological status of the co basin states it also proposed a proportionate reduction in the allocations to the co basin states in distress year with respect to their shares corresponding to the adopted reference water availability further none of these tribunals considered groundwater as an integral part of the overall water availability which should have been considered to ensure an equitable distribution of the water resources of the basin as a whole in this context garg and azad 2018 proposed a framework model for water sharing among co basin states in an objective manner by conceptualizing and formulating the struggle of the co basin states for water sharing in terms of the governing variables they also proposed conceptualization and formulation for the assessment of weighting factors of the co basin states for water sharing in terms of the governing variables however garg and azad 2018 provided no comparison and analysis of the results of their model with the results of altogether different approaches like the tribunal award to demonstrate the merit of their model over the tribunal award in the absence of such a comparison garg and azad 2018 results might be considered as some numerical values arising out of a model but might be away from the realities in order to fill this important gap an indian cauvery river basin was chosen for which the tribunal water sharing award was also available to share its water among its four co basin states the present paper fills this important gap analyse the tribunal award on the cauvery basin and compares it with the model results to demonstrate the model applicability and hence to make the model more acceptable for a real basin besides this some new general insights were also obtained through the application of the model on the cauvery river basin the cauvery river water dispute anand 2004 in india which is the focus of the present study created in a significantly hostile environment in the year 1991 and resulted in violence between two co basin states of the cauvery basin in india karnataka and tamil nadu the multiparty democratic system in india was unable to resolve the problem of water sharing politically as the most sincere and honest efforts of any ruling party were always contested by the opposition parties for their political gains the federal structure of the government in india is further complicated by the fact that the governments in the state and centre may be of different political parties having conflicting political compulsions moreover these parties could have come into power by exploiting the significantly sensitive issue of water sharing to their political advantages therefore the establishment of an independent judicial tribunal to settle the dispute among the different stakeholders co basin states of the cauvery basin became inevitable and the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt was constituted in the year 1990 to resolve the problem independently without any political motives the cwdt accepted the general principle for transboundary water sharing joseph 2007 ghosh 2015 rasul 2014 giardano and wolf 2003 mckinney 2011 among co basin states that demand a reasonable and equitable share of water ila 2004 while taking into consideration the economic and social requirements of the co basin states for water the inherent difficulty was in defining equitable and reasonable and its application while allocating water among the co basin states a common debate of a river water dispute usually consists of one state claiming its prescriptive rights over the water and demanding that the principle of prior appropriation be applied in deciding water allocation while the other state argues for an equitable and reasonable share of the river water to be distributed to each co basin state moreover each basin state tends to exaggerate its requirements consequently the claim of each co basin state cannot be satisfied with the limited water availability in the basin in this context the helsinki rules ila 1966 on water resources summarize the different factors variables that have to be considered while making decisions on water allocation however it does not provide any objective criteria or formulations on how to use these factors for water allocation the tribunal also agreed with the variables envisaged in the helsinki rules for resolving the water sharing problem among the co basin states however it was unable to consider them in the final verdict owing to the absence of a scientific methodology in quantifying these variables therefore the co basin states were considerably dissatisfied with the final award of the tribunal which primarily presented a subjective judgement with certain interwoven rationalities consequently the final award was also challenged by the co basin states of the cauvery basin in the supreme court of india but the final award of the tribunal was primarily upheld by the supreme court of india with a few modifications however the co basin states were still not satisfied with the final verdict and it became politically difficult to implement even the final verdict of the supreme court of india we have analyzed the verdict of the cwdt for its rationality in the present study and compared it with the results obtained by a more scientific formulation presented by garg and azad 2018 the study on the cauvery river basin also inferred new insights for the distribution of water for other basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 cauvery river basin the cauvery river is a peninsular river and the boundary of its basin is spread over four south indian states i e tamil nadu karnataka kerala and the union territory of pondicherry it lies between longitude 75 27 e to 79 54 e and latitude 19 09 n to 13 30 n fig 1 it covers approximately 802 km from its origin in the brahmagiri hills down the ghats and through the plains and eventually drains into the bay of bengal out of its total length of approximately 802 km 320 km lies in karnataka 414 km is in tamil nadu 4 km is in pondicherry and the remaining 64 km forms the common boundary between karnataka and tamil nadu physiographically the basin can be divided into three parts namely the uplands in the western ghats the plateau region of mysore and the delta in tamil nadu and pondicherry the cauvery basin has a catchment area of 81155 km2 cwc 2102 which is approximately 2 47 of the total geographical area of india the cauvery basin index map is shown in fig 1 and its state wise distribution of the catchment area are listed in table 1 the cauvery river after its origin from the brahmagiri hills runs southeast and then turns northeast before it is joined by harangi its first significant tributary at the border of kodagu and mysore districts further downstream it is joined by hemavathy at the confluence of the three rivers cauvery hemavathy and laxmanthirtha which lies 12 km northwest of the city of mysore the krishnarajasagar dam is constructed in 1931 thereafter the cauvery river is joined by an important tributary kabini which originates in the western ghats in the state of kerala shimsha and arkavathy are the tributaries that join the river cauvery after the sivasamudram falls just before the river enters the state of tamil nadu upon entering tamil nadu the cauvery continues through a series of twisted gorges until it reaches the hogenakkal falls and flows through a straight narrow gorge near salem where the 54 m high and 1 6 km long mettur dam was constructed in 1934 the mettur dam provides irrigation to approximately 110000 ha and hydropower of 240 mw for this area benjamin 1971 subsequently the cauvery river veers south and at 45 km below the mettur reservoir it merges with the bhavani river which originates in the palakkad district of kerala to enter the plains of tamil nadu once in the plains the cauvery is joined by its tributaries noyil and amaravathi below the upper anicut dam the river branches into two streams that further down reunite to form the island of srirangam the grand anicut dam is situated just after the srirangam island and diverts water for irrigation in the cauvery delta to the east thereafter the cauvery river is further split into two with one branch acquiring the name vennar while the other retains its original name i e cauvery the branch that retains the name of cauvery enters the bay of bengal at kaveripattinum approximately 13 km north of tranquebar finally the branches split into innumerable smaller branches and eventually flow into the bay of bengal 2 2 cauvery river dispute the sharing of the water of the cauvery river has been the source of a serious conflict between the states of tamil nadu and karnataka the genesis of this conflict rests in two agreements meenakshisundaram et al 2010 finalized in 1892 and 1924 between the erstwhilemadras presidency now the state of tamil nadu and the princely state of mysore now the state of karnataka karnataka claims that these pre independence agreements are invalid and are skewed heavily in favour of tamil nadu the madras presidency was favoured over the princely state of mysore as madras was under the british rule further karnataka now demanded more share of water as it is contributing more runoff to the cauvery basin when compared to tamil nadu therefore karnataka demanded a renegotiated settlement based on the criteria of equitable sharing of waters tamil nadu on the other hand pleaded that it had already developed approximately 1 2 million ha of land consequently it is significantly dependent on the existing pattern of usage further tamil nadu claimed that any change in this pattern would adversely affect the livelihood of millions of farmers in the state to understand the conflict better the history of the cauvery conflict can be divided into four phases gosh and bandyopadhyay 2009 consisting of i phase i period between the agreements of 1892 and 1924 ii phase ii post the agreement of 1924 up to its validity in 1974 iii phase iii period of the formation of cwdt up to its award notification in 2013 iv phase iv period of review by the supreme court and its verdict 2018 these phases are briefly described hereunder in subsequent sections 2 2 1 the period between the agreements of 1892 and 1924 the genesis of the cauvery dispute dates back to the late 1880 s when the then madras state was under the british administration whereas the mysore state was a princely state the dispute arose when state of mysore decided that the unused surplus water that joins into the sea should be intercepted in mysore and used by mysore for its irrigation and other purposes this decision created panic in the madras presidency because they believed that it would adversely affect the existing irrigation systems in the cauvery delta on the insistence of the then government of india the two sides in 1892 finalized an agreement entitled rules defining the limits within which no new irrigation works are to be constructed by mysore state without previous reference to madras government the agreement of 1892 made it the prerogative of the madras presidency to unilaterally determine the scenarios when its interests were being adversely impacted in particular the agreement of 1892 symbolized the victory of the lower riparian state madras over the upper riparian state mysore michael 1979 hussain 1972 gebert 1983 however the dispute again precipitated in 1910 when mysore approved a plan to construct a dam later to be called the krishnarajasagar or krs dam however madras refused to give its consent for this move as it had its plans to build a storage dam at mettur after a reference to the government of india permission was accorded to mysore aggrieved by the decision madras wanted a redressal through arbitration under the terms of the agreement of 1892 consequently the government of india referred the matter for arbitration under rule iv of the agreement of 1892 the award upheld the earlier decision of the government of india and allowed mysore to proceed with the construction of the dam with a capacity of up to 11 thousand million cubic feet tmc hussain 1972 in 1920 a series of meetings were held between both parties however a formal agreement was signed only in 1924 the agreement of 1924 allowed mysore and madras to proceed with the work of the krishnarajasagar and mettur dams respectively including restrictions on both the states in terms of the area that could be irrigated michael 1979 2 2 2 post the agreement of 1924 up to its validity in 1974 for the next three decades from 1924 there were no major disputes between both the states however in the early 1950s karnataka raised objections against madras proposal for two canal projects namely kattalai and pullambadi on the ground that the surplus water used by these projects would adversely affect the apportionment of water between the states when the 1924 agreement would again be reviewed after 50 years in 1974 in view of these the planning commission of india approved these projects with the rider that these projects would not cause prejudice to the agreement for distribution of surplus water in 1974 to which madras gave its concurrence jain 1971 the cauvery controversy again gained momentum during the period of the second 1956 61 and third 1961 66 five year plan when karnataka forwarded plans for the construction of three dams on the tributaries of cauvery namely kabini hemavaty and harangi out of the three dam proposals of karnataka only the kabini project was approved by the planning commission for irrigation of 12140 ha of land cffc 1972 considering the objections of tamil nadu neither the central water commission nor the planning commission of india cleared the remaining two projects despite the objections of tamil nadu and without approval from central water commission cwc karnataka continued with the construction of these two dams consequently in august 1971 the tamil nadu government approached the supreme court of india however the supreme court of india ruled that there was insufficient ground for it to issue an injunction against the state of karnataka namasivayam 1975 with the reorganization of the states of indian 1956 two new states namely kerala and pondicherry entered into the dispute for cauvery water allocation to resolve the continued disputes on the government of india initiative a meeting was arranged between the chief ministers of tamil nadu kerala and karnataka and the union minister for irrigation and power to resolve the issue the meeting ended on may 31 1972 with a preliminary agreement on the following attempts should be made to resolve the dispute by negotiators as early as possible establishment of a cauvery fact finding committee cffc to collect all the data pertaining to the cauvery water the role of the committee was only to collect data and analyze it but not to make any recommendations tamil nadu government should withdraw its case before the supreme court in june 1972 the central government appointed the cffc which collected the requisite data from the concerned states and submitted its initial report in december 1972 followed by an additional report in august 1973 based on the findings of the cffc 1972 the co basin states agreed on the issue of availability of water in the cauvery river basin as 740 tmc and 670 tmc at 50 dependability and 75 dependability respectively 2 2 3 formation of cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt and its award from 1981 to 1985 karnataka and tamil nadu engaged in a series of bilateral talks none of which was able to achieve conflict resolution considering the persistent obstructions the central government requested the supreme court to settle the issue consequently the supreme court directed the central government to constitute a tribunal within a month of its ruling presented on may 4 1990 thereafter on june 2 1990 the centre established the cwdt on june 25 1991 the tribunal passed an interim order directing karnataka to release 205 tmc of water a year of which tamil nadu would release 6 tmc to pondicherry after hearing the arguments as briefly described in section 2 2 3 1 of all the parties involved for the next 16 years the cwdt delivered its final verdict on february 5 2007 the tribunal presented its unanimous decision wherein the total water availability in the cauvery river basin at the lower coleroon anicut site in a normal year i e a year with 50 dependable yield was determined to be 740 tmc which included 10 tmc for minimum environmental flow and 4 tmc for unavoidable wastage to the sea in its verdict for a normal year the tribunal annually allocated 419tmcof water to tamil nadu 270 tmc to karnataka 30 tmc water to kerala and 7 tmc to pondicherry the notification of the final order was issued by the government of india based on the directions of the supreme court on february 19 2013 and it took effect from the date of the notification itself 2 2 3 1 predominant points in the cauvery disputes karnataka and tamil nadu presented their arguments and counter arguments to substantiate their respective claims for the cauvery water a brief summary of the arguments based on materials available in the public domain presented by each state to the cauvery tribunal are listed below i according to karnataka the 1924 agreement made under powerful british rule is a biased agreement favoring madras therefore karnataka requested that after its validity period of 50 years a fresh reallocation should be carried out in an equitable manner the farmers of tamil nadu had acquired prescriptive rights during the british rule when karnataka was not sufficiently empowered to even ask for impartial water sharing for the farmers of karnataka conversely tamil nadu was of the opinion that the agreement of 1924 provided a framework for the project development within the cauvery basin both for karnataka and tamil nadu therefore even if it was subjected to review after 50 years the fundamental spirit and the perspectives of the agreement should remain unaffected ii karnataka also argued that the groundwater should be included as an issue in the dispute it supported its case by citing the undp study which indicated that annually 128 tmc of groundwater could be withdrawn beneficially from within the delta area by tamil nadu the c c patel committee also reported that even with a significantly conservative estimate tamil nadu could use 30 tmc groundwater tamil nadu presented that even if more intensive use of groundwater were performed it would not result in much difference to its requirement of cauvery river water this was owing to the fact that the groundwater is used for starting the nurseries of the kuruvai paddy crop before the first release of cauvery water from the mettur dam that begins in late june subsequently the release from the mettur dam replenishes the groundwater therefore there will be hardly any change in the requirements of surface water from the mettur dam tamil nadu also supported its case by indicating that the verdicts of the krishna river dispute tribunal and narmada water dispute tribunal which decided that even though the groundwater resource of a state is a relevant factor for equitable apportionment of water of an interstate river basin the groundwater should be omitted altogether while considering the legal problem of the river basin because groundwater cannot be accurately estimated iii karnataka also argued that for equitable distribution of water the catchment contributions from the respective states and also its requirements considering the drought prone areas in the basin should be taken into consideration tamil nadu recognized the fact that catchment contribution to river flow and other influencing factors should be considered while distributing water among co basin states however it recommended that these factors should be considered only for the allocation of surplus water after satisfying the prescriptive rights of downstream farmers iv karnataka also claimed that its portion of the cauvery basin is dominated by the southwest sw monsoon whereas the portion of the basin in tamil nadu is dominated by the northeast ne monsoon however it also receives the sw monsoon therefore tamil nadu benefits from both the monsoons and it does not have to share the runoff of the ne monsoon however even though karnataka predominantly receives only the sw monsoon it has to share the runoff with tamil nadu considering this karnataka suggested that tamil nadu should change their cropping pattern such that it coincides with the pattern of rainfall in tamil nadu accordingly rather than growing paddy during the sw monsoon season it should only be grown during the ne monsoon which implied that paddy should be grown only during one season and dry crops should be grown during the second season these suggestions of karnataka were opposed by tamil nadu for the following reasons a ne monsoon is highly unpredictable and it will lead to failure of the paddy crop if the rainfall is below normal b the delta region is highly prone to waterlogging hence even a few days of waterlogging may eventually lead to failure of crops other than paddy c people in the area are accustomed to eating rice and it is very difficult for them to change their food habits v karnataka accused that the irrigation system in the delta was highly inefficient with the considerable escape of water occurring at the tail end regulators of the system karnataka suggested that through modernization of the irrigation system in tamil nadu construction of several small storages in the command area conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and the development of irrigation considering the agreed optimum cropping pattern tamil nadu will be able to avoid wastage and economize on its use of the cauvery water thereby allowing karnataka to use its rightful share of the river however tamil nadu did not agree with the views of karnataka that the irrigation system and the water management practices in the delta region are significantly inefficient tamil nadu admitted that there was room for improvement in the system however it is still one of the most efficient systems in the country 2 2 4 supreme court order of february 2018 dissatisfied with the tribunal award karnataka kerala and tamil nadu subsequently filed special leave petitions against the cwdt award 2007a b in the supreme court finally in february 2018 the supreme court delivered its verdict wherein it virtually endorsed the tribunal award but with some minor modifications it awarded an additional 4 75 tmc water to karnataka for the purpose of implementation of a water supply scheme for the city of bangalore and another 10 tmc for draught prone districts however the supreme court balanced the verdict by ordering that 10 tmc of groundwater from the cauvery delta must be preserved for safe use by tamil nadu therefore under the verdict of the supreme court karnataka would have to release 177 25 tmc of water to tamil nadu against its earlier amount of 192 tmc consequently karnataka would now receive 284 75 tmc against the 270 tmc allocated by the tribunal the allocated amount to tamil nadu was reduced to 404 25 tmc against 420 tmc allocated by the tribunal the states of kerala and pondicherry would continue to receive 30 tmc and 7 tmc respectively 2 3 issues with the tribunal and supreme court verdicts except for some minor modifications the supreme court more or less upheld the cwdt award the highlights of certain issues with the allocation of water by the cwdt which were not addressed appropriately are enumerated below while considering the factor of prescriptive rights the tribunal ruled that it could be treated as a relevant factor but not as an exclusive basis for the apportionment the tribunal also discarded the harmon doctrine as well as the principles of natural flow however it agreed with the helsinki rules ila 1966 which recommended the consideration of several factors such as the catchment area of the basin contribution of water by each co basin state past utilization of water and economic and social requirements of each co basin state even though the tribunal recognized these factors for equitable and reasonable allocation of water among co basin states the cwdt could not apply it while apportioning water among the co basin states of the cauvery river basin owing to the absence of a theoretical framework for water sharing in terms of relevant factors the tribunal in its final award stated that in a distress year i e years having water availability less than the water availability of a normal year the sharing would reduce proportionately to the water availability of a normal year as the cauvery river water allocation was based on 50 dependability a distress year could be one out of every two years this implied that the shortage of water could be a regular reality as opposed to a rare phenomenon moreover the cauvery river basin experiences both sw and ne monsoons in which the region of karnataka is dominated by the sw monsoon while the delta region in tamil nadu is dominated by the ne monsoon therefore the nature of distress was expected to demonstrate both temporal and spatial variations in such a condition the apportionment on a proportionate basis with respect to the normal year may not be appropriate another technical issue that the tribunal had not considered was the inclusion of groundwater for an apportionment among co basin states despite the extensive groundwater potential and its considerable uses in the basin the tribunal did not bring groundwater within the ambit of allocation the cauvery tribunal award restricted itself to sharing only stream surface flow however both surface and groundwater should have been integral parts of water available for allocation the tribunal reserved a quantity of 10 tmc for environmental protection and a quantity of 4 tmc as inevitable discharge into the sea for a normal year however both these figures do not adhere to any scientific assessment for the ecosystem or the hydrological characteristics of the basin the award recommended the establishment of a cauvery management board which was dominated by engineers this board did not represent a transdisciplinary knowledge base that combined the social natural and engineering sciences which could have evolved to achieve a sustainable resolution to the complex problem of the cauvery river basin the cauvery water disputes clearly present a lesson that the top down solutions decided either by the tribunal or the supreme court may not resolve the conflict as such it calls for a scientific approach to determine a reasonable and equitable share of water to be allocated among the co basin states 2 4 water sharing model this section provides a brief description of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 and its extension to the cauvery river basin for water sharing among its co basin states 2 4 1 conceptual representation of the cauvery water sharing model a schematic diagram of a simplified conceptual model for water sharing among co basin states is shown in fig 2 for the case of the cauvery river basin of india which has four co basin states namely tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry denoted by the variable names w x y and z respectively in the causal loop diagram representation with the limited water availability when compared to the total targeted demand of all the co basin states within the basin any allocation less than their aspired target results in varying degrees of discontent among the co basin states such a discontent would force these states to struggle for equity in water allocation which at any point of time is a function of target allocation and weight of the respective co basin states as represented in fig 2 the struggle for equity of any co basin state results in a change in its water allocation in proportion to its struggle for equity when compared to the overall struggle by all the co basin states thus the change in the allocation to any co basin state is a function of its struggle for equity the overall struggle of all co basin states and the availability of water which is shown in the conceptual diagram fig 2 when there is a change in the allocation to all the co basin states a revised allocation is finalized to each co basin state which again generates new values of discontent and hence new sets of struggles for equity the new sets of struggles for equity again result in a change in allocation to all the co basin states and this process continues until convergence is attained 2 4 2 model formulation we considered that there were n co basin states in a basin we also assumed that the target and allocation to the ith co basin state were denoted by tgt i and alc i respectively the deviation in the allocation of water to any co basin state that does not match its target causes discontent we defined the normalized discontent of the ith co basin state dct i in accordance with eq 1 1 dct i tgt i alc i if alc i tgt i tgt i if alc i tgt i let us also define the level of satisfaction stf i of the ith co basin state in a normalized form as the ratio of allocation to target in accordance with eq 2 2 stf i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 1 if alc i tgt i we assumed that p is the number of demand side variables considered for the model and d s v i j denotes the jth demand variable for the ith co basin state the target of the ith co basin state tgt i represents the summation of all types of demands for water for the ith co basin state and it can be expressed in accordance with eq 3 3 t g t i j 1 p d s v i j the discontents among the co basin states would result in a struggle for equity in water allocation which was assumed to be directly proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and inversely proportional to their satisfaction therefore the struggle for equity sfe i for the ith co basin state can be written in accordance with eq 4 4 s f e i d c t i s t f i w i 2 4 3 the formulation for determining weight of each co basin state the weighting factor of any co basin state contesting for water sharing can be divided into two parts i the weights attributed to various water demands termed as demand side variables and ii the weights attributed to other influencing variables termed as the supply side variables of the co basin states in the present study for the cauvery basin three variables irrigation domestic and industrial water demand of different co basin states were considered as the demand side variables conversely the existing water usage runoff contribution and weighted ratio of arable area to the catchment area of the various co basin states were considered as the other influencing variables or supply side variables further each of these types of variables was assigned weight contributions which were considered to be a function of its relative contributions with respect to each other and the influences of each of these variables for a co basin state with respect to the entire basin 2 4 3 1 the formulation for determining the contributions of demand and supply side variables we denoted the relative contributions of the jth demand side variable of the ith co basin state as demand side factors dsf i j and it can be expressed in accordance with eq 5a 5a d s f i j d s v i j i 1 n d s v i j i 1 n j 1 p i j a r e i n t e g e r s similarly we denoted the relative contributions of the kth supply side variable for the ith co basin state as the supply side factors ssf i k and can be expressed in accordance with eq 5b 5b s s f i k s s v i k i 1 n s s v i k i 1 n k 1 q i k a r e i n t e g e r s in the above two equations p and q are the total number of demand side and supply side variables respectively 2 4 3 2 formulation of the influence weight of demand and supply side variables the influence weight of any demand or supply side variable is considered as a ratio of the sum of that particular variable to the total of all variables in that category we denoted these influence weights as demand influence weights diw and supply influence weights siw then the influence weight at the demand side of the jth variable diw j can be written in accordance with eq 6a and similarly the influence weights for the supply side variables siw k for the kth supply side variable can be expressed using eq 6b 6a d i w j i 1 n d s v i j p w d j i 1 n r 1 p d s v i r p w d r i 1 n j 1 p r 1 p i r j a r e i n t e g e r s 6b s i w k i 1 n s s v i k p w s k i 1 n s 1 q s s v i s p w s s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s where pwd j and pws k are the priority weights for the jth demand side variable i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s and the kth supply side variable respectively the priority weight of each demand side variable can be assigned any specific value as per the priority value fixed by co basin states because these variables are similar in nature and have the same unit however most of the supply side variables are not similar in nature and unit therefore they are treated equivalent to each other and then the priority can be fixed by co basin states therefore the expression for the priority weight pws k for the kth supply variable can be written in accordance with eq 7 by considering the first variable i e k 1 to be the reference variable 7 i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q i k a r e i n t e g e r s where iw k is the importance weight of the kth supply side variable for the cauvery basin study three demand side and three supply side variables were considered as the governing variables garg and azad 2018 had introduced the arable area to catchment area ratio as a supply side variable to rationalize the effect of another supply side variable volume of water contribution as one of the co basin states may have a relatively large water contribution in the yield of basin but have smaller arable land however if a co basin state has a relatively small arable area along with a small water contribution in the basin as a whole it would be assigned a weightage that is equivalent to a co basin state with the relatively large arable area and the large water contribution corresponding to this variable the cauvery basin demonstrates a large variation in the catchment area of its co basin states ranging from 148 km2 to 43868 km2 along with a correspondingly large variation in the arable land therefore a modified supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio in place of arable area to catchment area ratio was defined to take care of the large variations in the catchment and arable areas among co basin states the supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio was weighted according to the relative arable area ratio of each co basin state which is equal to the ratio of respective arable areas of each co basin state to the total arable area within the entire basin as such the variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio of the ith state can be written as a a i i 1 n a a i a a i c a i where aa i and ca i represent the arable and catchment areas of the ith state respectively it may be noted that the weighted arable area to catchment area ratio serves two purposes i it improves the weight of a co basin state when it has relatively low water contribution in the basin and relatively high arable area demand ii it prevents a co basin state from being assigned a relatively higher weightage when it has relatively both low water contribution and low arable area it may be noted here that the first purpose of this variable is performed by the factor a a i c a i and the second purpose of this variable is performed by the factor a a i i 1 n a a i further it may be noted that in case all the co basin states have comparable arable areas then the factor a a i i 1 n a a i for all the co basin states will have approximately the same value and hence it will reduce to the original variable arable area to catchment area ratio in order to justify the introduction of weighting factor a a i i 1 n a a i in this supply side variable a sensitivity analysis was carried out by comparing the overall weights of co basin states under with and without a a i c a i weighting factor scenarios the analysis of basin data showed that karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry are having comparable arable area to catchment area ratio however the absolute value of arable area of karnataka and tamil nadu are about 300 times larger than the arable area of pondicherry therefore if we use arable area to catchment area ratio as the supply side variable then we will get same order of weightage for all these co basin states corresponding to this variable the sensitivity study of the model gave discontent of 33 02 33 08 and 5 09 to karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively it may be noted that the discontent for pondicherry co basin state is relatively much less as compared to other co basin states because pondicherry also got the same order of weight as for other co basin states in spite of having relatively very low arable area demand the sensitivity study with the modified supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio showed that the modified variable has addressed this issue and gave discontent of 32 05 32 62 and 36 54 to karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively which is justifiable from the point of view of equitable water allocation among co basin states as such the modified variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio performed the intended balancing act which in turn helped in equitable and reasonable allocations among co basin states 2 4 3 3 formulation of the weighting factor for each co basin state once the contribution factors and influence weights of each demand and supply side variable are determined the weight of ith co basin state w i can be calculated using eq 8 8 w i α j 1 p d s f i j d i w j β k 1 q s s f i k s i w k where α is the overall weight of the demand side variables with values ranging between 0 and 1 β is the overall weight of the supply side variables considered to be equals to 1 α 2 4 4 water allocation quantities among co basin states in the present model the allocation of water to any co basin state from the overall water availability wa in the basin is assumed to be proportional to the ratio of the struggle for equity of the concerned co basin state to the overall struggle for equity of all the co basin states thus the water allocation to the ith state alc i at any time t can be written in the form of eq 9 9 a l c i s f e i w a i 1 n s f e i at a successive time t δ t the water allocation can be determined by assigning a weight to a new value and a weight 1 to the old value of alc i to control the convergence accordingly the incremental allocation δ a l c i in δ t time can be written in the form of eq 10 10 δ a l c i s f e i w a i 1 n s f e i 1 a l c i a l c i where is the weight convergence factor that varies between 0 and 1 the changes in alc i over the time interval δ t can be calculated using eq 10 hence the rate of change of alc i can be expressed in accordance with eq 11 11 a l c i t k c δ a l c i where kc is a time constant and δ alc i is the change in the allocation for the ith co basin state in accordance with eq 10 eq 11 can be solved by system dynamics using alc i as the stock variable kc as the time constant and δ a l c i is as expressed by eq 10 therefore alc i can be expressed by eq 12 in a system dynamic form 12 alc i integ kc δ alc i initial allocation where integ stands for integration the new value of the water allocation a l c i to any state is adjusted in accordance with eq 12 and the process is repeated until equilibrium is reached i e δ a l c i 0 the above formulation for an equitable distribution of water allocation was modelled using a system dynamics approach and applied to the water sharing dispute in the cauvery river basin of india 2 5 system dynamics model representation in this section the system dynamics based simulation model for water sharing in the cauvery river basin of india is represented in the form of a causal loop diagram the four co basin states of cauvery basin are tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry and are denoted by the variable names w x y and z respectively in the causal loop diagram representation fig 3 for a better understanding a two stage development of a system dynamic causal loop diagram to represent the water sharing formulation of the cauvery river basin was conducted in the first stage of the development of the causal loop diagram various linkages among the model variables were identified as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from the causal loop diagram that wa is to be shared between the four co basin states namely w x y and z representing tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry respectively any allocation to the co basin states that were less than their targeted values would lead to varying levels of discontents and satisfactions among the co basin states in the causal loop diagram shown in fig 4 the target values for the four co basin states are denoted by the variables targetw tgt1 targetx tgt2 targety tgt3 and targetz tgt4 while the discontents are denoted by discontentw dct1 discontentx dct2 discontenty dct3 and discontentz dct4 and the satisfactions are denoted by satisfactionw stf1 satisfactionx stf2 satisfactiony stf3 and satisfactionz stf4 respectively furthermore the causal loop diagram also shows the stock variables namely allocation alc1 allocation alc2 allocation alc3 and allocation alc4 respectively representing the allocations made to states w i e i 1 x i e i 2 y i e i 3 and z i e i 4 any water allocation that is less than the target values leads to a propensity to struggle for equity among the co basin states for water allocation which were denoted by struggle for equityw sfe1 struggle for equityx sfe2 struggle for equityy sfe3 and struggle for equityz sfe4 for the four co basin states as all the four co basin states will have different degrees of influence on the water allocation their weights were denoted by weightw w1 weightx w2 weightyy w3 and weightz w4 respectively the details of the causal loops of these weights are shown and explained in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram the struggle for equity among the four co basin states would result in re adjustments in the allocation of water between the four states which are denoted by incr allocationw δ alc1 incr allocationx δ alc2 incr allocationy δ alc3 and incr allocationz δ alc4 this process of re adjustment in the allocation between the two states will continue as shown in the causal loop of fig 3 until the equilibrium is reached i e until δ alc1 δ alc2 δ alc3 and δ alc4 approaches to zero after the development of the first stage of the causal loop diagram the detailed causal loop diagram for the targets and weights corresponding to each of the co basin states are shown in the second stage of the development fig 4 for example the weights of the states w x y and z were denoted as weightw w1 weightx w2 weighty w3 and weightz w4 respectively and are defined as a function of the demand side and supply side variables accordingly these have been shown in the causal loop diagram as a function of the demand side variables such as agricultural drinking water and industrial demands as well as a function of the supply side variables such as the existing water utilization volume of water contribution and weighted arable to catchment area ratio for each of the co basin states it may be noted here that while representing a variable name in the causal loop diagram all the variable codes representing the concerned variable are shown along with their descriptive names for example struggle for equity for state w was represented by sfe1 struggle for equity for state x is represented by sfe2 and so on they are shown along with their respective descriptive names while assigning the variable code in the causal loop diagram the subscript was appended at the end of the variable code the first subscript corresponds to the state index number and the second subscript corresponds to the concerned variable index code for example the first demand side variable i e j 1 which is the agricultural demand for state x i e i 1 is represented by dsv11 while for state y i e i 2 it is represented by dsv21 similarly for the second demand variable j 2 which is the drinking water demand for state x i e i 1 and state y i e i 2 was denoted as dsv12 and dsv22 respectively the same indexing pattern was adopted to represent the demand and supply factors along with their influence weights the calculations of weights were completed in accordance with eq 5 to 8 which is self explanatory 2 6 summary of data used in the study the proposed model by garg and azad 2018 was applied to the cauvery river basin fig 1 in india to study the water sharing disputes among the co basin states and compare the results with the water allocation award finalized by the cwdt the data used for the model was primarily obtained from the cffc 1972 report cwdt 2007a b award final verdict of the supreme court of india 2018 cwc 2102 various government publications reports and the information available on the internet fig 3 illustrates the linkages between the various parameters variables of the proposed model in the present study normal dry and wet year rainfall were considered as 50 25 and 75 dependable values respectively the dependability values were estimated by the thiessen polygon method using the annual rainfall data obtained from the rain gauges located in and around the cauvery basin the total catchment area of the cauvery river basin was considered as 81155 km2 cwc 2102 up to lower coleroon anicut out of which the areas spanning 43868 km2 34273 km2 2866 km2 and 148 km2 are located in tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry respectively the groundwater recharge in the command area was derived from the district wise groundwater recharge data cgwb 2017 on a proportionate basis a summary of the cauvery basin data and other parameters associated with the proposed model are listed in table1 3 results and discussion a detailed technical review of the tribunal award is presented in section 3 1 to assess the technical robustness of the tribunal award in section 3 2 a comparison of the results obtained by the water sharing model garg and azad 2018 with the tribunal award is presented to comprehensively illustrate the objectivity and flexibility of the proposed model garg and azad 2018 while ensuring equitable distribution of water among co basin states section 3 3 discusses the effect of the inclusion of groundwater along with surface water on water allocation among various co basin states 3 1 technical review of cwdt award the tribunal had considered no variable other than the water demands of co basin states and overall water availability in the basin although it stated that other variables should also be considered in the water allocation process as suggested by the helsinki rule the tribunal finalized the allocations among the co basin states assuming the homogeneity of hydrological conditions within the basin as a whole and disregarded the dependability of the yield within each co basin state when compared to the dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole this was obvious from the fact that the tribunal award stipulated a proportionate reduction of allocation for co basin states during dry distress years i e less than 50 dependable yield with respect to the allocation made to respective co basin states for a normal year i e 50 a dependable year a detailed analysis of the yield series data submitted by tamil nadu to the cwdt showed that there was hardly any positive correlation between the yield series at mettur dam and the yield series below mettur dam fig 5 and table 2 this is because the yield above the mettur dam is governed by the sw monsoon while the yield below the mettur dam is governed by the ne monsoon and both the monsoon systems are independent as the mettur dam is close to the border of karnataka and tamil nadu the yield series at mettur dam primarily represents the major contribution from the catchment within the state of karnataka further it also represents the contribution of the kabini river lies within the state of kerala and a very small contribution from tamil nadu similarly the yield series below the mettur dam primarily represents the major contribution of the catchment within tamil nadu and also a small contribution from the catchments within kerala and pondicherry therefore we may assume that the dependability of the yield series at the mettur dam primarily represents the dependability of the yield of the cauvery water within the administrative boundary of karnataka and the dependability of the yield series below the mettur dam primarily represents the dependability of the yield of the cauvery water within the administrative boundary of tamil nadu the summation of the yields above and below the mettur dam represents the yield of the entire cauvery basin in table 2 the yield series of 38 years 1934 35 to 1971 72 are arranged in the descending order with respect to the dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole column 6 columns 7 and 8 in table 2 represent the dependability of the yield in karnataka i e yield at mettur dam and tamil nadu i e below mettur dam respectively for a given dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole at lower coleroon anicut in column 6 the graphical representation of these different levels of dependability is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that there is almost a reverse trend between the dependability levels of the yield series of karnataka and tamil nadu thus we can expect that when the portion of the cauvery in karnataka is experiencing a dry hydrologic condition then in the same water year there is a high probability of the portion of the cauvery basin in tamil nadu experiencing a wet hydrological condition therefore any water allocation among co basin states is required to be performed based on prevailing hydrological conditions in co basin states as it would not be justifiable to assume the same hydrological condition in all the co basin states based on the past yield series data however the tribunal award had overlooked these basin specific characteristics arising owing to the influence of two distinct monsoon systems i e sw and ne consequently the tribunal award could not achieve the intended objective of reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states according to the cwdt award in a normal year i e 50 a dependable year karnataka will release a pre decided quantum of water in a fixed monthly pattern and it will be reduced proportionately during a distress year i e less than 50 dependable yield such an allocation methodology of the tribunal on a proportionate basis may work when the co basin states as well as the cauvery basin as a whole experience the same hydrological condition in case the co basin states experience different hydrological conditions the tribunal award will lead to further distortion from the equitable allocation of water the possible combinations of hydrological conditions in the co basin states are shown in the matrix presented in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that only three combinations are reasonably favorable for the application of the tribunal award out of nine possible combinations of the cauvery system further the allocation of water among the stakeholders for the remaining six combinations would be irrational this in turn implies that the tribunal award will not provide a proper allocation in two years out of every three years i e the tribunal award demonstrates a 66 chance of violating the principle of reasonable and equitable allocation among co basin states as such if the verdict is considered rationally the tribunal award seems to be unreasonable because when the flow of the basin as a whole is at normal dependability the co basin states may experience considerably different levels of dependability such as dry wet or normal conditions hence it is not logical to distribute the water among co basin states assuming that the co basin states will demonstrate the same dependability as the basin demonstrates as a whole to further illustrate these shortcomings of the tribunal award we examined the case of the water year 1947 48 1944 45 and 1948 49 in table 2 in the water year 1947 48 the yield of the basin as a whole demonstrates 50 dependability whereas the yield of karnataka also demonstrates normal dependability of 47 37 and tamil nadu also demonstrates near normal dependability of 55 26 in the water year 1944 45 the yield of the basin as a whole is near normal dependability of 52 63 whereas the yields of karnataka and tamil nadu in the same water year are dry at 78 95 and wet at 15 79 respectively similarly while considering the year 1948 49 the yield of the basin as a whole is near normal at 55 26 dependability whereas the yields of karnataka and tamil nadu in the same water year are wet at 36 84 and dry at 68 42 values of dependability respectively the examples of these three water years clearly demonstrate that even if the cauvery basin yield as a whole demonstrates approximately normal 50 dependability the dependability of yield in the co basin states can be in any of the three possible states of dry normal and wet hence it is unacceptable to implement the tribunal award considering normal dependability at the basin level as a whole to confirm the presence of similar yield trends in the basin at present the weighted average rainfall of all the co basin states as well as the cauvery basin as a whole were calculated in the absence of the associated yield series of recent times that is acceptable to all the co basin states the weighted average rainfall was calculated based on 40 years from 1974 to 2014 of data collected from rainfall stations within and around the cauvery basin catchment obtained from the india meteorological department the rainfall data prior to this period was insufficient and hence were not used for this study the dependability of the annual weighted average rainfall of the co basin states with respect to the rainfall dependability of the cauvery basin as a whole is plotted in fig 6 the trends of the rainfall dependencies of the co basin states in fig 6 are similar to the yield trends shown in fig 5 therefore we concluded that the rainfall and yield patterns of the karnataka and tamil nadu co basin states in general demonstrate inverse trends with respect to each other these trends can be attributed to the fact that karnataka obtains its rainfall predominantly from the sw monsoon while tamil nadu obtains its rainfall predominantly from the ne monsoon hence the principle of proportionate allocation of water in dry years as suggested by the tribunal may not be applicable for an equitable distribution of water among co basin states of the cauvery basin 3 2 comparison of the results of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 with the cwdt award we observed that there is a lack of a rational approach in the allocation of water among the co basin states as the tribunal primarily adjusted the demands of the co basin states to match the water availability in the cauvery basin the demand adjustment was conducted subjectively by restricting demands curtailing the irrigation area of the co basin states and assuming higher efficiency of the irrigation system by suggesting the improvement in the conveyance system and the adoption of modern techniques therefore the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 was applied to address the shortcomings of the tribunal award and the results of the model were compared with the tribunal award the tribunal presented its award for a normal hydrological year as well as for a distress i e dry year therefore the comparison of results obtained using the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 with the cwdt award was performed for both the normal and dry hydrological years and are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 respectively 3 2 1 comparison of the results for normal hydrological years as already discussed in the earlier section the cauvery basin rarely experiences homogeneous hydrological conditions in fact more often both the karnataka and tamil nadu states experience opposing hydrological conditions further a close perusal of the data for the years 1944 45 1947 48 and 1948 49 table 2 demonstrate that even if the yield series of cauvery basin as a whole may be close to normal 50 dependability the karnataka portion and tamil nadu portion of the basin may both demonstrate near normal dependability or one may be dry with dependability close to 75 and other may be wet with dependability less than 25 or vice versa further in accordance with the different monsoon patterns for the co basin states of the cauvery basin in a given water year karnataka and kerala can be assumed to have the same hydrological conditions while tamil nadu and pondicherry can be assumed to be in the same hydrological conditions to incorporate the hydrological characteristics of the basin in the water allocation process three hydrological conditions namely normal wet and dry were considered for the co basin states although the model is a general and can give results for any combination of hydrological conditions for the sake of simplification we considered the normal dry and wet hydrological conditions as 50 75 and 25 dependable values respectively based on these assumptions there are three combination of hydrological conditions namely i normal normal ii dry wet iii wet dry which can be experienced by the portions of the cauvery basin located in karnataka and tamil nadu while the cauvery basin as whole may be experiencing near normal hydrological condition in terms of the overall yield of the basin to conduct further analysis for these hydrological conditions the irrigation demand made by the co basin states to the tribunal during the 50 dependable yield of the basin were assumed to correspond to the normal hydrological condition demand for all the co basin states the irrigation demand for dry and wet hydrological conditions for each co basin state was calculated by adjusting the irrigation demand with respect to the effective rainfall in each of these two cases thus the irrigation demand of a dry year was determined by adding an equivalent volume of water for the command area corresponding to the decrease in effective rainfall with respect to the effective rainfall in a normal year the effective rainfall was calculated based on the food and agriculture organisation fao formula similarly the irrigation demand of the wet water year was calculated by subtracting the equivalent volume of water corresponding to the increase in effective rainfall in a wet water year from the effective rainfall in a normal year after determining the water demands of the co basin states for various hydrological conditions i e normal dry and wet the water sharing model of garg and azad 2018 was applied to the cauvery basin and the allocation to various co basin states in these hydrological conditions was calculated initially a comparison of the results of the water allocation presented by the cwdt award with the results of the water sharing model was performed for a normal hydrological condition among the co basin states which is listed in table 4a it can be observed from table 4a that the cwdt award caused more discontent in kerala and karnataka when compared to tamil nadu the results of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 resulted in approximately the same values of discontent in karnataka tamil nadu and kerala in terms of the volume of water thetribunal allocated 39 02 tmc and 1 04 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 25 97 tmc and 14 04 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively when compared to the water allocated by the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 fig 7 shows that the model converged quickly to the final water allocation values for the co basin states for normal hydrological conditions and the same trends were demonstrated for the various hydrological conditions after calculating the results for the normal hydrological condition throughout the cauvery basin the water allocation among co basin states was also calculated for other hydrological combinations i e dry wet or wet dry combinations as listed in table 4b using the proposed model when the basin as a whole has a near normal yield it can be seen from table 4b and fig 8 that the allocation to karnataka may increase to 315 2 tmc or 278 1 tmc depending upon the dry or wet hydrological conditions respectively when compared to the static award of the cwdt of 270 tmc for a basin wide normal year irrespective of the hydrological conditions in the co basin states similarly the allocation to tamil nadu may also change to 399 4 tmc or 380 tmc depending upon the dry or wet hydrological conditions respectively when compared to the static award of the cwdt of 419 tmc for a basin wide normal year the cwdt award did not consider the different hydrological conditions among the co basin states of the cauvery basin and presented a static water allocation for the co basin states which led to inequitable water allocations this may be one of the technically valid reasons to explain the ineffectiveness of the award and hence the immense resistance of the co basin state of karnataka to share the demanded quantum of water with tamil nadu even during the normal hydrological years measured for the cauvery basin as a whole 3 2 2 comparison of the results for dry hydrological years for distress or dry year the tribunal recommended a proportionate reduction in allocation among co basin states however even though it seems logical to make such a reduction it is not strictly applicable to the cauvery basin because of the following reasons i for the hydrological characteristics of the cauvery basin there is a higher probability that one part of the basin will experience wet condition whereas other parts of the basin will be dry ii it is illogical to reduce all types of demand proportionately iii even if the entire cauvery basin may be experiencing a distress condition the results of the study demonstrate that the proportionate principle may not be applicable especially for a severe dry hydrological condition this is because the variation of rainfall demonstrating high dependability is much more in karnataka than in tamil nadu which in turn implies that in a severe dry year the requirement of karnataka will increase much more than tamil nadu as the proportion of the contribution from rainfall that satisfies a part of the irrigation demand in tamil nadu will be more consequently the surface water requirement will be less when compared to karnataka the results of the water allocation using the proposed model by garg and azad 2018 for a range of water availability options from a minimum of approximately 500 tmc to an average water availability of approximately 750 tmc in a distress year clearly confirms that the principle of proportionate allocation may not prove to be rational even when all the co basin states of the cauvery basin are considered to experience the same hydrological distress conditions fig 9 it also clearly indicates that in a severe drought year the allocation to karnataka should increase instead of demonstrating a proportionate decrease as per the tribunal award because the relative contributions of rainfall satisfying a part of the irrigation demand will be much more in tamil nadu owing to the presence of dual monsoon effects in its catchment rather than the single monsoon effect in the catchment of karnataka 3 3 water allocation considering both surface and groundwater of the basin the cwdt declined to include groundwater in the basin water availability based on the fact that groundwater could not be accurately estimated from a technical perspective and hence not fully cognizable from the legal point of view however despite inherent uncertainties about the assessment of the quantum of groundwater availability ignoring it altogether is not rationally justifiable particularly considering the better techniques and the availability of the data on groundwater recharges these days the central ground water board cgwb 2017 provided the annual groundwater recharge data of the country based on their extensive data network which was used in this study to explore the various possible scenarios of water allocation in the cauvery basin therefore considering the shortcomings of the cwdt award the sharing of water allocation among co basin states was also calculated by including the groundwater availability of the basin along with the surface water availability of 726 tmc excluding 14 tmc towards environmental flow and unavoidable wastage to minimize the effect of uncertainties associated with groundwater estimation and to be on the conservative side the groundwater recharge only within the command area of the co basin states was considered further the following two scenarios of annual dynamic groundwater recharge were considered for its allocation among co basin states along with surface water a groundwater recharge only from rainfall b groundwater recharge from rainfall as well as other sources of recharge a brief description of the results of water allocation among co basin states for these two cases of groundwater recharges along with surface water are discussed in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 3 3 1 water allocation considering dynamic groundwater recharge owing to rainfall and surface water to consider the effect of groundwater the water availability in the model was considered as the sum of surface water and dynamic groundwater available owning to recharge in the command area only through rainfall the model results for allocation of combined surface and groundwater for this scenario under basin wide normal condition are listed in table 5a along with its comparison with the cwdt award it is to be noted that after making water allocation by the model to the co basin states the net surface water share corresponding to a co basin state was calculated after subtracting the respective groundwater availability for that co basin state the results for this scenario under different hydrological conditions are listed in table 5b and are illustrated in a graphical form in fig 10 in this scenario for a basin wide normal condition the cwdt award when compared to the model results allocated 32 6 tmc and 1 0 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively and 23 3 tmc and 10 4 tmc less water to karnataka and kerala respectively it may be noted that the model allocated 6 4 tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under this scenario when compared to the case where only surface water was considered section 3 2 1 whereas the surface water allocation values to karnataka and kerala were reduced by 2 8 tmc and 3 6 tmc respectively these allocation results are contrary to the general perceptions that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water for the water sharing among the co basin states in the cauvery basin a similar trend can also be observed in tables 4b and 5b under different hydrological conditions 3 3 2 water allocation considering groundwater from all recharge sources and surface water similar to section 3 3 1 the total water availability for water allocation was considered as the sum of the dynamic groundwater available owing to recharge in the command area from all sources and the surface water the results are listed in table 6a for the basin wide normal condition and in table 6b for different hydrological conditions fig 11 it can be observed from table 6a that the cwdt allocated approximately 35 5 tmc and 1 4 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 24 3 tmc and 12 7 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively under the basin wide normal hydrological condition when compared to the allocations made by the model from the results listed in tables 4a and 6a it can be noted that the model allocated 3 5 tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under this scenario when compared to the case where only surface water was considered section 3 2 1 whereas the surface water allocation values to karnataka kerala and pondicherry were reduced by 1 7 tmc 1 3 tmc and 0 5 tmc respectively in this scenario also the allocation was determined to be against the general assumption that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water in the water sharing process among the co basin states in the cauvery basin a similar trend can also be observed in tables 4b and 5b under different hydrological conditions 4 conclusions the cwdt award cwdt 2007a b for cauvery river water sharing was analyzed and compared with the results obtained by the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 using the same data that was used by cwdt the study demonstrated that there are shortcomings in the cwdt award which have to be addressed to ensure equitable and reasonable allocation of water among co basin states the study also gave some general insights about river water sharing issues not confined to the cauvery basin only following conclusions covering both cauvery basin specific as well as general river basin water sharing issues were drawn from the present study i it was demonstrated that the cwdt award could not resolve the water sharing problem even for a normal year yield as different hydrological conditions of the co basin states may lead to the samenormal yield for basin as a whole however the tribunal failed to consider it and gave a static distribution of water among the co basin states for the normal yield ofthe cauvery basin even most of the other tribunals such as narmada water dispute tribunal nwdt 1979 and krishna water dispute tribunal kwdt 1976 also gave the static water allocation to the co basin states without giving any considerations for likely variations in the hydrological conditions of the co basin states as such failed to ensure equitable water allocation among co basin states it is an important finding which should have been considered by the tribunals while making the awards for river water sharing disputes ii the cauvery tribunal emphasized the principle of equitable apportionment which was recognized by the helsinki rules to be the guiding factor for resolving disputes on the apportionment of water of an interstate river it also stressed that for determining reasonable and equitable shares relevant factors have to be considered together in reaching a conclusion for determining reasonable and equitable shares for co basin states however these objective considerations could not be provided by the various river basin tribunals including cwdt iii the technical review of the cwdt award demonstrated that the proportionate reduction in the allocation to the co basin states for distress years with respect to the allocation specified for normal years may result in allocations among co basin states that are not in consonance with the intended objective of reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states in fact other tribunals had also recommended the proportionate reduction in the allocation for distress year which as per the present study shall not ensure equitable allocations among co basin states iv the assumption of hydrological homogeneity in the cauvery basin was analyzed by comparing the dependability level of the yield series of the basin as a whole and the dependability level of the yield series of the respective co basin states a significant disparity with the dependability levels of the yield series of the co basin states viz a viz the dependability level of yield series of basin as a whole was found therefore it is not advisable to give a static allocation independent of the hydrological conditions of the co basin states because it does not lead to equitable allocations among co basin states similar to cwdt tribunals for other river basins may also suffer from the same deficiency as such the study gave this important insight that it would not be proper for the tribunals to give a static allocation among co basin states and heterogeneity in hydrological conditions of the basin must be considered while giving the awards even for the normal yield of the basin v the cwdt award could not ensure equitable allocation of water among co basin states because of the following two reasons i its inability to consider different hydrological conditions that may be experienced by co basin states due to presence of two monsoon systems namely ne and sw which are active in tamil nadu and karnataka respectively ii it did not give any weight to the factors governing the water allocation among co basin states vi the results of the model by garg and azad 2018 demonstrated different allocations to different co basin states depending upon the hydrological conditions of the co basin states even for a normal yield of the cauvery basin against a static allocation of water given by the cwdt the water allocation values varied from 359 9 tmc to 399 9 tmc for tamil nadu from 278 1 tmc to 315 2 tmc for karnataka from 42 5 tmc to 44 tmc for kerala and from 5 6 tmc to 6 2 tmc for pondicherry depending upon hydrological conditionsof the co basin states for the normal yield of the cauvery basin against the static values of water allocated by the tribunal of 419 tmc for tamil nadu 270 tmc for karnataka 30 tmc for kerala and 7 tmc for pondicherry for the normal yield of the cauvery basin without considering different hydrological condition in co basin states vii a comparative study of the surface water allocation of the cauvery basin by the cwdt award and by the model garg and azad 2018 demonstrated that even if the cauvery basin was assumed to demonstrate a basin wide normal hydrological condition the cwdt award when compared to the model results allocated 39 tmc and 1 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 26 tmc and 14 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively however if the predominant hydrological inhomogeneity of the basin was considered then for the worst hydrological combination namely when tamil nadu is wet and karnataka is under dry hydrological condition but the basin as a whole has a normal yield the static cwdt award when compared to model results would result in allocating 59 1 tmc and 1 4 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 45 2 tmc and 15 3 tmc less water will be allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively viii the cwdt had not included groundwater in the total water availability in the cauvery basin for the apportionment in view of uncertainty associated with the groundwater estimation and hence not fully cognizable from a legal perspective however when groundwater is included in the total water availability of the basin in such scenario the model results were found to be more favorable to tamil nadu thereby defying the general perception of tamil nadu that its share in surface water allocation would be reduced if groundwater is also considered along with surface water the proposed model results suggest that the share of surface water to tamil nadu may increase up to 6 4 tmc under the basin wide normal hydrological condition while the shares of karnataka and kerala may get reduced up to 2 7 tmc and 3 7 tmc respectively when compared to the model results without the consideration of groundwater it may be noted that nwdt and kwdt had also not included ground water in their awards while considering the overall availability of water for sharing in the basin the present study suggests that the tribunals must also include groundwater as an integral part of the overall water availability of the basin to ensure equitable allocations of water resources of the basin as a whole as such the present study on the cauvery basin provided some important insights for river water sharing disputes in general and conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model of garg and azad 2018 could address the water sharing problems among co basin states it may be noted that the model of garg and azad 2018 can take any number of co basin states with any number of demand and supply side variables along with priority importance weights of these variables therefore one may choose the relevant variables depending upon the specific trans boundary water sharing problem the crux of a water sharing problem lies in the determination of the equitable and reasonable share of water among the co basin states in an objective manner considering all the relevant variables so that it could be acceptable to all the co basin states and the proposed model provided an answer to it further socio political factors can aggravate water sharing problems if it does not ensure reasonable and equitable allocations among stakeholders if equitable distributions are secured then chances of getting socio political acceptability become very high even if it does not get entirely accepted by all political entities due to political compulsions it can definitely defuse political tensions and prevent it from gaining more significant socio political dimensions as such the proposed framework model can reduce a socio political ramification by ensuring equitable allocations among stakeholders other factors which can lead to socio political unacceptability can be addressed politically by bringing in appropriate legislation such as setting up an appropriate institutional arrangement in the form of a river basin management board that can have the capacity to create resolution mechanisms through best practices on the concept of river basin governance 5 disclaimer this

6100,the award finalized by the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt 2007a b final order of the cauvery water disputes tribunal ministry of water resources govt of india new delhi for water sharing among the co basin states of the cauvery river basin in india was analyzed and compared with the results obtained by using a model proposed by garg and azad 2018 j hydrol 560 pp 289 300 by analyzing the same data that was used by the tribunal the comparison of the model results for a real basin with the results of the altogether different approach like the tribunal award was made to serve two purposes i establishing confidence in the applicability of the model which otherwise might be considered as some mathematical jargons by the authors without having adequate connect with the realities ii analyse the tribunal award for its rationality and to draw general inferences the analysis of the tribunal award led to some new insights on the water sharing among co basin states namely i it is demonstrated that it would not be proper to reduce the allocation of water to a co basin states for distress year in proportion to its allocation for the normal year to ensure an equitable distribution among co basin states ii it is also revealed that the static allocation even for normal yield of the basin as a whole should not be made among co basin states because it is possible that the normal yield of the basin as a whole may not synchronize with the normal yield of co basin states iii the study defied the general perception that the inclusion of groundwater in overall water availability of the basin will lead to reduction in share of the surface water for co basin states having relatively more groundwater potential as compared to other co basin states the study indicated that the cwdt 2007a b award failed to ensure an equitable water sharing among co basin states even for a year with normal yield in the cauvery basin as a whole the results of the model demonstrated different allocations to different co basin states depending upon the hydrological conditions of the individual co basin states for the normal yield of the cauvery basin as a whole against the static allocation of water recommended by the tribunal the model recommended that the water allocation be varied from 380 thousand million cubic feet tmc to 399 4 tmc for tamil nadu from 278 1 tmc to 315 2 tmc for karnataka from 42 5 tmc to 45 2 tmc for kerala and from 5 6 tmc to 6 2 tmc for pondicherry depending upon the hydrological conditions of the co basin states during a normal yield of the cauvery basin against the static values of water allocation proposed by the tribunal of 419 tmc for tamil nadu 270 tmc for karnataka 30 tmc for kerala and 7 tmc for pondicherry for the normal yield of the cauvery basin further the study showed that if groundwater is also included along with surface water for water allocation among co basin states then the model allocated 3 5tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under the normal hydrologic condition of the cauvery basin prima facie it is against general perception that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water as groundwater potential of tamil nadu co basin state is relatively higher than other co basin states it can be safely concluded from the study that the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 has the potential to resolve the transboundary water allocation problems and the model is flexible to include any number of demand and supply side variables along with their weights in a rational manner keywords system dynamics cauvery river dispute water sharing model water allocation water conflicts cauvery conflict 1 introduction the ever increasing demands as well as the skewed distribution of water both temporally and spatially has resulted in the sharing of limited water resources becoming a focal point of conflicts in particular the scarcity of water can be directly linked to conflicts among co basin states nations garg and hassan 2007 menzel and matovelle 2010 existing literature on the subject demonstrates that water conflicts are based on the concept of scarcity induces disputes westing 1986 homer dixon 1994 gleick 1993 richards and singh 1997 hall and hall 1998 several studies corriea and de silva 1999 yoffe and ward 1999 gleick 2000 wolf et al 2003 have explored the potential role of water resources as a catalyst of conflict among nations or states the traditional approaches to conflict resolution normally rely on classical game theory parrachino et al 2006 madani 2010 and or outside mediation an excellent review of different approaches was presented by wolf 2002 and dinar et al 2007 however these approaches achieved limited success and mostly resulted in a legal battle among stakeholders for example a perusal of some major river disputes such as narmada 1979 krishna 1976 and cauvery 2007 disputes of india revealed that the traditional approach of negotiations among co basin states could not resolve the problems of water sharing even after spending many years and were ultimately referred to the tribunals by the government of india for its resolution these tribunals award mostly relied on a vague interpretation of objectives of ensuring equitable and reasonable allocations among co basin states while resolving the water sharing disputes all the tribunal awards suffered from problems of rigidities inefficiencies and inequities which are typically associated with traditional water allocation system adopted by these tribunals the tribunals could not ensure equitable and reasonable water allocation among co basin states because of their inherent difficulties in objectively defining and formulating equitable and reasonable allocations naturally in the absence of an established formulation for the water allocation among stakeholders it had given ample scopes for subjectivities in decision making for water allocation and certainly led to different outcomes under different court settings all these tribunals gave a static allocation of water among co basin states for the adopted water availability of the basin without considering the hydrological status of the co basin states it also proposed a proportionate reduction in the allocations to the co basin states in distress year with respect to their shares corresponding to the adopted reference water availability further none of these tribunals considered groundwater as an integral part of the overall water availability which should have been considered to ensure an equitable distribution of the water resources of the basin as a whole in this context garg and azad 2018 proposed a framework model for water sharing among co basin states in an objective manner by conceptualizing and formulating the struggle of the co basin states for water sharing in terms of the governing variables they also proposed conceptualization and formulation for the assessment of weighting factors of the co basin states for water sharing in terms of the governing variables however garg and azad 2018 provided no comparison and analysis of the results of their model with the results of altogether different approaches like the tribunal award to demonstrate the merit of their model over the tribunal award in the absence of such a comparison garg and azad 2018 results might be considered as some numerical values arising out of a model but might be away from the realities in order to fill this important gap an indian cauvery river basin was chosen for which the tribunal water sharing award was also available to share its water among its four co basin states the present paper fills this important gap analyse the tribunal award on the cauvery basin and compares it with the model results to demonstrate the model applicability and hence to make the model more acceptable for a real basin besides this some new general insights were also obtained through the application of the model on the cauvery river basin the cauvery river water dispute anand 2004 in india which is the focus of the present study created in a significantly hostile environment in the year 1991 and resulted in violence between two co basin states of the cauvery basin in india karnataka and tamil nadu the multiparty democratic system in india was unable to resolve the problem of water sharing politically as the most sincere and honest efforts of any ruling party were always contested by the opposition parties for their political gains the federal structure of the government in india is further complicated by the fact that the governments in the state and centre may be of different political parties having conflicting political compulsions moreover these parties could have come into power by exploiting the significantly sensitive issue of water sharing to their political advantages therefore the establishment of an independent judicial tribunal to settle the dispute among the different stakeholders co basin states of the cauvery basin became inevitable and the cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt was constituted in the year 1990 to resolve the problem independently without any political motives the cwdt accepted the general principle for transboundary water sharing joseph 2007 ghosh 2015 rasul 2014 giardano and wolf 2003 mckinney 2011 among co basin states that demand a reasonable and equitable share of water ila 2004 while taking into consideration the economic and social requirements of the co basin states for water the inherent difficulty was in defining equitable and reasonable and its application while allocating water among the co basin states a common debate of a river water dispute usually consists of one state claiming its prescriptive rights over the water and demanding that the principle of prior appropriation be applied in deciding water allocation while the other state argues for an equitable and reasonable share of the river water to be distributed to each co basin state moreover each basin state tends to exaggerate its requirements consequently the claim of each co basin state cannot be satisfied with the limited water availability in the basin in this context the helsinki rules ila 1966 on water resources summarize the different factors variables that have to be considered while making decisions on water allocation however it does not provide any objective criteria or formulations on how to use these factors for water allocation the tribunal also agreed with the variables envisaged in the helsinki rules for resolving the water sharing problem among the co basin states however it was unable to consider them in the final verdict owing to the absence of a scientific methodology in quantifying these variables therefore the co basin states were considerably dissatisfied with the final award of the tribunal which primarily presented a subjective judgement with certain interwoven rationalities consequently the final award was also challenged by the co basin states of the cauvery basin in the supreme court of india but the final award of the tribunal was primarily upheld by the supreme court of india with a few modifications however the co basin states were still not satisfied with the final verdict and it became politically difficult to implement even the final verdict of the supreme court of india we have analyzed the verdict of the cwdt for its rationality in the present study and compared it with the results obtained by a more scientific formulation presented by garg and azad 2018 the study on the cauvery river basin also inferred new insights for the distribution of water for other basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 cauvery river basin the cauvery river is a peninsular river and the boundary of its basin is spread over four south indian states i e tamil nadu karnataka kerala and the union territory of pondicherry it lies between longitude 75 27 e to 79 54 e and latitude 19 09 n to 13 30 n fig 1 it covers approximately 802 km from its origin in the brahmagiri hills down the ghats and through the plains and eventually drains into the bay of bengal out of its total length of approximately 802 km 320 km lies in karnataka 414 km is in tamil nadu 4 km is in pondicherry and the remaining 64 km forms the common boundary between karnataka and tamil nadu physiographically the basin can be divided into three parts namely the uplands in the western ghats the plateau region of mysore and the delta in tamil nadu and pondicherry the cauvery basin has a catchment area of 81155 km2 cwc 2102 which is approximately 2 47 of the total geographical area of india the cauvery basin index map is shown in fig 1 and its state wise distribution of the catchment area are listed in table 1 the cauvery river after its origin from the brahmagiri hills runs southeast and then turns northeast before it is joined by harangi its first significant tributary at the border of kodagu and mysore districts further downstream it is joined by hemavathy at the confluence of the three rivers cauvery hemavathy and laxmanthirtha which lies 12 km northwest of the city of mysore the krishnarajasagar dam is constructed in 1931 thereafter the cauvery river is joined by an important tributary kabini which originates in the western ghats in the state of kerala shimsha and arkavathy are the tributaries that join the river cauvery after the sivasamudram falls just before the river enters the state of tamil nadu upon entering tamil nadu the cauvery continues through a series of twisted gorges until it reaches the hogenakkal falls and flows through a straight narrow gorge near salem where the 54 m high and 1 6 km long mettur dam was constructed in 1934 the mettur dam provides irrigation to approximately 110000 ha and hydropower of 240 mw for this area benjamin 1971 subsequently the cauvery river veers south and at 45 km below the mettur reservoir it merges with the bhavani river which originates in the palakkad district of kerala to enter the plains of tamil nadu once in the plains the cauvery is joined by its tributaries noyil and amaravathi below the upper anicut dam the river branches into two streams that further down reunite to form the island of srirangam the grand anicut dam is situated just after the srirangam island and diverts water for irrigation in the cauvery delta to the east thereafter the cauvery river is further split into two with one branch acquiring the name vennar while the other retains its original name i e cauvery the branch that retains the name of cauvery enters the bay of bengal at kaveripattinum approximately 13 km north of tranquebar finally the branches split into innumerable smaller branches and eventually flow into the bay of bengal 2 2 cauvery river dispute the sharing of the water of the cauvery river has been the source of a serious conflict between the states of tamil nadu and karnataka the genesis of this conflict rests in two agreements meenakshisundaram et al 2010 finalized in 1892 and 1924 between the erstwhilemadras presidency now the state of tamil nadu and the princely state of mysore now the state of karnataka karnataka claims that these pre independence agreements are invalid and are skewed heavily in favour of tamil nadu the madras presidency was favoured over the princely state of mysore as madras was under the british rule further karnataka now demanded more share of water as it is contributing more runoff to the cauvery basin when compared to tamil nadu therefore karnataka demanded a renegotiated settlement based on the criteria of equitable sharing of waters tamil nadu on the other hand pleaded that it had already developed approximately 1 2 million ha of land consequently it is significantly dependent on the existing pattern of usage further tamil nadu claimed that any change in this pattern would adversely affect the livelihood of millions of farmers in the state to understand the conflict better the history of the cauvery conflict can be divided into four phases gosh and bandyopadhyay 2009 consisting of i phase i period between the agreements of 1892 and 1924 ii phase ii post the agreement of 1924 up to its validity in 1974 iii phase iii period of the formation of cwdt up to its award notification in 2013 iv phase iv period of review by the supreme court and its verdict 2018 these phases are briefly described hereunder in subsequent sections 2 2 1 the period between the agreements of 1892 and 1924 the genesis of the cauvery dispute dates back to the late 1880 s when the then madras state was under the british administration whereas the mysore state was a princely state the dispute arose when state of mysore decided that the unused surplus water that joins into the sea should be intercepted in mysore and used by mysore for its irrigation and other purposes this decision created panic in the madras presidency because they believed that it would adversely affect the existing irrigation systems in the cauvery delta on the insistence of the then government of india the two sides in 1892 finalized an agreement entitled rules defining the limits within which no new irrigation works are to be constructed by mysore state without previous reference to madras government the agreement of 1892 made it the prerogative of the madras presidency to unilaterally determine the scenarios when its interests were being adversely impacted in particular the agreement of 1892 symbolized the victory of the lower riparian state madras over the upper riparian state mysore michael 1979 hussain 1972 gebert 1983 however the dispute again precipitated in 1910 when mysore approved a plan to construct a dam later to be called the krishnarajasagar or krs dam however madras refused to give its consent for this move as it had its plans to build a storage dam at mettur after a reference to the government of india permission was accorded to mysore aggrieved by the decision madras wanted a redressal through arbitration under the terms of the agreement of 1892 consequently the government of india referred the matter for arbitration under rule iv of the agreement of 1892 the award upheld the earlier decision of the government of india and allowed mysore to proceed with the construction of the dam with a capacity of up to 11 thousand million cubic feet tmc hussain 1972 in 1920 a series of meetings were held between both parties however a formal agreement was signed only in 1924 the agreement of 1924 allowed mysore and madras to proceed with the work of the krishnarajasagar and mettur dams respectively including restrictions on both the states in terms of the area that could be irrigated michael 1979 2 2 2 post the agreement of 1924 up to its validity in 1974 for the next three decades from 1924 there were no major disputes between both the states however in the early 1950s karnataka raised objections against madras proposal for two canal projects namely kattalai and pullambadi on the ground that the surplus water used by these projects would adversely affect the apportionment of water between the states when the 1924 agreement would again be reviewed after 50 years in 1974 in view of these the planning commission of india approved these projects with the rider that these projects would not cause prejudice to the agreement for distribution of surplus water in 1974 to which madras gave its concurrence jain 1971 the cauvery controversy again gained momentum during the period of the second 1956 61 and third 1961 66 five year plan when karnataka forwarded plans for the construction of three dams on the tributaries of cauvery namely kabini hemavaty and harangi out of the three dam proposals of karnataka only the kabini project was approved by the planning commission for irrigation of 12140 ha of land cffc 1972 considering the objections of tamil nadu neither the central water commission nor the planning commission of india cleared the remaining two projects despite the objections of tamil nadu and without approval from central water commission cwc karnataka continued with the construction of these two dams consequently in august 1971 the tamil nadu government approached the supreme court of india however the supreme court of india ruled that there was insufficient ground for it to issue an injunction against the state of karnataka namasivayam 1975 with the reorganization of the states of indian 1956 two new states namely kerala and pondicherry entered into the dispute for cauvery water allocation to resolve the continued disputes on the government of india initiative a meeting was arranged between the chief ministers of tamil nadu kerala and karnataka and the union minister for irrigation and power to resolve the issue the meeting ended on may 31 1972 with a preliminary agreement on the following attempts should be made to resolve the dispute by negotiators as early as possible establishment of a cauvery fact finding committee cffc to collect all the data pertaining to the cauvery water the role of the committee was only to collect data and analyze it but not to make any recommendations tamil nadu government should withdraw its case before the supreme court in june 1972 the central government appointed the cffc which collected the requisite data from the concerned states and submitted its initial report in december 1972 followed by an additional report in august 1973 based on the findings of the cffc 1972 the co basin states agreed on the issue of availability of water in the cauvery river basin as 740 tmc and 670 tmc at 50 dependability and 75 dependability respectively 2 2 3 formation of cauvery water disputes tribunal cwdt and its award from 1981 to 1985 karnataka and tamil nadu engaged in a series of bilateral talks none of which was able to achieve conflict resolution considering the persistent obstructions the central government requested the supreme court to settle the issue consequently the supreme court directed the central government to constitute a tribunal within a month of its ruling presented on may 4 1990 thereafter on june 2 1990 the centre established the cwdt on june 25 1991 the tribunal passed an interim order directing karnataka to release 205 tmc of water a year of which tamil nadu would release 6 tmc to pondicherry after hearing the arguments as briefly described in section 2 2 3 1 of all the parties involved for the next 16 years the cwdt delivered its final verdict on february 5 2007 the tribunal presented its unanimous decision wherein the total water availability in the cauvery river basin at the lower coleroon anicut site in a normal year i e a year with 50 dependable yield was determined to be 740 tmc which included 10 tmc for minimum environmental flow and 4 tmc for unavoidable wastage to the sea in its verdict for a normal year the tribunal annually allocated 419tmcof water to tamil nadu 270 tmc to karnataka 30 tmc water to kerala and 7 tmc to pondicherry the notification of the final order was issued by the government of india based on the directions of the supreme court on february 19 2013 and it took effect from the date of the notification itself 2 2 3 1 predominant points in the cauvery disputes karnataka and tamil nadu presented their arguments and counter arguments to substantiate their respective claims for the cauvery water a brief summary of the arguments based on materials available in the public domain presented by each state to the cauvery tribunal are listed below i according to karnataka the 1924 agreement made under powerful british rule is a biased agreement favoring madras therefore karnataka requested that after its validity period of 50 years a fresh reallocation should be carried out in an equitable manner the farmers of tamil nadu had acquired prescriptive rights during the british rule when karnataka was not sufficiently empowered to even ask for impartial water sharing for the farmers of karnataka conversely tamil nadu was of the opinion that the agreement of 1924 provided a framework for the project development within the cauvery basin both for karnataka and tamil nadu therefore even if it was subjected to review after 50 years the fundamental spirit and the perspectives of the agreement should remain unaffected ii karnataka also argued that the groundwater should be included as an issue in the dispute it supported its case by citing the undp study which indicated that annually 128 tmc of groundwater could be withdrawn beneficially from within the delta area by tamil nadu the c c patel committee also reported that even with a significantly conservative estimate tamil nadu could use 30 tmc groundwater tamil nadu presented that even if more intensive use of groundwater were performed it would not result in much difference to its requirement of cauvery river water this was owing to the fact that the groundwater is used for starting the nurseries of the kuruvai paddy crop before the first release of cauvery water from the mettur dam that begins in late june subsequently the release from the mettur dam replenishes the groundwater therefore there will be hardly any change in the requirements of surface water from the mettur dam tamil nadu also supported its case by indicating that the verdicts of the krishna river dispute tribunal and narmada water dispute tribunal which decided that even though the groundwater resource of a state is a relevant factor for equitable apportionment of water of an interstate river basin the groundwater should be omitted altogether while considering the legal problem of the river basin because groundwater cannot be accurately estimated iii karnataka also argued that for equitable distribution of water the catchment contributions from the respective states and also its requirements considering the drought prone areas in the basin should be taken into consideration tamil nadu recognized the fact that catchment contribution to river flow and other influencing factors should be considered while distributing water among co basin states however it recommended that these factors should be considered only for the allocation of surplus water after satisfying the prescriptive rights of downstream farmers iv karnataka also claimed that its portion of the cauvery basin is dominated by the southwest sw monsoon whereas the portion of the basin in tamil nadu is dominated by the northeast ne monsoon however it also receives the sw monsoon therefore tamil nadu benefits from both the monsoons and it does not have to share the runoff of the ne monsoon however even though karnataka predominantly receives only the sw monsoon it has to share the runoff with tamil nadu considering this karnataka suggested that tamil nadu should change their cropping pattern such that it coincides with the pattern of rainfall in tamil nadu accordingly rather than growing paddy during the sw monsoon season it should only be grown during the ne monsoon which implied that paddy should be grown only during one season and dry crops should be grown during the second season these suggestions of karnataka were opposed by tamil nadu for the following reasons a ne monsoon is highly unpredictable and it will lead to failure of the paddy crop if the rainfall is below normal b the delta region is highly prone to waterlogging hence even a few days of waterlogging may eventually lead to failure of crops other than paddy c people in the area are accustomed to eating rice and it is very difficult for them to change their food habits v karnataka accused that the irrigation system in the delta was highly inefficient with the considerable escape of water occurring at the tail end regulators of the system karnataka suggested that through modernization of the irrigation system in tamil nadu construction of several small storages in the command area conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and the development of irrigation considering the agreed optimum cropping pattern tamil nadu will be able to avoid wastage and economize on its use of the cauvery water thereby allowing karnataka to use its rightful share of the river however tamil nadu did not agree with the views of karnataka that the irrigation system and the water management practices in the delta region are significantly inefficient tamil nadu admitted that there was room for improvement in the system however it is still one of the most efficient systems in the country 2 2 4 supreme court order of february 2018 dissatisfied with the tribunal award karnataka kerala and tamil nadu subsequently filed special leave petitions against the cwdt award 2007a b in the supreme court finally in february 2018 the supreme court delivered its verdict wherein it virtually endorsed the tribunal award but with some minor modifications it awarded an additional 4 75 tmc water to karnataka for the purpose of implementation of a water supply scheme for the city of bangalore and another 10 tmc for draught prone districts however the supreme court balanced the verdict by ordering that 10 tmc of groundwater from the cauvery delta must be preserved for safe use by tamil nadu therefore under the verdict of the supreme court karnataka would have to release 177 25 tmc of water to tamil nadu against its earlier amount of 192 tmc consequently karnataka would now receive 284 75 tmc against the 270 tmc allocated by the tribunal the allocated amount to tamil nadu was reduced to 404 25 tmc against 420 tmc allocated by the tribunal the states of kerala and pondicherry would continue to receive 30 tmc and 7 tmc respectively 2 3 issues with the tribunal and supreme court verdicts except for some minor modifications the supreme court more or less upheld the cwdt award the highlights of certain issues with the allocation of water by the cwdt which were not addressed appropriately are enumerated below while considering the factor of prescriptive rights the tribunal ruled that it could be treated as a relevant factor but not as an exclusive basis for the apportionment the tribunal also discarded the harmon doctrine as well as the principles of natural flow however it agreed with the helsinki rules ila 1966 which recommended the consideration of several factors such as the catchment area of the basin contribution of water by each co basin state past utilization of water and economic and social requirements of each co basin state even though the tribunal recognized these factors for equitable and reasonable allocation of water among co basin states the cwdt could not apply it while apportioning water among the co basin states of the cauvery river basin owing to the absence of a theoretical framework for water sharing in terms of relevant factors the tribunal in its final award stated that in a distress year i e years having water availability less than the water availability of a normal year the sharing would reduce proportionately to the water availability of a normal year as the cauvery river water allocation was based on 50 dependability a distress year could be one out of every two years this implied that the shortage of water could be a regular reality as opposed to a rare phenomenon moreover the cauvery river basin experiences both sw and ne monsoons in which the region of karnataka is dominated by the sw monsoon while the delta region in tamil nadu is dominated by the ne monsoon therefore the nature of distress was expected to demonstrate both temporal and spatial variations in such a condition the apportionment on a proportionate basis with respect to the normal year may not be appropriate another technical issue that the tribunal had not considered was the inclusion of groundwater for an apportionment among co basin states despite the extensive groundwater potential and its considerable uses in the basin the tribunal did not bring groundwater within the ambit of allocation the cauvery tribunal award restricted itself to sharing only stream surface flow however both surface and groundwater should have been integral parts of water available for allocation the tribunal reserved a quantity of 10 tmc for environmental protection and a quantity of 4 tmc as inevitable discharge into the sea for a normal year however both these figures do not adhere to any scientific assessment for the ecosystem or the hydrological characteristics of the basin the award recommended the establishment of a cauvery management board which was dominated by engineers this board did not represent a transdisciplinary knowledge base that combined the social natural and engineering sciences which could have evolved to achieve a sustainable resolution to the complex problem of the cauvery river basin the cauvery water disputes clearly present a lesson that the top down solutions decided either by the tribunal or the supreme court may not resolve the conflict as such it calls for a scientific approach to determine a reasonable and equitable share of water to be allocated among the co basin states 2 4 water sharing model this section provides a brief description of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 and its extension to the cauvery river basin for water sharing among its co basin states 2 4 1 conceptual representation of the cauvery water sharing model a schematic diagram of a simplified conceptual model for water sharing among co basin states is shown in fig 2 for the case of the cauvery river basin of india which has four co basin states namely tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry denoted by the variable names w x y and z respectively in the causal loop diagram representation with the limited water availability when compared to the total targeted demand of all the co basin states within the basin any allocation less than their aspired target results in varying degrees of discontent among the co basin states such a discontent would force these states to struggle for equity in water allocation which at any point of time is a function of target allocation and weight of the respective co basin states as represented in fig 2 the struggle for equity of any co basin state results in a change in its water allocation in proportion to its struggle for equity when compared to the overall struggle by all the co basin states thus the change in the allocation to any co basin state is a function of its struggle for equity the overall struggle of all co basin states and the availability of water which is shown in the conceptual diagram fig 2 when there is a change in the allocation to all the co basin states a revised allocation is finalized to each co basin state which again generates new values of discontent and hence new sets of struggles for equity the new sets of struggles for equity again result in a change in allocation to all the co basin states and this process continues until convergence is attained 2 4 2 model formulation we considered that there were n co basin states in a basin we also assumed that the target and allocation to the ith co basin state were denoted by tgt i and alc i respectively the deviation in the allocation of water to any co basin state that does not match its target causes discontent we defined the normalized discontent of the ith co basin state dct i in accordance with eq 1 1 dct i tgt i alc i if alc i tgt i tgt i if alc i tgt i let us also define the level of satisfaction stf i of the ith co basin state in a normalized form as the ratio of allocation to target in accordance with eq 2 2 stf i alc i tgt i if alc i tgt i 1 if alc i tgt i we assumed that p is the number of demand side variables considered for the model and d s v i j denotes the jth demand variable for the ith co basin state the target of the ith co basin state tgt i represents the summation of all types of demands for water for the ith co basin state and it can be expressed in accordance with eq 3 3 t g t i j 1 p d s v i j the discontents among the co basin states would result in a struggle for equity in water allocation which was assumed to be directly proportional to their discontent as well as to the weighting factor and inversely proportional to their satisfaction therefore the struggle for equity sfe i for the ith co basin state can be written in accordance with eq 4 4 s f e i d c t i s t f i w i 2 4 3 the formulation for determining weight of each co basin state the weighting factor of any co basin state contesting for water sharing can be divided into two parts i the weights attributed to various water demands termed as demand side variables and ii the weights attributed to other influencing variables termed as the supply side variables of the co basin states in the present study for the cauvery basin three variables irrigation domestic and industrial water demand of different co basin states were considered as the demand side variables conversely the existing water usage runoff contribution and weighted ratio of arable area to the catchment area of the various co basin states were considered as the other influencing variables or supply side variables further each of these types of variables was assigned weight contributions which were considered to be a function of its relative contributions with respect to each other and the influences of each of these variables for a co basin state with respect to the entire basin 2 4 3 1 the formulation for determining the contributions of demand and supply side variables we denoted the relative contributions of the jth demand side variable of the ith co basin state as demand side factors dsf i j and it can be expressed in accordance with eq 5a 5a d s f i j d s v i j i 1 n d s v i j i 1 n j 1 p i j a r e i n t e g e r s similarly we denoted the relative contributions of the kth supply side variable for the ith co basin state as the supply side factors ssf i k and can be expressed in accordance with eq 5b 5b s s f i k s s v i k i 1 n s s v i k i 1 n k 1 q i k a r e i n t e g e r s in the above two equations p and q are the total number of demand side and supply side variables respectively 2 4 3 2 formulation of the influence weight of demand and supply side variables the influence weight of any demand or supply side variable is considered as a ratio of the sum of that particular variable to the total of all variables in that category we denoted these influence weights as demand influence weights diw and supply influence weights siw then the influence weight at the demand side of the jth variable diw j can be written in accordance with eq 6a and similarly the influence weights for the supply side variables siw k for the kth supply side variable can be expressed using eq 6b 6a d i w j i 1 n d s v i j p w d j i 1 n r 1 p d s v i r p w d r i 1 n j 1 p r 1 p i r j a r e i n t e g e r s 6b s i w k i 1 n s s v i k p w s k i 1 n s 1 q s s v i s p w s s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s where pwd j and pws k are the priority weights for the jth demand side variable i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s and the kth supply side variable respectively the priority weight of each demand side variable can be assigned any specific value as per the priority value fixed by co basin states because these variables are similar in nature and have the same unit however most of the supply side variables are not similar in nature and unit therefore they are treated equivalent to each other and then the priority can be fixed by co basin states therefore the expression for the priority weight pws k for the kth supply variable can be written in accordance with eq 7 by considering the first variable i e k 1 to be the reference variable 7 i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q s 1 q i s k a r e i n t e g e r s i 1 n k 1 q i k a r e i n t e g e r s where iw k is the importance weight of the kth supply side variable for the cauvery basin study three demand side and three supply side variables were considered as the governing variables garg and azad 2018 had introduced the arable area to catchment area ratio as a supply side variable to rationalize the effect of another supply side variable volume of water contribution as one of the co basin states may have a relatively large water contribution in the yield of basin but have smaller arable land however if a co basin state has a relatively small arable area along with a small water contribution in the basin as a whole it would be assigned a weightage that is equivalent to a co basin state with the relatively large arable area and the large water contribution corresponding to this variable the cauvery basin demonstrates a large variation in the catchment area of its co basin states ranging from 148 km2 to 43868 km2 along with a correspondingly large variation in the arable land therefore a modified supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio in place of arable area to catchment area ratio was defined to take care of the large variations in the catchment and arable areas among co basin states the supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio was weighted according to the relative arable area ratio of each co basin state which is equal to the ratio of respective arable areas of each co basin state to the total arable area within the entire basin as such the variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio of the ith state can be written as a a i i 1 n a a i a a i c a i where aa i and ca i represent the arable and catchment areas of the ith state respectively it may be noted that the weighted arable area to catchment area ratio serves two purposes i it improves the weight of a co basin state when it has relatively low water contribution in the basin and relatively high arable area demand ii it prevents a co basin state from being assigned a relatively higher weightage when it has relatively both low water contribution and low arable area it may be noted here that the first purpose of this variable is performed by the factor a a i c a i and the second purpose of this variable is performed by the factor a a i i 1 n a a i further it may be noted that in case all the co basin states have comparable arable areas then the factor a a i i 1 n a a i for all the co basin states will have approximately the same value and hence it will reduce to the original variable arable area to catchment area ratio in order to justify the introduction of weighting factor a a i i 1 n a a i in this supply side variable a sensitivity analysis was carried out by comparing the overall weights of co basin states under with and without a a i c a i weighting factor scenarios the analysis of basin data showed that karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry are having comparable arable area to catchment area ratio however the absolute value of arable area of karnataka and tamil nadu are about 300 times larger than the arable area of pondicherry therefore if we use arable area to catchment area ratio as the supply side variable then we will get same order of weightage for all these co basin states corresponding to this variable the sensitivity study of the model gave discontent of 33 02 33 08 and 5 09 to karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively it may be noted that the discontent for pondicherry co basin state is relatively much less as compared to other co basin states because pondicherry also got the same order of weight as for other co basin states in spite of having relatively very low arable area demand the sensitivity study with the modified supply side variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio showed that the modified variable has addressed this issue and gave discontent of 32 05 32 62 and 36 54 to karnataka tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively which is justifiable from the point of view of equitable water allocation among co basin states as such the modified variable weighted arable area to catchment area ratio performed the intended balancing act which in turn helped in equitable and reasonable allocations among co basin states 2 4 3 3 formulation of the weighting factor for each co basin state once the contribution factors and influence weights of each demand and supply side variable are determined the weight of ith co basin state w i can be calculated using eq 8 8 w i α j 1 p d s f i j d i w j β k 1 q s s f i k s i w k where α is the overall weight of the demand side variables with values ranging between 0 and 1 β is the overall weight of the supply side variables considered to be equals to 1 α 2 4 4 water allocation quantities among co basin states in the present model the allocation of water to any co basin state from the overall water availability wa in the basin is assumed to be proportional to the ratio of the struggle for equity of the concerned co basin state to the overall struggle for equity of all the co basin states thus the water allocation to the ith state alc i at any time t can be written in the form of eq 9 9 a l c i s f e i w a i 1 n s f e i at a successive time t δ t the water allocation can be determined by assigning a weight to a new value and a weight 1 to the old value of alc i to control the convergence accordingly the incremental allocation δ a l c i in δ t time can be written in the form of eq 10 10 δ a l c i s f e i w a i 1 n s f e i 1 a l c i a l c i where is the weight convergence factor that varies between 0 and 1 the changes in alc i over the time interval δ t can be calculated using eq 10 hence the rate of change of alc i can be expressed in accordance with eq 11 11 a l c i t k c δ a l c i where kc is a time constant and δ alc i is the change in the allocation for the ith co basin state in accordance with eq 10 eq 11 can be solved by system dynamics using alc i as the stock variable kc as the time constant and δ a l c i is as expressed by eq 10 therefore alc i can be expressed by eq 12 in a system dynamic form 12 alc i integ kc δ alc i initial allocation where integ stands for integration the new value of the water allocation a l c i to any state is adjusted in accordance with eq 12 and the process is repeated until equilibrium is reached i e δ a l c i 0 the above formulation for an equitable distribution of water allocation was modelled using a system dynamics approach and applied to the water sharing dispute in the cauvery river basin of india 2 5 system dynamics model representation in this section the system dynamics based simulation model for water sharing in the cauvery river basin of india is represented in the form of a causal loop diagram the four co basin states of cauvery basin are tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry and are denoted by the variable names w x y and z respectively in the causal loop diagram representation fig 3 for a better understanding a two stage development of a system dynamic causal loop diagram to represent the water sharing formulation of the cauvery river basin was conducted in the first stage of the development of the causal loop diagram various linkages among the model variables were identified as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from the causal loop diagram that wa is to be shared between the four co basin states namely w x y and z representing tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry respectively any allocation to the co basin states that were less than their targeted values would lead to varying levels of discontents and satisfactions among the co basin states in the causal loop diagram shown in fig 4 the target values for the four co basin states are denoted by the variables targetw tgt1 targetx tgt2 targety tgt3 and targetz tgt4 while the discontents are denoted by discontentw dct1 discontentx dct2 discontenty dct3 and discontentz dct4 and the satisfactions are denoted by satisfactionw stf1 satisfactionx stf2 satisfactiony stf3 and satisfactionz stf4 respectively furthermore the causal loop diagram also shows the stock variables namely allocation alc1 allocation alc2 allocation alc3 and allocation alc4 respectively representing the allocations made to states w i e i 1 x i e i 2 y i e i 3 and z i e i 4 any water allocation that is less than the target values leads to a propensity to struggle for equity among the co basin states for water allocation which were denoted by struggle for equityw sfe1 struggle for equityx sfe2 struggle for equityy sfe3 and struggle for equityz sfe4 for the four co basin states as all the four co basin states will have different degrees of influence on the water allocation their weights were denoted by weightw w1 weightx w2 weightyy w3 and weightz w4 respectively the details of the causal loops of these weights are shown and explained in the second stage of the development of the causal loop diagram the struggle for equity among the four co basin states would result in re adjustments in the allocation of water between the four states which are denoted by incr allocationw δ alc1 incr allocationx δ alc2 incr allocationy δ alc3 and incr allocationz δ alc4 this process of re adjustment in the allocation between the two states will continue as shown in the causal loop of fig 3 until the equilibrium is reached i e until δ alc1 δ alc2 δ alc3 and δ alc4 approaches to zero after the development of the first stage of the causal loop diagram the detailed causal loop diagram for the targets and weights corresponding to each of the co basin states are shown in the second stage of the development fig 4 for example the weights of the states w x y and z were denoted as weightw w1 weightx w2 weighty w3 and weightz w4 respectively and are defined as a function of the demand side and supply side variables accordingly these have been shown in the causal loop diagram as a function of the demand side variables such as agricultural drinking water and industrial demands as well as a function of the supply side variables such as the existing water utilization volume of water contribution and weighted arable to catchment area ratio for each of the co basin states it may be noted here that while representing a variable name in the causal loop diagram all the variable codes representing the concerned variable are shown along with their descriptive names for example struggle for equity for state w was represented by sfe1 struggle for equity for state x is represented by sfe2 and so on they are shown along with their respective descriptive names while assigning the variable code in the causal loop diagram the subscript was appended at the end of the variable code the first subscript corresponds to the state index number and the second subscript corresponds to the concerned variable index code for example the first demand side variable i e j 1 which is the agricultural demand for state x i e i 1 is represented by dsv11 while for state y i e i 2 it is represented by dsv21 similarly for the second demand variable j 2 which is the drinking water demand for state x i e i 1 and state y i e i 2 was denoted as dsv12 and dsv22 respectively the same indexing pattern was adopted to represent the demand and supply factors along with their influence weights the calculations of weights were completed in accordance with eq 5 to 8 which is self explanatory 2 6 summary of data used in the study the proposed model by garg and azad 2018 was applied to the cauvery river basin fig 1 in india to study the water sharing disputes among the co basin states and compare the results with the water allocation award finalized by the cwdt the data used for the model was primarily obtained from the cffc 1972 report cwdt 2007a b award final verdict of the supreme court of india 2018 cwc 2102 various government publications reports and the information available on the internet fig 3 illustrates the linkages between the various parameters variables of the proposed model in the present study normal dry and wet year rainfall were considered as 50 25 and 75 dependable values respectively the dependability values were estimated by the thiessen polygon method using the annual rainfall data obtained from the rain gauges located in and around the cauvery basin the total catchment area of the cauvery river basin was considered as 81155 km2 cwc 2102 up to lower coleroon anicut out of which the areas spanning 43868 km2 34273 km2 2866 km2 and 148 km2 are located in tamil nadu karnataka kerala and pondicherry respectively the groundwater recharge in the command area was derived from the district wise groundwater recharge data cgwb 2017 on a proportionate basis a summary of the cauvery basin data and other parameters associated with the proposed model are listed in table1 3 results and discussion a detailed technical review of the tribunal award is presented in section 3 1 to assess the technical robustness of the tribunal award in section 3 2 a comparison of the results obtained by the water sharing model garg and azad 2018 with the tribunal award is presented to comprehensively illustrate the objectivity and flexibility of the proposed model garg and azad 2018 while ensuring equitable distribution of water among co basin states section 3 3 discusses the effect of the inclusion of groundwater along with surface water on water allocation among various co basin states 3 1 technical review of cwdt award the tribunal had considered no variable other than the water demands of co basin states and overall water availability in the basin although it stated that other variables should also be considered in the water allocation process as suggested by the helsinki rule the tribunal finalized the allocations among the co basin states assuming the homogeneity of hydrological conditions within the basin as a whole and disregarded the dependability of the yield within each co basin state when compared to the dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole this was obvious from the fact that the tribunal award stipulated a proportionate reduction of allocation for co basin states during dry distress years i e less than 50 dependable yield with respect to the allocation made to respective co basin states for a normal year i e 50 a dependable year a detailed analysis of the yield series data submitted by tamil nadu to the cwdt showed that there was hardly any positive correlation between the yield series at mettur dam and the yield series below mettur dam fig 5 and table 2 this is because the yield above the mettur dam is governed by the sw monsoon while the yield below the mettur dam is governed by the ne monsoon and both the monsoon systems are independent as the mettur dam is close to the border of karnataka and tamil nadu the yield series at mettur dam primarily represents the major contribution from the catchment within the state of karnataka further it also represents the contribution of the kabini river lies within the state of kerala and a very small contribution from tamil nadu similarly the yield series below the mettur dam primarily represents the major contribution of the catchment within tamil nadu and also a small contribution from the catchments within kerala and pondicherry therefore we may assume that the dependability of the yield series at the mettur dam primarily represents the dependability of the yield of the cauvery water within the administrative boundary of karnataka and the dependability of the yield series below the mettur dam primarily represents the dependability of the yield of the cauvery water within the administrative boundary of tamil nadu the summation of the yields above and below the mettur dam represents the yield of the entire cauvery basin in table 2 the yield series of 38 years 1934 35 to 1971 72 are arranged in the descending order with respect to the dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole column 6 columns 7 and 8 in table 2 represent the dependability of the yield in karnataka i e yield at mettur dam and tamil nadu i e below mettur dam respectively for a given dependability of the yield of the cauvery basin as a whole at lower coleroon anicut in column 6 the graphical representation of these different levels of dependability is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that there is almost a reverse trend between the dependability levels of the yield series of karnataka and tamil nadu thus we can expect that when the portion of the cauvery in karnataka is experiencing a dry hydrologic condition then in the same water year there is a high probability of the portion of the cauvery basin in tamil nadu experiencing a wet hydrological condition therefore any water allocation among co basin states is required to be performed based on prevailing hydrological conditions in co basin states as it would not be justifiable to assume the same hydrological condition in all the co basin states based on the past yield series data however the tribunal award had overlooked these basin specific characteristics arising owing to the influence of two distinct monsoon systems i e sw and ne consequently the tribunal award could not achieve the intended objective of reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states according to the cwdt award in a normal year i e 50 a dependable year karnataka will release a pre decided quantum of water in a fixed monthly pattern and it will be reduced proportionately during a distress year i e less than 50 dependable yield such an allocation methodology of the tribunal on a proportionate basis may work when the co basin states as well as the cauvery basin as a whole experience the same hydrological condition in case the co basin states experience different hydrological conditions the tribunal award will lead to further distortion from the equitable allocation of water the possible combinations of hydrological conditions in the co basin states are shown in the matrix presented in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that only three combinations are reasonably favorable for the application of the tribunal award out of nine possible combinations of the cauvery system further the allocation of water among the stakeholders for the remaining six combinations would be irrational this in turn implies that the tribunal award will not provide a proper allocation in two years out of every three years i e the tribunal award demonstrates a 66 chance of violating the principle of reasonable and equitable allocation among co basin states as such if the verdict is considered rationally the tribunal award seems to be unreasonable because when the flow of the basin as a whole is at normal dependability the co basin states may experience considerably different levels of dependability such as dry wet or normal conditions hence it is not logical to distribute the water among co basin states assuming that the co basin states will demonstrate the same dependability as the basin demonstrates as a whole to further illustrate these shortcomings of the tribunal award we examined the case of the water year 1947 48 1944 45 and 1948 49 in table 2 in the water year 1947 48 the yield of the basin as a whole demonstrates 50 dependability whereas the yield of karnataka also demonstrates normal dependability of 47 37 and tamil nadu also demonstrates near normal dependability of 55 26 in the water year 1944 45 the yield of the basin as a whole is near normal dependability of 52 63 whereas the yields of karnataka and tamil nadu in the same water year are dry at 78 95 and wet at 15 79 respectively similarly while considering the year 1948 49 the yield of the basin as a whole is near normal at 55 26 dependability whereas the yields of karnataka and tamil nadu in the same water year are wet at 36 84 and dry at 68 42 values of dependability respectively the examples of these three water years clearly demonstrate that even if the cauvery basin yield as a whole demonstrates approximately normal 50 dependability the dependability of yield in the co basin states can be in any of the three possible states of dry normal and wet hence it is unacceptable to implement the tribunal award considering normal dependability at the basin level as a whole to confirm the presence of similar yield trends in the basin at present the weighted average rainfall of all the co basin states as well as the cauvery basin as a whole were calculated in the absence of the associated yield series of recent times that is acceptable to all the co basin states the weighted average rainfall was calculated based on 40 years from 1974 to 2014 of data collected from rainfall stations within and around the cauvery basin catchment obtained from the india meteorological department the rainfall data prior to this period was insufficient and hence were not used for this study the dependability of the annual weighted average rainfall of the co basin states with respect to the rainfall dependability of the cauvery basin as a whole is plotted in fig 6 the trends of the rainfall dependencies of the co basin states in fig 6 are similar to the yield trends shown in fig 5 therefore we concluded that the rainfall and yield patterns of the karnataka and tamil nadu co basin states in general demonstrate inverse trends with respect to each other these trends can be attributed to the fact that karnataka obtains its rainfall predominantly from the sw monsoon while tamil nadu obtains its rainfall predominantly from the ne monsoon hence the principle of proportionate allocation of water in dry years as suggested by the tribunal may not be applicable for an equitable distribution of water among co basin states of the cauvery basin 3 2 comparison of the results of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 with the cwdt award we observed that there is a lack of a rational approach in the allocation of water among the co basin states as the tribunal primarily adjusted the demands of the co basin states to match the water availability in the cauvery basin the demand adjustment was conducted subjectively by restricting demands curtailing the irrigation area of the co basin states and assuming higher efficiency of the irrigation system by suggesting the improvement in the conveyance system and the adoption of modern techniques therefore the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 was applied to address the shortcomings of the tribunal award and the results of the model were compared with the tribunal award the tribunal presented its award for a normal hydrological year as well as for a distress i e dry year therefore the comparison of results obtained using the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 with the cwdt award was performed for both the normal and dry hydrological years and are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 respectively 3 2 1 comparison of the results for normal hydrological years as already discussed in the earlier section the cauvery basin rarely experiences homogeneous hydrological conditions in fact more often both the karnataka and tamil nadu states experience opposing hydrological conditions further a close perusal of the data for the years 1944 45 1947 48 and 1948 49 table 2 demonstrate that even if the yield series of cauvery basin as a whole may be close to normal 50 dependability the karnataka portion and tamil nadu portion of the basin may both demonstrate near normal dependability or one may be dry with dependability close to 75 and other may be wet with dependability less than 25 or vice versa further in accordance with the different monsoon patterns for the co basin states of the cauvery basin in a given water year karnataka and kerala can be assumed to have the same hydrological conditions while tamil nadu and pondicherry can be assumed to be in the same hydrological conditions to incorporate the hydrological characteristics of the basin in the water allocation process three hydrological conditions namely normal wet and dry were considered for the co basin states although the model is a general and can give results for any combination of hydrological conditions for the sake of simplification we considered the normal dry and wet hydrological conditions as 50 75 and 25 dependable values respectively based on these assumptions there are three combination of hydrological conditions namely i normal normal ii dry wet iii wet dry which can be experienced by the portions of the cauvery basin located in karnataka and tamil nadu while the cauvery basin as whole may be experiencing near normal hydrological condition in terms of the overall yield of the basin to conduct further analysis for these hydrological conditions the irrigation demand made by the co basin states to the tribunal during the 50 dependable yield of the basin were assumed to correspond to the normal hydrological condition demand for all the co basin states the irrigation demand for dry and wet hydrological conditions for each co basin state was calculated by adjusting the irrigation demand with respect to the effective rainfall in each of these two cases thus the irrigation demand of a dry year was determined by adding an equivalent volume of water for the command area corresponding to the decrease in effective rainfall with respect to the effective rainfall in a normal year the effective rainfall was calculated based on the food and agriculture organisation fao formula similarly the irrigation demand of the wet water year was calculated by subtracting the equivalent volume of water corresponding to the increase in effective rainfall in a wet water year from the effective rainfall in a normal year after determining the water demands of the co basin states for various hydrological conditions i e normal dry and wet the water sharing model of garg and azad 2018 was applied to the cauvery basin and the allocation to various co basin states in these hydrological conditions was calculated initially a comparison of the results of the water allocation presented by the cwdt award with the results of the water sharing model was performed for a normal hydrological condition among the co basin states which is listed in table 4a it can be observed from table 4a that the cwdt award caused more discontent in kerala and karnataka when compared to tamil nadu the results of the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 resulted in approximately the same values of discontent in karnataka tamil nadu and kerala in terms of the volume of water thetribunal allocated 39 02 tmc and 1 04 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 25 97 tmc and 14 04 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively when compared to the water allocated by the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 fig 7 shows that the model converged quickly to the final water allocation values for the co basin states for normal hydrological conditions and the same trends were demonstrated for the various hydrological conditions after calculating the results for the normal hydrological condition throughout the cauvery basin the water allocation among co basin states was also calculated for other hydrological combinations i e dry wet or wet dry combinations as listed in table 4b using the proposed model when the basin as a whole has a near normal yield it can be seen from table 4b and fig 8 that the allocation to karnataka may increase to 315 2 tmc or 278 1 tmc depending upon the dry or wet hydrological conditions respectively when compared to the static award of the cwdt of 270 tmc for a basin wide normal year irrespective of the hydrological conditions in the co basin states similarly the allocation to tamil nadu may also change to 399 4 tmc or 380 tmc depending upon the dry or wet hydrological conditions respectively when compared to the static award of the cwdt of 419 tmc for a basin wide normal year the cwdt award did not consider the different hydrological conditions among the co basin states of the cauvery basin and presented a static water allocation for the co basin states which led to inequitable water allocations this may be one of the technically valid reasons to explain the ineffectiveness of the award and hence the immense resistance of the co basin state of karnataka to share the demanded quantum of water with tamil nadu even during the normal hydrological years measured for the cauvery basin as a whole 3 2 2 comparison of the results for dry hydrological years for distress or dry year the tribunal recommended a proportionate reduction in allocation among co basin states however even though it seems logical to make such a reduction it is not strictly applicable to the cauvery basin because of the following reasons i for the hydrological characteristics of the cauvery basin there is a higher probability that one part of the basin will experience wet condition whereas other parts of the basin will be dry ii it is illogical to reduce all types of demand proportionately iii even if the entire cauvery basin may be experiencing a distress condition the results of the study demonstrate that the proportionate principle may not be applicable especially for a severe dry hydrological condition this is because the variation of rainfall demonstrating high dependability is much more in karnataka than in tamil nadu which in turn implies that in a severe dry year the requirement of karnataka will increase much more than tamil nadu as the proportion of the contribution from rainfall that satisfies a part of the irrigation demand in tamil nadu will be more consequently the surface water requirement will be less when compared to karnataka the results of the water allocation using the proposed model by garg and azad 2018 for a range of water availability options from a minimum of approximately 500 tmc to an average water availability of approximately 750 tmc in a distress year clearly confirms that the principle of proportionate allocation may not prove to be rational even when all the co basin states of the cauvery basin are considered to experience the same hydrological distress conditions fig 9 it also clearly indicates that in a severe drought year the allocation to karnataka should increase instead of demonstrating a proportionate decrease as per the tribunal award because the relative contributions of rainfall satisfying a part of the irrigation demand will be much more in tamil nadu owing to the presence of dual monsoon effects in its catchment rather than the single monsoon effect in the catchment of karnataka 3 3 water allocation considering both surface and groundwater of the basin the cwdt declined to include groundwater in the basin water availability based on the fact that groundwater could not be accurately estimated from a technical perspective and hence not fully cognizable from the legal point of view however despite inherent uncertainties about the assessment of the quantum of groundwater availability ignoring it altogether is not rationally justifiable particularly considering the better techniques and the availability of the data on groundwater recharges these days the central ground water board cgwb 2017 provided the annual groundwater recharge data of the country based on their extensive data network which was used in this study to explore the various possible scenarios of water allocation in the cauvery basin therefore considering the shortcomings of the cwdt award the sharing of water allocation among co basin states was also calculated by including the groundwater availability of the basin along with the surface water availability of 726 tmc excluding 14 tmc towards environmental flow and unavoidable wastage to minimize the effect of uncertainties associated with groundwater estimation and to be on the conservative side the groundwater recharge only within the command area of the co basin states was considered further the following two scenarios of annual dynamic groundwater recharge were considered for its allocation among co basin states along with surface water a groundwater recharge only from rainfall b groundwater recharge from rainfall as well as other sources of recharge a brief description of the results of water allocation among co basin states for these two cases of groundwater recharges along with surface water are discussed in section 3 3 1 and section 3 3 2 3 3 1 water allocation considering dynamic groundwater recharge owing to rainfall and surface water to consider the effect of groundwater the water availability in the model was considered as the sum of surface water and dynamic groundwater available owning to recharge in the command area only through rainfall the model results for allocation of combined surface and groundwater for this scenario under basin wide normal condition are listed in table 5a along with its comparison with the cwdt award it is to be noted that after making water allocation by the model to the co basin states the net surface water share corresponding to a co basin state was calculated after subtracting the respective groundwater availability for that co basin state the results for this scenario under different hydrological conditions are listed in table 5b and are illustrated in a graphical form in fig 10 in this scenario for a basin wide normal condition the cwdt award when compared to the model results allocated 32 6 tmc and 1 0 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively and 23 3 tmc and 10 4 tmc less water to karnataka and kerala respectively it may be noted that the model allocated 6 4 tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under this scenario when compared to the case where only surface water was considered section 3 2 1 whereas the surface water allocation values to karnataka and kerala were reduced by 2 8 tmc and 3 6 tmc respectively these allocation results are contrary to the general perceptions that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water for the water sharing among the co basin states in the cauvery basin a similar trend can also be observed in tables 4b and 5b under different hydrological conditions 3 3 2 water allocation considering groundwater from all recharge sources and surface water similar to section 3 3 1 the total water availability for water allocation was considered as the sum of the dynamic groundwater available owing to recharge in the command area from all sources and the surface water the results are listed in table 6a for the basin wide normal condition and in table 6b for different hydrological conditions fig 11 it can be observed from table 6a that the cwdt allocated approximately 35 5 tmc and 1 4 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 24 3 tmc and 12 7 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively under the basin wide normal hydrological condition when compared to the allocations made by the model from the results listed in tables 4a and 6a it can be noted that the model allocated 3 5 tmc more surface water to tamil nadu under this scenario when compared to the case where only surface water was considered section 3 2 1 whereas the surface water allocation values to karnataka kerala and pondicherry were reduced by 1 7 tmc 1 3 tmc and 0 5 tmc respectively in this scenario also the allocation was determined to be against the general assumption that the surface water allocation to tamil nadu would be significantly reduced if the groundwater is also considered along with the surface water in the water sharing process among the co basin states in the cauvery basin a similar trend can also be observed in tables 4b and 5b under different hydrological conditions 4 conclusions the cwdt award cwdt 2007a b for cauvery river water sharing was analyzed and compared with the results obtained by the model proposed by garg and azad 2018 using the same data that was used by cwdt the study demonstrated that there are shortcomings in the cwdt award which have to be addressed to ensure equitable and reasonable allocation of water among co basin states the study also gave some general insights about river water sharing issues not confined to the cauvery basin only following conclusions covering both cauvery basin specific as well as general river basin water sharing issues were drawn from the present study i it was demonstrated that the cwdt award could not resolve the water sharing problem even for a normal year yield as different hydrological conditions of the co basin states may lead to the samenormal yield for basin as a whole however the tribunal failed to consider it and gave a static distribution of water among the co basin states for the normal yield ofthe cauvery basin even most of the other tribunals such as narmada water dispute tribunal nwdt 1979 and krishna water dispute tribunal kwdt 1976 also gave the static water allocation to the co basin states without giving any considerations for likely variations in the hydrological conditions of the co basin states as such failed to ensure equitable water allocation among co basin states it is an important finding which should have been considered by the tribunals while making the awards for river water sharing disputes ii the cauvery tribunal emphasized the principle of equitable apportionment which was recognized by the helsinki rules to be the guiding factor for resolving disputes on the apportionment of water of an interstate river it also stressed that for determining reasonable and equitable shares relevant factors have to be considered together in reaching a conclusion for determining reasonable and equitable shares for co basin states however these objective considerations could not be provided by the various river basin tribunals including cwdt iii the technical review of the cwdt award demonstrated that the proportionate reduction in the allocation to the co basin states for distress years with respect to the allocation specified for normal years may result in allocations among co basin states that are not in consonance with the intended objective of reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co basin states in fact other tribunals had also recommended the proportionate reduction in the allocation for distress year which as per the present study shall not ensure equitable allocations among co basin states iv the assumption of hydrological homogeneity in the cauvery basin was analyzed by comparing the dependability level of the yield series of the basin as a whole and the dependability level of the yield series of the respective co basin states a significant disparity with the dependability levels of the yield series of the co basin states viz a viz the dependability level of yield series of basin as a whole was found therefore it is not advisable to give a static allocation independent of the hydrological conditions of the co basin states because it does not lead to equitable allocations among co basin states similar to cwdt tribunals for other river basins may also suffer from the same deficiency as such the study gave this important insight that it would not be proper for the tribunals to give a static allocation among co basin states and heterogeneity in hydrological conditions of the basin must be considered while giving the awards even for the normal yield of the basin v the cwdt award could not ensure equitable allocation of water among co basin states because of the following two reasons i its inability to consider different hydrological conditions that may be experienced by co basin states due to presence of two monsoon systems namely ne and sw which are active in tamil nadu and karnataka respectively ii it did not give any weight to the factors governing the water allocation among co basin states vi the results of the model by garg and azad 2018 demonstrated different allocations to different co basin states depending upon the hydrological conditions of the co basin states even for a normal yield of the cauvery basin against a static allocation of water given by the cwdt the water allocation values varied from 359 9 tmc to 399 9 tmc for tamil nadu from 278 1 tmc to 315 2 tmc for karnataka from 42 5 tmc to 44 tmc for kerala and from 5 6 tmc to 6 2 tmc for pondicherry depending upon hydrological conditionsof the co basin states for the normal yield of the cauvery basin against the static values of water allocated by the tribunal of 419 tmc for tamil nadu 270 tmc for karnataka 30 tmc for kerala and 7 tmc for pondicherry for the normal yield of the cauvery basin without considering different hydrological condition in co basin states vii a comparative study of the surface water allocation of the cauvery basin by the cwdt award and by the model garg and azad 2018 demonstrated that even if the cauvery basin was assumed to demonstrate a basin wide normal hydrological condition the cwdt award when compared to the model results allocated 39 tmc and 1 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 26 tmc and 14 tmc less water was allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively however if the predominant hydrological inhomogeneity of the basin was considered then for the worst hydrological combination namely when tamil nadu is wet and karnataka is under dry hydrological condition but the basin as a whole has a normal yield the static cwdt award when compared to model results would result in allocating 59 1 tmc and 1 4 tmc more water to tamil nadu and pondicherry respectively whereas 45 2 tmc and 15 3 tmc less water will be allocated to karnataka and kerala respectively viii the cwdt had not included groundwater in the total water availability in the cauvery basin for the apportionment in view of uncertainty associated with the groundwater estimation and hence not fully cognizable from a legal perspective however when groundwater is included in the total water availability of the basin in such scenario the model results were found to be more favorable to tamil nadu thereby defying the general perception of tamil nadu that its share in surface water allocation would be reduced if groundwater is also considered along with surface water the proposed model results suggest that the share of surface water to tamil nadu may increase up to 6 4 tmc under the basin wide normal hydrological condition while the shares of karnataka and kerala may get reduced up to 2 7 tmc and 3 7 tmc respectively when compared to the model results without the consideration of groundwater it may be noted that nwdt and kwdt had also not included ground water in their awards while considering the overall availability of water for sharing in the basin the present study suggests that the tribunals must also include groundwater as an integral part of the overall water availability of the basin to ensure equitable allocations of water resources of the basin as a whole as such the present study on the cauvery basin provided some important insights for river water sharing disputes in general and conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model of garg and azad 2018 could address the water sharing problems among co basin states it may be noted that the model of garg and azad 2018 can take any number of co basin states with any number of demand and supply side variables along with priority importance weights of these variables therefore one may choose the relevant variables depending upon the specific trans boundary water sharing problem the crux of a water sharing problem lies in the determination of the equitable and reasonable share of water among the co basin states in an objective manner considering all the relevant variables so that it could be acceptable to all the co basin states and the proposed model provided an answer to it further socio political factors can aggravate water sharing problems if it does not ensure reasonable and equitable allocations among stakeholders if equitable distributions are secured then chances of getting socio political acceptability become very high even if it does not get entirely accepted by all political entities due to political compulsions it can definitely defuse political tensions and prevent it from gaining more significant socio political dimensions as such the proposed framework model can reduce a socio political ramification by ensuring equitable allocations among stakeholders other factors which can lead to socio political unacceptability can be addressed politically by bringing in appropriate legislation such as setting up an appropriate institutional arrangement in the form of a river basin management board that can have the capacity to create resolution mechanisms through best practices on the concept of river basin governance 5 disclaimer this

6101,impacts of climate change on rainfall is shown to increase the risk of flooding in urban areas with high population densities creating a higher threat to loss of life and damage to property integrating stormwater management elements such as storage structures infiltration and other water sensitive design features into the urban landscape is an increasing trend to adapt to the higher flood threat evaluating the effectiveness of these stormwater management features is increasingly more valuable as we try to balance the need for livable space and provide a safe environment within the developed areas and major cities globally this study looks at two different urban catchments with and without stormwater management features to evaluate how well each catchment can absorb the impacts of climate change on flooding results from our analysis shows that sequentially placed storage structures are significantly effective in absorbing the more intense rainfall events expected in a warmer climate we compare the ratio of total rainfall volume to the volume of flow leaving each of the catchments as an indicator of how well each catchment is able to absorb the impacts of climate change and find that there is approximately a 20 fold decrease in the ratio in the catchment with stormwater management for the future climate conditions for this study temperature based scaling is used to account for climate change impacts on rainfall and we use hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to characterize and evaluate the responses of each catchment keywords urban flooding climate change water sensitive urban design integrated stormwater management 1 introduction rapid urbanization coupled with climate change is creating a mix of increasingly inextricable challenges if we consider the case of sydney the largest city in australia the population is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 0 9 1 4 australia bureau of statistics 2018 or close to 350 000 people annually accommodating this growth in major cities has led to higher population density and urban sprawl brody et al 2013 eigenbrod et al 2011 urban sprawl in turn has led to drastic changes in surface cover where parks sporting fields and farmland have been developed into impervious surfaces such as high rise apartments shopping centers car parks and vast residential developments when one considers this change in the context of flooding more people are now living in close quarters leading to a higher risk of flood related damages to both life and property shi 2019 zhou et al 2016 zhu and tang 2010 within the process of planning to accommodate the projected growth in the urban landscape one must consider future climate conditions that are projected to further exacerbate the problem of urban flooding hettiarachchi et al 2018 ipcc 2014 masson delmotte et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 rising global temperatures due to climate change is projected to increase intensities and frequencies of extreme storm events steffen et al 2017 in most locations around australia intense rainfall events will become more extreme being driven by a warmer climate lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 whetton 2011 the swift nature of runoff in urban environments due to the higher impervious surface area provides reason to investigate the potential relationship between a changing climate and flood levels ashley et al 2005 zhou et al 2016 with increase in urbanization taking place worldwide schultz 2006 wang et al 2006 integrated stormwater management methods and water sensitive urban design wsud measures are becoming more crucial as a form of adaptation to offset the climate change enhanced risk of flooding dong et al 2017 whetton 2011 zimmermann et al 2016 literature shows that an increase in impervious surfaces such as paved pathways and roads causes increased flood frequency due to poor infiltration and faster concentration times from reduced flow resistance a particular study performed in vietnam indicated an increase in the maximum inundation depth of 21 18 cm by 2050 for an extreme rainfall event solely due to land use change huong and pathirana 2013 research conducted by boyd et al 1993 compared the actual depth of runoff from impervious surfaces to that of pervious surfaces where the findings indicated the runoff depths to be 5 2 times larger on average in this paper we compare two markedly different catchments with different urban land use characteristics with and without an integrated stormwater management infrastructure to show how each catchment absorbs or does not absorb the impacts of climate change we use hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to evaluate how different land use types and urban stormwater management systems respond to the differing runoff characteristics and built infrastructure within each catchment for this study we focus on the effects of climate change on rainfall intensities and use temperature as the basis for assessing changes to rainfall to reflect the impacts of climate change the two main questions that we consider are 1 how well can constructed stormwater management features in an urban environment absorb the effects of climate change 2 what is the difference between the two catchment responses to climate change impacts on rainfall even though the implications and causes of urban flooding are widely studied and there is an abundance of literature on this topic there exist gaps especially pertaining to climate change impacts on urban flood mitigation systems that form the motivations for this study ashley et al 2005 da silva et al 2018 hollis 1975 löwe et al 2017 schreider et al 2000 zhou et al 2016 here we aim to help fill that gap and add to the current research by addressing the question on how well constructed stormwater features can handle changes in urban runoff patterns due to climate change 2 study locations data and methodology 2 1 study locations the study areas of interest are two urban catchments in sydney australia fig 1 a the first study area catchment 1 the university of new south wales unsw kensington campus fig 1b represents a highly urbanized catchment consisting of impervious surface areas with typical storm water conveyance through pipes and manholes the catchment area that was modelled equals 0 24 km2 in size with an average slope of 4 1 it is a fully built up catchment with 73 of the total catchment area consisting of either buildings or pavements table 1 the second study area catchment 2 the centennial park cp adjoining the suburbs of bondi junction woollahra randwick and moore park in sydney fig 1c is also classified as an urban catchment since it has large urban areas upstream which all drain into the grassy parkland in which a pond detention system is contained the centennial park catchment is located 1 km away from unsw and is approximately 5 76 km2 with an average slope of 1 1 table 1 2 2 urban flood modelling the modelling part of this study was done using the drains software o loughlin et al 2018 drains is hydraulic and hydrologic h h modelling software that allows detailed modelling of urban stormwater drainage systems it calculates runoff hydrographs from pervious and impervious surfaces and routes them through a system of gutters pit inlets pipes and channels the software also conducts flood routing through detention basins as well as flow in open channels with bridge and culvert structures the runoff generation method used in drains for this research is the ilsax hydrological model o loughlin et al 2018 further to this drains allows for the modification of precipitation volumes and includes standard temporal patterns that are based on the most recent australian rainfall runoff 2016 arr2016 guidelines drains can also model storage structures such as the centennial park detention system to perform the required hydrologic and hydraulic analysis on drains necessary information was obtained from multiple sources including unsw facilities management city of sydney council and the centennial park and moore park trust information obtained included stormwater infrastructure details invert levels sub catchment boundaries ground elevations pond configurations and features flow paths pond storage data and recent pond water levels this data was then used to construct the unsw and centennial park catchment models illustrated in fig 1b and c respectively peak flow rate is an indicator of flooding potential in a drainage system since it represents the total volume of water passing through per unit of time m3 s therefore high peak flow rates increase the pressure placed on the system s capacity and ability to move surface runoff without flooding causing danger to nearby infrastructure and people during the modelling analysis peak flow rate was assessed at 3 separate reference locations consisting of manholes nodes and pipes outlined in blue in fig 1b and c for both catchments these locations were selected since they represent the main pipelines which carry majority of the water passing though the catchment critical sections as well as being located downstream near the catchment outlet furthermore this generates results which are more representative of the catchment as a whole rather than using just a single location by doing this the accuracy of each model s results is enhanced whilst the probability of modelling errors and inconsistency is reduced we also extract runoff volumes and total volumes leaving the catchments as indicators to evaluate and compare the two catchments four different climate scenarios were used in the modelling analysis refer to table 3 below to replicate the effects of increasing temperatures due to climate change phenomenon the way in which these different climate scenarios are modelled in the drains package is described in more detail in section 2 4 2 3 precipitation data the australian rainfall and runoff guide provides a consistent and updated approach to collecting analyzing and managing flood information that is essential for policy decisions and projects within australia ball et al 2016 this study uses the 2016 australian rainfall and runoff arr2016 intensity frequency duration ifd relationships which was obtained from the arr 2016 data hub we focus on the 50 and 10 annual exceedance probability aep events since these storms are generally expected to cause harm to urban environments in the future whilst still occurring frequently compared to say a 1 aep storm based on city of sydney guidelines and policies city of sydney 2017 urban stormwater systems are designed to handle 50 aep storms without excessive and dangerous flooding occurring once the required rainfall intensities were obtained drains generates 10 storm temporal patterns for alternate modelling scenarios refer to figs s1 s4 figs s1 s4 represent the different temporal patterns generated by drains based on the input ifd relationships each with varying rainfall distributions intensities peaks and troughs the difference in temporal patterns shown here causes the variations in modelling results within each scenario presented in this paper whereby the maximums worst case scenario are generally caused by the peakier temporal patterns and minimums best case scenario by the flatter temporal patterns the box and whisker plots presented in the latter sections of this paper are therefore representative of the variable nature of storm events by including modelling results for 10 different temporal patterns 2 4 accounting for climate change many of the current studies use gcm downscaling as a method of accounting for climate change in precipitation najafi and hessami kermani 2017 nguyen et al 2008 nguyen et al 2010 zahmatkesh et al 2015 however gcm downscaling has a disadvantage when applied to urban catchments due to the smaller spatial area and shorter duration of critical events busuioc et al 1999 girvetz et al 2013 nguyen et al 2008 sharma et al 2007 willems et al 2012 current literature details that these climate affected extreme rainfall events are altered in terms of both rainfall volume and varying intensification of the storm s temporal pattern trenberth 2011 wasko and sharma 2015 a method to use temperature as an index to scale rainfall patterns was presented by wasko and sharma 2015 wasko and sharma 2015 analyzed the relationship between burst patterns from 79 australian rainfall gauges and temperature variations and showed that rainfall patterns scale with increased temperature creating less uniform temporal patterns with higher intensities the portions of a storm with lowest intensity were shown to decrease in rainfall intensity while the portion of the storm with the highest intensity would have even larger peak intensity by as much as 1 3 as illustrated in fig 2 therefore a temperature based method to scale rainfall to account for climate change is used in the study as a more suitable approach with urban catchments it should be noted that a temperature based scaling approach has been found to be sub optimal for tropical regimes roderick et al 2019 but satisfactory for climates such as in sydney hettiarachchi et al 2018 quantified the application of these temporal scaling factors reporting up to a 35 increase in flood depth resulting from scaled temporal patterns and a 10 170 increase in flood depth resulting from the projected rainfall volume being added to the new projected temporal patterns we try to illustrate these changes in rainfall due to climate change in fig 2 which shows the shift to a generic intensity duration curve for a particular return frequency with increase in temperature as discussed in the above referenced literature it is generally accepted that the rainfall depth will increase with an increase in temperature the inserts illustrate the changes in temporal distributions discussed in wasko and sharma 2015 the current and future show how the highest intra storm rainfall rate increases while the lowest intra storm rainfall rate decrease resulting in an intensification of temporal patterns during a storm hettiarachchi et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 for the purpose of this study the change to rainfall volumes per change in temperature is based on well accepted clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth et al 2003 which give a 7 increase per deg k which is then applied within equation one as shown below the scaling of rainfall volume was based on the following equation 1 v t δ t v t 1 α v δ t where vt is the rainfall depth for each return period and duration for the current temperature taken from arr2016 vt δt is the rainfall depth adjusted for temperature increase and α v is the scaling of the precipitation per degree c 7 application of this relationship led to the precipitation multiplication factors shown in table 2 these multiplication factors were then entered into the drains climate change rainfall multiplier dialogue box depending on which climate change scenario was being modelled to adjust the rainfall depth for each scenario in addition to the above modification of design rainfall intensity wasko and sharma 2015 conclusively showed that design temporal patterns were becoming steeper or more intense with warming temperatures while it is possible to change the temporal pattern and ascertain the outcomes of the modelled peak flows as per the site specific changes noted by wasko and sharma 2015 operational limitations of the drains software makes this challenging as a result the 10 alternate temporal patterns used in the software were used unchanged with the caveat that final assessment could be performed assuming unequal weighting of the 10 patterns in the estimate of the expected peak flow a simple rationale for such unequal weighting might be to apply more weight to the storm temporal patterns that exhibited most intense peaks within a storm distribution and lower weighting to those that exhibited a flatter or more uniform distribution more detail on how these unequally weighted patterns could be interpreted is provided in section 3 2 5 rainfall outflow ro ratio to evaluate the catchments ability to absorb the impact of higher rainfall rates and volumes we use a simple rainfall outflow ro ratio the ro ratio represents the percentage of total rainfall that translates into the volume that leaves the catchment indicating how much of the rainfall is abstracted or retained within the catchment for each respective storm event the ro used here is similar in concept to the well established runoff coefficient goel 2011 applicable to different land use types in hydrologic calculations for this manuscript the ro is different in that we consider the built storage features within each catchment which then leads to retention as a result of physical storage of runoff and such losses such as infiltration over green space or hydraulics abstraction in stormwater management features storage ponds within the catchment a lower ro ratio indicates that a higher portion of the rainfall is abstracted or retained within constructed stormwater management features within the catchment the opposite is true for a higher ro ratio indicating that the catchment is not effective at managing flow rates which can result in a higher risk of flooding within the catchment as well as downstream of the catchment the ro ratio is calculated using the following equation 2 ro r a t i o σ outlet rainfall where σ outlet is the sum of water volumes exiting catchment outlets rainfall is the total volume of rainfall over the catchment area for the duration of the storm event 3 results and discussion in the following subsections we present and discuss the results generated by the two models and the scenarios presented in table 3 we attempt to answer the two main questions presented at the beginning of the paper by first looking at the fractional volume of rainfall that leaves the catchment outlet this ratio is used to ascertain how well each of the catchments can absorb the higher rainfall volumes resulting from scaling effects based on climate change following this we analyze peak flow rates and volumes stored within the catchments of the two models to show how different types of land use responds to higher rainfall rates 3 1 rainfall outflow ro ratio as shown in fig 3 mean ro ratio of the ten storm patterns along with the variation are plotted for the current and 3 climate scenarios representing higher temperature conditions a change in mean ro ratio between the current and the 3 c rise in temperature scenario for the unsw model is from 79 to 83 for a 50 aep storm event whilst there is an increase from 86 to 88 for a 10 aep storm event on the other hand the mean ro ratio remains at approximately 3 5 and 4 for the 50 and 10 aep respectively for all the modeled scenario at the cp catchment the difference in ro ratios between the unsw and cp catchments substantial and significant the first major difference is that the relative proportion of rainfall volume reaching the catchment outlet is approximately 20 times greater for the unsw catchment compared to centennial park the second difference is the fact that unsw shows an increasing trend between ro ratio with warmer temperature as expected whereas the cp catchment has minimal to no change with increasing temperature scenarios for both return periods the minimal change in ro ratio in the cp watershed is even more notable when considering that rainfall volume was scaled by a factor of 1 225 or 22 5 for the 3 deg c warmer scenario in both catchments this difference in ratio is also prevalent just in the case of the two return periods with ro ratio increasing by less than 1 at centennial park from a the 50 to 10 aep whereas unsw increase by approximately 5 overall tables s1and s2 in the supplementary information presents the percentage of storage utilized at each of the storage locations refer to fig s5 within the cp pond system during each of the model scenarios the effectiveness of the design of the pond system at cp is demonstrated by the progression of storage as shown in table s2 as more and more of the ponds are at 100 capacity for the 10 aep event at 3 deg c increase in temperature which matches with the cascading layout of the ponds as shown in fig s1 as discussed in section 2 3 the box plots for each model scenario are based on 10 storm patterns that help to account for the variability in intra strom distribution of rainfall it is interesting to note that the interquartile range for the cp watershed is predominately left skewed with the median at the top half of that range suggesting that storm patterns with peak rainfall loaded towards the latter half of the storm duration have a higher impact of volume sensitive watersheds and stormwater management systems similar to the discussion on the impact of storm temporal patterns in hettiarachchi et al 2018 this result is a noteworthy indicator of the effectiveness of integrated stormwater management measures in creating an urban catchment which is resilient and adaptable when faced with more extreme storm conditions under a future warming climate the hydraulic abstraction at these stormwater management systems can be impacted by changes in seasonal rainfall patterns which can increase the effectiveness of flood mitigation hettiarachchi et al 2019 sharma et al 2018 the runoff volume leaving the cp catchments is a small percentage of the total rainfall volume over the catchment which directly attributable to the storage capabilities of the pond detention system with the added benefit of higher infiltration losses occurring over the grassland areas this result quantifies and proves just how much of an effect integrated stormwater management measures such as the centennial park pond storages have in mitigating the potential increase in flooding in a typical urban catchment and highlighting the capability of the centennial park catchment to adapt to future climate conditions 3 2 peak flow rates peak flow rates are an important factor when sizing sewer systems or trying to determine total conveyance capacity required to safely move surface runoff in an urban developed environment in most cases street flow is part of the conveyance capacity of an urban system during larger storm events hence the total peak flow rate is defined as the sum of the overflow flow rate and pipe flow rate along a stretch of sewer or street since the unsw drainage system in particular is expected to have significant overflows surcharging from manholes for larger more intense storms which will flow along the streets it is important to include the overflow rate to find the total peak flow rate fig 4 presents the peak flow rates for the unsw and the cp catchments extracted along pipes and conduits within the box outlined in fig 1b and c respectively the boxplots shown in fig 4 are based on 30 results for each scenario generated at 3 locations for 10 temporal patterns for the 10 aep rainfall event the results are normalized by the mean of the peak flow rates for the current day scenario it is interesting to note that the rate of increase in the median peak flow with each degree in temperature increase is similar in both catchments with approximately a 20 increase in the peak flow for a 3 deg c rise in temperature scenario the spread in the results also increase with higher temperatures with the unsw showing a significantly higher level of variability in peak flow rates with the varying temporal patterns of rainfall the maximum limit of peak flow increases by 55 for the unsw campus while the highest increase is 35 for the cp catchment the higher variability can be attributed to direct runoff generated by the land cover at unsw and the varying levels of street flow the larger spread of peak flow rates also illustrates the challenges of determining the sizes and capacity of sewer systems in an urban environment the variability in the results for both catchments are similar to the results presented in hettiarachchi et al 2018 the smaller spread in peak flow in the cp catchment can be attributed to the lower overall impervious area and the available storage facilities modulating the impacts of higher rainfall rates it is interesting to note that there is a skew towards the higher peak flows in the interquartile range for the 3 deg c increase scenario within the cp catchment suggesting higher rates of overflow from the storage ponds during some of the temporal patterns modelled lack of such skew in the unsw results shows that highly urban areas are more directly sensitive to the peak intensity within a storm compared to watersheds with mixed land use 3 3 stored water volumes as a supplementary analysis we looked at the overall volume of runoff that gets conveyed through the drainage network of each catchment we used a storage location at the outlet of the model to accumulate the runoff as an index of the total volume generated for each scenario and is plotted in fig 5 again the results presented in fig 5 are normalized based on the mean of the volumes generated in the current scenario model unlike the peak flows in fig 4 here we see a different rate of increase in the volume of flow through the catchment between unsw and cp which shows the impact of available storage within the catchment the runoff volume that is conveyed through the unsw drainage network increases by close to 60 for the 3 deg c increase in temperature this increase in volume conveyed through the network indicates the added stress on the drainage system as a result of the larger storms that can be expected in a future climate in contrast the volume leaving the cp catchment increases less than 20 for a 3 deg c change in temperature as the sequential layout of the storage facilities help retain a major portion of the increased flow the results presented in fig 3 shows that integrating stormwater management features within an urban stormwater system can absorb the impacts of climate change on rainfall patterns and can help mitigate the increased risk of flooding in a future warmer climate the changes in rainfall to outflow ratio with higher rainfall values related to a warmer climate for the two different catchments provide a clear contrast and indicate the importance of providing storage related infrastructure and mixing in pervious land cover within the urban landscape an important consideration here is that these catchments are part of a larger overall city wide storm sewer system and the cp catchment will significantly help mitigate flooding in downstream catchments by being able to retain and control outflow from the area in contrast higher flows from the unsw catchment will add stress on the downstream systems and will contribute to the increased threat of flood damages when considering the results presented from figs 3 5 as a whole the difference in the catchment response to the expected changes to rainfall due to climate change becomes evident the unsw catchment is representative of a majority of the main urban areas and major cities throughout the world with minimal stormwater management features whereas the cp catchment represents a growing trend in making stormwater management an integral part of new urban planning the results presented in the manuscript show the contrast in how well each of the catchment areas is able to handle the potential increase in flooding that can occur due to climate change in response to the first question we pose at the start of this paper we do not see a stark difference in the overall catchment response related to average peak flow rates within the system though the variability of peak flows in the unsw system is significantly higher than within the cp system the impervious land cover which leads to the rapid and direct nature of runoff in the unsw catchment makes this system particularly sensitive to changes in intensity due to increase in rainfall volume and changes in temporal patterns the results also show that integrating green spaces and storage related infrastructure can help modulate this effect and help maintain a safer level of service within the constructed storm sewer system we emphasize again that one of the clearest changes in design storm patterns for a warmer future lies in a tendency for temporal patterns to become peakier wasko and sharma 2015 the results here have not explicitly considered the changes to temporal patterns due to the limitations of the software at the time of modelling however one can instead view the outcomes across the 10 alternate temporal patterns recommended for use by arr2016 as representing an unequally weighted average of the 10 peak flows or volumes in other words instead of considering the 10 patterns as equally likely one could consider the patterns hence resulting flows to be more likely if they exhibit greater intensification than other patterns we can confirm that the patterns representing greater intensification fall in the upper quartile of the peak flow or volume results depicted in the boxplots in figs 3 5 hence one could expect the true expected impact of warming to be greater than what the average results in the figures tend to indicate with the weights on the highest flows or volumes representing peakier patterns and hence a greater likelihood than is the case otherwise 4 conclusion with the projected increase in rainfall volumes and intensities in a warming climate and the need to provide a safe level of service in urban stormwater systems we look at how urban systems respond to the changes in rainfall patterns and how well stormwater management features can absorb and mitigate the increase risk of flooding this paper presents and discusses results from a modelling analysis of two different urban catchments with and without integrated green spaces and storage and show how well these two catchments adapt and deal with the expected changes in rainfall patterns we use scaling factors related to changes in temperature to account for climate change impacts on rainfall the main findings that answer the questions posed at the start of the paper are as follows we find a 20 fold decrease in the ratio of total rainfall volume and the volume leaving the watershed ro ratio for the urban area with green spaces and storage facilities we show that the ro ratio increases as expected for the watershed area with higher percentage of impervious land cover whereas this ratio changes minimally for the catchment with green space and storage facilities both catchments show a similar trend in average peak flow rates though the catchment while the watershed with highly impervious land cover shows a high degree of variability in the peak flow rates this variability complicates the designing of stormwater conveyance systems within dense urban areas and adds to the potential of more frequent flooding the 20 fold decrease and the minimal change in volume of flow leaving the catchment with storage infrastructure is significant and a testament to the need to incorporate stormwater management within urban built environments even when challenged for livable space this simple but effective study shows the clear need to properly plan and include integrated stormwater management features within the urban landscape in order to provide the level of care to protect human life and property from flooding in a changing climate the authors acknowledge that the modelling completed for this manuscript simplifies some of the complexities and nuances

6101,impacts of climate change on rainfall is shown to increase the risk of flooding in urban areas with high population densities creating a higher threat to loss of life and damage to property integrating stormwater management elements such as storage structures infiltration and other water sensitive design features into the urban landscape is an increasing trend to adapt to the higher flood threat evaluating the effectiveness of these stormwater management features is increasingly more valuable as we try to balance the need for livable space and provide a safe environment within the developed areas and major cities globally this study looks at two different urban catchments with and without stormwater management features to evaluate how well each catchment can absorb the impacts of climate change on flooding results from our analysis shows that sequentially placed storage structures are significantly effective in absorbing the more intense rainfall events expected in a warmer climate we compare the ratio of total rainfall volume to the volume of flow leaving each of the catchments as an indicator of how well each catchment is able to absorb the impacts of climate change and find that there is approximately a 20 fold decrease in the ratio in the catchment with stormwater management for the future climate conditions for this study temperature based scaling is used to account for climate change impacts on rainfall and we use hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to characterize and evaluate the responses of each catchment keywords urban flooding climate change water sensitive urban design integrated stormwater management 1 introduction rapid urbanization coupled with climate change is creating a mix of increasingly inextricable challenges if we consider the case of sydney the largest city in australia the population is expected to increase at an average annual growth rate of 0 9 1 4 australia bureau of statistics 2018 or close to 350 000 people annually accommodating this growth in major cities has led to higher population density and urban sprawl brody et al 2013 eigenbrod et al 2011 urban sprawl in turn has led to drastic changes in surface cover where parks sporting fields and farmland have been developed into impervious surfaces such as high rise apartments shopping centers car parks and vast residential developments when one considers this change in the context of flooding more people are now living in close quarters leading to a higher risk of flood related damages to both life and property shi 2019 zhou et al 2016 zhu and tang 2010 within the process of planning to accommodate the projected growth in the urban landscape one must consider future climate conditions that are projected to further exacerbate the problem of urban flooding hettiarachchi et al 2018 ipcc 2014 masson delmotte et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 rising global temperatures due to climate change is projected to increase intensities and frequencies of extreme storm events steffen et al 2017 in most locations around australia intense rainfall events will become more extreme being driven by a warmer climate lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 whetton 2011 the swift nature of runoff in urban environments due to the higher impervious surface area provides reason to investigate the potential relationship between a changing climate and flood levels ashley et al 2005 zhou et al 2016 with increase in urbanization taking place worldwide schultz 2006 wang et al 2006 integrated stormwater management methods and water sensitive urban design wsud measures are becoming more crucial as a form of adaptation to offset the climate change enhanced risk of flooding dong et al 2017 whetton 2011 zimmermann et al 2016 literature shows that an increase in impervious surfaces such as paved pathways and roads causes increased flood frequency due to poor infiltration and faster concentration times from reduced flow resistance a particular study performed in vietnam indicated an increase in the maximum inundation depth of 21 18 cm by 2050 for an extreme rainfall event solely due to land use change huong and pathirana 2013 research conducted by boyd et al 1993 compared the actual depth of runoff from impervious surfaces to that of pervious surfaces where the findings indicated the runoff depths to be 5 2 times larger on average in this paper we compare two markedly different catchments with different urban land use characteristics with and without an integrated stormwater management infrastructure to show how each catchment absorbs or does not absorb the impacts of climate change we use hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to evaluate how different land use types and urban stormwater management systems respond to the differing runoff characteristics and built infrastructure within each catchment for this study we focus on the effects of climate change on rainfall intensities and use temperature as the basis for assessing changes to rainfall to reflect the impacts of climate change the two main questions that we consider are 1 how well can constructed stormwater management features in an urban environment absorb the effects of climate change 2 what is the difference between the two catchment responses to climate change impacts on rainfall even though the implications and causes of urban flooding are widely studied and there is an abundance of literature on this topic there exist gaps especially pertaining to climate change impacts on urban flood mitigation systems that form the motivations for this study ashley et al 2005 da silva et al 2018 hollis 1975 löwe et al 2017 schreider et al 2000 zhou et al 2016 here we aim to help fill that gap and add to the current research by addressing the question on how well constructed stormwater features can handle changes in urban runoff patterns due to climate change 2 study locations data and methodology 2 1 study locations the study areas of interest are two urban catchments in sydney australia fig 1 a the first study area catchment 1 the university of new south wales unsw kensington campus fig 1b represents a highly urbanized catchment consisting of impervious surface areas with typical storm water conveyance through pipes and manholes the catchment area that was modelled equals 0 24 km2 in size with an average slope of 4 1 it is a fully built up catchment with 73 of the total catchment area consisting of either buildings or pavements table 1 the second study area catchment 2 the centennial park cp adjoining the suburbs of bondi junction woollahra randwick and moore park in sydney fig 1c is also classified as an urban catchment since it has large urban areas upstream which all drain into the grassy parkland in which a pond detention system is contained the centennial park catchment is located 1 km away from unsw and is approximately 5 76 km2 with an average slope of 1 1 table 1 2 2 urban flood modelling the modelling part of this study was done using the drains software o loughlin et al 2018 drains is hydraulic and hydrologic h h modelling software that allows detailed modelling of urban stormwater drainage systems it calculates runoff hydrographs from pervious and impervious surfaces and routes them through a system of gutters pit inlets pipes and channels the software also conducts flood routing through detention basins as well as flow in open channels with bridge and culvert structures the runoff generation method used in drains for this research is the ilsax hydrological model o loughlin et al 2018 further to this drains allows for the modification of precipitation volumes and includes standard temporal patterns that are based on the most recent australian rainfall runoff 2016 arr2016 guidelines drains can also model storage structures such as the centennial park detention system to perform the required hydrologic and hydraulic analysis on drains necessary information was obtained from multiple sources including unsw facilities management city of sydney council and the centennial park and moore park trust information obtained included stormwater infrastructure details invert levels sub catchment boundaries ground elevations pond configurations and features flow paths pond storage data and recent pond water levels this data was then used to construct the unsw and centennial park catchment models illustrated in fig 1b and c respectively peak flow rate is an indicator of flooding potential in a drainage system since it represents the total volume of water passing through per unit of time m3 s therefore high peak flow rates increase the pressure placed on the system s capacity and ability to move surface runoff without flooding causing danger to nearby infrastructure and people during the modelling analysis peak flow rate was assessed at 3 separate reference locations consisting of manholes nodes and pipes outlined in blue in fig 1b and c for both catchments these locations were selected since they represent the main pipelines which carry majority of the water passing though the catchment critical sections as well as being located downstream near the catchment outlet furthermore this generates results which are more representative of the catchment as a whole rather than using just a single location by doing this the accuracy of each model s results is enhanced whilst the probability of modelling errors and inconsistency is reduced we also extract runoff volumes and total volumes leaving the catchments as indicators to evaluate and compare the two catchments four different climate scenarios were used in the modelling analysis refer to table 3 below to replicate the effects of increasing temperatures due to climate change phenomenon the way in which these different climate scenarios are modelled in the drains package is described in more detail in section 2 4 2 3 precipitation data the australian rainfall and runoff guide provides a consistent and updated approach to collecting analyzing and managing flood information that is essential for policy decisions and projects within australia ball et al 2016 this study uses the 2016 australian rainfall and runoff arr2016 intensity frequency duration ifd relationships which was obtained from the arr 2016 data hub we focus on the 50 and 10 annual exceedance probability aep events since these storms are generally expected to cause harm to urban environments in the future whilst still occurring frequently compared to say a 1 aep storm based on city of sydney guidelines and policies city of sydney 2017 urban stormwater systems are designed to handle 50 aep storms without excessive and dangerous flooding occurring once the required rainfall intensities were obtained drains generates 10 storm temporal patterns for alternate modelling scenarios refer to figs s1 s4 figs s1 s4 represent the different temporal patterns generated by drains based on the input ifd relationships each with varying rainfall distributions intensities peaks and troughs the difference in temporal patterns shown here causes the variations in modelling results within each scenario presented in this paper whereby the maximums worst case scenario are generally caused by the peakier temporal patterns and minimums best case scenario by the flatter temporal patterns the box and whisker plots presented in the latter sections of this paper are therefore representative of the variable nature of storm events by including modelling results for 10 different temporal patterns 2 4 accounting for climate change many of the current studies use gcm downscaling as a method of accounting for climate change in precipitation najafi and hessami kermani 2017 nguyen et al 2008 nguyen et al 2010 zahmatkesh et al 2015 however gcm downscaling has a disadvantage when applied to urban catchments due to the smaller spatial area and shorter duration of critical events busuioc et al 1999 girvetz et al 2013 nguyen et al 2008 sharma et al 2007 willems et al 2012 current literature details that these climate affected extreme rainfall events are altered in terms of both rainfall volume and varying intensification of the storm s temporal pattern trenberth 2011 wasko and sharma 2015 a method to use temperature as an index to scale rainfall patterns was presented by wasko and sharma 2015 wasko and sharma 2015 analyzed the relationship between burst patterns from 79 australian rainfall gauges and temperature variations and showed that rainfall patterns scale with increased temperature creating less uniform temporal patterns with higher intensities the portions of a storm with lowest intensity were shown to decrease in rainfall intensity while the portion of the storm with the highest intensity would have even larger peak intensity by as much as 1 3 as illustrated in fig 2 therefore a temperature based method to scale rainfall to account for climate change is used in the study as a more suitable approach with urban catchments it should be noted that a temperature based scaling approach has been found to be sub optimal for tropical regimes roderick et al 2019 but satisfactory for climates such as in sydney hettiarachchi et al 2018 quantified the application of these temporal scaling factors reporting up to a 35 increase in flood depth resulting from scaled temporal patterns and a 10 170 increase in flood depth resulting from the projected rainfall volume being added to the new projected temporal patterns we try to illustrate these changes in rainfall due to climate change in fig 2 which shows the shift to a generic intensity duration curve for a particular return frequency with increase in temperature as discussed in the above referenced literature it is generally accepted that the rainfall depth will increase with an increase in temperature the inserts illustrate the changes in temporal distributions discussed in wasko and sharma 2015 the current and future show how the highest intra storm rainfall rate increases while the lowest intra storm rainfall rate decrease resulting in an intensification of temporal patterns during a storm hettiarachchi et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 for the purpose of this study the change to rainfall volumes per change in temperature is based on well accepted clausius clapeyron relationship trenberth et al 2003 which give a 7 increase per deg k which is then applied within equation one as shown below the scaling of rainfall volume was based on the following equation 1 v t δ t v t 1 α v δ t where vt is the rainfall depth for each return period and duration for the current temperature taken from arr2016 vt δt is the rainfall depth adjusted for temperature increase and α v is the scaling of the precipitation per degree c 7 application of this relationship led to the precipitation multiplication factors shown in table 2 these multiplication factors were then entered into the drains climate change rainfall multiplier dialogue box depending on which climate change scenario was being modelled to adjust the rainfall depth for each scenario in addition to the above modification of design rainfall intensity wasko and sharma 2015 conclusively showed that design temporal patterns were becoming steeper or more intense with warming temperatures while it is possible to change the temporal pattern and ascertain the outcomes of the modelled peak flows as per the site specific changes noted by wasko and sharma 2015 operational limitations of the drains software makes this challenging as a result the 10 alternate temporal patterns used in the software were used unchanged with the caveat that final assessment could be performed assuming unequal weighting of the 10 patterns in the estimate of the expected peak flow a simple rationale for such unequal weighting might be to apply more weight to the storm temporal patterns that exhibited most intense peaks within a storm distribution and lower weighting to those that exhibited a flatter or more uniform distribution more detail on how these unequally weighted patterns could be interpreted is provided in section 3 2 5 rainfall outflow ro ratio to evaluate the catchments ability to absorb the impact of higher rainfall rates and volumes we use a simple rainfall outflow ro ratio the ro ratio represents the percentage of total rainfall that translates into the volume that leaves the catchment indicating how much of the rainfall is abstracted or retained within the catchment for each respective storm event the ro used here is similar in concept to the well established runoff coefficient goel 2011 applicable to different land use types in hydrologic calculations for this manuscript the ro is different in that we consider the built storage features within each catchment which then leads to retention as a result of physical storage of runoff and such losses such as infiltration over green space or hydraulics abstraction in stormwater management features storage ponds within the catchment a lower ro ratio indicates that a higher portion of the rainfall is abstracted or retained within constructed stormwater management features within the catchment the opposite is true for a higher ro ratio indicating that the catchment is not effective at managing flow rates which can result in a higher risk of flooding within the catchment as well as downstream of the catchment the ro ratio is calculated using the following equation 2 ro r a t i o σ outlet rainfall where σ outlet is the sum of water volumes exiting catchment outlets rainfall is the total volume of rainfall over the catchment area for the duration of the storm event 3 results and discussion in the following subsections we present and discuss the results generated by the two models and the scenarios presented in table 3 we attempt to answer the two main questions presented at the beginning of the paper by first looking at the fractional volume of rainfall that leaves the catchment outlet this ratio is used to ascertain how well each of the catchments can absorb the higher rainfall volumes resulting from scaling effects based on climate change following this we analyze peak flow rates and volumes stored within the catchments of the two models to show how different types of land use responds to higher rainfall rates 3 1 rainfall outflow ro ratio as shown in fig 3 mean ro ratio of the ten storm patterns along with the variation are plotted for the current and 3 climate scenarios representing higher temperature conditions a change in mean ro ratio between the current and the 3 c rise in temperature scenario for the unsw model is from 79 to 83 for a 50 aep storm event whilst there is an increase from 86 to 88 for a 10 aep storm event on the other hand the mean ro ratio remains at approximately 3 5 and 4 for the 50 and 10 aep respectively for all the modeled scenario at the cp catchment the difference in ro ratios between the unsw and cp catchments substantial and significant the first major difference is that the relative proportion of rainfall volume reaching the catchment outlet is approximately 20 times greater for the unsw catchment compared to centennial park the second difference is the fact that unsw shows an increasing trend between ro ratio with warmer temperature as expected whereas the cp catchment has minimal to no change with increasing temperature scenarios for both return periods the minimal change in ro ratio in the cp watershed is even more notable when considering that rainfall volume was scaled by a factor of 1 225 or 22 5 for the 3 deg c warmer scenario in both catchments this difference in ratio is also prevalent just in the case of the two return periods with ro ratio increasing by less than 1 at centennial park from a the 50 to 10 aep whereas unsw increase by approximately 5 overall tables s1and s2 in the supplementary information presents the percentage of storage utilized at each of the storage locations refer to fig s5 within the cp pond system during each of the model scenarios the effectiveness of the design of the pond system at cp is demonstrated by the progression of storage as shown in table s2 as more and more of the ponds are at 100 capacity for the 10 aep event at 3 deg c increase in temperature which matches with the cascading layout of the ponds as shown in fig s1 as discussed in section 2 3 the box plots for each model scenario are based on 10 storm patterns that help to account for the variability in intra strom distribution of rainfall it is interesting to note that the interquartile range for the cp watershed is predominately left skewed with the median at the top half of that range suggesting that storm patterns with peak rainfall loaded towards the latter half of the storm duration have a higher impact of volume sensitive watersheds and stormwater management systems similar to the discussion on the impact of storm temporal patterns in hettiarachchi et al 2018 this result is a noteworthy indicator of the effectiveness of integrated stormwater management measures in creating an urban catchment which is resilient and adaptable when faced with more extreme storm conditions under a future warming climate the hydraulic abstraction at these stormwater management systems can be impacted by changes in seasonal rainfall patterns which can increase the effectiveness of flood mitigation hettiarachchi et al 2019 sharma et al 2018 the runoff volume leaving the cp catchments is a small percentage of the total rainfall volume over the catchment which directly attributable to the storage capabilities of the pond detention system with the added benefit of higher infiltration losses occurring over the grassland areas this result quantifies and proves just how much of an effect integrated stormwater management measures such as the centennial park pond storages have in mitigating the potential increase in flooding in a typical urban catchment and highlighting the capability of the centennial park catchment to adapt to future climate conditions 3 2 peak flow rates peak flow rates are an important factor when sizing sewer systems or trying to determine total conveyance capacity required to safely move surface runoff in an urban developed environment in most cases street flow is part of the conveyance capacity of an urban system during larger storm events hence the total peak flow rate is defined as the sum of the overflow flow rate and pipe flow rate along a stretch of sewer or street since the unsw drainage system in particular is expected to have significant overflows surcharging from manholes for larger more intense storms which will flow along the streets it is important to include the overflow rate to find the total peak flow rate fig 4 presents the peak flow rates for the unsw and the cp catchments extracted along pipes and conduits within the box outlined in fig 1b and c respectively the boxplots shown in fig 4 are based on 30 results for each scenario generated at 3 locations for 10 temporal patterns for the 10 aep rainfall event the results are normalized by the mean of the peak flow rates for the current day scenario it is interesting to note that the rate of increase in the median peak flow with each degree in temperature increase is similar in both catchments with approximately a 20 increase in the peak flow for a 3 deg c rise in temperature scenario the spread in the results also increase with higher temperatures with the unsw showing a significantly higher level of variability in peak flow rates with the varying temporal patterns of rainfall the maximum limit of peak flow increases by 55 for the unsw campus while the highest increase is 35 for the cp catchment the higher variability can be attributed to direct runoff generated by the land cover at unsw and the varying levels of street flow the larger spread of peak flow rates also illustrates the challenges of determining the sizes and capacity of sewer systems in an urban environment the variability in the results for both catchments are similar to the results presented in hettiarachchi et al 2018 the smaller spread in peak flow in the cp catchment can be attributed to the lower overall impervious area and the available storage facilities modulating the impacts of higher rainfall rates it is interesting to note that there is a skew towards the higher peak flows in the interquartile range for the 3 deg c increase scenario within the cp catchment suggesting higher rates of overflow from the storage ponds during some of the temporal patterns modelled lack of such skew in the unsw results shows that highly urban areas are more directly sensitive to the peak intensity within a storm compared to watersheds with mixed land use 3 3 stored water volumes as a supplementary analysis we looked at the overall volume of runoff that gets conveyed through the drainage network of each catchment we used a storage location at the outlet of the model to accumulate the runoff as an index of the total volume generated for each scenario and is plotted in fig 5 again the results presented in fig 5 are normalized based on the mean of the volumes generated in the current scenario model unlike the peak flows in fig 4 here we see a different rate of increase in the volume of flow through the catchment between unsw and cp which shows the impact of available storage within the catchment the runoff volume that is conveyed through the unsw drainage network increases by close to 60 for the 3 deg c increase in temperature this increase in volume conveyed through the network indicates the added stress on the drainage system as a result of the larger storms that can be expected in a future climate in contrast the volume leaving the cp catchment increases less than 20 for a 3 deg c change in temperature as the sequential layout of the storage facilities help retain a major portion of the increased flow the results presented in fig 3 shows that integrating stormwater management features within an urban stormwater system can absorb the impacts of climate change on rainfall patterns and can help mitigate the increased risk of flooding in a future warmer climate the changes in rainfall to outflow ratio with higher rainfall values related to a warmer climate for the two different catchments provide a clear contrast and indicate the importance of providing storage related infrastructure and mixing in pervious land cover within the urban landscape an important consideration here is that these catchments are part of a larger overall city wide storm sewer system and the cp catchment will significantly help mitigate flooding in downstream catchments by being able to retain and control outflow from the area in contrast higher flows from the unsw catchment will add stress on the downstream systems and will contribute to the increased threat of flood damages when considering the results presented from figs 3 5 as a whole the difference in the catchment response to the expected changes to rainfall due to climate change becomes evident the unsw catchment is representative of a majority of the main urban areas and major cities throughout the world with minimal stormwater management features whereas the cp catchment represents a growing trend in making stormwater management an integral part of new urban planning the results presented in the manuscript show the contrast in how well each of the

the ro ratio increases as expected for the watershed area with higher percentage of impervious land cover whereas this ratio changes minimally for the catchment with green space and storage facilities both catchments show a similar trend in average peak flow rates though the catchment while the watershed with highly impervious land cover shows a high degree of variability in the peak flow rates this variability complicates the designing of stormwater conveyance systems within dense urban areas and adds to the potential of more frequent flooding the 20 fold decrease and the minimal change in volume of flow leaving the catchment with storage infrastructure is significant and a testament to the need to incorporate stormwater management within urban built environments even when challenged for livable space this simple but effective study shows the clear need to properly plan and include integrated stormwater management features within the urban landscape in order to provide the level of care to protect human life and property from flooding in a changing climate the authors acknowledge that the modelling completed for this manuscript simplifies some of the complexities and nuances of urban storm sewer systems and urban flooding the results presented here do show the difference and the benefits of integrated stormwater management within the urban landscape declaration of

manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of daniele penna associate editor soil water infiltration is an important part of the land surface hydrological cycle and plays an important role in the hydrological response of the soil such as soil erosion high infiltration rates favor an increase in the soil water storage capacity that allows maintaining vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions alfalfa medicago sativa l is a quality perennial legume grassland which is widely planted in semi arid areas in this study the effects of the root channels formed by the decay of alfalfa on preferential flow were evaluated as a driving force to improve soil water infiltration and soil water supply a double ring infiltrometer 30 cm inner diameter and 60 cm outer diameter was used to measure the infiltration process with the falling head method methylene blue was used to visualize the pathways followed by the infiltrated water the results showed that the initial infiltration rate in the alfalfa grassland increased by 27 7 compared with the control bare land and the total cumulative infiltration was 1 13 times higher the steady infiltration rate of the grassland increased by 31 8 compared to the bare land the root channel diameters were measured with a vernier caliper and the average root channel area rca was calculated through the average root channel diameter arcd the values of arcd and rca were significantly and positively correlated with the infiltration rates being the coefficients of determination 0 815 and 0 789 respectively our results indicated that root channels formed by the decayed roots of alfalfa played an important role in increasing soil water infiltration and soil water supply under semi arid conditions our research improves the understanding of the hydrological cycle processes at the plant soil interface in semi arid areas keywords soil water infiltration rate root channels double ring infiltrometer preferential flow soil water supply 1 introduction land surface water resources shortage and their effective utilization are among the most serious problems in farmlands particularly in arid and semi arid regions yin et al 2018 soil water is one of the most important limiting factors that influences vegetation growth and distribution patterns in arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2007 2008 wu et al 2017 under these conditions any decrease in soil water could aggravate soil water shortage in both the top and deep soil layers and even favor the formation of the dry soil layer further endangering the sustainability of vegetation restoration jia et al 2017 2019 furthermore soil water availability for plants is a clear limiting factor that affects vegetation survival growth and restoration in arid and semi arid areas because rainfall is the only source that can replenish soil water wang et al 2007 the study of water infiltration is therefore crucial for its ecological significance soil matrix and preferential flow are the two main forms of water infiltration into the soil jarvis et al 2012 matrix flow refers to the relatively slow movement of water and solutes through the soil while passing through all pore spaces allaire et al 2009 preferential flow is defined as the physical movement of water and solutes along certain pathways while bypassing a fraction of the pore matrix hendrickx and flury 2001 preferential flow may accelerate or delay the movement of water and solutes depending upon the position of the water and solutes compared to the position of the preferential flow paths allaire et al 2009 however preferential flow is randomly distributed in the soil spatially and temporally and thus is essentially unpredictable hendrickx and flury 2001 zhang et al 2015 2017 preferential flow occurs in most soils and is caused from a series of factors such as macropore flow non homogeneous infiltration lateral flow and wetting front instabilities allaire et al 2009 bundt et al 2001 to visualize preferential water flow pathways in soils dye traces are often used flury and flühler 1994 ghodrati and jury 1990 flury and wai 2003 brilliant blue fcf c l food blue 2 has often been used for its lower adsorption and higher mobility flury and flühler 1994 although ions and isotopes have been also employed to distinguish preferential and matrix flow paths e g bogner et al 2008 backnäs et al 2012 ma et al 2017 jaromir and tomas 2018 zhang et al 2015 used brilliant blue solution at a concentration of 5 g l 1 to identify preferential flow pathways through dye coverage and the maximum depth of infiltration could also be determined weiler and flühler 2004 and cey and rudolph 2009 suggested that the type of macropore flow and the interaction between macropore flow and matrix flow can be understood after mapping dye concentration by using classification techniques or image analysis software numerous methods for measuring infiltration have been developed and applied such as the single ring infiltrometer reynolds and elrick 1990 wu et al 1999 the double ring infiltrometer bouwer 1986 the disc permeameter perroux and white 1988 ankeny et al 1988 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 the rainfall simulator peterson and bubenzer 1986 ogden et al 1997 mao et al 2011 the point source method mao et al 2016 the run off on out method liu et al 2010 and the guelph permeameter lópez vicente and navas 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2016 2017 the ring infiltrometer is the most commonly used method for measuring soil infiltration rates walsh and mcdonnell 2012 according to zhang et al 2016 and using the single ring infiltrometer preferential flow encourages higher initial infiltration rates wu et al 1997 compared the constant and falling head methods with numerical modelling obtaining similar soil infiltration rates in fine textured soils although soil infiltration rates decreased more than 30 with the decrease of the water head in coarse soils the double ring infiltrometer is frequently used to measure infiltration because this device is relatively inexpensive simple and easy to operate nevertheless errors in the experimental results are not infrequent and are well documented zhang et al 2016 for example described the effect of preferential flow on the measurement accuracy of infiltration rates caused by the disturbance of soil when infiltrometer is inserted into the ground zhang et al 2017 in order to avoid preferential flow in measuring infiltration in forest soil added a layer of fine sand to the inner and outer rings and found that the measured infiltration reflected the transient process of soil matrix infiltration and the results were consistent with the values generated by accepted infiltration models the disc permeameter unlike the infiltrometer forces water to penetrate into the soil under negative water potentials previously determined by the operator therefore it can only measure the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated soil logsdon and jaynes 1993 angulo jaramillo et al 2000 hence this method cannot measure soil infiltration on soil surface under positive pressure conditions besides the soil hydraulic conductivity measurement under ponded infiltration conditions is not ensured by using this method reynolds and zebchuk 1996 rainfall simulation is often used to measure infiltration rates smets et al 2011 iserloh et al 2013 and study soil erosion and other soil hydrological processes lassu et al 2015 keesstra et al 2016 it is known that the different methods and techniques provide distinct soil water infiltrations rates under the same conditions cerda 1997 reported that the infiltration rates estimated by the ring infiltrometer were 8 8 5 times higher than those obtained by rainfall simulator based on 40 groups of field measurements furthermore mao et al 2011 revealed that the initial infiltration rate measured by the rainfall simulator was not accurate under heavy rainfall conditions a point source method was developed by su 2007 for measuring in situ infiltration rates obtaining lower rates than those rates measured with the linear source method although the point source method had higher accuracy and lower relative error the use of this method formed a circular or near circular wet area at the soil surface which increased gradually over time to reach a final wet area mao et al 2016 channels formed by plant roots are common preferential soil flow pathways both for water and solutes bogner et al 2010 germann et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the alfalfa s root system is characterized by a large diameter long almost straight taproot when alfalfa dies and decays it provides a temporary channel for macropore flow mitchell et al 1995 old root channels that have been opened at the soil surface wang and strong 1996 and root channels created by decayed roots in the vertical direction mitchell 1995 are both regarded as macropores water infiltration into soil through root channels is an important mechanism of soil infiltration and plays an important role in predicting runoff generation and groundwater recharge weiler and naef 2003 macropores formed by plant roots are crucial for the soil water downward movement especially in arid and semi arid areas wu et al 2017 found that the initial infiltration rate and the average infiltration rate during the first 15 min increased as the diameter of root channels increased mitchell 1995 and benegas et al 2014 concluded that tree roots including both living and decaying roots have positive effects on soil infiltration by increasing macroporosity and soil aggregation more than sixty years ago barley 1954 also illustrated that plant roots increased the soil infiltration rate although previous studies have addressed the effects of root systems on soil water infiltration the influence of root channels formed by decayed roots is scarcely studied this theme especially in arid and semi arid regions where soil water availability for plant is essential deserves to be studied in depth the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the decayed roots in response to preferentialflow paths and 2 to further explore the relationships between the properties of the channels formed by the decayed roots and the soil water infiltration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted at the key field observation station of ecological environment of the ministry of agriculture on the loess plateau which is located in gongjiawan district lanzhou city in gansu province china 36 01 n 103 45 w as shown in fig 1 this area belongs to the arid hilly and gully regions on the loess plateau altitude ranging from 1698 to 1823 m a s l which is characterized by a semi arid and continental climate between 2001 and 2013 the mean annual precipitation and evaporation were 383 and 1450 mm respectively rainfall events were unevenly distributed and mainly concentrated in july august and september the average annual temperature was 7 4 c and the highest and lowest recorded temperature were 19 8 c in july and 7 2 c in january the mean annual sunshine duration was about 2651 h and the frost free period ranged between 135 and 167 days the soil is mainly loessial and the loess layer thickness is approximately 150 m within the fine soil fraction 2 mm of diameter the mean content of sand silt and clay is 25 5 66 1 and 8 4 respectively determined by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments according to the usda texture classification the soil moisture at field capacity by mass ranges between 19 3 and 22 6 huang et al 2017 and the mean soil organic matter content is ca 27 2 g kg 1 for the 0 30 cm depth layer 2 2 experimental plots and infiltration measurements the experimental site was a cultivated alfalfa medicago sativa l field where plants remained dead for 3 5 years other grass species like leymus secalinus artemisia sacrorum artemisia annua and artemisia incisa etc grew in the alfalfa field after the death of medicago sativa three alfalfa field research areas each area of 10 10 m were established in the grassland seeds were planted with a row spacing of 50 cm and at a sowing rate of 0 07 kg m 2 in the process of planting the sowing rate was slightly higher than usual in order to improve the emergence rate owing to the barren soil conditions alfalfa grass growth depended on rainfall there were no additional fertilizations human interventions or animal disturbances and these conditions were similar in all plots during all the experimental treatments these treatments included alfalfa grassland and bare land in addition the alfalfa grassland was treated with or without a fine sand layer the purpose of the fine sand layer was to avoid the occurrence of preferential flow six experimental plots were randomly selected at each experimental treatment and set as six replicates infiltration measurements were carried out in all the treatments alfalfa with 6 measurements and without 6 measurements fine sand and bare soil 6 measurements the double ring infiltrometer was used to measure water infiltration fig 2 after selecting a level site the litter layer was carefully removed so that the soil surface was exposed then the rings 30 cm diameter inner ring 60 cm diameter outer ring both 20 cm in height were placed concentrically on the soil surface and were gently inserted 10 cm vertically into the soil in order to reduce crack formation some soil was then placed outside of the inner and outer rings to avoid water outflow the inner and outer rings were filled with water with and without methylene blue respectively until the water depth reached 5 cm at the same time in both rings when methylene blue was dissolved in water the solution appeared bright blue the falling head method was used to measure water infiltration the time required to infiltrate water up to the water level dropped 1 cm in the inner ring was recorded with a stopwatch until the infiltration time did not change for three consecutive measurements and this rate was assumed as the steady state infiltration during the infiltration tests water was refilled into the rings whenever the water level dropped to 1 cm depth and the water levels in the inner and outer rings were consistent to calculate the initial infiltration rate only the first three minutes of the infiltration process were taken into consideration in fact the initial infiltration rate was an average rate because we took into account the total three minutes of infiltrated water the average of the last three fairly constant infiltration rates was considered as the steady state infiltration rate these rates were calculated following the equation of zhang et al 2017 1 i δ i δ t 600 where i is the infiltration rate mm h 1 δi is the cumulative infiltration in the inner ring cm during δt time of infiltration min and 600 is a unit conversion factor to evaluate the role played by the root channels in the preferential flow other double ring infiltrometer was applied to measure the infiltration process in the alfalfa grassland with the fine sand layer 6 measurements according to the methods of zhang et al 2017 a layer of nylon cloth was placed on the soil surface inside the inner ring and between the inner and outer rings and then a layer of fine sand of 1 3 cm thick was evenly placed on the nylon cloth in order to avoid the occurrence of preferential flow and to ensure that water infiltrates the soil surface only through the soil matrix to reduce the scouring of the fine sand layers while the rings were filled with water paperboards were placed on the sand surface in the infiltration tests with sand measurements were carried out following the same method mentioned above 2 3 soil sampling and analysis twenty four hours after the end of the infiltration tests vertical soil profiles were excavated passing through the center of the inner ring the vertical soil profiles are shown in fig 3 for alfalfa and bare land treatments the width and depth of the wetted soil area were then measured with a steel ruler having the smallest division of 1 mm the wetted vertical profiles were recorded with a camera in order to distinguish the spots stained by the tracer dye afterwards soil samples were collected throughout the entire soil profile 0 100 cm at 10 cm intervals on the other side of the excavation trench three replicates were collected at each soil layer and the soil water content by mass swc weight and soil bulk density bd g cm 3 were determined the swc was measured by taking the proportion of the loss of mass after oven drying at 105 c to the constant mass of dry soil the bd was measured using a stainless steel cutting ring sampler of 5 cm diameter and height 393 cm3 to collect the samples the soil total porosity tp was calculated using the following equation 2 tp 1 b d d s 100 where ds is the soil particle density g cm 3 which was assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 huang et al 2017 the mean and standard error values of the soil physical properties are shown in table 1 2 4 root channels measurement the diameter of the root channels i e the diameter of the stubbles on the ground were only measured in the inner ring of the twelve alfalfa experimental plots by using a vernier caliper having a vernier constant of 0 10 mm the average value of the stubble diameters was regarded as the average diameter of root channels which we assumed that have influenced the preferential water flow wu et al 2017 meanwhile to estimate the area of the root channels the total number of root channels was counted in the inner ring at each experimental site according to the methods of wu et al 2017 the following formulas were used to calculate the average root channels diameter arcd cm and the root channel area rca cm2 3 arcd i 1 n d n n 1 2 3 4 rca n π a r c d 2 4 n 1 2 3 where di is the diameter of the root channel cm n is the number of root channels 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were conducted using spss software ver 22 0 one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine if the differences in the soil properties between each experimental treatment were statistically significant with a p value of 0 05 regression analysis was used to determine relationships between the maximum infiltration depth the diameter of root channels the area of root channels the number of root channels and the steady state infiltration rate the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the performance of the applied regression equations 3 results 3 1 soil properties in different treatments the differences in the soil physical properties of the different treatments are shown in table 1 overall the swc and bd were lower in the medicago sativa grassland than in the bare land whereas opposite differences were found for the tp a significant difference between medicago sativa grassland and bare soil was found for swc for the 70 80 cm soil depth although the differences were not significant for the other soil layers the bd was significantly lower in medicago sativa grassland than in bare land for all the soil depths greater than 40 50 cm the tp was significantly higher in the medicago sativa grassland than in the bare land for the soil depths of 40 50 50 60 70 80 and 80 90 cm 3 2 soil water infiltration in the decayed root channels the infiltration rates and cumulative infiltration curves of all the experimental treatments are shown in fig 4 the initial infiltration rate was high as usual in this study in all treatments it decreased with time and finally reached a stable state the different soil water infiltration rates in medicago sativa were always higher than those rates found in the bare land fig 4 compared with the bare land where the initial infiltration rate was 190 48 mm h 1 the same rate in the medicago sativa grassland was 27 70 greater reaching up to 243 24 mm h 1 figs 4a 5 at the end of the experiment the cumulative infiltration in the alfalfa fields was 1 13 times the value obtained in the bare land fig 4b in addition our results revealed significant differences in the steady state infiltration rate between the different experimental treatments fig 5 the steady state infiltration rate in the medicago sativa grassland was higher than that observed in the bare land in particular the steady state infiltration rate in the alfalfa grassland 73 32 mm h 1 was 31 80 greater than the value estimated in the bare land 55 62 mm h 1 moreover when the infiltration rate reached a steady state value there was a positive and strong correlation r2 0 825 between the steady state infiltration rate and the maximum depth reached by the water along the soil profile fig 6 this means that the higher depth the water penetrated into the soil the higher steady state infiltration rates were reached the maximum depth reached by the infiltrated water was ca 96 cm in the alfalfa grassland and ca 63 cm in the bare land plots fig 3 we concluded that preferential flowpaths increased water penetration into the soil owing to the decay of the alfalfa roots 3 3 relation between root channel properties and soil water infiltration the correlation analyses showed that the average root channel diameter was positively correlated r2 0 815 p 0 01 with the steady state infiltration rate fig 7 b likewise there was a significant relationship r2 0 789 p 0 01 between the root channel area and the steady state infiltration rate fig 7c in other words the infiltration rate increased with the increase of the arcd and rca values the number of root channels was also significantly and positively correlated r2 0 797 p 0 01 with the steady state infiltration rate fig 7a 4 discussion soil water infiltration is related to surface runoff soil erosion plant water storage and groundwater recharge jiang et al 2018 in addition water flow behavior is increasingly considered as the main factor of soil water distribution jiang et al 2017 in our study the steady state infiltration rate of alfalfa was higher than that of the bare land consistent with the finding of meek et al 1990 the effect of alfalfa root induced macropores was mainly demonstrated by the increase of final infiltration rate when alfalfa roots decayed schematically there are two main forms of water infiltration in the soil matrix flow and preferential flow jarvis et al 2012 soil matrix flow which is present in unsaturated conditions is affected by capillary suction and the process of infiltration is well matched with philip s sorptivity concept zhang et al 2017 preferential flow mainly due to gravitational potential which is generally in the vertical direction germann et al 2007 is caused by a number of factors such as macropore flow non homogeneous infiltration lateral flow and wetting front instabilities allaire et al 2009 bundt et al 2001 and therefore is difficult to describe with current theories such as richard s and darcy type equations de vries and chow 1978 weiler 2005 brilliant blue dye is an important tool to prove the existence of preferential flow flury et al 1994 our study showed that most of the dye covered the top soil fig 3 and this result was in agreement with the findings of devitt and smith 2002 several studies showed that the dye coverage was lower in the subsoil than at the soil surface because preferential flow was more frequent in the upper soil layers than in the deeper ones zhang et al 2015 furthermore mitchell et al 1995 illustrated that the dyeing depth went below 55 cm along the decayed root channels more likely because the roots influenced the physical properties of the soil such as porosity and bulk density aubertin 1971 the decayed root channels tagged with blue dye inside fig 3a were a clear indication of pore space creation by the alfalfa roots dye was found around the roots and the dye coverage decreased with the soil depth when a root decayed a clear porous soil remained which was characterized by lower density and higher porosity providing new space for water and air storage our results were in agreement with those of mitchell et al 1995 and barley 1954 who indicated that root channels created by decayed roots increased the infiltration rate the existence of preferential flow resulted in the enhancement of soil infiltration capacity after alfalfa died the channels formed by the decayed roots were the main preferential flow that provided a temporary channel for macropore flow mitchell et al 1995 as shown in fig 3a root channels would increase macropores network density and continuity and channels formed by plant roots may be conducive to water transport and solute movement as preferential flow bogner et al 2010 germann et al 2012 in general and compared with living roots it was much easier for decayed roots to form long and continuous preferential flow pathways that facilitated the downward movement of water mitchell et al 1995 additionally we also found that the arcd and rca showed a positive correlation with the infiltration rates fig 7b c this result agreed with the observations reported by wu et al 2017 who illustrated that the arcd and rca were positively correlated with the average infiltration rate calculated during the 0 15 min time interval and the initial infiltration rate lastly it must be noted that the roots of legumes such as alfalfa are more effective creating stable macropores than those of gramineous plants which contribute to increasing infiltration rates and benefit the higher proliferation and weight of leguminous roots wu et al 2016 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the decayed root channels of alfalfa had significant effects on soil water infiltration in a loessial cultivated soil under semi arid conditions compared to bare soil the initial soil water infiltration rate in the medicago sativa grassland increased by 27 70 and the cumulative infiltration was 1 13 times higher moreover the steady infiltration rate in the grassland increased by 31 80 compared with the bare land control plots our results indicated that root channels created by the alfalfa decayed roots played a significant role in increasing infiltration rate the root diameter and area of the root sections indicated previously with the terms arcd and rca were significantly and positively correlated with the infiltration rate being respectively 0 815 and 0 789 the coefficients of determination our results supported the conclusion that the decayed root channels of alfalfa significantly enhanced infiltration of water from soil surface toward deeper layers

manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of daniele penna associate editor soil water infiltration is an important part of the land surface hydrological cycle and plays an important role in the hydrological response of the soil such as soil erosion high infiltration rates favor an increase in the soil water storage capacity that allows maintaining vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions alfalfa medicago sativa l is a quality perennial legume grassland which is widely planted in semi arid areas in this study the effects of the root channels formed by the decay of alfalfa on preferential flow were evaluated as a driving force to improve soil water infiltration and soil water supply a double ring infiltrometer 30 cm inner diameter and 60 cm outer diameter was used to measure the infiltration process with the falling head method methylene blue was used to visualize the pathways followed by the infiltrated water the results showed that the initial infiltration rate in the alfalfa grassland increased by 27 7 compared with the control bare land and the total cumulative infiltration was 1 13 times higher the steady infiltration rate of the grassland increased by 31 8 compared to the bare land the root channel diameters were measured with a vernier caliper and the average root channel area rca was calculated through the average root channel diameter arcd the values of arcd and rca were significantly and positively correlated with the infiltration rates being the coefficients of determination 0 815 and 0 789 respectively our results indicated that root channels formed by the decayed roots of alfalfa played an important role in increasing soil water infiltration and soil water supply under semi arid conditions our research improves the understanding of the hydrological cycle processes at the plant soil interface in semi arid areas keywords soil water infiltration rate root channels double ring infiltrometer preferential flow soil water supply 1 introduction land surface water resources shortage and their effective utilization are among the most serious problems in farmlands particularly in arid and semi arid regions yin et al 2018 soil water is one of the most important limiting factors that influences vegetation growth and distribution patterns in arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2007 2008 wu et al 2017 under these conditions any decrease in soil water could aggravate soil water shortage in both the top and deep soil layers and even favor the formation of the dry soil layer further endangering the sustainability of vegetation restoration jia et al 2017 2019 furthermore soil water availability for plants is a clear limiting factor that affects vegetation survival growth and restoration in arid and semi arid areas because rainfall is the only source that can replenish soil water wang et al 2007 the study of water infiltration is therefore crucial for its ecological significance soil matrix and preferential flow are the two main forms of water infiltration into the soil jarvis et al 2012 matrix flow refers to the relatively slow movement of water and solutes through the soil while passing through all pore spaces allaire et al 2009 preferential flow is defined as the physical movement of water and solutes along certain pathways while bypassing a fraction of the pore matrix hendrickx and flury 2001 preferential flow may accelerate or delay the movement of water and solutes depending upon the position of the water and solutes compared to the position of the preferential flow paths allaire et al 2009 however preferential flow is randomly distributed in the soil spatially and temporally and thus is essentially unpredictable hendrickx and flury 2001 zhang et al 2015 2017 preferential flow occurs in most soils and is caused from a series of factors such as macropore flow non homogeneous infiltration lateral flow and wetting front instabilities allaire et al 2009 bundt et al 2001 to visualize preferential water flow pathways in soils dye traces are often used flury and flühler 1994 ghodrati and jury 1990 flury and wai 2003 brilliant blue fcf c l food blue 2 has often been used for its lower adsorption and higher mobility flury and flühler 1994 although ions and isotopes have been also employed to distinguish preferential and matrix flow paths e g bogner et al 2008 backnäs et al 2012 ma et al 2017 jaromir and tomas 2018 zhang et al 2015 used brilliant blue solution at a concentration of 5 g l 1 to identify preferential flow pathways through dye coverage and the maximum depth of infiltration could also be determined weiler and flühler 2004 and cey and rudolph 2009 suggested that the type of macropore flow and the interaction between macropore flow and matrix flow can be understood after mapping dye concentration by using classification techniques or image analysis software numerous methods for measuring infiltration have been developed and applied such as the single ring infiltrometer reynolds and elrick 1990 wu et al 1999 the double ring infiltrometer bouwer 1986 the disc permeameter perroux and white 1988 ankeny et al 1988 lópez vicente and álvarez 2018 the rainfall simulator peterson and bubenzer 1986 ogden et al 1997 mao et al 2011 the point source method mao et al 2016 the run off on out method liu et al 2010 and the guelph permeameter lópez vicente and navas 2009 rodrigo comino et al 2016 2017 the ring infiltrometer is the most commonly used method for measuring soil infiltration rates walsh and mcdonnell 2012 according to zhang et al 2016 and using the single ring infiltrometer preferential flow encourages higher initial infiltration rates wu et al 1997 compared the constant and falling head methods with numerical modelling obtaining similar soil infiltration rates in fine textured soils although soil infiltration rates decreased more than 30 with the decrease of the water head in coarse soils the double ring infiltrometer is frequently used to measure infiltration because this device is relatively inexpensive simple and easy to operate nevertheless errors in the experimental results are not infrequent and are well documented zhang et al 2016 for example described the effect of preferential flow on the measurement accuracy of infiltration rates caused by the disturbance of soil when infiltrometer is inserted into the ground zhang et al 2017 in order to avoid preferential flow in measuring infiltration in forest soil added a layer of fine sand to the inner and outer rings and found that the measured infiltration reflected the transient process of soil matrix infiltration and the results were consistent with the values generated by accepted infiltration models the disc permeameter unlike the infiltrometer forces water to penetrate into the soil under negative water potentials previously determined by the operator therefore it can only measure the hydraulic characteristics of unsaturated soil logsdon and jaynes 1993 angulo jaramillo et al 2000 hence this method cannot measure soil infiltration on soil surface under positive pressure conditions besides the soil hydraulic conductivity measurement under ponded infiltration conditions is not ensured by using this method reynolds and zebchuk 1996 rainfall simulation is often used to measure infiltration rates smets et al 2011 iserloh et al 2013 and study soil erosion and other soil hydrological processes lassu et al 2015 keesstra et al 2016 it is known that the different methods and techniques provide distinct soil water infiltrations rates under the same conditions cerda 1997 reported that the infiltration rates estimated by the ring infiltrometer were 8 8 5 times higher than those obtained by rainfall simulator based on 40 groups of field measurements furthermore mao et al 2011 revealed that the initial infiltration rate measured by the rainfall simulator was not accurate under heavy rainfall conditions a point source method was developed by su 2007 for measuring in situ infiltration rates obtaining lower rates than those rates measured with the linear source method although the point source method had higher accuracy and lower relative error the use of this method formed a circular or near circular wet area at the soil surface which increased gradually over time to reach a final wet area mao et al 2016 channels formed by plant roots are common preferential soil flow pathways both for water and solutes bogner et al 2010 germann et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the alfalfa s root system is characterized by a large diameter long almost straight taproot when alfalfa dies and decays it provides a temporary channel for macropore flow mitchell et al 1995 old root channels that have been opened at the soil surface wang and strong 1996 and root channels created by decayed roots in the vertical direction mitchell 1995 are both regarded as macropores water infiltration into soil through root channels is an important mechanism of soil infiltration and plays an important role in predicting runoff generation and groundwater recharge weiler and naef 2003 macropores formed by plant roots are crucial for the soil water downward movement especially in arid and semi arid areas wu et al 2017 found that the initial infiltration rate and the average infiltration rate during the first 15 min increased as the diameter of root channels increased mitchell 1995 and benegas et al 2014 concluded that tree roots including both living and decaying roots have positive effects on soil infiltration by increasing macroporosity and soil aggregation more than sixty years ago barley 1954 also illustrated that plant roots increased the soil infiltration rate although previous studies have addressed the effects of root systems on soil water infiltration the influence of root channels formed by decayed roots is scarcely studied this theme especially in arid and semi arid regions where soil water availability for plant is essential deserves to be studied in depth the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the decayed roots in response to preferentialflow paths and 2 to further explore the relationships between the properties of the channels formed by the decayed roots and the soil water infiltration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted at the key field observation station of ecological environment of the ministry of agriculture on the loess plateau which is located in gongjiawan district lanzhou city in gansu province china 36 01 n 103 45 w as shown in fig 1 this area belongs to the arid hilly and gully regions on the loess plateau altitude ranging from 1698 to 1823 m a s l which is characterized by a semi arid and continental climate between 2001 and 2013 the mean annual precipitation and evaporation were 383 and 1450 mm respectively rainfall events were unevenly distributed and mainly concentrated in july august and september the average annual temperature was 7 4 c and the highest and lowest recorded temperature were 19 8 c in july and 7 2 c in january the mean annual sunshine duration was about 2651 h and the frost free period ranged between 135 and 167 days the soil is mainly loessial and the loess layer thickness is approximately 150 m within the fine soil fraction 2 mm of diameter the mean content of sand silt and clay is 25 5 66 1 and 8 4 respectively determined by laser diffraction using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments according to the usda texture classification the soil moisture at field capacity by mass ranges between 19 3 and 22 6 huang et al 2017 and the mean soil organic matter content is ca 27 2 g kg 1 for the 0 30 cm depth layer 2 2 experimental plots and infiltration measurements the experimental site was a cultivated alfalfa medicago sativa l field where plants remained dead for 3 5 years other grass species like leymus secalinus artemisia sacrorum artemisia annua and artemisia incisa etc grew in the alfalfa field after the death of medicago sativa three alfalfa field research areas each area of 10 10 m were established in the grassland seeds were planted with a row spacing of 50 cm and at a sowing rate of 0 07 kg m 2 in the process of planting the sowing rate was slightly higher than usual in order to improve the emergence rate owing to the barren soil conditions alfalfa grass growth depended on rainfall there were no additional fertilizations human interventions or animal disturbances and these conditions were similar in all plots during all the experimental treatments these treatments included alfalfa grassland and bare land in addition the alfalfa grassland was treated with or without a fine sand layer the purpose of the fine sand layer was to avoid the occurrence of preferential flow six experimental plots were randomly selected at each experimental treatment and set as six replicates infiltration measurements were carried out in all the treatments alfalfa with 6 measurements and without 6 measurements fine sand and bare soil 6 measurements the double ring infiltrometer was used to measure water infiltration fig 2 after selecting a level site the litter layer was carefully removed so that the soil surface was exposed then the rings 30 cm diameter inner ring 60 cm diameter outer ring both 20 cm in height were placed concentrically on the soil surface and were gently inserted 10 cm vertically into the soil in order to reduce crack formation some soil was then placed outside of the inner and outer rings to avoid water outflow the inner and outer rings were filled with water with and without methylene blue respectively until the water depth reached 5 cm at the same time in both rings when methylene blue was dissolved in water the solution appeared bright blue the falling head method was used to measure water infiltration the time required to infiltrate water up to the water level dropped 1 cm in the inner ring was recorded with a stopwatch until the infiltration time did not change for three consecutive measurements and this rate was assumed as the steady state infiltration during the infiltration tests water was refilled into the rings whenever the water level dropped to 1 cm depth and the water levels in the inner and outer rings were consistent to calculate the initial infiltration rate only the first three minutes of the infiltration process were taken into consideration in fact the initial infiltration rate was an average rate because we took into account the total three minutes of infiltrated water the average of the last three fairly constant infiltration rates was considered as the steady state infiltration rate these rates were calculated following the equation of zhang et al 2017 1 i δ i δ t 600 where i is the infiltration rate mm h 1 δi is the cumulative infiltration in the inner ring cm during δt time of infiltration min and 600 is a unit conversion factor to evaluate the role played by the root channels in the preferential flow other double ring infiltrometer was applied to measure the infiltration process in the alfalfa grassland with the fine sand layer 6 measurements according to the methods of zhang et al 2017 a layer of nylon cloth was placed on the soil surface inside the inner ring and between the inner and outer rings and then a layer of fine sand of 1 3 cm thick was evenly placed on the nylon cloth in order to avoid the occurrence of preferential flow and to ensure that water infiltrates the soil surface only through the soil matrix to reduce the scouring of the fine sand layers while the rings were filled with water paperboards were placed on the sand surface in the infiltration tests with sand measurements were carried out following the same method mentioned above 2 3 soil sampling and analysis twenty four hours after the end of the infiltration tests vertical soil profiles were excavated passing through the center of the inner ring the vertical soil profiles are shown in fig 3 for alfalfa and bare land treatments the width and depth of the wetted soil area were then measured with a steel ruler having the smallest division of 1 mm the wetted vertical profiles were recorded with a camera in order to distinguish the spots stained by the tracer dye afterwards soil samples were collected throughout the entire soil profile 0 100 cm at 10 cm intervals on the other side of the excavation trench three replicates were collected at each soil layer and the soil water content by mass swc weight and soil bulk density bd g cm 3 were determined the swc was measured by taking the proportion of the loss of mass after oven drying at 105 c to the constant mass of dry soil the bd was measured using a stainless steel cutting ring sampler of 5 cm diameter and height 393 cm3 to collect the samples the soil total porosity tp was calculated using the following equation 2 tp 1 b d d s 100 where ds is the soil particle density g cm 3 which was assumed to be 2 65 g cm 3 huang et al 2017 the mean and standard error values of the soil physical properties are shown in table 1 2 4 root channels measurement the diameter of the root channels i e the diameter of the stubbles on the ground were only measured in the inner ring of the twelve alfalfa experimental plots by using a vernier caliper having a vernier constant of 0 10 mm the average value of the stubble diameters was regarded as the average diameter of root channels which we assumed that have influenced the preferential water flow wu et al 2017 meanwhile to estimate the area of the root channels the total number of root channels was counted in the inner ring at each experimental site according to the methods of wu et al 2017 the following formulas were used to calculate the average root channels diameter arcd cm and the root channel area rca cm2 3 arcd i 1 n d n n 1 2 3 4 rca n π a r c d 2 4 n 1 2 3 where di is the diameter of the root channel cm n is the number of root channels 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical analyses were conducted using spss software ver 22 0 one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine if the differences in the soil properties between each experimental treatment were statistically significant with a p value of 0 05 regression analysis was used to determine relationships between the maximum infiltration depth the diameter of root channels the area of root channels the number of root channels and the steady state infiltration rate the coefficient of determination r2 was used to evaluate the performance of the applied regression equations 3 results 3 1 soil properties in different treatments the differences in the soil physical properties of the different treatments are shown in table 1 overall the swc and bd were lower in the medicago sativa grassland than in the bare land whereas opposite differences were found for the tp a significant difference between medicago sativa grassland and bare soil was found for swc for the 70 80 cm soil depth although the differences were not significant for the other soil layers the bd was significantly lower in medicago sativa grassland than in bare land for all the soil depths greater than 40 50 cm the tp was significantly higher in the medicago sativa grassland than in the bare land for the soil depths of 40 50 50 60 70 80 and 80 90 cm 3 2 soil water infiltration in the decayed root channels the infiltration rates and cumulative infiltration curves of all the experimental treatments are shown in fig 4 the initial infiltration rate was high as usual in this study in all treatments it decreased with time and finally reached a stable state the different soil water infiltration rates in medicago sativa were always higher than those rates found in the bare land fig 4 compared with the bare land where the initial infiltration rate was 190 48 mm h 1 the same rate in the medicago sativa grassland was 27 70 greater reaching up to 243 24 mm h 1 figs 4a 5 at the end of the experiment the cumulative infiltration in the alfalfa fields was 1 13 times the value obtained in the bare land fig 4b in addition our results revealed significant differences in the steady state infiltration rate between the different experimental treatments fig 5 the steady state infiltration rate in the medicago sativa grassland was higher than that observed in the bare land in particular the steady state infiltration rate in the alfalfa grassland 73 32 mm h 1 was 31 80 greater than the value estimated in the bare land 55 62 mm h 1 moreover when the infiltration rate reached a steady state value there was a positive and strong correlation r2 0 825 between the steady state infiltration rate and the maximum depth reached by the water along the soil profile fig 6 this means that the higher depth the water penetrated into the soil the higher steady state infiltration rates were reached the maximum depth reached by the infiltrated water was ca 96 cm in the alfalfa grassland and ca 63 cm in the bare land plots fig 3 we concluded that preferential flowpaths increased water penetration into the soil owing to the decay of the alfalfa roots 3 3 relation between root channel properties and soil water infiltration the correlation analyses showed that the average root channel diameter was positively correlated r2 0 815 p 0 01 with the steady state infiltration rate fig 7 b likewise there was a significant relationship r2 0 789 p 0 01 between the root channel area and the steady state infiltration rate fig 7c in other words the infiltration rate increased with the increase of the arcd and rca values the number of root channels was also significantly and positively correlated r2 0 797 p 0 01 with the steady state infiltration rate fig 7a 4 discussion soil water infiltration is related to surface runoff soil erosion plant water storage and groundwater recharge jiang et al 2018 in addition water flow behavior is increasingly considered as the main factor of soil water distribution jiang et al 2017 in our study the steady state infiltration rate of alfalfa was higher than that of the bare land consistent with the finding of meek et al 1990 the effect of alfalfa root induced macropores was mainly demonstrated by the increase of final infiltration rate when alfalfa roots decayed schematically there are two main forms of water infiltration in the soil matrix flow and preferential flow jarvis et al 2012 soil matrix flow which is present in unsaturated conditions is affected by capillary suction and the process of infiltration is well matched with philip s sorptivity concept zhang et al 2017 preferential flow mainly due to gravitational potential which is generally in the vertical direction germann et al 2007 is caused by a number of factors such as macropore flow non homogeneous infiltration lateral flow and wetting front instabilities allaire et al 2009 bundt et al 2001 and therefore is difficult to describe with current theories such as richard s and darcy type equations de vries and chow 1978 weiler 2005 brilliant blue dye is an important tool to prove the existence of preferential flow flury et al 1994 our study showed that most of the dye covered the top soil fig 3 and this result was in agreement with the findings of devitt and smith 2002 several studies showed that the dye coverage was lower in the subsoil than at the soil surface because preferential flow was more frequent in the upper soil layers than in the deeper ones zhang et al 2015 furthermore mitchell et al 1995 illustrated that the dyeing depth went below 55 cm along the decayed root channels more likely because the roots influenced the physical properties of the soil such as porosity and bulk density aubertin 1971 the decayed root channels tagged with blue dye inside fig 3a were a clear indication of pore space creation by the alfalfa roots dye was found around the roots and the dye coverage decreased with the soil depth when a root decayed a clear porous soil remained which was characterized by lower density and higher porosity providing new space for water and air storage our results were in agreement with those of mitchell et al 1995 and barley 1954 who indicated that root channels created by decayed roots increased the infiltration rate the existence of preferential flow resulted in the enhancement of soil infiltration capacity after alfalfa died the channels formed by the decayed roots were the main preferential flow that provided a temporary channel for macropore flow mitchell et al 1995 as shown in fig 3a root channels would increase macropores network density and continuity and channels formed by plant roots may be conducive to water transport and solute movement as preferential flow bogner et al 2010 germann et al 2012 in general and compared with living roots it was much easier for decayed roots to form long and continuous preferential flow pathways that facilitated the downward movement of water mitchell et al 1995 additionally we also found that the arcd and rca showed a positive correlation with the infiltration rates fig 7b c this result agreed with the observations reported by wu et al 2017 who illustrated that the arcd and rca were positively correlated with the average infiltration rate calculated during the 0 15 min time interval and the initial infiltration rate lastly it must be noted that the roots of legumes such as alfalfa are more effective creating stable macropores than those of gramineous plants which contribute to increasing infiltration rates and benefit the higher proliferation and weight of leguminous roots wu et al 2016 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that the decayed root channels of alfalfa had significant effects on soil water infiltration in a loessial cultivated soil under semi arid conditions compared to bare soil the initial soil water infiltration rate in the medicago sativa grassland increased by 27 70 and the cumulative infiltration was 1 13 times higher moreover the steady infiltration rate in the grassland increased by 31 80 compared with the bare land control plots our results indicated that root channels created by the alfalfa decayed roots played a significant role in increasing infiltration rate the root diameter and area of the root sections indicated previously with the terms arcd and rca were significantly and positively correlated with the infiltration rate being respectively 0 815 and 0 789 the coefficients of determination our results supported the conclusion that the decayed root channels of alfalfa significantly enhanced infiltration of water from soil surface toward deeper layers

6103,recent research has shown that assimilating satellite soil moisture sm retrievals into the land surface models lsms improves simulations of land atmosphere water and energy exchanges with satellite sm retrievals becoming widely and continuously available it is desirable to examine the impact of assimilating them into numerical weather prediction models in order to improve numerical weather forecast skills based on the development of the coupled system of national centers for environmental prediction ncep global forecast system gfs and national aeronautics and space administration nasa land information system lis in this paper we designed an experiment to demonstrate the impacts of assimilating the advanced scatterometer ascat sm data products on the weather forecasts of gfs with respect to the surface air temperature analysis product of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and cpc s morphing method based precipitation data improvement from the ascat sm assimilation for probabilities of high quality forecasts can reach up to 1 7 for gfs precipitation 3 1 for 2 meter minimum temperature and 3 1 for 2 meter diurnal temperature range predictions respectively these results suggest that satellite sm data assimilation could be beneficial for gfs numerical weather forecasts of noaa ncep keywords data assimilation soil moisture numerical weather prediction ascat global forecast system 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important variable for regional and global numerical weather prediction models that impacts the energy and water exchanges between land surface and the atmosphere koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 zhan et al 2012 yin et al 2015c 2016 currently a number of microwave satellite sm products are operationally generated with certain accuracy naeimi et al 2009 kerr et al 2010 jones et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010 li et al 2010 parinussa et al 2014 yin et al 2014 yin et al 2015a b it is thus desirable to examine the impacts of assimilating satellite sm retrievals into weather prediction models and in turn improve numerical weather forecast skills several global weather forecast centers are currently assimilating or testing the assimilation of remotely sensed sm observations ongoing research at the european centre for medium range weather forecasts has shown positive impacts from the assimilation of remote sensing sm data drusch and viterbo 2007 scipal et al 2008 de rosnay et al 2013 building on the extended kalman filter and the offline joint uk land environment simulator land surface model lsm a new land data assimilation system was developed by the uk met office aiming to correctly propagate surface information to deeper soil layers using remote sensing observations dharssi et al 2010 however research related to data assimilation of satellite sm at the national centers for environmental prediction ncep of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in the us has only recently begun the global forecast system gfs of ncep is an important numerical weather prediction model that provides medium range weather forecasts for each gfs run a set of initial values of system state variables including sm is required for the sm state variable the current gfs version uses estimates that are provided by previous gfs forecasts because of uncertainties associated with precipitation estimates and other meteorological forcing data for the noah lsm initial values used for the gfs runs may not represent the true sm information which may contribute to downstream errors in gfs forecasts it is thus desirable to maximize the impacts of satellite sm products in an advanced data assimilation system meanwhile the nasa lis land information system offers a framework to develop a generic sequential data assimilation subsystem kumar et al 2006 2008 in particular the lis includes effective tools such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf that is widely used for sequential assimilation of hydrologic variables evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 several remote sensing sm products from passive and active microwave satellite sensors have been developed to address issues in the in situ sm observations resulting from sparse spatial distributions recent studies indicate that sm retrievals from advanced scatterometer ascat on board the meteorological operation metop satellite program bartalis et al 2007 are comparable to passive sm retrievals liu et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 the ascat provides continuous and reliable long term sm service with retrievals from metop a launched in october 2006 metop b launched in september 2012 wagner et al 2013 and metop c launched in november 2018 however there are typically large uncertainties in sm retrievals from densely vegetated areas due to the robust impacts of vegetation structure and water content in particular backscatter for active c band sensors such as ascat is impacted by diurnal variations in vegetation water content more strongly than previously thought van emmerik et al 2015 therefore we developed a coupled gfs lis system in this paper and then evaluated the impacts of ascat sm assimilation on the numerical weather forecasts from gfs over sparsely vegetated areas the descriptions of the gfs lis noah 2 7 1 and the structure of coupled gfs lis system are briefly introduced in the next section the enkf based numerical experiment focused on assimilating the ascat sm product into the developed gfs lis coupled system is documented in section 3 descriptions of input data sources and methodology are provided in section 4 based on comparisons with 2 meter minimum temperature tmin 2 meter maximum temperature tmax and 2 meter diurnal temperature range dtr from the noaa cpc climate prediction center surface air temperature analysis product and precipitation retrieved from the cpc s morphing method cmorph the coupled verification of gfs forecast is shown in section 5 discussion and a brief summary are then provided in sections 6 and 7 respectively 2 model descriptions 2 1 ncep global forecast system gfs the gfs operationally running at noaa ncep is a three dimensional hydrostatic global spectral model it uses the global data assimilation system gdas to provide guess fields for the full forecasts the gdas runs for each cycle 00 06 12 and 18 utc however to save time and space in experiments the gfs is initially set up to run only for the 00 utc cycle in this paper the gfs model version t670 is run at t254 spatial resolution that is about 35 km in gaussian projection grid dimensions 1344 at longitude by 672 at latitude the gfs produced 3 hour forecasts 168 h in advance during the may 16 30 2014 time period the vertical was divided into 47 layers with the first 37 layers ranging from 1000 mb to 100 mb with 25 mb intervals and the following 10 layers set as 70 mb 50 mb 30 mb 20 mb 10 mb 7 mb 5 mb 3 mb 2 mb and 1 mb 2 2 lis noah land surface model lis integrates the use of ground and satellite observations with well documented lsms and advanced tools to accurately characterize land surface states and fluxes kumar et al 2006 2008 to match the lsm used in gfs t670 254 the lis noah 2 7 1 model was used in this paper the noah lsm is a one dimensional soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model that has four soil layers with thicknesses of 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm from the surface ek et al 2003 the first three layers are for estimations in non forested regions while the last soil layer is for simulations in forested areas ek et al 2003 based on layer based heat diffusion standard diffusion and gravity drainage equations the noah lsm is able to model dynamics of sm and soil temperature ek et al 2003 reichle et al 2010 in this paper the lis noah 2 7 1 model was spun up by cycling 3 times through the period from 1 january 2008 to 30 april 2014 simulations for each case were conducted during the may 1 31 2014 period with half hour time step inputs and daily outputs at 25 km resolution specifically the soil temperature and sm from lis noah 2 7 1 outputs for the may 1 31 2014 period were placed into the gfs initial condition files 2 3 coupled gfs lis system the lis noah 2 7 1 outputs with and without benefits from sm assimilation were remapped from the lat lon projection at 25 km spatial resolution to a gaussian projection with respect to the spatial resolution 35 km of gfs model lis was set up to run in parallel with each gfs simulation providing updated initial land surface conditions for each 00z gfs run there the soil temperature and sm fields from lis noah were placed into the gfs initial condition files fig 1 the resulting analysis and forecast fields were finally converted to 3 hour outputs at 25 km spatial resolution in lat lon projection by the post processor in the gfs model fig 1 3 methodology of the experiment 3 1 enkf based sm data assimilation the enkf has been widely used in sequential sm data assimilation evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 based on sequential bayesian filtering and monte carlo approximation ensemble forecasts and state variables are alternately updated in enkf reichle et al 2002 forward propagation of ensemble model states is conducted using the lsm when enkf runs in the ensemble forecast step in the enkf error variances for forecast and measurement estimates vary in time and depend on the dynamics of the previous updates the kalman gain relates to forecast error covariance as in the lis examples kumar et al 2009 a 3 constant value was used to define error variances 3 2 experiment design based on the gfs lis coupled system we designed a set of numerical experiments to investigate the impacts of satellite sm assimilation on numerical weather prediction the ascat sm is expected to perform reasonably over the sparsely vegetated areas because dense forests and shrubs are generally opaque to c band radar wagner et al 2013 specifically lower backscatter variations 2 db may result in great sm retrieval uncertainties over tropical forests and densely vegetated regions wagner et al 2013 where average green vegetation fraction gvf climatologies are generally larger than 0 5 jiang et al 2010 lis provides monthly advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr normalized difference vegetation index ndvi based gvf maps this study is focused on the areas where the gvf values are less than 0 5 jiang et al 2010 over the global domain during the may 16 to 30 2014 period the basic structure of the experiments is as follows 1 the first simulation the original gfs org run is used to emphasize gfs t670 254 original performance without benefits of data assimilation and modifications on land surface parameters land cover gvf soil texture and slope 2 the second simulation the open loop olp run uses a single realization with replacement of land surface parameters including land cover gvf soil texture and slope maps consistent with those used in lis noah 2 7 1 lsm this simulation is chosen to assess the influences of different land surface parameters on gfs forecasts and in turn to highlight the impact of satellite sm data assimilation 3 the third simulation the data assimilation da run is focused on assimilating the ascat sm product into the gfs lis coupled system using the enkf because the land surface parameters in gfs are replaced as stated in the olp case the differences of the model results between da and olp cases are based only on the impact of the ascat sm data assimilation in the da case the enkf is a monte carlo method that requires an ensemble and thus perturbations are added to make ensemble members differ from each other kumar et al 2009 the input forcing data precipitation downward long and short wave radiation of the noah model are perturbed as described in table 1 kumar et al 2009 the implicit assumption is that a systematic bias in model output should not be caused by adding zero mean gaussian noise in the enkf analysis step ryu et al 2008 the variance values in the nasa lis were manually adjusted to make the normalized innovations satisfy the requirement of normal distribution for optimal simulations ensemble size of enkf was set as which is the optimal ensemble size in a sequential sm assimilation system yin et al 2015a the benefits of assimilating the ascat sm product are expected to be highlighted by the suboptimal forcing and initialization used in the da case 4 data and methodology 4 1 ascat sm product ascat is onboard the polar orbiting metop a metop b and metop c satellites it is a real aperture radar using vertically polarized antennas the nominal spatial resolution of the c band 5 255 ghz ascat is 50 km and its experimental resolution is 25 km the morning overpass time of the ascat occurs at 09 30 local time and the evening overpass occurs at 21 30 local time the ascat sm product used in this paper is developed using a time series based change detection method at the vienna university of technology wagner et al 1999 naeimi et al 2009 it yields the surface degree of saturation from 0 to 100 representing the driest and wettest observations respectively bartalis et al 2007 in this paper we employed the daily 25 km ascat sm data sets during 2008 2014 period over sparse vegetation areas where gvf values are lower than 0 5 and scaled them to the same sm climatology of the noah 2 7 1 lsm using linear transformation that is represented as koster et al 2009 1 φ ascat n o a h μ noah φ ascat μ ascat σ noah σ ascat where φ ascat noah is the re scaled ascat sm retrieval and φ ascat is the raw ascat sm retrieval μ noah σ noah and μ ascat σ ascat are the averaged sm the standard deviation for the lis noah 2 7 1 model and the ascat sm estimations over the 2008 2014 period respectively 4 2 noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product in support of various purposes including climate monitoring forecast verification and studies on climate change and on the development of regional to global scale earth system models noaa cpc has developed an operational global daily land only 2 meter temperature analysis at 50 km spatial resolution ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip wd52ws global temp the analysis is based on 6000 global telecommunication system stations around the global and covers the 1979 present period in this paper the daily tmin tmax and dtr datasets over the may 15 june 5 2016 period were used to assess the gfs forecasts the gfs lis coupled system based tmin and tmax estimations were resampled from 3 hour 25 km to daily 50 km to match the temporal and spatial resolution of the noaa cpc 2 meter temperature analysis 4 3 cmorph precipitation product the climate prediction center morphing method cmorph incorporates half hourly interval geostationary satellite based high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data the current cmorph product uses motion vectors derived from the dmsp 13 14 15 ssm i the noaa 15 16 17 18 amsu b and amsr e and tmi aboard nasa s aqua and trmm spacecraft joyce et al 2004 to generate spatially and temporally complete microwave derived precipitation analyses the precipitation intensity and shape are modified between microwave sensor scans using a time weighted linear interpolation joyce et al 2004 the 3 hourly 25 km cmorph datasets were retrieved from may 16 to june 5 2016 to assess gfs precipitation predictions in this paper 4 4 performance measures 4 4 1 rainfall forecast skill scores many skill scores have been used to evaluate the quality of rainfall forecast but a directive is an objective method of converting the predicted probability distribution into a discrete number or category gringorten 1951 vislocky and young 1988 in this study rainfall events were classified as non precipitation little rain moderate rain heavy rain or extreme rain on the basis of the thresholds of 3 hourly intensity in table 2 and the rainfall forecast skill scores s were then ranged from 0 to 5 with indicating from the worst to the best prediction performance vislocky and young 1988 with respect to the cmorph precipitation product thus estimations on the forecasting accuracy fa of the predicted non precipitation and precipitation for i j grid location are then expressed as 2 fa i j s i j 5 0 100 4 4 2 root mean square error root mean square error rmse is a widely applied measure of the differences between the model and observed variables temperature and precipitation forecasts are very important to weather warnings and human activity the predicted precipitation tmin tmax and dtr are thus verified using the observations based products in this work specifically the 3 hourly model 25 km 2 meter temperature simulations at coordinated universal utc time are resampled as daily 50 km at local time then the rmse is used to evaluate the predicted precipitation with respect to the cmorph product and verify the gfs tmin tmax and dtr forecasts with respect to the noaa cpc 2 meter temperature analysis 5 gfs forecast verification with respect to the 50 km noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 2 shows rmse differences in unit k in predicted tmin for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 forecast hour fh over 16 30 may 2014 period the blue color indicates improvement while the red color means degradation the forecasting results for the 6 fhs present similar patterns the slight differences in the predicted tmin between org and olp cases can be found in fig 2a with improvements over the small areas located in the northwestern china and degradations distributed in the northeastern canada however this situation can be clearly improved by da case in fig 2b relative to the olp run the gfs tmin predictions exhibited overwhelmingly positive responses to da run on almost the entire study domain with some improvements larger than 2 k in central australia southern india and south africa fig 2b whereas the slight degradations are mainly located over the horn of africa with respect to the noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 3 shows statistical results for the rmse values of the 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin forecasts over the may 16 30 2014 period curves shifting toward the left indicate improvements in reducing the probability of large rmse while curves shifting towards the right indicate degradations compared to the org case the accumulative probabilities of less than 3 k rmse values for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin predictions are slightly improved by 0 1 0 4 0 9 1 1 1 2 and 0 9 by olp case respectively relative to olp run da case presents a left shifting tendency with increased probability of providing lower rmse values with benefits of ascat sm assimilation the accumulative probabilities of less than 3 k rmse values for the olp run are increased by 1 3 1 0 0 8 0 7 0 9 and 0 6 for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin predictions respectively similar to fig 2 with respect to the 50 km noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 4 denotes rmse differences in predicted dtr for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh from may 16 to 30 2014 the blue color shading shows improvement yet the red color shading indicates degradation the large degradations for the olp case are observed in central asia northeastern canada and western south america fig 4a the da case yields significant improvement on dtr forecasts across the study domain in comparison to the olp case by exhibiting larger than 3 k improvements in west u s central australia south africa and central asia fig 4b the different patterns in fig 4b indicate that the da case successfully forecasts dtr in comparison to olp run and shows significant improvements over sparsely vegetated areas with respect to the noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 5 shows the study domain averaged frequency probability as a function of rmse values for dtr during the may 16 30 2014 period the statistical density function of frequency probability shifting toward the left indicates improvement while shifts toward the right indicate degradation relative to the org case the olp case exhibits marginal influences on dtr forecasts from 24 to 144 fh whereas the da case performs better with significantly shifting toward the left the olp run shows slight degradations over the org case and reductions in accumulative probabilities of rmse less than 4 k for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh dtr forecasts by 0 5 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 respectively compared to the olp run the accumulative probabilities of rmse less than 4 k for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh dtr forecasts are enhanced by 2 8 2 9 2 8 2 6 2 8 3 1 with benefits of ascat sm assimilation based on the rainfall forecast skill scores in table 1 and forecast accuracy computed according to eq 2 differences in predicted rainfall accuracy in for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh over the 16 30 may 2014 period are shown in fig 6 the blue color shading means improvement the red color shading means degradation compared to the org case the olp run presents a modest performance in northwestern sahara middle east canada and northwestern china but shows marginal improvements in northeast china and western u s fig 6a the pattern differences between olp and da cases demonstrate that the da case is successful in the northern china and northwestern sahara with showing improvements larger than 6 whereas the degradations can be seen in the north india east sahara and south africa fig 6b with respect to the 25 km cmorph precipitation product fig 7 illustrates study domain averaged frequency probability as a function of forecasting accuracy for the 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 hour precipitation and non precipitation predictions from may 16 to 30 2014 contrary to figs 3 and 5 the statistical density function of frequency probability shifting towards the left indicates degraded and shifting towards the right indiciates degradation for the 24 and 48 hour precipitation forecasts the olp case demonstrates great improvements over the org case while there are slight differences between olp and da cases however the da case yields greater improvements for 72 96 120 and 144 hour forecasts in comparison to the olp case specifically over the org case the olp case can enhance the accumulative probabilities of high quality precipitation forecasts which are defined as the forecasts that have larger than 80 accuracy by 1 4 2 2 2 7 1 6 1 8 and 1 8 for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh respectively with benefits of assimilating ascat sm retrievals the improvements for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh are 0 4 0 4 0 4 3 1 0 8 and 2 9 in comparison with the olp run respectively 6 discussion this work examined the impact of enkf based ascat sm assimilation on the forecasts of the noaa ncep gfs model over sparsely vegetated areas gvf less than 0 5 the results presented in section 5 indicate that the gfs model performs better with benefits of assimilating ascat sm data into the coupled gfs lis system the gfs lis coupled system produced 3 hour forecasts for 168 hr in advance for each day over a biweekly period thus making the sample size 112 8 three hourly forecasts day 14 day in figs 2 4 6 and 8 the statistical results shown in figs 3 5 and 7 have huge sample sizes roughly 108 with representation of the study domain averaged rmse patterns the strong consistency of results implies that the results in this paper are qualitatively stable and likely represent a longer analysis period however several limitations should be considered in interpreting this result when applying global remote sensing sm data products in numerical weather prediction models these limitations are discussed below 6 1 physical considerations in this paper clear improvements of ascat sm assimilation on gfs tmin and dtr forecasts over sahara areas can be found in figs 2 and 4 however the obvious degradations of assimilating ascat sm product on tmax predictions in the sahara areas are exhibited in fig 8 on one hand the results show that the ascat retrievals should include useful information in their seasonal cycle and anomaly signals over sand areas which can utilize the model sm increments to correct tmin and dtr simulations on the other hand however further improvements on ascat sm product over sand areas are expected to address noise reduction previous studies indicate that the weather forecast model generally performs better at nighttime than daytime due to the benefits of ascat sm assimilation dharssi et al 2011 schneider et al 2014 the results in this paper demonstrated this very clearly the non hydraulic equilibrium of the soil may lead to decoupling occurrence during the daytime leroux et al 2014 while the remotely sensed sm retrievals are generally closer to the ground measurements during the nighttime albergel et al 2009 leroux et al 2014 thus ascat sm data of descending orbits a m perform better than that of ascending orbits p m wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2009 additionally the daily ascat sm product was assimilated into the lis noah model at 00z of each day and then lis was set up to run in parallel with each gfs simulation providing updated initial land surface condition for each 00z gfs run fig 1 there the soil temperature and sm fields from lis noah were placed into the gfs initial condition files benefits of assimilating the ascat sm product were thus directly used for the first 6 hour gdas guess cycle and the tmin generally showed during the 00z 06z time the tmax generally showed during the 12z 18z time during the third gdas cycle runs positive information with benefits of data assimilation might be reduced when propagating from the first gdas cycle to the third gdas cycle meanwhile model uncertainties generally tend to increase in the long term however the significant improvements on tmin and dtr forecasts over the global domain potentially overshadow the degradations on tmax estimations in the sahara region 6 2 impacts of land surface parameters in noah lsm vegetation information from land cover and gvf directly affects energy and water balances chen and dudhia 2001 yin et al 2015c 2016 and the hydraulic conductivity in noah model is associated with soil variables including soil texture and slop chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 due to the differences of the land surface parameters including land cover gvf soil texture and slope there are distinct differences in forecasts between the org and olp cases the olp and da cases are thus driven by the same land surface parameters to ensure the model output differences only come from turning on off the ascat sm data assimilation 6 3 additional future work the current operational gfs version t1534 at ncep is a global numerical weather prediction system at a base horizontal resolution of 12 km grid dimensions 3072 at longitude by 1536 at latitude in gaussian projection which is higher than the t670 254 used in this paper but their dynamical cores and mathematical processes of producing forecast outputs are consistent the operational gfs t1534 performance is thus expected to be improved with the benefits of ascat sm data assimilation however the revisit time of ascat is 2 3 days compared to the ascat soil moisture operational products system smops developed at noaa nesdis provides a near real time operational global blend of all available microwave soil moisture retrievals on a daily basis yin et al 2015a 2019 building on the reasonable quality control of the blended sm retrievals yin et al 2014 it can be expected to extend the improvements on gfs model performance from sparse vegetation areas to the entire global domain with benefits from the assimilation of the near real time smops blended sm data in near future 7 conclusions with the development of the coupled gfs lis system in this paper three numerical experiments were carried out to examine the impacts of assimilating satellite soil moisture data into numerical weather prediction models the 2 meter minimum temperature and 2 meter diurnal temperature range forecasts with benefits of ascat soil moisture assimilation are closer to the observations with high quality forecast probability showing improvements of 1 7 and 3 1 respectively positive impacts of assimilating ascat soil moisture product on precipitation predictions are also found with the study domain averaged probability of high quality forecasts improved as much as 3 1 based on the results assimilating remotely sensed soil

6103,recent research has shown that assimilating satellite soil moisture sm retrievals into the land surface models lsms improves simulations of land atmosphere water and energy exchanges with satellite sm retrievals becoming widely and continuously available it is desirable to examine the impact of assimilating them into numerical weather prediction models in order to improve numerical weather forecast skills based on the development of the coupled system of national centers for environmental prediction ncep global forecast system gfs and national aeronautics and space administration nasa land information system lis in this paper we designed an experiment to demonstrate the impacts of assimilating the advanced scatterometer ascat sm data products on the weather forecasts of gfs with respect to the surface air temperature analysis product of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc and cpc s morphing method based precipitation data improvement from the ascat sm assimilation for probabilities of high quality forecasts can reach up to 1 7 for gfs precipitation 3 1 for 2 meter minimum temperature and 3 1 for 2 meter diurnal temperature range predictions respectively these results suggest that satellite sm data assimilation could be beneficial for gfs numerical weather forecasts of noaa ncep keywords data assimilation soil moisture numerical weather prediction ascat global forecast system 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important variable for regional and global numerical weather prediction models that impacts the energy and water exchanges between land surface and the atmosphere koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 zhan et al 2012 yin et al 2015c 2016 currently a number of microwave satellite sm products are operationally generated with certain accuracy naeimi et al 2009 kerr et al 2010 jones et al 2010 entekhabi et al 2010 li et al 2010 parinussa et al 2014 yin et al 2014 yin et al 2015a b it is thus desirable to examine the impacts of assimilating satellite sm retrievals into weather prediction models and in turn improve numerical weather forecast skills several global weather forecast centers are currently assimilating or testing the assimilation of remotely sensed sm observations ongoing research at the european centre for medium range weather forecasts has shown positive impacts from the assimilation of remote sensing sm data drusch and viterbo 2007 scipal et al 2008 de rosnay et al 2013 building on the extended kalman filter and the offline joint uk land environment simulator land surface model lsm a new land data assimilation system was developed by the uk met office aiming to correctly propagate surface information to deeper soil layers using remote sensing observations dharssi et al 2010 however research related to data assimilation of satellite sm at the national centers for environmental prediction ncep of national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in the us has only recently begun the global forecast system gfs of ncep is an important numerical weather prediction model that provides medium range weather forecasts for each gfs run a set of initial values of system state variables including sm is required for the sm state variable the current gfs version uses estimates that are provided by previous gfs forecasts because of uncertainties associated with precipitation estimates and other meteorological forcing data for the noah lsm initial values used for the gfs runs may not represent the true sm information which may contribute to downstream errors in gfs forecasts it is thus desirable to maximize the impacts of satellite sm products in an advanced data assimilation system meanwhile the nasa lis land information system offers a framework to develop a generic sequential data assimilation subsystem kumar et al 2006 2008 in particular the lis includes effective tools such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf that is widely used for sequential assimilation of hydrologic variables evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 several remote sensing sm products from passive and active microwave satellite sensors have been developed to address issues in the in situ sm observations resulting from sparse spatial distributions recent studies indicate that sm retrievals from advanced scatterometer ascat on board the meteorological operation metop satellite program bartalis et al 2007 are comparable to passive sm retrievals liu et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 the ascat provides continuous and reliable long term sm service with retrievals from metop a launched in october 2006 metop b launched in september 2012 wagner et al 2013 and metop c launched in november 2018 however there are typically large uncertainties in sm retrievals from densely vegetated areas due to the robust impacts of vegetation structure and water content in particular backscatter for active c band sensors such as ascat is impacted by diurnal variations in vegetation water content more strongly than previously thought van emmerik et al 2015 therefore we developed a coupled gfs lis system in this paper and then evaluated the impacts of ascat sm assimilation on the numerical weather forecasts from gfs over sparsely vegetated areas the descriptions of the gfs lis noah 2 7 1 and the structure of coupled gfs lis system are briefly introduced in the next section the enkf based numerical experiment focused on assimilating the ascat sm product into the developed gfs lis coupled system is documented in section 3 descriptions of input data sources and methodology are provided in section 4 based on comparisons with 2 meter minimum temperature tmin 2 meter maximum temperature tmax and 2 meter diurnal temperature range dtr from the noaa cpc climate prediction center surface air temperature analysis product and precipitation retrieved from the cpc s morphing method cmorph the coupled verification of gfs forecast is shown in section 5 discussion and a brief summary are then provided in sections 6 and 7 respectively 2 model descriptions 2 1 ncep global forecast system gfs the gfs operationally running at noaa ncep is a three dimensional hydrostatic global spectral model it uses the global data assimilation system gdas to provide guess fields for the full forecasts the gdas runs for each cycle 00 06 12 and 18 utc however to save time and space in experiments the gfs is initially set up to run only for the 00 utc cycle in this paper the gfs model version t670 is run at t254 spatial resolution that is about 35 km in gaussian projection grid dimensions 1344 at longitude by 672 at latitude the gfs produced 3 hour forecasts 168 h in advance during the may 16 30 2014 time period the vertical was divided into 47 layers with the first 37 layers ranging from 1000 mb to 100 mb with 25 mb intervals and the following 10 layers set as 70 mb 50 mb 30 mb 20 mb 10 mb 7 mb 5 mb 3 mb 2 mb and 1 mb 2 2 lis noah land surface model lis integrates the use of ground and satellite observations with well documented lsms and advanced tools to accurately characterize land surface states and fluxes kumar et al 2006 2008 to match the lsm used in gfs t670 254 the lis noah 2 7 1 model was used in this paper the noah lsm is a one dimensional soil vegetation atmosphere transfer model that has four soil layers with thicknesses of 10 cm 30 cm 60 cm and 100 cm from the surface ek et al 2003 the first three layers are for estimations in non forested regions while the last soil layer is for simulations in forested areas ek et al 2003 based on layer based heat diffusion standard diffusion and gravity drainage equations the noah lsm is able to model dynamics of sm and soil temperature ek et al 2003 reichle et al 2010 in this paper the lis noah 2 7 1 model was spun up by cycling 3 times through the period from 1 january 2008 to 30 april 2014 simulations for each case were conducted during the may 1 31 2014 period with half hour time step inputs and daily outputs at 25 km resolution specifically the soil temperature and sm from lis noah 2 7 1 outputs for the may 1 31 2014 period were placed into the gfs initial condition files 2 3 coupled gfs lis system the lis noah 2 7 1 outputs with and without benefits from sm assimilation were remapped from the lat lon projection at 25 km spatial resolution to a gaussian projection with respect to the spatial resolution 35 km of gfs model lis was set up to run in parallel with each gfs simulation providing updated initial land surface conditions for each 00z gfs run there the soil temperature and sm fields from lis noah were placed into the gfs initial condition files fig 1 the resulting analysis and forecast fields were finally converted to 3 hour outputs at 25 km spatial resolution in lat lon projection by the post processor in the gfs model fig 1 3 methodology of the experiment 3 1 enkf based sm data assimilation the enkf has been widely used in sequential sm data assimilation evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 based on sequential bayesian filtering and monte carlo approximation ensemble forecasts and state variables are alternately updated in enkf reichle et al 2002 forward propagation of ensemble model states is conducted using the lsm when enkf runs in the ensemble forecast step in the enkf error variances for forecast and measurement estimates vary in time and depend on the dynamics of the previous updates the kalman gain relates to forecast error covariance as in the lis examples kumar et al 2009 a 3 constant value was used to define error variances 3 2 experiment design based on the gfs lis coupled system we designed a set of numerical experiments to investigate the impacts of satellite sm assimilation on numerical weather prediction the ascat sm is expected to perform reasonably over the sparsely vegetated areas because dense forests and shrubs are generally opaque to c band radar wagner et al 2013 specifically lower backscatter variations 2 db may result in great sm retrieval uncertainties over tropical forests and densely vegetated regions wagner et al 2013 where average green vegetation fraction gvf climatologies are generally larger than 0 5 jiang et al 2010 lis provides monthly advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr normalized difference vegetation index ndvi based gvf maps this study is focused on the areas where the gvf values are less than 0 5 jiang et al 2010 over the global domain during the may 16 to 30 2014 period the basic structure of the experiments is as follows 1 the first simulation the original gfs org run is used to emphasize gfs t670 254 original performance without benefits of data assimilation and modifications on land surface parameters land cover gvf soil texture and slope 2 the second simulation the open loop olp run uses a single realization with replacement of land surface parameters including land cover gvf soil texture and slope maps consistent with those used in lis noah 2 7 1 lsm this simulation is chosen to assess the influences of different land surface parameters on gfs forecasts and in turn to highlight the impact of satellite sm data assimilation 3 the third simulation the data assimilation da run is focused on assimilating the ascat sm product into the gfs lis coupled system using the enkf because the land surface parameters in gfs are replaced as stated in the olp case the differences of the model results between da and olp cases are based only on the impact of the ascat sm data assimilation in the da case the enkf is a monte carlo method that requires an ensemble and thus perturbations are added to make ensemble members differ from each other kumar et al 2009 the input forcing data precipitation downward long and short wave radiation of the noah model are perturbed as described in table 1 kumar et al 2009 the implicit assumption is that a systematic bias in model output should not be caused by adding zero mean gaussian noise in the enkf analysis step ryu et al 2008 the variance values in the nasa lis were manually adjusted to make the normalized innovations satisfy the requirement of normal distribution for optimal simulations ensemble size of enkf was set as which is the optimal ensemble size in a sequential sm assimilation system yin et al 2015a the benefits of assimilating the ascat sm product are expected to be highlighted by the suboptimal forcing and initialization used in the da case 4 data and methodology 4 1 ascat sm product ascat is onboard the polar orbiting metop a metop b and metop c satellites it is a real aperture radar using vertically polarized antennas the nominal spatial resolution of the c band 5 255 ghz ascat is 50 km and its experimental resolution is 25 km the morning overpass time of the ascat occurs at 09 30 local time and the evening overpass occurs at 21 30 local time the ascat sm product used in this paper is developed using a time series based change detection method at the vienna university of technology wagner et al 1999 naeimi et al 2009 it yields the surface degree of saturation from 0 to 100 representing the driest and wettest observations respectively bartalis et al 2007 in this paper we employed the daily 25 km ascat sm data sets during 2008 2014 period over sparse vegetation areas where gvf values are lower than 0 5 and scaled them to the same sm climatology of the noah 2 7 1 lsm using linear transformation that is represented as koster et al 2009 1 φ ascat n o a h μ noah φ ascat μ ascat σ noah σ ascat where φ ascat noah is the re scaled ascat sm retrieval and φ ascat is the raw ascat sm retrieval μ noah σ noah and μ ascat σ ascat are the averaged sm the standard deviation for the lis noah 2 7 1 model and the ascat sm estimations over the 2008 2014 period respectively 4 2 noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product in support of various purposes including climate monitoring forecast verification and studies on climate change and on the development of regional to global scale earth system models noaa cpc has developed an operational global daily land only 2 meter temperature analysis at 50 km spatial resolution ftp ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip wd52ws global temp the analysis is based on 6000 global telecommunication system stations around the global and covers the 1979 present period in this paper the daily tmin tmax and dtr datasets over the may 15 june 5 2016 period were used to assess the gfs forecasts the gfs lis coupled system based tmin and tmax estimations were resampled from 3 hour 25 km to daily 50 km to match the temporal and spatial resolution of the noaa cpc 2 meter temperature analysis 4 3 cmorph precipitation product the climate prediction center morphing method cmorph incorporates half hourly interval geostationary satellite based high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data the current cmorph product uses motion vectors derived from the dmsp 13 14 15 ssm i the noaa 15 16 17 18 amsu b and amsr e and tmi aboard nasa s aqua and trmm spacecraft joyce et al 2004 to generate spatially and temporally complete microwave derived precipitation analyses the precipitation intensity and shape are modified between microwave sensor scans using a time weighted linear interpolation joyce et al 2004 the 3 hourly 25 km cmorph datasets were retrieved from may 16 to june 5 2016 to assess gfs precipitation predictions in this paper 4 4 performance measures 4 4 1 rainfall forecast skill scores many skill scores have been used to evaluate the quality of rainfall forecast but a directive is an objective method of converting the predicted probability distribution into a discrete number or category gringorten 1951 vislocky and young 1988 in this study rainfall events were classified as non precipitation little rain moderate rain heavy rain or extreme rain on the basis of the thresholds of 3 hourly intensity in table 2 and the rainfall forecast skill scores s were then ranged from 0 to 5 with indicating from the worst to the best prediction performance vislocky and young 1988 with respect to the cmorph precipitation product thus estimations on the forecasting accuracy fa of the predicted non precipitation and precipitation for i j grid location are then expressed as 2 fa i j s i j 5 0 100 4 4 2 root mean square error root mean square error rmse is a widely applied measure of the differences between the model and observed variables temperature and precipitation forecasts are very important to weather warnings and human activity the predicted precipitation tmin tmax and dtr are thus verified using the observations based products in this work specifically the 3 hourly model 25 km 2 meter temperature simulations at coordinated universal utc time are resampled as daily 50 km at local time then the rmse is used to evaluate the predicted precipitation with respect to the cmorph product and verify the gfs tmin tmax and dtr forecasts with respect to the noaa cpc 2 meter temperature analysis 5 gfs forecast verification with respect to the 50 km noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 2 shows rmse differences in unit k in predicted tmin for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 forecast hour fh over 16 30 may 2014 period the blue color indicates improvement while the red color means degradation the forecasting results for the 6 fhs present similar patterns the slight differences in the predicted tmin between org and olp cases can be found in fig 2a with improvements over the small areas located in the northwestern china and degradations distributed in the northeastern canada however this situation can be clearly improved by da case in fig 2b relative to the olp run the gfs tmin predictions exhibited overwhelmingly positive responses to da run on almost the entire study domain with some improvements larger than 2 k in central australia southern india and south africa fig 2b whereas the slight degradations are mainly located over the horn of africa with respect to the noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 3 shows statistical results for the rmse values of the 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin forecasts over the may 16 30 2014 period curves shifting toward the left indicate improvements in reducing the probability of large rmse while curves shifting towards the right indicate degradations compared to the org case the accumulative probabilities of less than 3 k rmse values for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin predictions are slightly improved by 0 1 0 4 0 9 1 1 1 2 and 0 9 by olp case respectively relative to olp run da case presents a left shifting tendency with increased probability of providing lower rmse values with benefits of ascat sm assimilation the accumulative probabilities of less than 3 k rmse values for the olp run are increased by 1 3 1 0 0 8 0 7 0 9 and 0 6 for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh tmin predictions respectively similar to fig 2 with respect to the 50 km noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 4 denotes rmse differences in predicted dtr for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh from may 16 to 30 2014 the blue color shading shows improvement yet the red color shading indicates degradation the large degradations for the olp case are observed in central asia northeastern canada and western south america fig 4a the da case yields significant improvement on dtr forecasts across the study domain in comparison to the olp case by exhibiting larger than 3 k improvements in west u s central australia south africa and central asia fig 4b the different patterns in fig 4b indicate that the da case successfully forecasts dtr in comparison to olp run and shows significant improvements over sparsely vegetated areas with respect to the noaa cpc surface air temperature analysis product fig 5 shows the study domain averaged frequency probability as a function of rmse values for dtr during the may 16 30 2014 period the statistical density function of frequency probability shifting toward the left indicates improvement while shifts toward the right indicate degradation relative to the org case the olp case exhibits marginal influences on dtr forecasts from 24 to 144 fh whereas the da case performs better with significantly shifting toward the left the olp run shows slight degradations over the org case and reductions in accumulative probabilities of rmse less than 4 k for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh dtr forecasts by 0 5 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 respectively compared to the olp run the accumulative probabilities of rmse less than 4 k for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh dtr forecasts are enhanced by 2 8 2 9 2 8 2 6 2 8 3 1 with benefits of ascat sm assimilation based on the rainfall forecast skill scores in table 1 and forecast accuracy computed according to eq 2 differences in predicted rainfall accuracy in for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh over the 16 30 may 2014 period are shown in fig 6 the blue color shading means improvement the red color shading means degradation compared to the org case the olp run presents a modest performance in northwestern sahara middle east canada and northwestern china but shows marginal improvements in northeast china and western u s fig 6a the pattern differences between olp and da cases demonstrate that the da case is successful in the northern china and northwestern sahara with showing improvements larger than 6 whereas the degradations can be seen in the north india east sahara and south africa fig 6b with respect to the 25 km cmorph precipitation product fig 7 illustrates study domain averaged frequency probability as a function of forecasting accuracy for the 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 hour precipitation and non precipitation predictions from may 16 to 30 2014 contrary to figs 3 and 5 the statistical density function of frequency probability shifting towards the left indicates degraded and shifting towards the right indiciates degradation for the 24 and 48 hour precipitation forecasts the olp case demonstrates great improvements over the org case while there are slight differences between olp and da cases however the da case yields greater improvements for 72 96 120 and 144 hour forecasts in comparison to the olp case specifically over the org case the olp case can enhance the accumulative probabilities of high quality precipitation forecasts which are defined as the forecasts that have larger than 80 accuracy by 1 4 2 2 2 7 1 6 1 8 and 1 8 for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh respectively with benefits of assimilating ascat sm retrievals the improvements for 24 48 72 96 120 and 144 fh are 0 4 0 4 0 4 3 1 0 8 and 2 9 in comparison with the olp run respectively 6 discussion this work examined the impact of enkf based ascat sm assimilation on the forecasts of the noaa ncep gfs model over sparsely vegetated areas gvf less than 0 5 the results presented in section 5 indicate that the gfs model performs better with benefits of assimilating ascat sm data into the coupled gfs lis system the gfs lis coupled system produced 3 hour forecasts for 168 hr in advance for each day over a biweekly period thus making the sample size 112 8 three hourly forecasts day 14 day in figs 2 4 6 and 8 the statistical results shown in figs 3 5 and 7 have huge sample sizes roughly 108 with representation of the study domain averaged rmse patterns the strong consistency of results implies that the results in this paper are qualitatively stable and likely represent a longer analysis period however several limitations should be considered in interpreting this result when applying global remote sensing sm data products in numerical weather prediction models these limitations are discussed below 6 1 physical considerations in this paper clear improvements of ascat sm assimilation on gfs tmin and dtr forecasts over sahara areas can be found in figs 2 and 4 however the obvious degradations of assimilating ascat sm product on tmax predictions in the sahara areas are exhibited in fig 8 on one hand the results show that the ascat retrievals should include useful information in their seasonal cycle and anomaly signals over sand areas which can utilize the model sm increments to correct tmin and dtr simulations on the other hand however further improvements on ascat sm product over sand areas are expected to address noise reduction previous studies indicate that the weather forecast model generally performs better at nighttime than daytime due to the benefits of ascat sm assimilation dharssi et al 2011 schneider et al 2014 the results in this paper demonstrated this very clearly the non hydraulic equilibrium of the soil may lead to decoupling occurrence during the daytime leroux et al 2014 while the remotely sensed sm retrievals are generally closer to the ground measurements during the nighttime albergel et al 2009 leroux et al 2014 thus ascat sm data of descending orbits a m perform better than that of ascending orbits p m wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2009 additionally the daily ascat sm product was assimilated into the lis noah model at 00z of each day and then lis was set up to run in parallel with each gfs simulation providing updated initial land surface condition for each 00z gfs run fig 1 there the soil temperature and sm fields from lis noah were placed into the gfs initial condition files benefits of assimilating the ascat sm product were thus directly used for the first 6 hour gdas guess cycle and the tmin generally showed during the 00z 06z time the tmax generally showed during the 12z 18z time during the third gdas cycle runs positive information with benefits of data assimilation might be reduced when propagating from the first gdas cycle to the third gdas cycle meanwhile model uncertainties generally tend to increase in the long term however the significant improvements on tmin and dtr forecasts over the global domain potentially overshadow the degradations on tmax estimations in the sahara region 6 2 impacts of land surface parameters in noah lsm vegetation information from land cover and gvf directly affects energy and water balances chen and dudhia 2001 yin et al 2015c 2016 and the hydraulic conductivity in noah model is associated with soil variables including soil texture and slop chen and dudhia 2001 ek et al 2003 due to the differences of the land surface parameters including land cover gvf soil texture and slope there are distinct differences in forecasts between the org and olp cases the olp and da cases are thus driven by the same land surface parameters to ensure the model output differences only come from turning on off the ascat sm data assimilation 6 3 additional future work the current operational gfs version t1534 at ncep is a global numerical weather prediction system at a base horizontal resolution of 12 km grid dimensions 3072 at longitude by 1536 at latitude in gaussian projection which is higher than the t670 254 used in this paper but their dynamical cores and mathematical processes of producing forecast outputs are consistent the operational gfs t1534 performance is thus expected to be improved with the benefits of ascat sm data assimilation however the revisit time of ascat is 2 3 days compared to the ascat soil moisture operational products system smops developed at noaa nesdis provides a near real time operational global blend of all available microwave soil moisture retrievals on a daily basis yin et al 2015a 2019 building on the reasonable quality control of the blended sm retrievals yin et al 2014 it can be expected to extend the improvements on gfs model performance from sparse vegetation areas to the entire global domain with benefits from the assimilation of the near real time smops blended sm data in near future 7 conclusions with the development of the coupled gfs lis system in this paper three numerical experiments were carried out to examine the impacts of assimilating satellite soil moisture data into numerical weather prediction models the 2 meter minimum temperature and 2 meter diurnal temperature range forecasts with benefits of ascat soil moisture assimilation are closer to the observations with high quality forecast probability showing improvements of 1 7 and 3 1 respectively positive impacts of assimilating ascat soil moisture product on precipitation predictions are also found with the study domain averaged probability of high quality forecasts improved as much as 3 1 based on the results assimilating remotely sensed soil

6104,understanding response of temporal distribution timing frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall to warming is important in water resources management in this paper relative entropy is used to investigate the spatial variability and change in uniformity of rainfall distribution over india temporal trends in atmospheric temperature can alter the frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall events which influence the uniformity of rainfall distribution the study is divided into two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 based on time trend in annual mean temperature the sensitivity of rainfall uniformity and high and low intensity rainfall events to annual mean temperature and the degree of coherence between them are investigated the uniformity of rainfall distribution shows a significant spatial variability significant changes are observed in both the amount and timing of rainfall across india a significant association between rainfall uniformity and low intensity of rainfall is observed in the recent past over a larger aerial extent compared to the distant past it is concluded that rise in temperature modifies both high and low intensity rainfall events thus altering the uniformity in rainfall distribution a regionally varied strength of coherence between rainfall uniformity and high and low intensity rainfall is observed which may be due to regionally dependent soil moisture precipitation feedbacks keywords relative entropy rainfall uniformity temperature trend india 1 introduction variability in the temporal characteristics of rainfall poses serious implications to ecosystem functioning eg kumar 2013 rohr et al 2013 austin et al 2004 guan et al 2018 kumar 2007 vegetation dynamics duveiller et al 2018 xu et al 2018 state of the hydrological system berghuijs et al 2014 dev 2012 regional hydro climatology huang et al 2016 carré cheddadi 2017 hettiarachchi et al 2019 as well as planning and decisions related to sustainable water management ceglar et al 2017 roxy 2017 the dynamics of rainfall characteristics depend on numerous factors including large scale atmospheric processes naidu et al 2017 sun et al 2017 warming at regional and global scales putnam broecker 2017 sun et al 2017 and land sea temperature gradients jin wang 2017 roxy 2017 roxy et al 2015 changes in these large scale and regional governing processes can alter the number of rainy days and temporal uniformity of the rainfall for example periods of prolonged dry spell will reduce the temporal uniformity of distribution of rainfall a major objective of the study reported in this paper is to examine the change in such uniformity in rainfall in india over the past few decades for this purpose the uniformity in distribution of rainfall is defined as the proximity of the distribution to a uniform distribution and provides a measure of how uniformly the daily rainfall is distributed within the year it may be noted that inter annual variability and uniformity are two conceptually different aspects of rainfall characteristics while inter annual variability deals with year to year variation of rainfall the concept of uniformity as used in this paper refers to the distribution of rainfall within a year the uniformity in distribution of rainfall is governed by both exogenous and endogenous factors rajah et al 2014 molnar et al 2015 rajah et al 2014 throw light on the mechanism of how the temporal uniformity of rainfall is affected by changing frequencies of low and high intensity rainfall events and their drivers influenced by rise in temperature they also conclude that warming not only modifies the characteristics of high intensity rainfall events but also affects low intensity events that have a significant potential to modulate the temporal uniformity of rainfall the exogenous factors such as regional land surface warming and large scale climate forcing like enso el nino southern oscillations play an important role in changes in the uniformity of rainfall by modulating the endogenous characteristics of rainfall pattern sahany et al 2018 the endogenous factors such as frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall are also affected by exogenous factors like increase in atmospheric temperature thus altering the pattern of uniformity in rainfall fig 1 presents a hypothetical example of association between uniformity and rainfall intensity in a hypothetical situation higher uniformity low value of relative entropy in rainfall distribution is observed if only low intensity rainfall events occur in a year fig 1a lower uniformity high value of relative entropy is observed when only high intensity rainfall events with lower frequency than that of low intensity events occur fig 1b the formulation of relative entropy is given in section 3 1 in real situations more complex changes in the uniformity take place when frequency and magnitude of both high and low intensity rainfall events are altered as shown in fig 1c these changes in the uniformity in rainfall due to exogenous and endogenous factors under changing climatic conditions in india are rarely studied the specific objectives of this study are 1 to examine the spatiotemporal variation of the degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution across the ten zones of india details in section 2 2 to detect changes in the timing and amount of rainfall and 3 to investigate the controls of low and high intensity rainfall events on degree of uniformity of rainfall subjected to regional annual mean temperature amt two historical time windows 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 are considered to investigate the objectives the period of available data 1951 2010 is divided into two equal parts 1951 1980 30 years and 1981 2010 30 years dividing the dataset into two equal time windows will help in minimising the effect of bias in sample size sharma and mujumdar 2017 found that the characteristics of rainfall and other extremes lead to substantial concurrence of heatwaves and droughts during 1981 2010 with respect to 1951 1980 as changes in relative entropy affects the duration and frequency of rainfall characteristics it can help in describing the time evolution of droughts and other events related to rainfall the info theoretic measure relative entropy re is used to quantify the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall feng et al 2013 pascale et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 the seasonality index introduced by feng et al 2013 is a product of re and normalised annual rainfall which needs information on re and rainfall to fully describe the index whereas in this study only re is used to infer about the uniformity of rainfall distribution the timing and amount of rainfall are determined from the annual rainfall distribution whereas the controls of low and high intensity rainfall on re are analysed using quantile regression and spearman s rank correlation conditioned on amt the remaining part of the paper is divided into four sections section 2 deals with study area and data used to approach the research objectives section 3 is devoted to the discussion of methodologies adopted for the analysis results and discussions based on the analysis are provided in section 4 section 5 summarises the conclusions and limitations of the present work 2 study area and data the study area consists of the mainland india bounded between 8 4 and 37 6 north latitude and 68 7 to 97 25 east longitude it receives about 80 of the total annual rainfall during june to september due to the south west monsoon the spatial variation of mean annual rainfall is shown in fig 2 a the mainland india is divided into ten zones fig 2b with approximately uniform climatic characteristics in a zone pathak et al 2014 the zones are classified in such a way that each zone has unique hydroclimatic conditions and maximum land area coverage the latitude and longitude of these zones are given in table s1 in supporting information the high resolution 0 25 0 25 daily rainfall dataset prepared by india meteorological department imd for the period 1951 2010 pai et al 2014 is used in this study daily rainfall data from 6955 stations were used in the preparation of this high resolution gridded rainfall dataset through spatial interpolation by applying inverse distance weighted scheme shepard 1968 this dataset is comparable with the existing aphrodite and other imd products in terms of climatological as well as variability features of indian rainfall vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the daily maximum and minimum air temperature dataset prepared by national climate centre ncc imd at 1 1 spatial resolution for the period 1951 2010 srivastava et al 2009 are used in this study the observed data from 395 quality controlled stations were used to prepare the gridded dataset using modified shepard s angular distance weighing algorithm the original temperature dataset was re gridded to the resolution 0 25 0 25 of the rainfall dataset by bilinear interpolation amt was constructed by taking an average of annual mean temperature of all the grid cells within each zone the details of the trend analysis and significance of amt are shown in fig s1 and table s2 in supporting information in this study annual mean temperature amt is considered instead of annual maximum and or minimum temperature the annual maximum and or minimum temperature may be used as more effective forcings for rainfall extremes the focus of the work is on uniformity of rainfall distribution within a year rather than the occurrence of extremes moreover the annual mean temperature includes the signature of both annual maximum and annual minimum temperatures and therefore considered more appropriate variable for analysing rainfall uniformity 3 methodology in this section the methodology used for addressing the research objectives is discussed the analysis is performed for two time windows each of 30 years 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 3 1 degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution relative entropy relative entropy re is an information theoretic measure to determine the distance between two probability distributions in this paper re serves as a measure of the degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution if the observed rainfall distribution is compared with a uniform distribution let p 1 p 2 p n be the values of the daily observed rainfall where n 365 or 366 depending on normal or leap year respectively if p i 1 n p i is the total rainfall in a year then the ratio p i p i p can be regarded as daily fraction of annual rainfall let q m be the rainfall on day m from a uniform rainfall sequence that assumes a constant value of 1 365 and 1 366 for normal year and leap year respectively for all m 1 2 n therefore the degree of uniformity of rainfall measured as re feng et al 2013 is given by 1 re i 1 n p i log 2 p i q m the maximum value of re is achieved when all the rainfall is concentrated on a single day then p i 1 and re log 2 n log 2 365 8 511 or re log 2 n l o g 2 366 8 515 for a non leap year or leap year respectively the minimum value of re is zero when the rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year in the analysis the fact that p i log 2 p i q m 0 when p i 0 is used re is thus a measure of how uniformly rainfall is distributed throughout the year and a high value of re indicates that the rainfall is unevenly distributed in a year re is a robust measure and can be used to infer the effective number of wet days in a year pascale et al 2015 the effective number of wet days nwd is related to re as follows 2 nwd n 2 r e where n assumes a value of 365 or 366 depending on the year under consideration is a normal year or a leap year respectively 3 2 timing and amount of rainfall percentile approach in order to understand the changes in the timing and the corresponding amount of rainfall percentile based approach is adopted the day of the year and the corresponding rainfall amount for 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile of the total annual rainfall are estimated following pryor schoof 2008 for each grid within each zone respectively these percentiles indicate the cumulative fraction of total annual rainfall received the changes in the mean and standard deviation of these metrics are analyzed for the two time windows at each grid using two sample t test and two sample f test respectively at 5 significance level 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 detection of change in distribution two sample anderson darling test identification and detection of change in the distribution of re and its sensitivity to high and low intensity rainfall conditioned on amt for each grid in different zones are of immense significance as such a change indicates a shift in rainfall regimes and sensitivity of uniformity of rainfall in this work the two sample anderson darling test is used to detect the change in the distribution of re across two time windows 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 respectively the two sample anderson darling test is more robust to changes in distribution in terms of shift scale symmetry and distribution having same mean and standard deviation but differ in the tails when compared with the popular test kolmogorov smirnoff test engmann cousineau 2011 moreover the test needs fewer data to reach sufficient statistical power and has type i error rate corresponding to significance level in compare to kolmogorov smirnoff test engmann cousineau 2011 the matlab function prepared by trujillo ortiz et al 2007 is used for the analysis 3 3 2 controls of low and high intensity rainfall on re linear regression deals with modeling conditional mean of the response variable whereas quantile regression models the different quantiles of the response variable and provides a more comprehensive behavior of response variable with respect to the covariates wasko sharma 2014 let the ranks of the pair x i y i are denoted as r x i r y i for i 1 2 n therefore the spearman rank correlation coefficient neter et al 1996 denoted by ρ y x is given by following expression 3 ρ y x i 1 n r x i r x r y i r y i 1 n r x i r x 2 j 1 n r y j r y 2 where r x and r y are the mean ranks of r x i and r y i respectively ρ y x is bounded between 1 to 1 and it measure the association between two variables using monotonic function a two sided t test is used to assess the significance of the association understanding the complex interactions between re and low and high intensity rainfall events under the influence of increased temperature remains an important issue as it helps in revealing the underlying governing processes that control the behaviour of re in this study partial correlation coefficient based on spearman rank correlation principle are used to infer these conditional associations the partial correlation coefficient can be expressed in terms of spearman rank correlation coefficient as follows 4 ρ y x z ρ y x ρ y z ρ x z 1 ρ y z 2 1 ρ x z 2 let x i y i be the pair of data where y and x are the dependent and independent variables respectively the p th quantile regression model is given as 5 y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i ε i where 0 p 1 and ε i is an error with zero mean the model parameters β 0 y x p and β 1 y x p are estimated by minimizing the absolute deviation ad of errors weighted by p as follows 6 a d β 0 y x p β 1 y x p p y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i 1 p y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i the two indices used in this study to refer the proportion of low and high intensity rainfall events to annual rainfall are rlowtot and r95ptot respectively according to imd guidelines http imd gov in section nhac termglossary pdf the range of low intensity rainfall is between 0 1 and 7 5 mm the index rlowtot measures the fraction of low intensity rainfall amount to annual rainfall and it assume values in the range of 0 if no low intensity rainfall event occurs in a year to 1 if all the rainfall events are in the range of low intensity similarly the high intensity rainfall index is given by r95ptot which indicates the fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rainfall which is higher than the 95th percentile of rainfall during the base period of 1961 1990 karl et al 1999 these indices are estimated for each grid of different zones under consideration in this paper the variables re r95ptot rlowtot are used as dependent variables and amt is used as an independent variable for quantile regression analysis the association among quantile regression coefficients resulting from the analyses are investigated using spearman rank correlation the schematic workflow for estimating quantile regression coefficients and their association are shown in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of degree of uniformity the spatiotemporal dynamics of the degree of uniformity of rainfall for india was estimated by re it was applied to each grid of size 0 25 0 25 for 1951 2010 and the time series of re for a particular grid depicts the history of temporal evolution of uniformity in rainfall distribution this approach is applied to all the grid cells across mainland india the histogram of the mean re across india is shown in fig 4 the spatial variability of re across all zones is determined by taking the 5th and 95th percentiles of re along with its mean value across spaces the temporal evolution of the spatial variability of re is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that zones 1 and 2 have a higher spatial variability whereas zones 5 and 6 show lower spatial variability as compared to other zones moreover zone 6 shows lowest range of variability in re which suggests a higher uniformity in distribution of rainfall zone 1 has the highest range of variability which can be attributed to variability in rainfall patterns perhaps due to rapid variation in elevation a zone with higher uniformity in distribution of rainfall will have lower re values as the observed distribution is close to the uniform distribution and corresponding higher number of wet days eq 2 the maps depicting the temporal statistics such as average magnitude of re 1951 2010 trends in re and their statistical significance are shown in fig 6 upper panel the annual mean number of wet days a day with rainfall amount greater than 0 1 mm based on imd classification of very light rain ranges between 0 1 and 0 2 mm is computed for the years 1951 2010 and their trend and significance is shown in fig 6 lower panel from fig 6 most of the grid cells in zones 3 4 7 and 2 shows increase in re whereas some portion of zones 1 5 6 and 8 shows decreasing trend in re a few clusters of grid cells with statistically significant changes in re are observed in zones 1 3 4 8 and 5 in lower panel of fig 6 there is a decreasing trend in annual number of wet days in major portion of india with clusters of significant changes observed in zones 1 3 4 5 and 8 in fig 6 the analysis is reported for the entire duration of study i e 1951 2010 however it is to be noted that from fig 7 onwards the results and discussions are made for two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 the shift in the distribution of re is an indication of stress due to change in the number of wet days in the year which influences instability in processes related to hydrological and ecosystems if the distribution of re shifts to the right it is an indication of a reduced number of wet days and similarly a shift to the left in the distribution of re would imply an increase in the number of wet days both of which may have implications on the water availability in the region being adapted to the sustained conditions of timing and amount of water different ecological and biological functioning will face tremendous stress due to significant variability in water availability for example due to change in length of rainy season the growth and development stages of different species of vegetation will be affected to assess the change in the frequency distribution of re across all zones two sample anderson darling test is performed for all the grid cells in particular zone and the results are shown in fig 7 third column more than 30 of the grid cells in most of the zones show statistically significant change in frequency distribution of re with zone 1 and zone 2 showing the highest 42 29 and lowest 21 55 change respectively the large number of grid cells dominating agricultural productivity of the country zones 3 4 and 8 show a significant increasing trend in re this change in re affects the timing and amount of rainfall which are crucial for sustainable planning and management of water in rainfed agriculture practices from fig 7 it is also clear that higher fraction of grid cells across the country show an increasing trend in re in the next subsection the changes in the timing and amount of rainfall in different zones of india are analysed and their potential implications are discussed 4 2 change in timing and amount of rainfall to understand how the timing of 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile of total rainfall and the corresponding rainfall amount have changed between 1951 and 1980 and 1981 2010 analysis on each grid of different zones is carried out the timing referred here indicates the day of year at which the corresponding percentiles of the annual total precipitation are received the mean and standard deviation of the day of occurrence of a particular percentile of annual rainfall are determined from the distribution of annual rainfall for the years in the period for example to get the mean of day of occurrence of 10th percentile the day of occurrence of 10th percentile is noted for all the years in the time window and the mean is determined changes in the mean and variance of these two parameters are assessed individually for each grid of those zones by implementing two sample t test for change in mean and two sample f test for change in standard deviation respectively the results of these tests for the changes in mean and standard deviation for amount and timing of rainfall at different percentiles are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the variability in amount and day of the year of receiving the percentiles of annual rainfall during 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 are presented in figs s14 and s15 of supporting information respectively it is observed that more than 40 of the grid cells in zone 1 and zone 6 show significant changes in rainfall amount for different percentiles during the two time periods similarly zone 1 also shows highest variability in rainfall amount in more than 30 of the grid cells within it similar observations in zone 7 is also observed zone 7 includes the western ghats one of the global biodiversity hotspots the range of standard deviation of amount of rainfall received at increasing percentiles also increases accordingly in fig 8 moderate percentage of grid cells show increase in mean amount of rainfall for higher percentiles 50th 75th and 90th are observed for zones 5 10 whereas even higher percentage show decrease in mean amount for the same percentiles in zones 3 4 and 6 fig 10 large spatial extent exhibiting decrease of mean amount of rainfall received at higher percentiles indicate significant reduction of availability of water another important parameter other than rainfall amount is the time of occurrence of certain percentiles of annual rainfall and its variability from fig 9 it can be seen that more percentage of grid cells showing significant changes in mean and standard deviation of day of occurrence of 10th 25th and 50th percentiles which can be related to the changing patterns of seasonal progression of rainfall events across grid cells in eachzone these changes can also be related to changes in the onset duration and recession of monsoon season which contributes major portion of annual rainfall in india an interesting observation from fig 11 is that comparatively large number of grid cells in most of the zones show significant delay in the mean day of occurrence of 10th percentile of annual rainfall this high variability in day of occurrence of onset of rainy season may be attributed to the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature as observed by goswami xavier 2005 overall a pattern of decreasing variability in mean day of occurrence of different percentiles of annual rainfall is observed in most of the zones which suggests that the variability in recession of rainfall season is less in compare to the initiation in most of the zones fig s15 in the following subsection the influence of low and high intensity rainfall events and their changing relationship to the dynamics of uniformity of rainfall is discussed 4 3 influence of low and high intensity rainfall on re the temporal uniformity of rainfall depends on the frequency and amount of low and high intensity rainfall events with increasing temperature both the frequency and amount of these events may change and can affect the uniformity therefore it is important to assess the changing relationship between re and low and high intensity rainfall events independent of rise in temperature for better understanding the dynamics of temporal rainfall uniformity the changes in the frequency of high and low intensity rainfall events for different zones are shown in figs s2 and s3 of supporting information in order to gain an understanding about the influence of these events on re removing the effect of amt changes in the partial correlation coefficient were performed for each grid cell of different zones and are shown as density function in fig 12 in order to assess the relationship between re and rlowtot r95ptot conditioned to amt and r95ptot rlowtot partial correlation test based on spearman rank method is conducted for all zones separately and presented in fig 13 the percentage of grid cells within the zones showing significant correlation are given in tables s3 and s4 supporting information the spatial maps showing the variability of partial correlations are given in fig a 1 appendix two distinct characteristics in the dynamics of low and high intensity rainfall influencing temporal uniformity are observed from fig 12 low intensity rainfall amount modulates the wider range of re by both increasing and decreasing it for different zones whereas the high intensity amounts on an average tends to increase the re the frequency and amount of low intensity rainfall together play a major role in this mixed effect on re for example higher frequency of low intensity rainfall reduces re whereas decreasing amount increases the re the changes in the temporal distribution of partial correlation coefficient signifies the spatial non uniformity in both frequency and magnitude of high and low intensity rainfall events a significant shift in the distribution of partial correlation is observed in most of the zones in two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 the percentage of number of grid cells within different zones showing significant change are shown in table s3 in supporting information it is observed that more than 50 of the grid cells in all zones other than zone 2 show a significant association between re and r95ptot conditioned on amt whereas a lower percentage of grid cells show significant association between re and rlowtot unequivocally an increased number of grid cells in all zones except zone 10 showed significant association between re and r95ptot in the latter time period 1981 2010 suggesting intensification of extremes due to rise in temperature although lower number of grid cells within different zones show significant partial correlation between re and rlowtot conditioned on amt there is a significant increase in the number of grid cells in all zones except 2 6 7 and 9 in the latter time period indicating increase in areal extent of zones with significant association between uniformity and low intensity rainfall events these observations suggest that the characteristics of light to moderate intensity of rainfall events have also changed significantly and thus have remarkable influence on temporal uniformity of rainfall another aspect of the characteristics of rainfall is the changing dynamics in the association of re and r95ptot rlowtot conditioned on amt and rlowtot r95ptot in the partial correlation analysis the changes in the distribution of partial correlation coefficient during the two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 reflect the relative contribution of high low intensity rainfall events to behaviour of re conditioned to prevailing characteristics of low high and amt the results of this analysis are shown in fig 13 the zones which exhibit significant change in distribution of partial correlation coefficient during the two time periods reveal their sensitivity to changing characteristics of rainfall governing the temporal uniformity of rainfall 4 4 sensitivity of re to high and low intensity rainfall and their changing association from the previous section it is clear that both high and low intensity events influence temporal uniformity of rainfall as their association with re shows changes during the two time periods therefore it is necessary to understand the association between sensitivity of re and high r95ptot low rlowtot conditioned on amt the heat maps shown in fig 14 represent the spearman rank correlation between the quantile coefficients used to measure the sensitivities of re r95ptot and rlowtot to amt across different quantiles based on flowchart in fig 3 these correlation coefficients are the measure of degree of coherence between the sensitivities among variables conditioned on amt they represent the strength and direction of influence of high and low intensity rainfall contribution to re at different quantiles the quantile regression coefficients resulting from regressing re r95ptot and rlowtot on amt at 10th 30th 50th 70th and 90th quantiles for all zones are represented as box plots in figs s4 to s13 in supporting information a general observation of decreasing range of variability in the quantile regression coefficients from re to rlowtot through r95ptot with amt is found irrespective of any zones spatial maps depicting the changes in the magnitudes of the quantile coefficients for 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 time periods are provided in appendix figs a2 a3 and a4 from fig 14 it is observed that on an average the strength of association between sensitivity coefficients of re and r95ptot conditioned on amt is higher than sensitivity coefficients of re and rlowtot which indicates a higher degree of coherence between re and r 95ptot than rlowtot the influence of amt on re has regional dependence that controls the strength of coherence between re and other rainfall characteristics for example during initial time period 1951 1980 the coherence between rlowtot and amt are insignificant whereas it becomes significant in the later time period 1981 2010 for zone 6 the consistency in sign of coherence also plays an important role in underlying dynamics of these associations for example zones 4 5 8 and 9 have consistent signs of positive and negative for their association of re with r95ptot and rlowtot respectively during the two time periods in zones 8 and 9 a weakened coherence is observed between re and rlowtot during the later time period 1981 2010 the zones with significant correlations among β 1 r e a m t p β 1 r 95 p t o t a m t p and β 1 r l o w t o t a m t p may reflect the state of soil moisture precipitation feedbacks as studies show the dependence of occurrence of extreme rainfall events on soil moisture ho hagemann et al 2015 and its heterogenous nature lorenz et al 2016 the soil moisture precipitation feedbacks are controlled by land surface processes that can have significant impact on boundary layer atmosphere thus affecting the characteristics of extreme events the frequency of extreme events may get altered in a region with strong coupling of soil moisture precipitation temperature durre et al 2000 jaeger seneviratne 2011 and thus will affect the estimation of re due to changing patterns in amt these coupling may get affected which in turn will influence the precipitation characteristics controlling the overall rainfall uniformity these feedbacks are governed by many direct and indirect factors lorenz et al 2016 direct factors such as precipitation recycling can contribute significant supply of soil moisture available for occurrence of precipitation paul et al 2018 indirect factors occurring at wide range of scales from planetary boundary layer mesoscale circulation patterns to soil moisture state outside the region of interest can operate these feedbacks lorenz et al 2016 in general the feedbacks between soil moisture and extreme precipitation is very complex as both positive and negative feedback can exist depending on the location of the region of interest s orensson and meńendez 2011 the frequency of wet precipitation extremes are also affected by variability of soil moisture jaeger seneviratne 2011 holgate et al 2019 showed that the correlation between soil moisture and next day rainfall depth depends on spatial scales and regional hydroclimatology the strength and direction of correlation coefficient depends on land atmosphere coupling mechanism and related uncertainty trenberth shea 2005 demonstrated that the correlation between monthly mean surface temperature and precipitation depends on geographical locations and interaction between large scale circulations such as el nino and regional atmospheric conditions these analyses bring out the potential of both low and high intensity events to modulate the temporal uniformity of rainfall under increased temperature in concluding remarks of the paper by rajah et al 2014 the authors conjectured that with rising atmospheric temperature both the frequency of high and low intensity rainfall events may get affected and can cast considerable influence of the temporal uniformity of rainfall distribution in this analysis it is found that both these events are in fact changing in terms of frequency and association with distribution of temporal uniformity of rainfall 5 conclusion in this study changing characteristics of rainfall such as timing and amount of rainfall the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall using relative entropy and the influence of low and high intensity rainfall contribution on the behaviours of degree of uniformity are investigated for the entire indian subcontinent by dividing into ten zones the uniformity in rainfall distribution shows a wide range of spatial variability across different zones the grid cells over central northern west and west coastal show increase in relative entropy whereas a few grid cells over north east north east and south peninsula show a decrease changes in the timing and amount at different percentiles of annual rainfall for different zones are also observed with higher variability in the onset of rainy season measured at 10th percentile of annual rainfall these changes in timing and amount of rainfall received can have serious negative implications to agricultural planning and productivity they also affect the groundwater recharge cycle as well flow regime of surface water the sensitivity of high and low intensity rainfall on temporal uniformity of rainfall is investigated it is observed that under the influence of warming the characteristics of high and low intensity rainfall events are affected and substantially modulate the uniformity of rainfall the spatial variability and strength of degree of coherence between the sensitivity coefficients of uniformity high and low intensity events conditioned on amt may possibly be linked with the soil moisture precipitation feedback process relative entropy is unable to distinguish the influence of position of the extreme high rainfall events in the time period considered therefore the value of re will be the same whether the extreme rainfall events are all clustered together or occur randomly as long as the total rainfall and the magnitudes of individual extremes remain the same this is one of the major limitations of using relative entropy as an indicator of uniformity in rainfall distribution there are other important variables and parameters such as land use vegetation feedbacks to atmosphere controlling the amount of recycle precipitation influence of topography effecting moisture transport and atmospheric convection which controls the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall are not considered in this study the influence of human activities on changes in the global temperature is well studied however studies on the regional influence of warming to spatial variability and distribution of rainfall is still in nascent stage more investigative studies on combined and isolated impacts of climate change and human activities on rise in temperature and its influence on changes in seasonal rainfall characteristics are needed to understand the dynamics of seasonal rainfall variability there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation of seasonal rainfall characteristics and its temporal evolution due to changes in it s relationship with covariates under future climate scenarios for

6104,understanding response of temporal distribution timing frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall to warming is important in water resources management in this paper relative entropy is used to investigate the spatial variability and change in uniformity of rainfall distribution over india temporal trends in atmospheric temperature can alter the frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall events which influence the uniformity of rainfall distribution the study is divided into two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 based on time trend in annual mean temperature the sensitivity of rainfall uniformity and high and low intensity rainfall events to annual mean temperature and the degree of coherence between them are investigated the uniformity of rainfall distribution shows a significant spatial variability significant changes are observed in both the amount and timing of rainfall across india a significant association between rainfall uniformity and low intensity of rainfall is observed in the recent past over a larger aerial extent compared to the distant past it is concluded that rise in temperature modifies both high and low intensity rainfall events thus altering the uniformity in rainfall distribution a regionally varied strength of coherence between rainfall uniformity and high and low intensity rainfall is observed which may be due to regionally dependent soil moisture precipitation feedbacks keywords relative entropy rainfall uniformity temperature trend india 1 introduction variability in the temporal characteristics of rainfall poses serious implications to ecosystem functioning eg kumar 2013 rohr et al 2013 austin et al 2004 guan et al 2018 kumar 2007 vegetation dynamics duveiller et al 2018 xu et al 2018 state of the hydrological system berghuijs et al 2014 dev 2012 regional hydro climatology huang et al 2016 carré cheddadi 2017 hettiarachchi et al 2019 as well as planning and decisions related to sustainable water management ceglar et al 2017 roxy 2017 the dynamics of rainfall characteristics depend on numerous factors including large scale atmospheric processes naidu et al 2017 sun et al 2017 warming at regional and global scales putnam broecker 2017 sun et al 2017 and land sea temperature gradients jin wang 2017 roxy 2017 roxy et al 2015 changes in these large scale and regional governing processes can alter the number of rainy days and temporal uniformity of the rainfall for example periods of prolonged dry spell will reduce the temporal uniformity of distribution of rainfall a major objective of the study reported in this paper is to examine the change in such uniformity in rainfall in india over the past few decades for this purpose the uniformity in distribution of rainfall is defined as the proximity of the distribution to a uniform distribution and provides a measure of how uniformly the daily rainfall is distributed within the year it may be noted that inter annual variability and uniformity are two conceptually different aspects of rainfall characteristics while inter annual variability deals with year to year variation of rainfall the concept of uniformity as used in this paper refers to the distribution of rainfall within a year the uniformity in distribution of rainfall is governed by both exogenous and endogenous factors rajah et al 2014 molnar et al 2015 rajah et al 2014 throw light on the mechanism of how the temporal uniformity of rainfall is affected by changing frequencies of low and high intensity rainfall events and their drivers influenced by rise in temperature they also conclude that warming not only modifies the characteristics of high intensity rainfall events but also affects low intensity events that have a significant potential to modulate the temporal uniformity of rainfall the exogenous factors such as regional land surface warming and large scale climate forcing like enso el nino southern oscillations play an important role in changes in the uniformity of rainfall by modulating the endogenous characteristics of rainfall pattern sahany et al 2018 the endogenous factors such as frequency and amount of high and low intensity rainfall are also affected by exogenous factors like increase in atmospheric temperature thus altering the pattern of uniformity in rainfall fig 1 presents a hypothetical example of association between uniformity and rainfall intensity in a hypothetical situation higher uniformity low value of relative entropy in rainfall distribution is observed if only low intensity rainfall events occur in a year fig 1a lower uniformity high value of relative entropy is observed when only high intensity rainfall events with lower frequency than that of low intensity events occur fig 1b the formulation of relative entropy is given in section 3 1 in real situations more complex changes in the uniformity take place when frequency and magnitude of both high and low intensity rainfall events are altered as shown in fig 1c these changes in the uniformity in rainfall due to exogenous and endogenous factors under changing climatic conditions in india are rarely studied the specific objectives of this study are 1 to examine the spatiotemporal variation of the degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution across the ten zones of india details in section 2 2 to detect changes in the timing and amount of rainfall and 3 to investigate the controls of low and high intensity rainfall events on degree of uniformity of rainfall subjected to regional annual mean temperature amt two historical time windows 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 are considered to investigate the objectives the period of available data 1951 2010 is divided into two equal parts 1951 1980 30 years and 1981 2010 30 years dividing the dataset into two equal time windows will help in minimising the effect of bias in sample size sharma and mujumdar 2017 found that the characteristics of rainfall and other extremes lead to substantial concurrence of heatwaves and droughts during 1981 2010 with respect to 1951 1980 as changes in relative entropy affects the duration and frequency of rainfall characteristics it can help in describing the time evolution of droughts and other events related to rainfall the info theoretic measure relative entropy re is used to quantify the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall feng et al 2013 pascale et al 2015 sahany et al 2018 the seasonality index introduced by feng et al 2013 is a product of re and normalised annual rainfall which needs information on re and rainfall to fully describe the index whereas in this study only re is used to infer about the uniformity of rainfall distribution the timing and amount of rainfall are determined from the annual rainfall distribution whereas the controls of low and high intensity rainfall on re are analysed using quantile regression and spearman s rank correlation conditioned on amt the remaining part of the paper is divided into four sections section 2 deals with study area and data used to approach the research objectives section 3 is devoted to the discussion of methodologies adopted for the analysis results and discussions based on the analysis are provided in section 4 section 5 summarises the conclusions and limitations of the present work 2 study area and data the study area consists of the mainland india bounded between 8 4 and 37 6 north latitude and 68 7 to 97 25 east longitude it receives about 80 of the total annual rainfall during june to september due to the south west monsoon the spatial variation of mean annual rainfall is shown in fig 2 a the mainland india is divided into ten zones fig 2b with approximately uniform climatic characteristics in a zone pathak et al 2014 the zones are classified in such a way that each zone has unique hydroclimatic conditions and maximum land area coverage the latitude and longitude of these zones are given in table s1 in supporting information the high resolution 0 25 0 25 daily rainfall dataset prepared by india meteorological department imd for the period 1951 2010 pai et al 2014 is used in this study daily rainfall data from 6955 stations were used in the preparation of this high resolution gridded rainfall dataset through spatial interpolation by applying inverse distance weighted scheme shepard 1968 this dataset is comparable with the existing aphrodite and other imd products in terms of climatological as well as variability features of indian rainfall vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 the daily maximum and minimum air temperature dataset prepared by national climate centre ncc imd at 1 1 spatial resolution for the period 1951 2010 srivastava et al 2009 are used in this study the observed data from 395 quality controlled stations were used to prepare the gridded dataset using modified shepard s angular distance weighing algorithm the original temperature dataset was re gridded to the resolution 0 25 0 25 of the rainfall dataset by bilinear interpolation amt was constructed by taking an average of annual mean temperature of all the grid cells within each zone the details of the trend analysis and significance of amt are shown in fig s1 and table s2 in supporting information in this study annual mean temperature amt is considered instead of annual maximum and or minimum temperature the annual maximum and or minimum temperature may be used as more effective forcings for rainfall extremes the focus of the work is on uniformity of rainfall distribution within a year rather than the occurrence of extremes moreover the annual mean temperature includes the signature of both annual maximum and annual minimum temperatures and therefore considered more appropriate variable for analysing rainfall uniformity 3 methodology in this section the methodology used for addressing the research objectives is discussed the analysis is performed for two time windows each of 30 years 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 3 1 degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution relative entropy relative entropy re is an information theoretic measure to determine the distance between two probability distributions in this paper re serves as a measure of the degree of uniformity of rainfall distribution if the observed rainfall distribution is compared with a uniform distribution let p 1 p 2 p n be the values of the daily observed rainfall where n 365 or 366 depending on normal or leap year respectively if p i 1 n p i is the total rainfall in a year then the ratio p i p i p can be regarded as daily fraction of annual rainfall let q m be the rainfall on day m from a uniform rainfall sequence that assumes a constant value of 1 365 and 1 366 for normal year and leap year respectively for all m 1 2 n therefore the degree of uniformity of rainfall measured as re feng et al 2013 is given by 1 re i 1 n p i log 2 p i q m the maximum value of re is achieved when all the rainfall is concentrated on a single day then p i 1 and re log 2 n log 2 365 8 511 or re log 2 n l o g 2 366 8 515 for a non leap year or leap year respectively the minimum value of re is zero when the rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year in the analysis the fact that p i log 2 p i q m 0 when p i 0 is used re is thus a measure of how uniformly rainfall is distributed throughout the year and a high value of re indicates that the rainfall is unevenly distributed in a year re is a robust measure and can be used to infer the effective number of wet days in a year pascale et al 2015 the effective number of wet days nwd is related to re as follows 2 nwd n 2 r e where n assumes a value of 365 or 366 depending on the year under consideration is a normal year or a leap year respectively 3 2 timing and amount of rainfall percentile approach in order to understand the changes in the timing and the corresponding amount of rainfall percentile based approach is adopted the day of the year and the corresponding rainfall amount for 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile of the total annual rainfall are estimated following pryor schoof 2008 for each grid within each zone respectively these percentiles indicate the cumulative fraction of total annual rainfall received the changes in the mean and standard deviation of these metrics are analyzed for the two time windows at each grid using two sample t test and two sample f test respectively at 5 significance level 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 detection of change in distribution two sample anderson darling test identification and detection of change in the distribution of re and its sensitivity to high and low intensity rainfall conditioned on amt for each grid in different zones are of immense significance as such a change indicates a shift in rainfall regimes and sensitivity of uniformity of rainfall in this work the two sample anderson darling test is used to detect the change in the distribution of re across two time windows 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 respectively the two sample anderson darling test is more robust to changes in distribution in terms of shift scale symmetry and distribution having same mean and standard deviation but differ in the tails when compared with the popular test kolmogorov smirnoff test engmann cousineau 2011 moreover the test needs fewer data to reach sufficient statistical power and has type i error rate corresponding to significance level in compare to kolmogorov smirnoff test engmann cousineau 2011 the matlab function prepared by trujillo ortiz et al 2007 is used for the analysis 3 3 2 controls of low and high intensity rainfall on re linear regression deals with modeling conditional mean of the response variable whereas quantile regression models the different quantiles of the response variable and provides a more comprehensive behavior of response variable with respect to the covariates wasko sharma 2014 let the ranks of the pair x i y i are denoted as r x i r y i for i 1 2 n therefore the spearman rank correlation coefficient neter et al 1996 denoted by ρ y x is given by following expression 3 ρ y x i 1 n r x i r x r y i r y i 1 n r x i r x 2 j 1 n r y j r y 2 where r x and r y are the mean ranks of r x i and r y i respectively ρ y x is bounded between 1 to 1 and it measure the association between two variables using monotonic function a two sided t test is used to assess the significance of the association understanding the complex interactions between re and low and high intensity rainfall events under the influence of increased temperature remains an important issue as it helps in revealing the underlying governing processes that control the behaviour of re in this study partial correlation coefficient based on spearman rank correlation principle are used to infer these conditional associations the partial correlation coefficient can be expressed in terms of spearman rank correlation coefficient as follows 4 ρ y x z ρ y x ρ y z ρ x z 1 ρ y z 2 1 ρ x z 2 let x i y i be the pair of data where y and x are the dependent and independent variables respectively the p th quantile regression model is given as 5 y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i ε i where 0 p 1 and ε i is an error with zero mean the model parameters β 0 y x p and β 1 y x p are estimated by minimizing the absolute deviation ad of errors weighted by p as follows 6 a d β 0 y x p β 1 y x p p y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i 1 p y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i y i β 0 y x p β 1 y x p x i the two indices used in this study to refer the proportion of low and high intensity rainfall events to annual rainfall are rlowtot and r95ptot respectively according to imd guidelines http imd gov in section nhac termglossary pdf the range of low intensity rainfall is between 0 1 and 7 5 mm the index rlowtot measures the fraction of low intensity rainfall amount to annual rainfall and it assume values in the range of 0 if no low intensity rainfall event occurs in a year to 1 if all the rainfall events are in the range of low intensity similarly the high intensity rainfall index is given by r95ptot which indicates the fraction of annual rainfall due to extreme rainfall which is higher than the 95th percentile of rainfall during the base period of 1961 1990 karl et al 1999 these indices are estimated for each grid of different zones under consideration in this paper the variables re r95ptot rlowtot are used as dependent variables and amt is used as an independent variable for quantile regression analysis the association among quantile regression coefficients resulting from the analyses are investigated using spearman rank correlation the schematic workflow for estimating quantile regression coefficients and their association are shown in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal dynamics of degree of uniformity the spatiotemporal dynamics of the degree of uniformity of rainfall for india was estimated by re it was applied to each grid of size 0 25 0 25 for 1951 2010 and the time series of re for a particular grid depicts the history of temporal evolution of uniformity in rainfall distribution this approach is applied to all the grid cells across mainland india the histogram of the mean re across india is shown in fig 4 the spatial variability of re across all zones is determined by taking the 5th and 95th percentiles of re along with its mean value across spaces the temporal evolution of the spatial variability of re is shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that zones 1 and 2 have a higher spatial variability whereas zones 5 and 6 show lower spatial variability as compared to other zones moreover zone 6 shows lowest range of variability in re which suggests a higher uniformity in distribution of rainfall zone 1 has the highest range of variability which can be attributed to variability in rainfall patterns perhaps due to rapid variation in elevation a zone with higher uniformity in distribution of rainfall will have lower re values as the observed distribution is close to the uniform distribution and corresponding higher number of wet days eq 2 the maps depicting the temporal statistics such as average magnitude of re 1951 2010 trends in re and their statistical significance are shown in fig 6 upper panel the annual mean number of wet days a day with rainfall amount greater than 0 1 mm based on imd classification of very light rain ranges between 0 1 and 0 2 mm is computed for the years 1951 2010 and their trend and significance is shown in fig 6 lower panel from fig 6 most of the grid cells in zones 3 4 7 and 2 shows increase in re whereas some portion of zones 1 5 6 and 8 shows decreasing trend in re a few clusters of grid cells with statistically significant changes in re are observed in zones 1 3 4 8 and 5 in lower panel of fig 6 there is a decreasing trend in annual number of wet days in major portion of india with clusters of significant changes observed in zones 1 3 4 5 and 8 in fig 6 the analysis is reported for the entire duration of study i e 1951 2010 however it is to be noted that from fig 7 onwards the results and discussions are made for two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 the shift in the distribution of re is an indication of stress due to change in the number of wet days in the year which influences instability in processes related to hydrological and ecosystems if the distribution of re shifts to the right it is an indication of a reduced number of wet days and similarly a shift to the left in the distribution of re would imply an increase in the number of wet days both of which may have implications on the water availability in the region being adapted to the sustained conditions of timing and amount of water different ecological and biological functioning will face tremendous stress due to significant variability in water availability for example due to change in length of rainy season the growth and development stages of different species of vegetation will be affected to assess the change in the frequency distribution of re across all zones two sample anderson darling test is performed for all the grid cells in particular zone and the results are shown in fig 7 third column more than 30 of the grid cells in most of the zones show statistically significant change in frequency distribution of re with zone 1 and zone 2 showing the highest 42 29 and lowest 21 55 change respectively the large number of grid cells dominating agricultural productivity of the country zones 3 4 and 8 show a significant increasing trend in re this change in re affects the timing and amount of rainfall which are crucial for sustainable planning and management of water in rainfed agriculture practices from fig 7 it is also clear that higher fraction of grid cells across the country show an increasing trend in re in the next subsection the changes in the timing and amount of rainfall in different zones of india are analysed and their potential implications are discussed 4 2 change in timing and amount of rainfall to understand how the timing of 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th percentile of total rainfall and the corresponding rainfall amount have changed between 1951 and 1980 and 1981 2010 analysis on each grid of different zones is carried out the timing referred here indicates the day of year at which the corresponding percentiles of the annual total precipitation are received the mean and standard deviation of the day of occurrence of a particular percentile of annual rainfall are determined from the distribution of annual rainfall for the years in the period for example to get the mean of day of occurrence of 10th percentile the day of occurrence of 10th percentile is noted for all the years in the time window and the mean is determined changes in the mean and variance of these two parameters are assessed individually for each grid of those zones by implementing two sample t test for change in mean and two sample f test for change in standard deviation respectively the results of these tests for the changes in mean and standard deviation for amount and timing of rainfall at different percentiles are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the variability in amount and day of the year of receiving the percentiles of annual rainfall during 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 are presented in figs s14 and s15 of supporting information respectively it is observed that more than 40 of the grid cells in zone 1 and zone 6 show significant changes in rainfall amount for different percentiles during the two time periods similarly zone 1 also shows highest variability in rainfall amount in more than 30 of the grid cells within it similar observations in zone 7 is also observed zone 7 includes the western ghats one of the global biodiversity hotspots the range of standard deviation of amount of rainfall received at increasing percentiles also increases accordingly in fig 8 moderate percentage of grid cells show increase in mean amount of rainfall for higher percentiles 50th 75th and 90th are observed for zones 5 10 whereas even higher percentage show decrease in mean amount for the same percentiles in zones 3 4 and 6 fig 10 large spatial extent exhibiting decrease of mean amount of rainfall received at higher percentiles indicate significant reduction of availability of water another important parameter other than rainfall amount is the time of occurrence of certain percentiles of annual rainfall and its variability from fig 9 it can be seen that more percentage of grid cells showing significant changes in mean and standard deviation of day of occurrence of 10th 25th and 50th percentiles which can be related to the changing patterns of seasonal progression of rainfall events across grid cells in eachzone these changes can also be related to changes in the onset duration and recession of monsoon season which contributes major portion of annual rainfall in india an interesting observation from fig 11 is that comparatively large number of grid cells in most of the zones show significant delay in the mean day of occurrence of 10th percentile of annual rainfall this high variability in day of occurrence of onset of rainy season may be attributed to the meridional gradient of tropospheric temperature as observed by goswami xavier 2005 overall a pattern of decreasing variability in mean day of occurrence of different percentiles of annual rainfall is observed in most of the zones which suggests that the variability in recession of rainfall season is less in compare to the initiation in most of the zones fig s15 in the following subsection the influence of low and high intensity rainfall events and their changing relationship to the dynamics of uniformity of rainfall is discussed 4 3 influence of low and high intensity rainfall on re the temporal uniformity of rainfall depends on the frequency and amount of low and high intensity rainfall events with increasing temperature both the frequency and amount of these events may change and can affect the uniformity therefore it is important to assess the changing relationship between re and low and high intensity rainfall events independent of rise in temperature for better understanding the dynamics of temporal rainfall uniformity the changes in the frequency of high and low intensity rainfall events for different zones are shown in figs s2 and s3 of supporting information in order to gain an understanding about the influence of these events on re removing the effect of amt changes in the partial correlation coefficient were performed for each grid cell of different zones and are shown as density function in fig 12 in order to assess the relationship between re and rlowtot r95ptot conditioned to amt and r95ptot rlowtot partial correlation test based on spearman rank method is conducted for all zones separately and presented in fig 13 the percentage of grid cells within the zones showing significant correlation are given in tables s3 and s4 supporting information the spatial maps showing the variability of partial correlations are given in fig a 1 appendix two distinct characteristics in the dynamics of low and high intensity rainfall influencing temporal uniformity are observed from fig 12 low intensity rainfall amount modulates the wider range of re by both increasing and decreasing it for different zones whereas the high intensity amounts on an average tends to increase the re the frequency and amount of low intensity rainfall together play a major role in this mixed effect on re for example higher frequency of low intensity rainfall reduces re whereas decreasing amount increases the re the changes in the temporal distribution of partial correlation coefficient signifies the spatial non uniformity in both frequency and magnitude of high and low intensity rainfall events a significant shift in the distribution of partial correlation is observed in most of the zones in two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 the percentage of number of grid cells within different zones showing significant change are shown in table s3 in supporting information it is observed that more than 50 of the grid cells in all zones other than zone 2 show a significant association between re and r95ptot conditioned on amt whereas a lower percentage of grid cells show significant association between re and rlowtot unequivocally an increased number of grid cells in all zones except zone 10 showed significant association between re and r95ptot in the latter time period 1981 2010 suggesting intensification of extremes due to rise in temperature although lower number of grid cells within different zones show significant partial correlation between re and rlowtot conditioned on amt there is a significant increase in the number of grid cells in all zones except 2 6 7 and 9 in the latter time period indicating increase in areal extent of zones with significant association between uniformity and low intensity rainfall events these observations suggest that the characteristics of light to moderate intensity of rainfall events have also changed significantly and thus have remarkable influence on temporal uniformity of rainfall another aspect of the characteristics of rainfall is the changing dynamics in the association of re and r95ptot rlowtot conditioned on amt and rlowtot r95ptot in the partial correlation analysis the changes in the distribution of partial correlation coefficient during the two time periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 reflect the relative contribution of high low intensity rainfall events to behaviour of re conditioned to prevailing characteristics of low high and amt the results of this analysis are shown in fig 13 the zones which exhibit significant change in distribution of partial correlation coefficient during the two time periods reveal their sensitivity to changing characteristics of rainfall governing the temporal uniformity of rainfall 4 4 sensitivity of re to high and low intensity rainfall and their changing association from the previous section it is clear that both high and low intensity events influence temporal uniformity of rainfall as their association with re shows changes during the two time periods therefore it is necessary to understand the association between sensitivity of re and high r95ptot low rlowtot conditioned on amt the heat maps shown in fig 14 represent the spearman rank correlation between the quantile coefficients used to measure the sensitivities of re r95ptot and rlowtot to amt across different quantiles based on flowchart in fig 3 these correlation coefficients are the measure of degree of coherence between the sensitivities among variables conditioned on amt they represent the strength and direction of influence of high and low intensity rainfall contribution to re at different quantiles the quantile regression coefficients resulting from regressing re r95ptot and rlowtot on amt at 10th 30th 50th 70th and 90th quantiles for all zones are represented as box plots in figs s4 to s13 in supporting information a general observation of decreasing range of variability in the quantile regression coefficients from re to rlowtot through r95ptot with amt is found irrespective of any zones spatial maps depicting the changes in the magnitudes of the quantile coefficients for 1951 1980 and 1981 2010 time periods are provided in appendix figs a2 a3 and a4 from fig 14 it is observed that on an average the strength of association between sensitivity coefficients of re and r95ptot conditioned on amt is higher than sensitivity coefficients of re and rlowtot which indicates a higher degree of coherence between re and r 95ptot than rlowtot the influence of amt on re has regional dependence that controls the strength of coherence between re and other rainfall characteristics for example during initial time period 1951 1980 the coherence between rlowtot and amt are insignificant whereas it becomes significant in the later time period 1981 2010 for zone 6 the consistency in sign of coherence also plays an important role in underlying dynamics of these associations for example zones 4 5 8 and 9 have consistent signs of positive and negative for their association of re with r95ptot and rlowtot respectively during the two time periods in zones 8 and 9 a weakened coherence is observed between re and rlowtot during the later time period 1981 2010 the zones with significant correlations among β 1 r e a m t p β 1 r 95 p t o t a m t p and β 1 r l o w t o t a m t p may reflect the state of soil moisture precipitation feedbacks as studies show the dependence of occurrence of extreme rainfall events on soil moisture ho hagemann et al 2015 and its heterogenous nature lorenz et al 2016 the soil moisture precipitation feedbacks are controlled by land surface processes that can have significant impact on boundary layer atmosphere thus affecting the characteristics of extreme events the frequency of extreme events may get altered in a region with strong coupling of soil moisture precipitation temperature durre et al 2000 jaeger seneviratne 2011 and thus will affect the estimation of re due to changing patterns in amt these coupling may get affected which in turn will influence the precipitation characteristics controlling the overall rainfall uniformity these feedbacks are governed by many direct and indirect factors lorenz et al 2016 direct factors such as precipitation recycling can contribute significant supply of soil moisture available for occurrence of precipitation paul et al 2018 indirect factors occurring at wide range of scales from planetary boundary layer mesoscale circulation patterns to soil moisture state outside the region of interest can operate these feedbacks lorenz et al 2016 in general the feedbacks between soil moisture and extreme precipitation is very complex as both positive and negative feedback can exist depending on the location of the region of interest s orensson and meńendez 2011 the frequency of wet precipitation extremes are also affected by variability of soil moisture jaeger seneviratne 2011 holgate et al 2019 showed that the correlation between soil moisture and next day rainfall depth depends on spatial scales and regional hydroclimatology the strength and direction of correlation coefficient depends on land atmosphere coupling mechanism and related uncertainty trenberth shea 2005 demonstrated that the correlation between monthly mean surface temperature and precipitation depends on geographical locations and interaction between large scale circulations such as el nino and regional atmospheric conditions these analyses bring out the potential of both low and high intensity events to modulate the temporal uniformity of rainfall under increased temperature in concluding remarks of the paper by rajah et al 2014 the authors conjectured that with rising atmospheric temperature both the frequency of high and low intensity rainfall events may get affected and can cast considerable influence of the temporal uniformity of rainfall distribution in this analysis it is found that both these events are in fact changing in terms of frequency and association with distribution of temporal uniformity of rainfall 5 conclusion in this study changing characteristics of rainfall such as timing and amount of rainfall the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall using relative entropy and the influence of low and high intensity rainfall contribution on the behaviours of degree of uniformity are investigated for the entire indian subcontinent by dividing into ten zones the uniformity in rainfall distribution shows a wide range of spatial variability across different zones the grid cells over central northern west and west coastal show increase in relative entropy whereas a few grid cells over north east north east and south peninsula show a decrease changes in the timing and amount at different percentiles of annual rainfall for different zones are also observed with higher variability in the onset of rainy season measured at 10th percentile of annual rainfall these changes in timing and amount of rainfall received can have serious negative implications to agricultural planning and productivity they also affect the groundwater recharge cycle as well flow regime of surface water the sensitivity of high and low intensity rainfall on temporal uniformity of rainfall is investigated it is observed that under the influence of warming the characteristics of high and low intensity rainfall events are affected and substantially modulate the uniformity of rainfall the spatial variability and strength of degree of coherence between the sensitivity coefficients of uniformity high and low intensity events conditioned on amt may possibly be linked with the soil moisture precipitation feedback process relative entropy is unable to distinguish the influence of position of the extreme high rainfall events in the time period considered therefore the value of re will be the same whether the extreme rainfall events are all clustered together or occur randomly as long as the total rainfall and the magnitudes of individual extremes remain the same this is one of the major limitations of using relative entropy as an indicator of uniformity in rainfall distribution there are other important variables and parameters such as land use vegetation feedbacks to atmosphere controlling the amount of recycle precipitation influence of topography effecting moisture transport and atmospheric convection which controls the degree of uniformity in distribution of rainfall are not considered in this study the influence of human activities on changes in the global temperature is well studied however studies on the regional influence of warming to spatial variability and distribution of rainfall is still in nascent stage more investigative studies on combined and isolated impacts of climate change and human activities on rise in temperature and its influence on changes in seasonal rainfall characteristics are needed to understand the dynamics of seasonal rainfall variability there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation of seasonal rainfall characteristics and its temporal evolution due to changes in it s relationship with covariates under future climate scenarios for
