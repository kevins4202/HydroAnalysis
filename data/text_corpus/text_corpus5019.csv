25095,reaction diffusion models can be used to describe temporal and spatial dynamics of populations when the interests is the relationship of a given species with the environment in which it is inserted we can model this phenomenon through the equation of fisher kolmogorov that in a mathematical sense consider the existence of a source term that represents both the reproduction and the growth rate of a population up to the medium s carrying capacity through this equation it is possible to describe the behaviour of some animals plants bacteria and cells for example in order to predict the growth and invasion of these population and control them if necessary thus in this work we propose to introduce a control strategy in a biological system consisting of aquatic plants in which the configuration is the same as the control function introduced in a logistic model the solution to the reaction diffusion model with control is obtained through the finite fourier transform this strategy in practical terms is based on the withdrawal of plants by human management computational simulations will be presented to illustrate the efficiency of the control strategy adopted keywords fisher kolmogorov equation control fourier transform management of aquatic plants 1 introduction the intense process of urbanization and industrialization since the industrial revolution in the 19th century brought as one of the undesirable side effects the contamination of water bodies with different types of pollutant residues threatening the health of the population especially the poorest portion without access to adequate treatment of wastewater more sustainable alternatives from the environmental and economic point of view besides the chemical processes have been considered for example phytoremediation techniques recent works such as mishra and maiti 2017 and saha et al 2017 show that water hyacinth use can be an ecologically efficient alternative to wastewater treatment because of its ability to extract toxic waste such as heavy metals in large quantities water hyacinth is an aquatic macrophyte that has high rates of biomass production even in contaminated environments which can often lead to a population explosion by reducing the amount of available oxygen in the water damaging the species that live underwater thus population management techniques are necessary to maintain the homeostasis of wastewater ponds there are three forms of water hyacinth control namely the control by the use of chemicals physical control and biological control osmond and petroeschevsky 2013 physical control through human management can be relatively costly if there is no planning of the spaces destined for stabilization ponds on the other hand if control is not done properly some unwanted side effects may affect liminological aspects especially in shallow water ponds bicudo et al 2007 thus control of the homeostasis of the phytoremediation process of the pond water hyacinth system is not trivial making it an interesting problem for mathematical modeling two aspects to control this system are relevant the first is to find the point of the maximum rate of population growth of water hyacinth where the greater accumulation of biomass corresponds to the greater capacity of extraction of residues and the second is to find the ideal percentage of removal of the population in order to maintain high rates of constant growth without causing undesirable side effects as we will see in detail below the population models usually do not take into account the spatial dispersion of the population considering only the accumulation of biomass over time in this study we will try to show that the spatial dispersion modeling can bring important contributions for the definition of strategies of population management of the water hyacinth population models are studied in several areas of science especially in agrarian and biological sciences through them it is possible to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of interaction on different populations for example atoms or molecules bacteria or infected individuals moreover it is possible to predict the growth and invasion of a particular species and to assist in management and decision making when there is a need for the implementation of a control strategy an example is the invasion of certain region which requires the application of some type of control the application of a control strategy can occur through the use of chemicals such as pesticide and agrochemicals often being harmful to the environment additionally it can still be done through biological control which is a mechanism that regulates then population growth of plants or animals by human intervention or by natural enemies the control strategy should take into account some information about other species of plants and animals existing in the place in order to avoid damage to nature at the time or in the future furthermore it should be taken into account of the biological and financial viability of the type of control the studies of rafikov and balthazar 2005 and rafikov et al 2008 advocate the application of biological control because it causes less damage to the environment from a theoretical view they use the optimal non linear control with feedback introducing in the mathematical model composed by ordinary differential equations odes non linear control functions in this type of control it is considered that the biological system demands a periodic application of control other studies such as goh 2012 tang and cheke 2008 and molter and rafikov 2014 adopt strategies of biological control and discuss their implications for agroecosystems concerning the control of systems with reaction diffusion taking into account spatial diffusion and temporal dynamics there are few studies with specific techniques of control in general these studies introduces control in linear models in which the control functions also enter as linear ones as in ray 1981 in addition spatio temporal models are closer to the reality of biological events since they address the dynamics of the species under study both in time and in the space in which it is inserted for non linear systems with reaction diffusion such as the fisher kolmogorov one can highlight the study of duan 2016 which proposes an optimal control problem under boundary conditions for the extended fisher kolmogorov equation however there is no application yet instead there is only the formulation and proof of some theorems of the existence of optimal solutions of the control problem there are few studies on control applied in biological systems modelled by nonlinear partial differential equations pdes probably due to the complexity that these equation get through the introduction of control strategies and the difficulty in finding the control functions therefore in order to contributing to the development of control strategies for this type of model this study proposes a control strategy that includes the spatial and temporal dynamics in the system constituted by the fisher komolgorov equation where the formulation is based on the control of temporal dynamics as presented in costa et al 2003 in addition this work intends to contribute to the modeling of controlled biological systems which can be applied in agroecosystems to verify the efficiency of the control strategy there is considered an application in a biological system composed of aquatic plants in this work we proposed to use the biological control by human intervention as strategy for management of an aquatic plant system in polluted waters modelled by the equation of fisher kolmogorov which the control is introduced with the same characteristics introduced in the logistic model according to costa et al 2003 the management of aquatic plants in the treatment of wastewater is analyzed in several works as in jayaweera and kasturiarachchi 2004 jayaweera et al 2008 jianbo et al 2008 munavalli and saler 2009 chen et al 2010 nesterenko malkovskaya et al 2012 rezania et al 2015 and mishra and maiti 2017 some of these use experimental means and others carry out theoretical studies in all works the interest for aquatic plants is due to the non use of chemicals reducing the impact to the natural environment this work is organized as follows in the section 2 is showed the reaction diffusion model for the spatio temporal dynamic behavior of the population of a species as well as a synthesis of the main characteristics and solutions for the model in section 3 the assumption by costa et al 2003 are reviewed and then we propose a strategy of optimum control to the same biological system eichornia crassipes growing in polluted water taking into account a control function u x t introduced in fisher kolmogorov equation with the same characteristics as in the logistic model further in section 4 it is also carried out an analysis of the biological system in two dimensions finally we discuss the results and present some conclusions 2 the reaction diffusion model fisher kolmogorov equation the mathematical modelling of population dynamics allows estimating how the population evolves throughout the time and adding to the model the spatial spreading one can predict the distribution of the population into a specific region considering in the modelling both the temporal dynamics and the spatial spreading of the individuals it is possible to reach the linear diffusive model that combined with a reaction term constitutes the reaction diffusion model when understanding the interaction between a species with its environment that model can be described by the non linear partial differential equation of fisher kolmogorov 1 w t d 2 w x 2 w a b w in which w represents the population density and the term d is the coefficient of diffusion constant typical for each species the coefficient a corresponds to the rate of reproduction and b a k represents the interaction among the individuals of the same species where k is the carrying capacity the coefficients d a and k are positive the model 1 is a extension of the verhulst model including the diffusive aspect in the space in the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 the junction between the reaction kinetic with the diffusion allows the wave formation and the solution is given as follows 2 w x t w x ct w z where z x ct thus w x t is a solution of the type traveling wave moving with constant speed c in the positive direction of x and in order to be determined it must be differentiable twice in ℝ furthermore w x t satisfies the boundary conditions when z given by 3 lim z w z 0 and lim z w z 1 although it is not the focus in this work one can find an approximate solution to eq 1 by the singular perturbation method which allows a qualitative analysis of the behaviour of he system without the introduction of some regulator eq 1 was also utilized to describe the spatio temporal population dynamics according to logan 2008 and murray 2001 3 control strategy applied to management of a aquatic plant system the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 represents the growth of a specific plant population without any type of regulator in this work we present a strategy of control applied to the water plants management utilizing the fisher kolmogorov equation however before to specify such proposal a study of the application of control in the temporal dynamics by the verhulst model is carried out according to costa et al 2003 in order to support the application of the control in the fisher kolmogorov model 3 1 temporal dynamics control in costa et al 2003 the biological system under investigation was the aquatic plants water hyacinth e crassipes growing in wastewater this species has the capacity to uptake toxic elements supporting water cleaning according kawai et al 1983 and alves et al 2003 the net biomass yield is the most adequate parameter in order to evaluate the nutrient uptake as well as the scavenging of toxic elements in the system however when water hyacinth plants overtake a critical density the biomass growth rate decreases and as consequence the biological properties of the removal of toxic substances in the water are also reduce therefore considering the optimal approach it is adequate to carry out a constant control of the amount of water hyacinth plants in order to reach a better performance in the aquatic system water hyacinth control is a challenge for environmentalists due to their rapid growth they invade large proportions in space in a short period of time for decades it has been discussed and searched for better ways to do this control as can be seen in some works osmond and petroeschevsky 2013 charudattan et al 1995 in smaller spaces with easy access the withdrawal of biomass has been widely used in order to determine the control function of this specific biological system we have taken into account the results from costa et al 2003 which proposed the problem of optimal control aiming to find the amount of individuals of a plant species regarding efficient system functionality the logistic model describes the population growth 4 d w d t a w b w 2 in which w t represents the water hyacinth density dry mass gm 2 in the instant t days a shows the growth rate b is the competition coefficient among the plants considering u t a control function that indicates the individuals withdraw at a specific time t then the differential equation modeling the plants growth taking into account the daily withdraw is given by 5 d w d t a w u b w u 2 τ u in whith τ is the technical capacity to withdraw the water hyacinth plants the highest τ value corresponds to the shortest period for withdraw the plants from the pond and it can be obtained also through the logistic model as follows 6 n n 0 e t 99 τ taking into account that n is the number of individuals n 1 and n 0 is the initial condition of individuals with n 0 100 we have 7 1 100 e t 99 τ obtaining τ by the relation 8 τ ln 0 01 t 99 in which t 99 is the necessary time in order to remove 99 of the plants the control function u t show up in eq 5 in a non linear form satisfying the restriction 9 0 u t w t and initial condition 10 w 0 w 0 we aim to find the control function u t with t 0 t which satisfy the limitations 9 and which maximizes the functional 11 i 0 t τ u t dt w t in which the first term represents the amount of the water hyacinth biomass withdrew during the period of operation of the pond and the second term indicates the maximum amount of water hyacinth plants at the final moment t thus it is formulated the problem of the maximum performance of the pond considering only the temporal dynamic this optimal control problem was solved by rafikov and balthazar 2005 and costa et al 2003 through the application of pontryagin s maximum principle getting the control function 12 u t w ξ when w ξ 0 when w ξ in which the ξ value is given by 13 ξ a 2 b since the support capacity of the environment that limits the water hyacinth growth is given by a b value the ξ in 13 means that the control is applied when the amount of water hyacinth plants surpass half of the maximum support capacity of the pond corresponding to the optimal level replacing the control function 12 in the equation 5 we have 14 d w d t m τ w w t ξ w a b w w t ξ in whith m a 2 4b aτ 2b and the equations from 14 describe the variation of the plants in the pond considering the control application only when the plants population surpass the value 13 from equations in 14 we can observe that when the control is applied the ode 4 becomes linear due to the algebraic simplifications by replacing 12 in 5 both the equations in 14 have exact analytic solution in each instant t taking into account the initial condition 14 are given by 15 w t m w 0 m e τ t w t ξ a b w 0 w 0 a b w 0 e a t w t ξ therefore when we have a period wide enough of the pond operation i e t the solution in 15 tend to constant values thus when the population is under the effect of the control its growth increases only up to the desired level in the studies performed by kawai et al 1983 it was observed that water hyacinth growth is exponential over a certain time thereafter reaching a steady state phase the mathematical expression representing the growth curve of the water hyacinth plants obtained from experimental results is given by 16 w t 700 1 5 78 e 0 103 t where one obtains the parameters a and b of the model notice that 16 is the solution of the equation 4 without control and the same second equation in 14 in which the growth rate and the competition rate among the plants correspond to a 0 103t 1 and b 0 000147 m2g 1t 1 thus it is possible to determine the desired level of the population that stabilizes the biological system in 368 38 gm 2 and without control the population grows up to the support capacity at 700 68 gm 2 regarding this control strategy it is possible to determine the amount of water hyacinth plants that needs to be removed in daily basis 17 u t a 2 4 τ b corresponding to u t 18 04 gm 2 t 1 with τ 1 fig 1 shows the natural growth curves of the water hyacinth population considering the solution of the second equation in 14 taking into account both application without and with optimal control and initial condition w 0 100 gm 2 t 1 regarding the solution of the first equation in 14 we can observe that the control application starts from the 17th day and the density of water hyacinth plants under control stabilizes in 368 38 gm 2 t 1 3 2 control of the spatio temporal system considering a more realistic approach to the growth of water hyacinth we can take into account in addition of the growth of plants over time as they spread beneath the surface of the water in this way the control problem becomes a spatio temporal problem once determined the control function to the logistic growing based on the studies of costa et al 2003 and kawai et al 1983 we propose as the original contribution of this work the control for a system of aquatic plants considering both the temporal dynamic and spatial dispersion of the population thus we admit the existence of a control function u x t that can be used in the fischer kolmogorov pde 1 satisfying the following conditions the control function represents the amount of water hyacinth plant daily removed t in a certain space x the space considered is a channel fulfilled with residual water and the channel is from x 0 0 up to x l l the control function in space and time must drive the trajectories of the modeled biological system 1 to the desired equilibrium point therefore a control function that satisfies these conditions and includes the plants dispersal in the space based on the functions from the logistic model can be given by 18 u x t w x t ξ when w ξ 0 when w ξ in which ξ has the same dimension of w and it is equal to the found in the control application in eq 5 which the value was established by the theory of linear control with feedback for non linear systems through the application of the maximum principle inserted into eq 1 in the same way as the eq 12 was inserted in 5 replacing the control function 18 in the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 similarly as in 5 we have 19 w t d 2 w x 2 w u a b w u τ u w ξ d 2 w x 2 w a b w w ξ notice that the second equation of the system 19 is the fischer kolmogorov equation from the first equation we can find a new pde with the given control function as 20 w t d 2 w x 2 w ξ a b w ξ τ w ξ w t d 2 w x 2 a 2 b a a 2 τ w τ a 2 b w t d 2 w x 2 τ w a 2 4 b a τ 2 b in a simpler way we have 21 w t d 2 w x 2 τ w x t m in which τ is a constant representing the technical capacity to remove the plants according to 8 the initial conditions are given by 22 w x 0 w 0 and the boundary conditions in 21 are of neumann s type 23 w 0 t x 0 w l t x 0 t 0 indicating that there is no flow of plants in the channel borders this is because the aquatic plants depend on water to survive and the boundary represents the edge from the water to the ground then impairing the growth and as consequence the outflow of the plants from the channel observe that the equation 21 has the same form as the first equation in 14 taking into account that w t is now w x t and that there was added a diffusive term given by w x x moreover the pde 21 becomes linear with the addition of the control strategy thus it is possible to find a solution for this equation by well known methods found in literature for instance as the laplace transform fourier transform and separation of variables fourier method the pde 21 is defined in a finite domain 0 x l then one can use the finite fourier transform fft which is applied in problems in which the dominium interval of the variables under interest is finite i e if x is the variable that we intend to apply a finite transform then a l x b l in which a l and b l are finite numbers in space and l is the period of the function which can or cannot take the value of b l what depends on the domain of the function medrano balboa 1989 in order to utilize a fft sine or fft cosine according to medrano balboa 1989 it is necessary the analysis of some conditions in the pde order of the derivative with respect to x even or odd order of the boundary conditions even or odd for the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 we have the derivative in x even with order two and the boundary conditions are odd with order one therefore we can utilize the fft cosine given by 24 c f x f c n 0 b l f x cos n π x l d x in which n 0 1 2 3 and the inverse is given by 25 c 1 f c n f x 1 b l f c 0 2 b l n 1 f c n cos n π x b l and the transform of the derivative is presented as follows 26 c f 2 m x 1 m n π b l 2 m f c n 1 m p 1 m 1 p n π l 2 m p 1 1 n f 2 p 1 b l f 2 p 1 a l where m 1 2 3 is defined by the order of the boundary conditions now we can apply the fft cosine in all terms of the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 finding 27 c w t c d 2 w x 2 c w c m in which because the derivative of the equation have order two w w x t and m 1 by the property of the derivative 26 28 c d 2 w x 2 d c w 2 1 x d n π b l 2 1 w c n p 1 1 n π l 2 1 1 1 1 n w 2 1 2 b l w 2 1 2 a it has 29 p 1 1 n π l 2 1 1 1 1 n w 2 1 2 b l w 2 1 2 a 0 since w 0 b l and w 0 0 correspond to the boundary conditions 23 which are conditions of null flow therefore 30 c d 2 w x 2 c w 2 x d n π l 2 w c n t appling the fft in the derivative with respect to t produces 31 c w t w c t in w x t 32 c w w c n t and in the constant m obtain 33 c m 0 b l m cos n π x b l dx m replacing from 30 to 33 in the pde 21 becomes 34 w c t d n π l 2 w c n t w c n t m and then it has the ode 35 w c n t dt d n π l 2 1 w c n t m which can be solved by integrating factor considering s t e d n π l 2 1 t as the integrating factor thus one obtains 36 w c n t m d n π l 2 1 c 2 e d n π l 2 1 t taking into account that c 2 is a constant from the integration applying the fft cosine in the initial condition 22 yield 37 c w x 0 c w 0 38 w c n 0 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x thus through the initial condition transformation 37 we can determine the value of the constant c 2 39 c 2 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x and as a consequence we can rewrite the solution of the ode 35 as follows 40 w c n t m d n π l 2 1 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x e d n π l 2 1 t applying the fft cosine inverse in w c n t becomes 41 c 1 w c n t w x t 1 b l w c 0 t 2 b l n 1 w c cos n π x b l where 42 w c 0 t 1 e t 0 b l m d x e t 0 b l w 0 d x and then one obtains 43 w x t 1 b l w c 0 t 2 b l n 1 m d n π l 2 1 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x e d n π l 2 1 t cos n π x b l with n 1 2 3 fig 2 shows the solution 43 of the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 with initial condition w x 0 140 gm 2t 1 fig 3 considers another initial condition w x 0 560 gm 2t 1 above the desired level of plants taking into account the diffusive coefficient d 1 33 m2t 1 determined from the information on diffusion of water hyacinth contained in the work of kawai et al 1983 therefore analyzing figs 2 and 3 one can observe that for each position in x the plants density is the same for each time period t moreover regardless the initial condition the amount of plants tend to stabilize throughout the time approaching 368 38 gm 2 t 1 i e the plants density stabilizes near the half of support capacity k 700 gm 2 t 1 which is the desired level according to experimental data from kawai et al 1983 after stabilization the management should be carried out daily allowing the maintenance of the population density around the desired level thus the management of the wastewater pond involves the daily control of the plant population for an efficient reduction of toxic products of water additionally to illustrate the efficiency of the control strategy proposed in this work we have considered other two types of initial conditions seeking for a more realist situation taking into account non constant initial conditions for example w x 0 x 2 shown in fig 4 thus one can see that a same initial instant can have different concentrations of plant it is remarkable the convergence of the plants density toward the equilibrium level when the density of the plants is above the desired level there is a decreasing otherwise when de density is lower there is an increase of the population by reproduction 3 3 analysis of the fischer kolmogorov model with two spatial variables the analysis performed in previous section corresponds to the unidimensional study of the growth of plant population from here we evaluate the population growth in two dimensions taking into account a channel with length and width or a stabilization pond for this to the unidimensional fischer kolmogorov equation 1 is added a second spatial variable y and one obtain the two dimensional fischer kolmogorov equation as follows 44 w t d 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 w a b w which can be rewritten in polar coordinates considering x r cos θ y r sin θ and θ arctan y x 45 w t d 2 w r 2 1 r w r 1 r 2 2 w θ 2 w a b w in 45 we have take the term 2 w θ 2 0 since the r size is independent of the angle θ position and then 46 w t d 2 w r 2 1 r w r w a b w thus seeks out a solution w x y t w r t however eq 46 does not have solutions like wavefront traveler in which a wave to spread with constant speed without change its shape this is due to the term 1 r which the equation does not becomes an ode in the wave variable z r ct on the other hand it is possible to observe according to murray 2001 by taking higher values of r the term 1 r w r tend to zero and becomes insignificant then by disregarding this term the solution will tend asymptotically to a solution like wavefront traveler with speed c 2 such as in the unidimensional case therefore taking into account those simplifications the solution of eq 46 with the radial variable r is equivalent to the solution of eq 44 in two spatial variables moreover considering the simplifications suggested the equation 46 is similar to eq 1 but in radial variable instead spatial and with the angular variable θ free thus in relation to the solution of the bidimensional system we can consider the populational densities obtained in 43 in radial terms fig 5 shows the evolution of the plants density in the stabilization pond with the initial condition w r 0 w 0 in each spatial position there is a specific time t and a specific plants density w that is fixed to each r size 4 discussion of results and ecological context the results of the computational simulations of the proposed plant control model are presented in figs 2 5 in figs 2 and 3 x represents the space m t the time days and w the density of plants given in biomass g m 2 t one can note that for the initial distribution given the population growth of plants in time occurs in the same way for each position in space in fig 4 the initial distribution of plants differs from one place to another due the w 0 x 2 we observe that at points close to 0 there is no need for control application while close to 1 there is need of withdrawal of plants in fig 5 a more realistic situation can be observed with the growth of the plants in radial terms as time progresses plants grow freely in all directions until they reach half of the support capacity where the application of control begins that is the daily withdrawal of plants to illustrate the proposed control model a schematic diagram of the aquatic plants control in a stabilization pond is presented in fig 6 in this scheme the initial condition is initially informed w 0 from this we insert the control function u into the system where it is calculated once known the control function is returned to the system feedback which allows finding the solution for w i e the desired population density level the results obtained in the temporal dynamics show that the control applied in the aquatic plants system aims to maintain 50 of biomass of the support capacity in the stabilization pond this was also obtained in terms of experimental results performed in costa et al 2003 where removal of toxic products from the water was analysed for the spatio temporal analysis this threshold was used in the present study to start the control other recent works such as mishra and maiti 2017 and saha et al 2017 show that the use of water hyacinth remains an ecologically efficient alternative to wastewater treatment however the cost of control by human management may become superior to other forms of control if adequate facilities are not available in order to apply this control with advantageous operating costs it is necessary that the spaces for the placement of wastewater are planned with easy access to the management of the plants in this way the use of water hyacinth presents itself as an ecological alternative aiding in the cleaning of wastewater this species can be found freely in nature in rivers and lakes in these environments the application of water hyacinth control presented in this paper becomes not feasible due to restricted access difficult withdrawal and to involve other restrictive factors which raises the level of complexity of the mathematical modeling and the control problem 5 concluding remarks in our study it was proposed a strategy of control for a system composed by aquatic plants population growing in a wastewater stabilization pond modeled by the non linear fisher kolmogorov equation firstly we have showed the control of the temporal dynamic utilizing the logistic model according to costa et al 2003 in which proposed an introduction of a method for control of plants population in polluted water the control functions were introduced in the model in a non linear way from this application we have proposed a control function u x t in fisher kolmogorov model with the same characteristics of the control function u t obtained from the temporal dynamics by the application of the pontryagins maximum principle although the mathematical modeling of aquatic plant management is complex with some constraints imposed on the model it is possible to describe spatio temporal dynamics through the fischer kolmogorov equation the insertion of the control function in the fischer kolmogorov equation resulted in a controlled model in which the equations were linear the pde with control was obtained in an approximate way by the finite fourier transform it was carried out an analysis of the fischer kolmogorov model in two dimensions x and y whence we have found that this model is equivalent to the one dimensional model x therefore we proposed the controlled model for fischer kolmogorov equation considering a radial variable by computational simulations it was possible to show that the control strategy was efficient to control the biological system reaching the desired level regardless the initial plants density in terms of the ecological efficiency our model of control applied in the system of water hyacinth plants indicated that the most efficient rate of removal of the plants is 50 of the total capacity of plants in the stabilization pond since it is well known for long time that the rate of plant growth is directly correlated with the rate of uptake resources ingestad and ågren 1992 these results are compatible with the experimental studies of the water hyacinth ponds for the treatment of piggery wastes performed by costa et al 2003 moreover the model showed that the removal of the plants should be spread in the whole area of the pond ideally in each square meter indicating that a spatial management shall be taking into account when planning the stabilization ponds therefore for this control to be applied with advantageous operational costs it is necessary that the spaces for the placement of wastewater be planned with easy access to the management of the plants in different points of the ponds acknowledgements the author daiane frighetto frighetto acknowledges the financial support of

25095,reaction diffusion models can be used to describe temporal and spatial dynamics of populations when the interests is the relationship of a given species with the environment in which it is inserted we can model this phenomenon through the equation of fisher kolmogorov that in a mathematical sense consider the existence of a source term that represents both the reproduction and the growth rate of a population up to the medium s carrying capacity through this equation it is possible to describe the behaviour of some animals plants bacteria and cells for example in order to predict the growth and invasion of these population and control them if necessary thus in this work we propose to introduce a control strategy in a biological system consisting of aquatic plants in which the configuration is the same as the control function introduced in a logistic model the solution to the reaction diffusion model with control is obtained through the finite fourier transform this strategy in practical terms is based on the withdrawal of plants by human management computational simulations will be presented to illustrate the efficiency of the control strategy adopted keywords fisher kolmogorov equation control fourier transform management of aquatic plants 1 introduction the intense process of urbanization and industrialization since the industrial revolution in the 19th century brought as one of the undesirable side effects the contamination of water bodies with different types of pollutant residues threatening the health of the population especially the poorest portion without access to adequate treatment of wastewater more sustainable alternatives from the environmental and economic point of view besides the chemical processes have been considered for example phytoremediation techniques recent works such as mishra and maiti 2017 and saha et al 2017 show that water hyacinth use can be an ecologically efficient alternative to wastewater treatment because of its ability to extract toxic waste such as heavy metals in large quantities water hyacinth is an aquatic macrophyte that has high rates of biomass production even in contaminated environments which can often lead to a population explosion by reducing the amount of available oxygen in the water damaging the species that live underwater thus population management techniques are necessary to maintain the homeostasis of wastewater ponds there are three forms of water hyacinth control namely the control by the use of chemicals physical control and biological control osmond and petroeschevsky 2013 physical control through human management can be relatively costly if there is no planning of the spaces destined for stabilization ponds on the other hand if control is not done properly some unwanted side effects may affect liminological aspects especially in shallow water ponds bicudo et al 2007 thus control of the homeostasis of the phytoremediation process of the pond water hyacinth system is not trivial making it an interesting problem for mathematical modeling two aspects to control this system are relevant the first is to find the point of the maximum rate of population growth of water hyacinth where the greater accumulation of biomass corresponds to the greater capacity of extraction of residues and the second is to find the ideal percentage of removal of the population in order to maintain high rates of constant growth without causing undesirable side effects as we will see in detail below the population models usually do not take into account the spatial dispersion of the population considering only the accumulation of biomass over time in this study we will try to show that the spatial dispersion modeling can bring important contributions for the definition of strategies of population management of the water hyacinth population models are studied in several areas of science especially in agrarian and biological sciences through them it is possible to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of interaction on different populations for example atoms or molecules bacteria or infected individuals moreover it is possible to predict the growth and invasion of a particular species and to assist in management and decision making when there is a need for the implementation of a control strategy an example is the invasion of certain region which requires the application of some type of control the application of a control strategy can occur through the use of chemicals such as pesticide and agrochemicals often being harmful to the environment additionally it can still be done through biological control which is a mechanism that regulates then population growth of plants or animals by human intervention or by natural enemies the control strategy should take into account some information about other species of plants and animals existing in the place in order to avoid damage to nature at the time or in the future furthermore it should be taken into account of the biological and financial viability of the type of control the studies of rafikov and balthazar 2005 and rafikov et al 2008 advocate the application of biological control because it causes less damage to the environment from a theoretical view they use the optimal non linear control with feedback introducing in the mathematical model composed by ordinary differential equations odes non linear control functions in this type of control it is considered that the biological system demands a periodic application of control other studies such as goh 2012 tang and cheke 2008 and molter and rafikov 2014 adopt strategies of biological control and discuss their implications for agroecosystems concerning the control of systems with reaction diffusion taking into account spatial diffusion and temporal dynamics there are few studies with specific techniques of control in general these studies introduces control in linear models in which the control functions also enter as linear ones as in ray 1981 in addition spatio temporal models are closer to the reality of biological events since they address the dynamics of the species under study both in time and in the space in which it is inserted for non linear systems with reaction diffusion such as the fisher kolmogorov one can highlight the study of duan 2016 which proposes an optimal control problem under boundary conditions for the extended fisher kolmogorov equation however there is no application yet instead there is only the formulation and proof of some theorems of the existence of optimal solutions of the control problem there are few studies on control applied in biological systems modelled by nonlinear partial differential equations pdes probably due to the complexity that these equation get through the introduction of control strategies and the difficulty in finding the control functions therefore in order to contributing to the development of control strategies for this type of model this study proposes a control strategy that includes the spatial and temporal dynamics in the system constituted by the fisher komolgorov equation where the formulation is based on the control of temporal dynamics as presented in costa et al 2003 in addition this work intends to contribute to the modeling of controlled biological systems which can be applied in agroecosystems to verify the efficiency of the control strategy there is considered an application in a biological system composed of aquatic plants in this work we proposed to use the biological control by human intervention as strategy for management of an aquatic plant system in polluted waters modelled by the equation of fisher kolmogorov which the control is introduced with the same characteristics introduced in the logistic model according to costa et al 2003 the management of aquatic plants in the treatment of wastewater is analyzed in several works as in jayaweera and kasturiarachchi 2004 jayaweera et al 2008 jianbo et al 2008 munavalli and saler 2009 chen et al 2010 nesterenko malkovskaya et al 2012 rezania et al 2015 and mishra and maiti 2017 some of these use experimental means and others carry out theoretical studies in all works the interest for aquatic plants is due to the non use of chemicals reducing the impact to the natural environment this work is organized as follows in the section 2 is showed the reaction diffusion model for the spatio temporal dynamic behavior of the population of a species as well as a synthesis of the main characteristics and solutions for the model in section 3 the assumption by costa et al 2003 are reviewed and then we propose a strategy of optimum control to the same biological system eichornia crassipes growing in polluted water taking into account a control function u x t introduced in fisher kolmogorov equation with the same characteristics as in the logistic model further in section 4 it is also carried out an analysis of the biological system in two dimensions finally we discuss the results and present some conclusions 2 the reaction diffusion model fisher kolmogorov equation the mathematical modelling of population dynamics allows estimating how the population evolves throughout the time and adding to the model the spatial spreading one can predict the distribution of the population into a specific region considering in the modelling both the temporal dynamics and the spatial spreading of the individuals it is possible to reach the linear diffusive model that combined with a reaction term constitutes the reaction diffusion model when understanding the interaction between a species with its environment that model can be described by the non linear partial differential equation of fisher kolmogorov 1 w t d 2 w x 2 w a b w in which w represents the population density and the term d is the coefficient of diffusion constant typical for each species the coefficient a corresponds to the rate of reproduction and b a k represents the interaction among the individuals of the same species where k is the carrying capacity the coefficients d a and k are positive the model 1 is a extension of the verhulst model including the diffusive aspect in the space in the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 the junction between the reaction kinetic with the diffusion allows the wave formation and the solution is given as follows 2 w x t w x ct w z where z x ct thus w x t is a solution of the type traveling wave moving with constant speed c in the positive direction of x and in order to be determined it must be differentiable twice in ℝ furthermore w x t satisfies the boundary conditions when z given by 3 lim z w z 0 and lim z w z 1 although it is not the focus in this work one can find an approximate solution to eq 1 by the singular perturbation method which allows a qualitative analysis of the behaviour of he system without the introduction of some regulator eq 1 was also utilized to describe the spatio temporal population dynamics according to logan 2008 and murray 2001 3 control strategy applied to management of a aquatic plant system the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 represents the growth of a specific plant population without any type of regulator in this work we present a strategy of control applied to the water plants management utilizing the fisher kolmogorov equation however before to specify such proposal a study of the application of control in the temporal dynamics by the verhulst model is carried out according to costa et al 2003 in order to support the application of the control in the fisher kolmogorov model 3 1 temporal dynamics control in costa et al 2003 the biological system under investigation was the aquatic plants water hyacinth e crassipes growing in wastewater this species has the capacity to uptake toxic elements supporting water cleaning according kawai et al 1983 and alves et al 2003 the net biomass yield is the most adequate parameter in order to evaluate the nutrient uptake as well as the scavenging of toxic elements in the system however when water hyacinth plants overtake a critical density the biomass growth rate decreases and as consequence the biological properties of the removal of toxic substances in the water are also reduce therefore considering the optimal approach it is adequate to carry out a constant control of the amount of water hyacinth plants in order to reach a better performance in the aquatic system water hyacinth control is a challenge for environmentalists due to their rapid growth they invade large proportions in space in a short period of time for decades it has been discussed and searched for better ways to do this control as can be seen in some works osmond and petroeschevsky 2013 charudattan et al 1995 in smaller spaces with easy access the withdrawal of biomass has been widely used in order to determine the control function of this specific biological system we have taken into account the results from costa et al 2003 which proposed the problem of optimal control aiming to find the amount of individuals of a plant species regarding efficient system functionality the logistic model describes the population growth 4 d w d t a w b w 2 in which w t represents the water hyacinth density dry mass gm 2 in the instant t days a shows the growth rate b is the competition coefficient among the plants considering u t a control function that indicates the individuals withdraw at a specific time t then the differential equation modeling the plants growth taking into account the daily withdraw is given by 5 d w d t a w u b w u 2 τ u in whith τ is the technical capacity to withdraw the water hyacinth plants the highest τ value corresponds to the shortest period for withdraw the plants from the pond and it can be obtained also through the logistic model as follows 6 n n 0 e t 99 τ taking into account that n is the number of individuals n 1 and n 0 is the initial condition of individuals with n 0 100 we have 7 1 100 e t 99 τ obtaining τ by the relation 8 τ ln 0 01 t 99 in which t 99 is the necessary time in order to remove 99 of the plants the control function u t show up in eq 5 in a non linear form satisfying the restriction 9 0 u t w t and initial condition 10 w 0 w 0 we aim to find the control function u t with t 0 t which satisfy the limitations 9 and which maximizes the functional 11 i 0 t τ u t dt w t in which the first term represents the amount of the water hyacinth biomass withdrew during the period of operation of the pond and the second term indicates the maximum amount of water hyacinth plants at the final moment t thus it is formulated the problem of the maximum performance of the pond considering only the temporal dynamic this optimal control problem was solved by rafikov and balthazar 2005 and costa et al 2003 through the application of pontryagin s maximum principle getting the control function 12 u t w ξ when w ξ 0 when w ξ in which the ξ value is given by 13 ξ a 2 b since the support capacity of the environment that limits the water hyacinth growth is given by a b value the ξ in 13 means that the control is applied when the amount of water hyacinth plants surpass half of the maximum support capacity of the pond corresponding to the optimal level replacing the control function 12 in the equation 5 we have 14 d w d t m τ w w t ξ w a b w w t ξ in whith m a 2 4b aτ 2b and the equations from 14 describe the variation of the plants in the pond considering the control application only when the plants population surpass the value 13 from equations in 14 we can observe that when the control is applied the ode 4 becomes linear due to the algebraic simplifications by replacing 12 in 5 both the equations in 14 have exact analytic solution in each instant t taking into account the initial condition 14 are given by 15 w t m w 0 m e τ t w t ξ a b w 0 w 0 a b w 0 e a t w t ξ therefore when we have a period wide enough of the pond operation i e t the solution in 15 tend to constant values thus when the population is under the effect of the control its growth increases only up to the desired level in the studies performed by kawai et al 1983 it was observed that water hyacinth growth is exponential over a certain time thereafter reaching a steady state phase the mathematical expression representing the growth curve of the water hyacinth plants obtained from experimental results is given by 16 w t 700 1 5 78 e 0 103 t where one obtains the parameters a and b of the model notice that 16 is the solution of the equation 4 without control and the same second equation in 14 in which the growth rate and the competition rate among the plants correspond to a 0 103t 1 and b 0 000147 m2g 1t 1 thus it is possible to determine the desired level of the population that stabilizes the biological system in 368 38 gm 2 and without control the population grows up to the support capacity at 700 68 gm 2 regarding this control strategy it is possible to determine the amount of water hyacinth plants that needs to be removed in daily basis 17 u t a 2 4 τ b corresponding to u t 18 04 gm 2 t 1 with τ 1 fig 1 shows the natural growth curves of the water hyacinth population considering the solution of the second equation in 14 taking into account both application without and with optimal control and initial condition w 0 100 gm 2 t 1 regarding the solution of the first equation in 14 we can observe that the control application starts from the 17th day and the density of water hyacinth plants under control stabilizes in 368 38 gm 2 t 1 3 2 control of the spatio temporal system considering a more realistic approach to the growth of water hyacinth we can take into account in addition of the growth of plants over time as they spread beneath the surface of the water in this way the control problem becomes a spatio temporal problem once determined the control function to the logistic growing based on the studies of costa et al 2003 and kawai et al 1983 we propose as the original contribution of this work the control for a system of aquatic plants considering both the temporal dynamic and spatial dispersion of the population thus we admit the existence of a control function u x t that can be used in the fischer kolmogorov pde 1 satisfying the following conditions the control function represents the amount of water hyacinth plant daily removed t in a certain space x the space considered is a channel fulfilled with residual water and the channel is from x 0 0 up to x l l the control function in space and time must drive the trajectories of the modeled biological system 1 to the desired equilibrium point therefore a control function that satisfies these conditions and includes the plants dispersal in the space based on the functions from the logistic model can be given by 18 u x t w x t ξ when w ξ 0 when w ξ in which ξ has the same dimension of w and it is equal to the found in the control application in eq 5 which the value was established by the theory of linear control with feedback for non linear systems through the application of the maximum principle inserted into eq 1 in the same way as the eq 12 was inserted in 5 replacing the control function 18 in the fisher kolmogorov equation 1 similarly as in 5 we have 19 w t d 2 w x 2 w u a b w u τ u w ξ d 2 w x 2 w a b w w ξ notice that the second equation of the system 19 is the fischer kolmogorov equation from the first equation we can find a new pde with the given control function as 20 w t d 2 w x 2 w ξ a b w ξ τ w ξ w t d 2 w x 2 a 2 b a a 2 τ w τ a 2 b w t d 2 w x 2 τ w a 2 4 b a τ 2 b in a simpler way we have 21 w t d 2 w x 2 τ w x t m in which τ is a constant representing the technical capacity to remove the plants according to 8 the initial conditions are given by 22 w x 0 w 0 and the boundary conditions in 21 are of neumann s type 23 w 0 t x 0 w l t x 0 t 0 indicating that there is no flow of plants in the channel borders this is because the aquatic plants depend on water to survive and the boundary represents the edge from the water to the ground then impairing the growth and as consequence the outflow of the plants from the channel observe that the equation 21 has the same form as the first equation in 14 taking into account that w t is now w x t and that there was added a diffusive term given by w x x moreover the pde 21 becomes linear with the addition of the control strategy thus it is possible to find a solution for this equation by well known methods found in literature for instance as the laplace transform fourier transform and separation of variables fourier method the pde 21 is defined in a finite domain 0 x l then one can use the finite fourier transform fft which is applied in problems in which the dominium interval of the variables under interest is finite i e if x is the variable that we intend to apply a finite transform then a l x b l in which a l and b l are finite numbers in space and l is the period of the function which can or cannot take the value of b l what depends on the domain of the function medrano balboa 1989 in order to utilize a fft sine or fft cosine according to medrano balboa 1989 it is necessary the analysis of some conditions in the pde order of the derivative with respect to x even or odd order of the boundary conditions even or odd for the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 we have the derivative in x even with order two and the boundary conditions are odd with order one therefore we can utilize the fft cosine given by 24 c f x f c n 0 b l f x cos n π x l d x in which n 0 1 2 3 and the inverse is given by 25 c 1 f c n f x 1 b l f c 0 2 b l n 1 f c n cos n π x b l and the transform of the derivative is presented as follows 26 c f 2 m x 1 m n π b l 2 m f c n 1 m p 1 m 1 p n π l 2 m p 1 1 n f 2 p 1 b l f 2 p 1 a l where m 1 2 3 is defined by the order of the boundary conditions now we can apply the fft cosine in all terms of the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 finding 27 c w t c d 2 w x 2 c w c m in which because the derivative of the equation have order two w w x t and m 1 by the property of the derivative 26 28 c d 2 w x 2 d c w 2 1 x d n π b l 2 1 w c n p 1 1 n π l 2 1 1 1 1 n w 2 1 2 b l w 2 1 2 a it has 29 p 1 1 n π l 2 1 1 1 1 n w 2 1 2 b l w 2 1 2 a 0 since w 0 b l and w 0 0 correspond to the boundary conditions 23 which are conditions of null flow therefore 30 c d 2 w x 2 c w 2 x d n π l 2 w c n t appling the fft in the derivative with respect to t produces 31 c w t w c t in w x t 32 c w w c n t and in the constant m obtain 33 c m 0 b l m cos n π x b l dx m replacing from 30 to 33 in the pde 21 becomes 34 w c t d n π l 2 w c n t w c n t m and then it has the ode 35 w c n t dt d n π l 2 1 w c n t m which can be solved by integrating factor considering s t e d n π l 2 1 t as the integrating factor thus one obtains 36 w c n t m d n π l 2 1 c 2 e d n π l 2 1 t taking into account that c 2 is a constant from the integration applying the fft cosine in the initial condition 22 yield 37 c w x 0 c w 0 38 w c n 0 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x thus through the initial condition transformation 37 we can determine the value of the constant c 2 39 c 2 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x and as a consequence we can rewrite the solution of the ode 35 as follows 40 w c n t m d n π l 2 1 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x e d n π l 2 1 t applying the fft cosine inverse in w c n t becomes 41 c 1 w c n t w x t 1 b l w c 0 t 2 b l n 1 w c cos n π x b l where 42 w c 0 t 1 e t 0 b l m d x e t 0 b l w 0 d x and then one obtains 43 w x t 1 b l w c 0 t 2 b l n 1 m d n π l 2 1 m d n π l 2 1 0 b l w 0 cos n π x b l d x e d n π l 2 1 t cos n π x b l with n 1 2 3 fig 2 shows the solution 43 of the fischer kolmogorov equation with control 21 with initial condition w x 0 140 gm 2t 1 fig 3 considers another initial condition w x 0 560 gm 2t 1 above the desired level of plants taking into account the diffusive coefficient d 1 33 m2t 1 determined from the information on diffusion of water hyacinth contained in the work of kawai et al 1983 therefore analyzing figs 2 and 3 one can observe that for each position in x the plants density is the same for each time period t moreover regardless the initial condition the amount of plants tend to stabilize throughout the time approaching 368 38 gm 2 t 1 i e the plants density stabilizes near the half of support capacity k 700 gm 2 t 1 which is the desired level according to experimental data from kawai et al 1983 after stabilization the management should be carried out daily allowing the maintenance of the population density around the desired level thus the management of the wastewater pond involves the daily control of the plant population for an efficient reduction of toxic products of water additionally to illustrate the efficiency of the control strategy proposed in this work we have considered other two types of initial conditions seeking for a more realist situation taking into account non constant initial conditions for example w x 0 x 2 shown in fig 4 thus one can see that a same initial instant can have different concentrations of plant it is remarkable the convergence of the plants density toward the equilibrium level when the density of the plants is above the desired level there is a decreasing otherwise when de density is lower there is an increase of the population by reproduction 3 3 analysis of the fischer kolmogorov model with two spatial variables the analysis performed in previous section corresponds to the unidimensional study of the growth of plant population from here we evaluate the population growth in two dimensions taking into account a channel with length and width or a stabilization pond for this to the unidimensional fischer kolmogorov equation 1 is added a second spatial variable y and one obtain the two dimensional fischer kolmogorov equation as follows 44 w t d 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 w a b w which can be rewritten in polar coordinates considering x r cos θ y r sin θ and θ arctan y x 45 w t d 2 w r 2 1 r w r 1 r 2 2 w θ 2 w a b w in 45 we have take the term 2 w θ 2 0 since the r size is independent of the angle θ position and then 46 w t d 2 w r 2 1 r w r w a b w thus seeks out a solution w x y t w r t however eq 46 does not have solutions like wavefront traveler in which a wave to spread with constant speed without change its shape this is due to the term 1 r which the equation does not becomes an ode in the wave variable z r ct on the other hand it is possible to observe according to murray 2001 by taking higher values of r the term 1 r w r tend to zero and becomes insignificant then by disregarding this term the solution will tend asymptotically to a solution like wavefront traveler with speed c 2 such as in the unidimensional case therefore taking into account those simplifications the solution of eq 46 with the radial variable r is equivalent to the solution of eq 44 in two spatial variables moreover considering the simplifications suggested the equation 46 is similar to eq 1 but in radial variable instead spatial and with the angular variable θ free thus in relation to the solution of the bidimensional system we can consider the populational densities obtained in 43 in radial terms fig 5 shows the evolution of the plants density in the stabilization pond with the initial condition w r 0 w 0 in each spatial position there is a specific time t and a specific plants density w that is fixed to each r size 4 discussion of results and ecological context the results of the computational simulations of the proposed plant control model are presented in figs 2 5 in figs 2 and 3 x represents the space m t the time days and w the density of plants given in biomass g m 2 t one can note that for the initial distribution given the population growth of plants in time occurs in the same way for each position in space in fig 4 the initial distribution of plants differs from one place to another due the w 0 x 2 we observe that at points close to 0 there is no need for control application while close to 1 there is need of withdrawal of plants in fig 5 a more realistic situation can be observed with the growth of the plants in radial terms as time progresses plants grow freely in all directions until they reach half of the support capacity where the application of control begins that is the daily withdrawal of plants to illustrate the proposed control model a schematic diagram of the aquatic plants control in a stabilization pond is presented in fig 6 in this scheme the initial condition is initially informed w 0 from this we insert the control function u into the system where it is calculated once known the control function is returned to the system feedback which allows finding the solution for w i e the desired population density level the results obtained in the temporal dynamics show that the control applied in the aquatic plants system aims to maintain 50 of biomass of the support capacity in the stabilization pond this was also obtained in terms of experimental results performed in costa et al 2003 where removal of toxic products from the water was analysed for the spatio temporal analysis this threshold was used in the present study to start the control other recent works such as mishra and maiti 2017 and saha et al 2017 show that the use of water hyacinth remains an ecologically efficient alternative to wastewater treatment however the cost of control by human management may become superior to other forms of control if adequate facilities are not available in order to apply this control with advantageous operating costs it is necessary that the spaces for the placement of wastewater are planned with easy access to the management of the plants in this way the use of water hyacinth presents itself as an ecological alternative aiding in the cleaning of wastewater this species can be found freely in nature in rivers and lakes in these environments the application of water hyacinth control presented in this paper becomes not feasible due to restricted access difficult withdrawal and to involve other restrictive factors which raises the level of complexity of the mathematical modeling and the control problem 5 concluding remarks in our study it was proposed a strategy of control for a system composed by aquatic plants population growing in a wastewater stabilization pond modeled by the non linear fisher kolmogorov equation firstly we have showed the control of the temporal dynamic utilizing the logistic model according to costa et al 2003 in which proposed an introduction of a method for control of plants population in polluted water the control functions were introduced in the model in a non linear way from this application we have proposed a control function u x t in fisher kolmogorov model with the same characteristics of the control function u t obtained from the temporal dynamics by the application of the pontryagins maximum principle although the mathematical modeling of aquatic plant management is complex with some constraints imposed on the model it is possible to describe spatio temporal dynamics through the fischer kolmogorov equation the insertion of the control function in the fischer kolmogorov equation resulted in a controlled model in which the equations were linear the pde with control was obtained in an approximate way by the finite fourier transform it was carried out an analysis of the fischer kolmogorov model in two dimensions x and y whence we have found that this model is equivalent to the one dimensional model x therefore we proposed the controlled model for fischer kolmogorov equation considering a radial variable by computational simulations it was possible to show that the control strategy was efficient to control the biological system reaching the desired level regardless the initial plants density in terms of the ecological efficiency our model of control applied in the system of water hyacinth plants indicated that the most efficient rate of removal of the plants is 50 of the total capacity of plants in the stabilization pond since it is well known for long time that the rate of plant growth is directly correlated with the rate of uptake resources ingestad and ågren 1992 these results are compatible with the experimental studies of the water hyacinth ponds for the treatment of piggery wastes performed by costa et al 2003 moreover the model showed that the removal of the plants should be spread in the whole area of the pond ideally in each square meter indicating that a spatial management shall be taking into account when planning the stabilization ponds therefore for this control to be applied with advantageous operational costs it is necessary that the spaces for the placement of wastewater be planned with easy access to the management of the plants in different points of the ponds acknowledgements the author daiane frighetto frighetto acknowledges the financial support of

25096,emergy analysis is one of the ecological thermodynamics methods with a specific set of indicators it is proved to be highly informative for sustainability assessment of national regional economies however a large amount of data needed for its calculation are from official statistical data by administrative divisions the spatialization of emergy in early researches were limited to the administrative boundaries the emergy inside an administrative boundary renders a single value which hides plenty of information for more precise regional planning this study develops a new methodology for mapping the spatial distribution of emergy density of a region the renewable resource distribution can be mapped based on latest geospatial datasets and gis technology instead of solely relying on statistics and yearbooks data besides a new spatialization method of non renewable emergy based on dmsp ols nighttime lights data is proposed combined with the radiation calibration data the problem of light saturation of dmsp ols nighttime lights data was solved to improve the emergy spatial detail of city centers with a case study of jing jin ji region results showed that this method could generate a high resolution map of emergy use and depict human disturbance to the environment in a more precise manner this may provide supportive information for more precise land use planning strategic layout and policy regulation and is helpful for regional sustainable development keywords emergy spatialization gis thermodynamic geography nighttime lights data 1 introduction 1 1 emergy analysis and its major difficulties in spatialization urban socio economic systems have complex impacts on the environment the formation and development of the city is based on the support by the surrounding natural environment in regional planning and territorial management we should not separate the urban areas from the surrounding natural areas instead we should treat urban socio economic and ecological systems as a whole huang 1998 emergy is a concept that can express the energy from the local and the offsite environment that supports it existence and development in terms of solar energy equivalents it was proposed by h t odum based on the principles of thermodynamics and system ecology theory it expresses the solar equivalent energy embodied in a product or a service or the sum of direct and indirect inputs of all kinds of energy needed to generate a product or a service odum 1971 1988 1996 emergy of a nation region takes into account all the renewable inputs such as sunlight wind rain geothermal heat as well as the non renewable inputs such as fossil energy and mineral resources of that nation region it establishes a unified dimension from an energy perspective and allows combining the study of ecosystem and economic systems from this point of view emergy analysis has the advantage of being very informative in regional system study and planning and has been widely used in regional scale fang and ren 2017 li et al 2014 su et al 2013 by using emergy analysis we can calculate the national regional solar equivalent energy flow and obtain a series of indicators that reflect the ecological and economic characteristics of the system and evaluate its sustainable development capabilities with the help of geographic information systems gis tools by visualizing emergy and emergy based indicators in space policymakers can intuitively review the comparison and correlation between different areas facilitate the adjustment of policies based on the characteristics of different regions and promote the coordination and sustainable development within and between regions due to the data sources used for traditional emergy analysis are statistical data and yearbook data most of the studies on the spatialization of emergy are based on administrative boundaries for example sweeney sweeney et al 2007 developed a global national emergy accounting database nead and produced emergy distribution maps of major countries in the world pulselli et al 2007 conducted an emergy zonal analysis for the cagliari province italy li et al 2014 and yu et al 2016 conducted an emergy analysis for 30 provinces in china and the pearl river delta region respectively comparing emergy indices at the provincial scale however by traditional mapping method the emergy values are homogeneous in the same administrative region and the true emergy distribution in a regional scale are hidden pulselli 2010 pointed out that most of the studies that combined emergy analysis and geographic information systems were based on the boundaries of administrative regions within an administrative region it is difficult to allocate emergy data at a high resolution with the existing statistical data the aggregation and dispersion of emergy in a region is difficult to understand and map and thus emergy analysis becomes less informative as requirements of regional regulation and planning become more and more accurate emergy researchers have been increasingly aware of the importance of making more elaborate emergy distribution maps and have made many efforts for example huang et al 2001 applied the emergy calculation results of 1178 administrative districts in taipei metropolitan region to the analysis of regional emergy spatial zoning map which shows that the taipei basin has an energy spatial structure composed of six homogenous zones mixed use urban core high density urban residential district service and manufacturing urban district agricultural district newly developed suburban district and natural area huang et al 2018 used a variety of data downscale methods in the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration under the condition of data scarcity of city level and conducted spatialization of emergy according to the city boundary although the divisional scale is getting more and more detailed it was still limited to the administrative boundaries with the progress of global ground monitoring remote sensing technology internet based big data sharing and gis technology the method of spatialization of renewable emergy has gradually matured arbault et al 2014 lee and brown 2018 mellino et al 2014 however for non renewable emergy producing a distribution map is still difficult because of the level of aggregation of the data for example data such as imports and exports industrial production etc are usually obtained from the statistical data of administrative units as a matter of fact the non renewable emergy for urban areas is quite vital because if accounts for most of the total emergy for cities since industrialization the growth of cities total emergy mainly depends on imported goods and services huang 1998 and emergy inputs converge in the cities among a region so a more precise non renewable emergy spatial distribution for urban areas is quite worthy of study in previous studies some researchers explored alternative methods to present the distribution of non renewable emergy more precisely pulselli 2010 allocated statistical data of four provinces in the abruzzo region of italy to 315 cities based on population area or number of employees in each manufacturing department and then used gis s interpolation algorithm to generate non administrative emergy distribution map with higher resolution huang et al 2007 constructed energy flow models for different types of land use and mapped the spatial heterogeneity of urban energy in the taipei metropolitan region in 1 km 1 km grids mellino et al 2015 used transport systems and building distribution maps to map human made capital in an attempt to represent the distribution of non renewables however roads and buildings can only represent the emergy in storages of human made capital which do not reflect the flows of emergy 1 2 nighttime lights data provide the possibility of emergy spatialization under the condition that spatially distributed statistical data is difficult to obtain researchers have found a strong correlation between regional nighttime lights data and non renewable empower which indicates that nighttime lights data may become a proxy measure for mapping the region s non renewable emergy distribution map at a higher resolution coscieme et al 2014 mellino et al 2013 nighttime lights data provides information about a complex thermodynamics based aggregate measure of human activity it has been widely used since they have been made available to the public for example nighttime lights data have been used to sketch city boundaries imhoff et al 1997 shi et al 2014a many studies have shown that the lit area or brightness of lights is highly correlated with population density gdp energy consumption carbon emissions etc doll et al 2000 elvidge et al 1997a 2001 shi et al 2014b nighttime lights data can be used as an alternative estimation method for data that are hard to collect by the statistics department for example using nighttime lights data combined with statistical data such as gdp energy consumption etc chen 2015 estimated some social indicators such as infant mortality and poverty rates in some less developed areas where the statistical census data is limited when natural disasters occur such as hurricanes fires earthquakes or regional armed conflicts it is difficult to obtain data on the ground however using nighttime lights satellites power outages electric power generation and transmission can be easily detected and the impact of natural disasters regional armed conflicts etc can be assessed coscieme et al 2016 elvidge et al 1996 besides it is possible to spatialize the statistical data that are difficult to spatialize otherwise at a higher resolution by using the correlation between nighttime lights data and socio economic indicators for example nighttime lights data has been used to map economic activity intensity ghosh et al 2010 carbon emission intensity rayner et al 2010 spatial distribution of population doll 2008 sutton 1997 electricity consumption townsend and bruce 2010 global poverty elvidge et al 2009 impervious surface elvidge et al 2007b food demands matsumura et al 2009 and steel usage in urban construction hsu et al 2013 etc the two most widely used series of nighttime lights data are the dmsp ols dataset available from 1992 to 2013 and the viirs dataset available from october 2011 till now the us air force s defense meteorological satellite program dmsp operational linescan system ols was originally designed for observing moonlit clouds to collect meteorological information for us air force due to its high photoelectric amplification effect gain effect in addition to detecting clouds it can detect low lights emitted by cities gas flares fires even small scale residential areas traffic patterns and fishing boats which can be used as an indicator of human activity elvidge et al 1997b elvidge et al 2001 the satellites of the dmsp ols are sun synchronous and circle the earth 14 times a day for night observations in various places it usually passes through the sky from 20 30 to 21 30 at local time the radiances in each cell of the light image is assigned a digital number dn value from 0 meaning no light to 63 meaning the saturated light value which means that the dns found in the ols data are relative values and not absolute light radiances in 1992 the national geophysical data center ngdc of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa established an electronic archive of dmsp ols data elvidge et al 1999 since then it provided dmsp ols yearly nighttime lights data from 1992 to 2013 the latest version v4 dmsp ols nighttime lights data can be downloaded from the noaa ngdc website https ngdc noaa gov eog dmsp html these data have a resolution of 30 arc seconds spanning from 180 to 180 longitude and 65 to 75 latitude basically covering all human inhabited regions on earth bennett and smith 2017 the impacts of sunlight moonlight glares clouds and aurora have been screened out to enhance the quality of the data the website provides nighttime lights data in four categories cloud free coverage data raw average data without noise removal noise removed stable light data and average lights times percent frequency data among them noise removed stable light data are widely used as verifications or supplements of socio economic statistical data such as power consumption and gdp amaral et al 2005 chand et al 2009 doll et al 2000 elvidge et al 2001 raupach et al 2010 fig 1 shows the 2012 dmsp ols global stable light image obtained from the website however light saturation phenomenon is one of the main limitations of dmsp ols data due to the high gain settings and the limited range of detected radiation of the sensor the dn value of ols data usually appears saturated dn 63 in bright urban areas hsu et al 2015 study has shown that more than one third of the urban areas in the united states present saturation values xie et al 2014 the phenomenon of saturated lights makes some features of the central area of the city are not fully reflected thus it reduces the availability of the data to present social and economic activities and restricts the applicability of using light data for urban research elvidge et al 2007a li et al 2013 the new generation suomi npp viirs nighttime lights data with finer resolution and wider detection dynamic range shows a stronger correlation with human activity indicators at more local scales elvidge et al 2013 however viirs is not superior to ols in all aspects for example it can detect wavelengths in the range of 505 890 nm but does not include led light below 500 nm as some cities begin to switch from high pressure sodium to more energy efficient led lighting viirs will erroneously detect a reduction in light radiation falchi et al 2016 while the wavelength range that ols can detect is slightly wider 0 4 μm to 1 1 μm and more led lights can be detected in addition viirs observes the earth s surface at about 1 30 a m local time bennett and smith 2017 at this time human activities that use artificial lighting are generally fewer than what observed at 20 30 to 21 30 therefore we consider that ols data is more suitable than viirs data for mapping regional emergy since it has more abundant lighting information and can depict human activities such as energy consumption more comprehensively researchers have pointed out that the nighttime lights data is a reliable means to obtain the distribution of non renewable emergy of a region coscieme et al 2014 mellino et al 2013 however they did not calibrate the urban lights in order to avoid the effect of saturation without correction this may lead to loss of information of the emergy spatial distribution in light saturated areas this paper aims at enhancing the applicability of dmsp ols nighttime lights data for mapping non renewable emergy for a region by applying a saturation correction method along with a direct gis based mapping method of renewable emergy a methodological framework of emergy spatialization for a region is proposed this method will provide a thermodynamics based metabolic geography of territorial systems and inform regional planning for sustainable development 2 material and methods 2 1 case study area in this paper jing jin ji region also known as beijing tianjin hebei is selected as a research case to practice the method of regional emergy spatialization jing jin ji region belongs to the warm temperate monsoon climate zone which is located in the northern area of the north china plain it is surrounded by the taihang mountains and the yanshan mountains in the west and the north and the coast of bohai sea in the east including two provincial cities beijing and tianjin and 11 prefecture level cities in hebei province baoding cangzhou chengde handan hengshui langfang qinhuangdao shijiazhuang tangshan xingtai and zhangjiakou it covers an area of approximately 216 000 km2 with a population of about 110 million in 2012 the regional gdp was approximately 5 76 trillion yuan huang et al 2018 jing jin ji region is not only one of the largest and most developed areas in northern china but also the strategic platform for china s economic growth transformation and upgrading and participation in global cooperation and competition in the new era since the reform and opening up the beijing tianjin hebei region has achieved remarkable achievements in the areas of economic development social security and transport infrastructure but it also faces low levels of regional integration lack of a regional organization of the labor system and severe environmental problems on the one hand ecological vulnerability is prominent and environmental issues have evolved from urban to regional ones on the other hand the development of urban systems has been unbalanced two big cities beijing and tianjin are the most developed but the urbanization of secondary central cities has been slower it can be seen from the land use map of the jing jin ji region for 2012 fig 2 that the residential and constructive areas in beijing and tianjin are larger and the 11 prefectural cities in hebei province are smaller where the main type of land use is cultivated land forestland and grassland breaking up the administrative divisions and studying the entire region as a whole rather than each administrative unit have been caught more and more attention 1 1 here should be an announcement that the city here indicates the administrative unit of the government in china the government names the entire area within the administrative boundary city including urban areas rural areas and natural areas 2 2 the emergy spatialization framework this study establishes a framework to spatialize emergy of a given region fig 3 the spatialization procedure is divided into two parts the renewable part and the non renewable part geospatial data provide data sources for the spatial distribution of regional environmental renewable resources and geographic information systems gis provide tools to calculate the corresponding emergy nighttime lights data are used to assign the non renewable emergy spatially into each prefectural city beforehand saturation correction method was applied to mitigate the light saturation phenomenon in city centers of dmsp ols data 2 2 1 data preparation the available data are as follows non renewable emergy data of the 13 cities in the study area for 2012 are acquired from the literature which was calculated from statistical data huang et al 2018 the geospatial datasets renewable resources nighttime lights datasets and land use map used in this study are listed in table 1 the distribution of surface average solar radiance for jing jin ji region was drawn by zheng et al 2012 which was based on the ground based solar radiation observation data from 1998 to 2005 davies 2013 developed a global geothermal heat map based on 38 374 global heat flow measurement points around the world wind speed map is from the nasa s power prediction of worldwide energy resources project data sets which provides long term average global wind speed at 50 m on a 0 5 arc degree resolution climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas chelsa dataset provides global raster data for monthly average precipitation from january 1979 to december 2013 with a resolution of 30 arc seconds the cgiar csi global high resolution soil water balance dataset provides hydrological raster data describing actual evapotranspiration aet and soil water deficit with resolution of 30 arc seconds the mean annual aet from 1950 to 2000 in this dataset is used in this study the digital elevation coverage is from jonathan de ferranti who developed and uploaded the whole world s digital elevation coverage maps at 3 and 15 arc second resolutions dmsp ols stable lights data for 2012 and the radiance calibrated data for 2010 2011 can be downloaded at noaa ngdc websites land use data of jing jin ji region of the year 2012 is from resource and environment data cloud platform of chinese academy of sciences cas all the spatial data are projected to the wgs 1984 utm zone 50 n coordinates system all the raster data are uniformed into 30 arc seconds 700 m at the latitude of the study area data with higher resolution are resampled and data with lower resolution are re gridded for the convenience of calculation the annual areal empower density is expressed in sej m 2 yr 1 2 2 2 spatialization of renewable emergy renewable resources are the part of the natural support that flows into the regional system generally the renewable inputs of a region include the tripartite solar tidal and geothermal secondary and tertiary inputs wind rain chemical potential runoff chemical potential and runoff geopotential for a regional area which contains few or none coastal areas tidal energy and runoff chemical potential energy can be excluded after the spatial data of every renewable resource was prepared the arcgis tool map algebra was used to calculate the available energy of each resource flowing into the system according to the energy calculation equations as follows then the transformities i e the conversion factors that account for the equivalent solar energy embodied in one unit of a product or service were used to calculate emergy table 2 and the total renewable emergy of the system was calculated according to the rules of the emergy algebra 2 2 2 1 available energy exergy calculation method 2 2 2 1 1 solar exergy using ground based solar observation data the solar radiation energy per unit area of the input system can be calculated according to eq 1 1 e s o l a r j m 2 yr i j m 2 yr 1 a k where i is the observed solar radiation per unit area a is the albedo 30 brown and ulgiati 2016 and k is the carnot efficiency 0 93 brown and ulgiati 2016 2 2 2 1 2 geothermal exergy the surface heat flow energy distribution map is presented by davies 2013 and an average carnot efficiency of 69 based on a weighted average of carnot efficiencies for crustal mantel and core sources was used to converted to exergy lee and brown 2018 2 2 2 1 3 wind energy the energy of the wind absorbed by the surface of each square meter is calculated by eqs 2 and 3 brown and ulgiati 2016 2 v v r e f h h r e f α where v is the geostrophic wind speed v r e f is the wind speed at the reference wind height h r e f is the reference wind

produced by rain is composed by two main elements the energy generated by evapotranspiration chemical and the energy of runoff physical the chemical potential energy of water that is used by terrestrial vegetation within each cell is the water that is evapotranspired lee and brown 2018 mellino et al 2014 the evapotranspiration energy can be obtained by multiplying the mass of rainwater evaporating in the area by the gibbs free energy of rainwater eq 4 and the emergy distribution map of rain chemical potential is produced by multiplying the evapotranspiration chemical potential energy and its transformity 4 e c h e m m g where e c h e m is the chemical potential energy in each cell of the raster data i e the image m is the mass of evapotranspired water from each cell and g is the gibbs free energy of rain i e 4 723 j g 2 2 2 1 5 runoff geopotential energy runoff can be calculated by the water budget equation 5 r p e i where r accounts for the runoff p for the precipitation e for the evapotranspiration and i for the infiltration in this study it will be partially simplified that the infiltration is part of the runoff so r p e and the runoff map is generated by mapping the difference between precipitation data and evapotranspiration data eq 6 is used to obtain the geopotential energy of runoff 6 e g e o p o t e n t i a l m g h where e g e o p o t e n t i a l is the geopotential energy of runoff in each cell of the raster data m is the mass of runoff in each cell g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 8 m s2 and h is the average altitude in each cell 2 2 2 2 renewable emergy maps the emergy map of each renewable resource is obtained by multiplying its energy with its transformity the renewable empower distribution map of the study area was generated by taking the maximum value between the sum of the solar tidal and geothermal inputs and the largest of the secondary and tertiary inputs wind rain runoff for each cell according to the algorithm developed by brown and ulgiati 2016 which can be expressed by eq 7 cell statistics tool in arcgis was used to extract the maximum value for each cell of the raster data 7 r e n e w a b l e m a x s u m s o l a r g e o t h e r m a l t i d e m a x w i n d r a i n r u n o f f 2 2 3 saturation correction method of dmsp ols data elvidge et al 1999 firstly proposed a method of radiance calibration to correct the saturation of dmsp ols image at high gain settings the dmsp ols sensor can detect low lights while urban centers are saturated turning the gain setting down can reduce the detected radiance therefore different ranges of radiation could be obtained by setting different fixed gains 15 db 35 db and 55 db and then different fixed gain images were merged to generate a light image without saturation this method directly adjusts the gain of the sensor and can resolve light saturation of the sensor from the source it has also been continuously used and improved ziskin et al 2010 improved the weighting method for different fixed gain images synthesis and made the splice of images more continuous and smooth and produced the global radiation calibration light image for 2006 hsu et al 2015 presented an improved methodological framework for producing calibrated light images which use the stable lights image as a supplement to the final radiation calibration image to make up for the detection of some low lights may be missing since the quantity of images at fixed gain settings is limited a total of eight global datasets have been produced representing years from 1996 to 2011 table 3 available at https ngdc noaa gov eog dmsp download radcal html last accessed on july 2018 but the gain setting approach is time and cost consuming this method is unlikely to be used to correct the entire historical nighttime lights archive elvidge et al 1999 in order to compensate for the discontinuity of the radiation calibration product researchers have proposed various methods for calibrating the saturation of dmsp ols nighttime light images in other ways hara et al 2004 and letu et al 2010 applied linear regression model and cubic regression model respectively which assumed that the dn value of the light increases linearly or cubically when approaching the light saturated center of the city it was found that the correlation between the calibrated light data and the urban power consumption in several cities in japan increased from r2 0 6876 to r2 0 725 and to r2 0 8264 respectively these methods assumed that the changes of lights in city centers followed certain mathematical models which may cause that the light changes in the saturated areas are too idealistic on a micro level and were not widely used lu et al 2008 and zhang et al 2013 combined the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from modis images and proposed his and vanui methods respectively they found correlations between urbanization level and vegetation health and abundance raupach et al 2010 used population density to mitigate the saturation problem of nighttime light images around the world after their correction the correlations between the light data and gdp energy consumption and co2 emissions became stronger than the uncorrected ones these methods can be used for correcting long term time series of nighttime lights imagery however they require other data that describe human activities as supplements which do not represent a direct solution to the problem of saturation as we are going to study human activities from nighttime lights data a direct calibration that does not rely on further external data is preferable letu et al 2012 sought to calibrate the saturated stable lights images using existing series of radiation calibration data table 3 with satisfactory results they applied a certain mathematical method and gis tools to calibrate the saturated pixels of the 1999 stable lights images by 1996 1997 radiation calibration data the correlation between electricity consumption of several cities in japan and its calibrated light data rose to r2 0 9273 higher than by using other methods in the same study context this paper applies this saturation correction method the latest radiance calibration data is from hsu et al 2015 and the closest radiation calibrated data to 2012 stable lights data is the data from january 11 2010 to july 31 2011 table 3 the flowchart of stable lights correction method is displayed in fig 4 in short all the unsaturated lights data in 2012 stable lights image are kept and the saturated part is replaced by the radiation calibrated data that after a regressive transformation the regressive transformation is used to transform the 2010 2011 radiation calibrated light image in order to minimize the light radiance difference from 2012 stable lights image using the sample tool in arcgis and sampling every paired cell values at same location from the 2010 2011 radiation calibrated light image as well as the 2012 stable lights image we discovered that the first saturated stable light dn 63 occurred when the radiation calibration light cell s dn value was 53 94 dn 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image could be a saturation cut off threshold in other words cells at the location of whose dn values are less than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated images are all unsaturated in the 2012 stable lights image but it doesn t mean that cells at the location of whose dn values are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image are all saturated in the 2012 stable lights image it means that the saturation phenomenon starts to appear in the 2012 stable lights image where the dn values are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image the reason for this is the acquisition of stable lights images was based on satellites that could auto adjust gain setting which means that saturation does not occur immediately when the radiation reaches the detection limit as the actual radiation increases the dn value gradually shifts to the saturation value hsu et al 2015 there are still unsaturated cells in the 2012 stable lights image where the dn values of cells are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image but dn 53 94 is the threshold that was used to establish the regression model of the stable lights cell values and radiance calibrated cell values at the same positions r2 0 88 fig 5 then the regression equation was used to transform the radiance calibrated data by using the raster calculator tool in arcgis the extract by attributes tool was used to extract the light saturated cells dn 63 from the 2012 stable lights image subsequently a mask made up of these cells was used to extract the transformed radiance calibrated data at the corresponding position by the extract by mask tool the dn values of light saturated cells in stable lights data were turned into zero by the raster calculator tool finally the extracted saturation corrected cells and the stable lights without saturated cells were overlaid to generate the saturation corrected stable lights image 2 2 4 spatialization of non renewable emergy eq 8 was used to spatialize the non renewable emergy of each city in the study area 8 y i j x i j s o l j n i j where j represents a city and i represents a raster cell in the city j y i j is the non renewable emergy of the i th cell in city j x i j is the saturation corrected light value of the i th cell in city j n i j is the non renewable emergy of city j and s o l j is the sum of lights of the saturation corrected stable lights of city j thus the non renewable emergy was distributed to each cell of each city and then the grid non renewable emergy distribution data of each city in the urban agglomeration were spliced together to generate the non renewable emergy distribution map of the urban agglomeration 2 2 5 thermodynamic geography indicators 2 2 5 1 empower density by summing up the renewable and the non renewable empower total empower distribution map of the study region can be produced the values of the raster cells are summed up with the raster calculator tool in arcgis the empower density of a city can be used as a development density parameter which can reflect the level of urbanization and the wealth of residents lee and braham 2017 we can also observe the different level of urban development better by making comparisons between cities it should be noted that the boundary of city in china include urban areas rural areas and natural areas it may be different in other countries of the world so we should pay attention to this issue when making such comparisons in this study the residential and constructive areas of beijing tianjin hebei were extracted as urban areas by using land use map since the emergy baselines used in different years of researches can be different the emergy data should be unified into a same baseline before comparison in this study the data were all reported to the latest 1 20e 25 sej yr emergy baseline brown et al 2016 2 2 5 2 spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i tool in arcgis measures spatial autocorrelation based on feature locations and attribute values given a set of features and an associated attribute the tool evaluates whether the pattern expressed by the features attributes is clustered dispersed or random the global moran s i index is generally between 1 and 1 it indicates a clustered trend when the index value is positive and the closer to 1 the more clustered negative index value indicates dispersed trend and the closer to 1 the more dispersed the tool calculates the moran s i index value and both z score and p value to evaluate the significance of the results appendix a we can quantify the aggregation extent of emergy spatially by the help of this index mitchell 2005 the raster format data should be converted into features before using this tool 2 2 5 3 landscape development intensity index ldi ldi was proposed by brown and vivas 2005 and has been widely used to measure the gradients of human disturbance in wetlands carey et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a b areas with high levels of human disturbance are usually characterized by intensive material and energy consumption human activities and environmental pollution in this paper ldi index map is generated to see the spatial distribution characteristics of human disturbance gradients in the study area ldi index for each cell of the map can be calculated by eq 9 9 l d i i 10 l o g 10 u i r i where u i refers to the total renewable plus non renewable empower of the i th cell and r i refers to the renewable empower of the i th cell the spatial variation coefficient svc of ldi index of a region is the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean which can measure the dispersion of the distribution of ldi index of a region because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data for comparison between data sets with different means coefficient of variation is more comparable instead of the standard deviation a lower spatial variation coefficient means a more evenly distributed of human disturbance whereas a higher spatial variation coefficient means a more dispersed or unevenly distributed of human disturbance 3 results and discussions 3 1 nighttime lights saturation correction and the non renewable empower map as a result of saturation correction the dn range of the nighttime light imagery was expanded from the previous 0 63 to 0 1808 51 fig 6 b two night light profiles were created along an axis through the center of beijing fig 6 and the dn values of these two profiles are presented in fig 7 evidencing how much more detail can be gained through saturation correction it can be seen that before the correction the central area of the city showed a saturation value of 63 in a large range the dynamic characteristics of this part of the light were revealed after correction where the maximum corrected dn value is 1432 nearly 23 times higher than the maximum dn value before correction it is clear how light saturation correction is a crucial operational step especially in cities where the saturated pixels occupy a large proportion of the city area saturation correction can greatly enrich the understanding and visualization of the thermodynamic spatial characteristics of urban centers 3 2 renewable empower maps the emergy of renewable resources of the jing jin ji region was spatialized at a resolution of 30 arc second fig 8 it can be seen that the renewable emergy in jing jin ji region does not present a large spatial heterogeneity the driving force of the renewable emergy at each location can be identified by the spatial analysis tool highest position in arcgis under the influence of a typical monsoon climate wind and rain are the dominant renewable resources of the region fig 9 wind emergy is prominent in the north of zhangjiakou and chengde and rain chemical potential emergy is prominent in most other places in jing jin ji region cities can be ranked based on the available renewable emergy its density and the average density of different land use types of the jing jin jin region can be also ranked appendix b it can be seen that chengde and zhangjiakou rank the top two of total renewable emergy the flow of natural emergy in these two cities is relatively abundant mainly because of their large land area since the average density of renewable empowers of these two cities are not highly ranked although the total renewable emergy of qinhuangdao is not highly ranked because of its limited area it shows high values of renewable empower density langfang and hengshui are characterized by the lowest two of renewable emergy these cities have fewer natural resource availability and host less healthy environments compared to other cities in the region unused land has the highest renewable empower density values followed by water area forestland residential and constructive area and cropland ranks the lowest these messages can assist a better energy and land use planning for example we can see the distribution of renewable resources and use them where appropriate identifying ecosystems that with smaller renewable emergy might be relatively fragile so it needs to be carefully protected to maximize renewable resource availability unused land should not be developed as residential and constructive area etc 3 3 total empower density map total empower density map with a resolution of 30 arc second is shown in fig 10 it is almost the same as the non renewable empower density map because compared to non renewable emergy e 14 sej m 2 yr 1 the magnitude of renewable emergy e 10 sej m 2 yr 1 is too small there is nothing different when summing the renewable into the non renewable so non renewable empower density map is not specifically displayed in this paper as we can see from fig 10 beijing and tianjin have the largest and the most concentrated emergy consumption in jing jin ji region which indicates that they are the most developed in this region beijing has one large empower concentration area in the city center spreading outwards in a star shape while tianjin has two relatively independent emergy concentration areas in the city center and in the binhai new area but we can also see that the empower density of the two areas of tianjin is higher than that of beijing and has a tendency of connecting together as a whole if it is not controlled tianjin has the danger of forming a big pie like urban development like beijing other cities in the hebei province have much smaller emergy concentration areas at the city center or at the coastal area and the empower density suddenly decreases outward from the concentration area which shows that the sizes of the cities in hebei province are much smaller and less developed furthermore we can make comparisons of the empower density between cities table 4 it can be seen that the empower density in the urban area of tianjin 7 88e 14 is the highest in the jing jin ji region a little higher than macau 6 09e 14 but lower than manhattan new york 2 28e 15 and harlem new york 1 78e 15 the beijing urban area and province the tianjin province and the hebei urban areas have lower empower density than macao but larger than rome 8 11e 13 and taipei 6 76e 13 the hebei province ranks the lowest 3 83e 13 in terms of empower density among the cities and areas investigated table 4 in the jing jin ji region the empower densities in all urban areas are much greater than within the city boundaries in the tianjin urban area the emergy density is 2 42 times larger than its province the same ratio is 3 43 in beijing and 3 20 in hebei these results indicate that the level of urbanization and the wealth of residents of tianjin urban area are close to the cities of developed countries but there is still lots of room for improvement too much rural areas inside the city boundary in china have dragged down the total level of urbanization and the wealth of residents of the city 3 4 spatial autocorrelation of total empower in jing jin ji region the global moran s i index of each city investigated is above 0 85 which indicates that the total empower of all the cities in the jing jin ji region is very concentrated beijing tianjin and qinhuangdao show the highest concentration i e 0 982850 0 962132 and 0 937601 respectively appendix c the global moran s i of the entire region including the areas of all the provinces is 0 96 slightly smaller than the value for tianjin this indicates that the total emergy used in beijing and tianjin is not only very concentrated but also very large the results are statistically significant and all the confidence levels are greater than 99 appendix c 3 5 the human disturbance gradients map the distribution of the ldi index of the jing jin ji region is showed in fig 11 the darker spots indicate higher human disturbance to the ecosystem table 5 shows the ldi indices for each city in the jing jin ji region the average ldi of beijing is the fourth lowest among 13 cities just slightly higher than chengde zhangjiakou and qinhuangdao and significantly lower than its neighbors tianjin and langfang which can be an evidence that some of the high energy consumed industries have moved out of beijing to neighboring cities tianjin and langfang have the highest average ldi 32 54 and 30 25 and the lowest spatial variation coefficient svc 31 and 15 indicating that the human disturbance of the environment is large and the area developed and utilized by humans is large and uniform chengde and zhangjiakou have the lowest ldi average 3 94 and 6 06 and the highest svc 257 and 195 indicating that human disturbance is relatively small but uneven which means that some zones are characterized by high human disturbance degree in an overall relatively low human disturbance background table 6 shows the results of the overlay analysis of the ldi map and the land use map residential and constructive area have the highest ldi average 30 13 and the lowest svc 35 indicating that these areas have the highest intensity in human disturbance but evenly distributed energy and resource consumption patterns forestland and grassland have the lowest ldi averages 4 51 and 6 91 and the highest svcs 234 and 183 this shows that although the overall level of human disturbances in grassland and forestland is low there are significant differences in the level of disturbances some areas have ldi values as high as 49 35 and 52 52 cropland and water area also show high human disturbance levels ldi averages are 21 57 and 22 29 some of the areas where outside residential and constructive areas that show ldi values almost as high as residential and constructive areas on the one hand it can be explained that some non residential and constructive areas are also severely interfered by humans on the other hand it may technically due to the blooming effect of dmsp ols light data blooming effect means that the lit areas extend beyond the source s true illuminated area mainly because of the limited resolution and the producing procedure of the imagery averaging the adjacent input cells to produce output cell bennett and smith 2017 it is not difficult to understand that the lights of one area do not exactly light inside the boundary it definitely will illuminate adjacent areas include cropland grassland water area etc through the light transmission this issue is more pervasive over water and snow areas as these reflect nearby lights more than dark ground xie et al 2014 this problem is quite troublesome when studying cities because it can result in overestimation of features such as urban extent small and elvidge 2013 however when we studying the human disturbance in the landscape not only do we not think that it is a problem but we consider that it is a good indicator that reflects the spatial extent of human disturbance because the human disturbance of the ecosystem is probably not exactly inside the human settlements boundary as the land use map shows human activities inside the residential and constructive area may affect the adjacent cropland water area grassland and forest the human lights that intrude into the adjacent land can reflect the impact of human activities that penetrated to other land use types 3 6 limitations there are several limitations to this study regarding the renewable emergy due to the data availability some spatial data are only long term average values rather than specific values for the resource flow per year i e geothermal energy wind speed solar radiation and evapotranspiration in addition some of the distribution maps are obtained by interpolation of monitoring data and the resolution of some satellite based data is fairly low which may cause some uncertainties these limitations will be minimized with the improvement of monitoring and mapping technology and then people could retrieve better datasets another limitation is the transformities of renewable resources used in this study transformities of a specific energy flow can vary based on the processes or location lee and brown 2018 we used transformities from latest literature however it is well understood that transformities at the local scale may vary from the global average data the main limitation encountered regarding the spatialization of non renewable emergy emerged from the saturation correction method a linear regression model was applied to modify the 2010 2011 radiance calibration image in order to minimize the differences between its lights data and the stable lights data in 2012 it is assumed that the actual light radiation in the saturated part in stable lights image changed as the same mode as the unsaturated part between the two data however there is no available data to confirm that the actual radiation of the saturated lights in the urban centers of the jing jin ji region changes like that mode some researchers consider that since most of the cities in china are still in rapid development the actual radiation changes over time in light saturated areas of urban centers might be unpredictable ma et al 2014 but we are more willing to believe that it is not significant in one or two years 4 conclusions emergy is a measure of environmental support from an energy perspective that goes into the system it provides a quantitative way of measuring the global and the local impact on the environment the impact of cities goes far beyond its boundary because it must bring resources from all over the planet to support its development the impact globally can be measured by the quantity of emergy necessary to support it and the impact of locally can be measured by the ldi in this study we developed a method to spatialize a high resolution 30 arc second emergy distribution map of a region through which we can identify the hot spots of emergy use spatial patterns of emergy flows and human disturbance gradients etc which can monitor and map human activities and development and guide for more accurate and specific sustainable planning strategy that break through the limits of administrative boundaries based on gis technologies and environmental geospatial databases it is feasible to generate maps of the spatial distribution of renewable emergy due to the availability of statistical data non renewable emergy distribution map for a region usually display in administrative boundary patched way nighttime lights data is an applicable proxy for spatializing non renewable emergy which can further improve the spatial detail of emergy mapping it is noteworthy that the saturation correction for dmsp ols data is crucial especially in urban areas in order to study the spatial thermodynamics of a region better from the case study of jing jin ji region we can conclude that the empower density and ldi maps of cities for the year 2012 can be evidences of development status and policies implemented in the past as municipalities beijing and tianjin were most developed while cities in hebei were far away behind before and after 2008 olympics in order to ensure good environment conditions for the beijing large numbers of beijing s industrial enterprises migrated outward mainly to areas in neighboring cities such as tianjin langfang tangshan and cangzhou zhang et al 2014a b at the same time the upper reaches of beijing areas in chengde and zhangjiakou strictly controlled industrial development and protected the environment zhang 2009 long term research will better interpret the changes and transmissions of spatial thermodynamics of a region which is one of the future study scopes meanwhile from the ldi and land use map we found that some areas of cropland water area grassland and forest are suffering acute human disturbance which indicates that the real human disturbance can extend beyond the human settlements area that mapped in land use map the blooming effect of dmsp ols data may help to measure the real human disturbance spatial extent which is also one of the interesting points for further research acknowledgments this work is supported by the projects of sino italian cooperation of china natural science foundation cnsc no

25096,emergy analysis is one of the ecological thermodynamics methods with a specific set of indicators it is proved to be highly informative for sustainability assessment of national regional economies however a large amount of data needed for its calculation are from official statistical data by administrative divisions the spatialization of emergy in early researches were limited to the administrative boundaries the emergy inside an administrative boundary renders a single value which hides plenty of information for more precise regional planning this study develops a new methodology for mapping the spatial distribution of emergy density of a region the renewable resource distribution can be mapped based on latest geospatial datasets and gis technology instead of solely relying on statistics and yearbooks data besides a new spatialization method of non renewable emergy based on dmsp ols nighttime lights data is proposed combined with the radiation calibration data the problem of light saturation of dmsp ols nighttime lights data was solved to improve the emergy spatial detail of city centers with a case study of jing jin ji region results showed that this method could generate a high resolution map of emergy use and depict human disturbance to the environment in a more precise manner this may provide supportive information for more precise land use planning strategic layout and policy regulation and is helpful for regional sustainable development keywords emergy spatialization gis thermodynamic geography nighttime lights data 1 introduction 1 1 emergy analysis and its major difficulties in spatialization urban socio economic systems have complex impacts on the environment the formation and development of the city is based on the support by the surrounding natural environment in regional planning and territorial management we should not separate the urban areas from the surrounding natural areas instead we should treat urban socio economic and ecological systems as a whole huang 1998 emergy is a concept that can express the energy from the local and the offsite environment that supports it existence and development in terms of solar energy equivalents it was proposed by h t odum based on the principles of thermodynamics and system ecology theory it expresses the solar equivalent energy embodied in a product or a service or the sum of direct and indirect inputs of all kinds of energy needed to generate a product or a service odum 1971 1988 1996 emergy of a nation region takes into account all the renewable inputs such as sunlight wind rain geothermal heat as well as the non renewable inputs such as fossil energy and mineral resources of that nation region it establishes a unified dimension from an energy perspective and allows combining the study of ecosystem and economic systems from this point of view emergy analysis has the advantage of being very informative in regional system study and planning and has been widely used in regional scale fang and ren 2017 li et al 2014 su et al 2013 by using emergy analysis we can calculate the national regional solar equivalent energy flow and obtain a series of indicators that reflect the ecological and economic characteristics of the system and evaluate its sustainable development capabilities with the help of geographic information systems gis tools by visualizing emergy and emergy based indicators in space policymakers can intuitively review the comparison and correlation between different areas facilitate the adjustment of policies based on the characteristics of different regions and promote the coordination and sustainable development within and between regions due to the data sources used for traditional emergy analysis are statistical data and yearbook data most of the studies on the spatialization of emergy are based on administrative boundaries for example sweeney sweeney et al 2007 developed a global national emergy accounting database nead and produced emergy distribution maps of major countries in the world pulselli et al 2007 conducted an emergy zonal analysis for the cagliari province italy li et al 2014 and yu et al 2016 conducted an emergy analysis for 30 provinces in china and the pearl river delta region respectively comparing emergy indices at the provincial scale however by traditional mapping method the emergy values are homogeneous in the same administrative region and the true emergy distribution in a regional scale are hidden pulselli 2010 pointed out that most of the studies that combined emergy analysis and geographic information systems were based on the boundaries of administrative regions within an administrative region it is difficult to allocate emergy data at a high resolution with the existing statistical data the aggregation and dispersion of emergy in a region is difficult to understand and map and thus emergy analysis becomes less informative as requirements of regional regulation and planning become more and more accurate emergy researchers have been increasingly aware of the importance of making more elaborate emergy distribution maps and have made many efforts for example huang et al 2001 applied the emergy calculation results of 1178 administrative districts in taipei metropolitan region to the analysis of regional emergy spatial zoning map which shows that the taipei basin has an energy spatial structure composed of six homogenous zones mixed use urban core high density urban residential district service and manufacturing urban district agricultural district newly developed suburban district and natural area huang et al 2018 used a variety of data downscale methods in the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration under the condition of data scarcity of city level and conducted spatialization of emergy according to the city boundary although the divisional scale is getting more and more detailed it was still limited to the administrative boundaries with the progress of global ground monitoring remote sensing technology internet based big data sharing and gis technology the method of spatialization of renewable emergy has gradually matured arbault et al 2014 lee and brown 2018 mellino et al 2014 however for non renewable emergy producing a distribution map is still difficult because of the level of aggregation of the data for example data such as imports and exports industrial production etc are usually obtained from the statistical data of administrative units as a matter of fact the non renewable emergy for urban areas is quite vital because if accounts for most of the total emergy for cities since industrialization the growth of cities total emergy mainly depends on imported goods and services huang 1998 and emergy inputs converge in the cities among a region so a more precise non renewable emergy spatial distribution for urban areas is quite worthy of study in previous studies some researchers explored alternative methods to present the distribution of non renewable emergy more precisely pulselli 2010 allocated statistical data of four provinces in the abruzzo region of italy to 315 cities based on population area or number of employees in each manufacturing department and then used gis s interpolation algorithm to generate non administrative emergy distribution map with higher resolution huang et al 2007 constructed energy flow models for different types of land use and mapped the spatial heterogeneity of urban energy in the taipei metropolitan region in 1 km 1 km grids mellino et al 2015 used transport systems and building distribution maps to map human made capital in an attempt to represent the distribution of non renewables however roads and buildings can only represent the emergy in storages of human made capital which do not reflect the flows of emergy 1 2 nighttime lights data provide the possibility of emergy spatialization under the condition that spatially distributed statistical data is difficult to obtain researchers have found a strong correlation between regional nighttime lights data and non renewable empower which indicates that nighttime lights data may become a proxy measure for mapping the region s non renewable emergy distribution map at a higher resolution coscieme et al 2014 mellino et al 2013 nighttime lights data provides information about a complex thermodynamics based aggregate measure of human activity it has been widely used since they have been made available to the public for example nighttime lights data have been used to sketch city boundaries imhoff et al 1997 shi et al 2014a many studies have shown that the lit area or brightness of lights is highly correlated with population density gdp energy consumption carbon emissions etc doll et al 2000 elvidge et al 1997a 2001 shi et al 2014b nighttime lights data can be used as an alternative estimation method for data that are hard to collect by the statistics department for example using nighttime lights data combined with statistical data such as gdp energy consumption etc chen 2015 estimated some social indicators such as infant mortality and poverty rates in some less developed areas where the statistical census data is limited when natural disasters occur such as hurricanes fires earthquakes or regional armed conflicts it is difficult to obtain data on the ground however using nighttime lights satellites power outages electric power generation and transmission can be easily detected and the impact of natural disasters regional armed conflicts etc can be assessed coscieme et al 2016 elvidge et al 1996 besides it is possible to spatialize the statistical data that are difficult to spatialize otherwise at a higher resolution by using the correlation between nighttime lights data and socio economic indicators for example nighttime lights data has been used to map economic activity intensity ghosh et al 2010 carbon emission intensity rayner et al 2010 spatial distribution of population doll 2008 sutton 1997 electricity consumption townsend and bruce 2010 global poverty elvidge et al 2009 impervious surface elvidge et al 2007b food demands matsumura et al 2009 and steel usage in urban construction hsu et al 2013 etc the two most widely used series of nighttime lights data are the dmsp ols dataset available from 1992 to 2013 and the viirs dataset available from october 2011 till now the us air force s defense meteorological satellite program dmsp operational linescan system ols was originally designed for observing moonlit clouds to collect meteorological information for us air force due to its high photoelectric amplification effect gain effect in addition to detecting clouds it can detect low lights emitted by cities gas flares fires even small scale residential areas traffic patterns and fishing boats which can be used as an indicator of human activity elvidge et al 1997b elvidge et al 2001 the satellites of the dmsp ols are sun synchronous and circle the earth 14 times a day for night observations in various places it usually passes through the sky from 20 30 to 21 30 at local time the radiances in each cell of the light image is assigned a digital number dn value from 0 meaning no light to 63 meaning the saturated light value which means that the dns found in the ols data are relative values and not absolute light radiances in 1992 the national geophysical data center ngdc of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa established an electronic archive of dmsp ols data elvidge et al 1999 since then it provided dmsp ols yearly nighttime lights data from 1992 to 2013 the latest version v4 dmsp ols nighttime lights data can be downloaded from the noaa ngdc website https ngdc noaa gov eog dmsp html these data have a resolution of 30 arc seconds spanning from 180 to 180 longitude and 65 to 75 latitude basically covering all human inhabited regions on earth bennett and smith 2017 the impacts of sunlight moonlight glares clouds and aurora have been screened out to enhance the quality of the data the website provides nighttime lights data in four categories cloud free coverage data raw average data without noise removal noise removed stable light data and average lights times percent frequency data among them noise removed stable light data are widely used as verifications or supplements of socio economic statistical data such as power consumption and gdp amaral et al 2005 chand et al 2009 doll et al 2000 elvidge et al 2001 raupach et al 2010 fig 1 shows the 2012 dmsp ols global stable light image obtained from the website however light saturation phenomenon is one of the main limitations of dmsp ols data due to the high gain settings and the limited range of detected radiation of the sensor the dn value of ols data usually appears saturated dn 63 in bright urban areas hsu et al 2015 study has shown that more than one third of the urban areas in the united states present saturation values xie et al 2014 the phenomenon of saturated lights makes some features of the central area of the city are not fully reflected thus it reduces the availability of the data to present social and economic activities and restricts the applicability of using light data for urban research elvidge et al 2007a li et al 2013 the new generation suomi npp viirs nighttime lights data with finer resolution and wider detection dynamic range shows a stronger correlation with human activity indicators at more local scales elvidge et al 2013 however viirs is not superior to ols in all aspects for example it can detect wavelengths in the range of 505 890 nm but does not include led light below 500 nm as some cities begin to switch from high pressure sodium to more energy efficient led lighting viirs will erroneously detect a reduction in light radiation falchi et al 2016 while the wavelength range that ols can detect is slightly wider 0 4 μm to 1 1 μm and more led lights can be detected in addition viirs observes the earth s surface at about 1 30 a m local time bennett and smith 2017 at this time human activities that use artificial lighting are generally fewer than what observed at 20 30 to 21 30 therefore we consider that ols data is more suitable than viirs data for mapping regional emergy since it has more abundant lighting information and can depict human activities such as energy consumption more comprehensively researchers have pointed out that the nighttime lights data is a reliable means to obtain the distribution of non renewable emergy of a region coscieme et al 2014 mellino et al 2013 however they did not calibrate the urban lights in order to avoid the effect of saturation without correction this may lead to loss of information of the emergy spatial distribution in light saturated areas this paper aims at enhancing the applicability of dmsp ols nighttime lights data for mapping non renewable emergy for a region by applying a saturation correction method along with a direct gis based mapping method of renewable emergy a methodological framework of emergy spatialization for a region is proposed this method will provide a thermodynamics based metabolic geography of territorial systems and inform regional planning for sustainable development 2 material and methods 2 1 case study area in this paper jing jin ji region also known as beijing tianjin hebei is selected as a research case to practice the method of regional emergy spatialization jing jin ji region belongs to the warm temperate monsoon climate zone which is located in the northern area of the north china plain it is surrounded by the taihang mountains and the yanshan mountains in the west and the north and the coast of bohai sea in the east including two provincial cities beijing and tianjin and 11 prefecture level cities in hebei province baoding cangzhou chengde handan hengshui langfang qinhuangdao shijiazhuang tangshan xingtai and zhangjiakou it covers an area of approximately 216 000 km2 with a population of about 110 million in 2012 the regional gdp was approximately 5 76 trillion yuan huang et al 2018 jing jin ji region is not only one of the largest and most developed areas in northern china but also the strategic platform for china s economic growth transformation and upgrading and participation in global cooperation and competition in the new era since the reform and opening up the beijing tianjin hebei region has achieved remarkable achievements in the areas of economic development social security and transport infrastructure but it also faces low levels of regional integration lack of a regional organization of the labor system and severe environmental problems on the one hand ecological vulnerability is prominent and environmental issues have evolved from urban to regional ones on the other hand the development of urban systems has been unbalanced two big cities beijing and tianjin are the most developed but the urbanization of secondary central cities has been slower it can be seen from the land use map of the jing jin ji region for 2012 fig 2 that the residential and constructive areas in beijing and tianjin are larger and the 11 prefectural cities in hebei province are smaller where the main type of land use is cultivated land forestland and grassland breaking up the administrative divisions and studying the entire region as a whole rather than each administrative unit have been caught more and more attention 1 1 here should be an announcement that the city here indicates the administrative unit of the government in china the government names the entire area within the administrative boundary city including urban areas rural areas and natural areas 2 2 the emergy spatialization framework this study establishes a framework to spatialize emergy of a given region fig 3 the spatialization procedure is divided into two parts the renewable part and the non renewable part geospatial data provide data sources for the spatial distribution of regional environmental renewable resources and geographic information systems gis provide tools to calculate the corresponding emergy nighttime lights data are used to assign the non renewable emergy spatially into each prefectural city beforehand saturation correction method was applied to mitigate the light saturation phenomenon in city centers of dmsp ols data 2 2 1 data preparation the available data are as follows non renewable emergy data of the 13 cities in the study area for 2012 are acquired from the literature which was calculated from statistical data huang et al 2018 the geospatial datasets renewable resources nighttime lights datasets and land use map used in this study are listed in table 1 the distribution of surface average solar radiance for jing jin ji region was drawn by zheng et al 2012 which was based on the ground based solar radiation observation data from 1998 to 2005 davies 2013 developed a global geothermal heat map based on 38 374 global heat flow measurement points around the world wind speed map is from the nasa s power prediction of worldwide energy resources project data sets which provides long term average global wind speed at 50 m on a 0 5 arc degree resolution climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas chelsa dataset provides global raster data for monthly average precipitation from january 1979 to december 2013 with a resolution of 30 arc seconds the cgiar csi global high resolution soil water balance dataset provides hydrological raster data describing actual evapotranspiration aet and soil water deficit with resolution of 30 arc seconds the mean annual aet from 1950 to 2000 in this dataset is used in this study the digital elevation coverage is from jonathan de ferranti who developed and uploaded the whole world s digital elevation coverage maps at 3 and 15 arc second resolutions dmsp ols stable lights data for 2012 and the radiance calibrated data for 2010 2011 can be downloaded at noaa ngdc websites land use data of jing jin ji region of the year 2012 is from resource and environment data cloud platform of chinese academy of sciences cas all the spatial data are projected to the wgs 1984 utm zone 50 n coordinates system all the raster data are uniformed into 30 arc seconds 700 m at the latitude of the study area data with higher resolution are resampled and data with lower resolution are re gridded for the convenience of calculation the annual areal empower density is expressed in sej m 2 yr 1 2 2 2 spatialization of renewable emergy renewable resources are the part of the natural support that flows into the regional system generally the renewable inputs of a region include the tripartite solar tidal and geothermal secondary and tertiary inputs wind rain chemical potential runoff chemical potential and runoff geopotential for a regional area which contains few or none coastal areas tidal energy and runoff chemical potential energy can be excluded after the spatial data of every renewable resource was prepared the arcgis tool map algebra was used to calculate the available energy of each resource flowing into the system according to the energy calculation equations as follows then the transformities i e the conversion factors that account for the equivalent solar energy embodied in one unit of a product or service were used to calculate emergy table 2 and the total renewable emergy of the system was calculated according to the rules of the emergy algebra 2 2 2 1 available energy exergy calculation method 2 2 2 1 1 solar exergy using ground based solar observation data the solar radiation energy per unit area of the input system can be calculated according to eq 1 1 e s o l a r j m 2 yr i j m 2 yr 1 a k where i is the observed solar radiation per unit area a is the albedo 30 brown and ulgiati 2016 and k is the carnot efficiency 0 93 brown and ulgiati 2016 2 2 2 1 2 geothermal exergy the surface heat flow energy distribution map is presented by davies 2013 and an average carnot efficiency of 69 based on a weighted average of carnot efficiencies for crustal mantel and core sources was used to converted to exergy lee and brown 2018 2 2 2 1 3 wind energy the energy of the wind absorbed by the surface of each square meter is

produced by rain is composed by two main elements the energy generated by evapotranspiration chemical and the energy of runoff physical the chemical potential energy of water that is used by terrestrial vegetation within each cell is the water that is evapotranspired lee and brown 2018 mellino et al 2014 the evapotranspiration energy can be obtained by multiplying the mass of rainwater evaporating in the area by the gibbs free energy of rainwater eq 4 and the emergy distribution map of rain chemical potential is produced by multiplying the evapotranspiration chemical potential energy and its transformity 4 e c h e m m g where e c h e m is the chemical potential energy in each cell of the raster data i e the image m is the mass of evapotranspired water from each cell and g is the gibbs free energy of rain i e 4 723 j g 2 2 2 1 5 runoff geopotential energy runoff can be calculated by the water budget equation 5 r p e i where r accounts for the runoff p for the precipitation e for the evapotranspiration and i for the infiltration in this study it will be partially simplified that the infiltration is part of the runoff so r p e and the runoff map is generated by mapping the difference between precipitation data and evapotranspiration data eq 6 is used to obtain the geopotential energy of runoff 6 e g e o p o t e n t i a l m g h where e g e o p o t e n t i

2 2 2 renewable emergy maps the emergy map of each renewable resource is obtained by multiplying its energy with its transformity the renewable empower distribution map of the study area was generated by taking the maximum value between the sum of the solar tidal and geothermal inputs and the largest of the secondary and tertiary inputs wind rain runoff for each cell according to the algorithm developed by brown and ulgiati 2016 which can be expressed by eq 7 cell statistics tool in arcgis was used to extract the maximum value for each cell of the raster data 7 r e n e w a b l e m a x s u m

correct the saturation of dmsp ols image at high gain settings the dmsp ols sensor can detect low lights while urban centers are saturated turning the gain setting down can reduce the detected radiance therefore different ranges of radiation could be obtained by setting different fixed gains 15 db 35 db and 55 db and then different fixed gain images were merged to generate a light image without saturation this method directly adjusts the gain of the sensor and can resolve light saturation of the sensor from the source it has also been continuously used and improved ziskin et al 2010 improved the weighting method for different fixed gain images synthesis and made the splice of images more continuous and smooth and produced the global radiation calibration light image for 2006 hsu et al 2015 presented an improved methodological framework for producing calibrated light images which use the stable lights image as a supplement to the final radiation calibration image to make up for the detection of some low lights may be missing since the quantity of images at fixed gain settings is limited a total of eight global datasets have been produced representing years from 1996 to 2011 table 3 available at https ngdc noaa gov eog dmsp download radcal html last accessed on july 2018 but the gain setting approach is time and cost consuming this method is unlikely to be used to correct the entire historical nighttime lights archive elvidge et al 1999 in order to compensate for the discontinuity of the radiation calibration product researchers have proposed various methods for calibrating the saturation of dmsp ols nighttime light images in other ways hara et al 2004 and letu et al 2010 applied linear regression model and cubic regression model respectively which assumed that the dn value of the light increases linearly or cubically when approaching the light saturated center of the city it was found that the correlation between the calibrated light data and the urban power consumption in several cities in japan increased from r2 0 6876 to r2 0 725 and to r2 0 8264 respectively these methods assumed that the changes of lights in city centers followed certain mathematical models which may cause that the light changes in the saturated areas are too idealistic on a micro level and were not widely used lu et al 2008 and zhang et al 2013 combined the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from modis images and proposed his and vanui methods respectively they found correlations between urbanization level and vegetation health and abundance raupach et al 2010 used population density to mitigate the saturation problem of nighttime light images around the world after their correction the correlations between the light data and gdp energy consumption and co2 emissions became stronger than the uncorrected ones these methods can be used for correcting long term time series of nighttime lights imagery however they require other data that describe human activities as supplements which do not represent a direct solution to the problem of saturation as we are going to study human activities from nighttime lights data a direct calibration that does not rely on further external data is preferable letu et al 2012 sought to calibrate the saturated stable lights images using existing series of radiation calibration data table 3 with satisfactory results they applied a certain mathematical method and gis tools to calibrate the saturated pixels of the 1999 stable lights images by 1996 1997 radiation calibration data the correlation between electricity consumption of several cities in japan and its calibrated light data rose to r2 0 9273 higher than by using other methods in the same study context this paper applies this saturation correction method the latest radiance calibration data is from hsu et al 2015 and the closest radiation calibrated data to 2012 stable lights data is the data from january 11 2010 to july 31 2011 table 3 the flowchart of stable lights correction method is displayed in fig 4 in short all the unsaturated lights data in 2012 stable lights image are kept and the saturated part is replaced by the radiation calibrated data that after a regressive transformation the regressive transformation is used to transform the 2010 2011 radiation calibrated light image in order to minimize the light radiance difference from 2012 stable lights image using the sample tool in arcgis and sampling every paired cell values at same location from the 2010 2011 radiation calibrated light image as well as the 2012 stable lights image we discovered that the first saturated stable light dn 63 occurred when the radiation calibration light cell s dn value was 53 94 dn 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image could be a saturation cut off threshold in other words cells at the location of whose dn values are less than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated images are all unsaturated in the 2012 stable lights image but it doesn t mean that cells at the location of whose dn values are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image are all saturated in the 2012 stable lights image it means that the saturation phenomenon starts to appear in the 2012 stable lights image where the dn values are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image the reason for this is the acquisition of stable lights images was based on satellites that could auto adjust gain setting which means that saturation does not occur immediately when the radiation reaches the detection limit as the actual radiation increases the dn value gradually shifts to the saturation value hsu et al 2015 there are still unsaturated cells in the 2012 stable lights image where the dn values of cells are higher than 53 94 in the 2010 2011 calibrated image but dn 53 94 is the threshold that was used to establish the regression model of the stable lights cell values and radiance calibrated cell values at the same positions r2 0 88 fig 5 then the regression equation was used to transform the radiance calibrated data by using the raster calculator tool in arcgis the extract by attributes tool was used to extract the light saturated cells dn 63 from the 2012 stable lights image subsequently a mask made up of these cells was used to extract the transformed radiance calibrated data at the corresponding position by the extract by mask tool the dn values of light saturated cells in stable lights data were turned into zero by the raster calculator tool finally the extracted saturation corrected cells and the stable lights without saturated cells were overlaid to generate the saturation corrected stable lights image 2 2 4 spatialization of non renewable emergy eq 8 was used to spatialize the non renewable emergy of each city in the study area 8 y i j x i j s o l j n i j where j represents a city and i represents a raster cell in the city j y i j is the non renewable emergy of the i th cell in city j x i j is the saturation corrected light value of the i th cell in city j n i j is the non renewable emergy of city j and s o l j is the sum of lights of the saturation corrected stable lights of city j thus the non renewable emergy was distributed to each cell of each city and then the grid non renewable emergy distribution data of each city in the urban agglomeration were spliced together to generate the non renewable emergy distribution map of the urban agglomeration 2 2 5 thermodynamic geography indicators 2 2 5 1 empower density by summing up the renewable and the non renewable empower total empower distribution map of the study region can be produced the values of the raster cells are summed up with the raster calculator tool in arcgis the empower density of a city can be used as a development density parameter which can reflect the level of urbanization and the wealth of residents lee and braham 2017 we can also observe the different level of urban development better by making comparisons between cities it should be noted that the boundary of city in china include urban areas rural areas and natural areas it may be different in other countries of the world so we should pay attention to this issue when making such comparisons in this study the residential and constructive areas of beijing tianjin hebei were extracted as urban areas by using land use map since the emergy baselines used in different years of researches can be different the emergy data should be unified into a same baseline before comparison in this study the data were all reported to the latest 1 20e 25 sej yr emergy baseline brown et al 2016 2 2 5 2 spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i tool in arcgis measures spatial autocorrelation based on feature locations and attribute values given a set of features and an associated attribute the tool evaluates whether the pattern expressed by the features attributes is clustered dispersed or random the global moran s i index is generally between 1 and 1 it indicates a clustered trend when the index value is positive and the closer to 1 the more clustered negative index value indicates dispersed trend and the closer to 1 the more dispersed the tool calculates the moran s i index value and both z score and p value to evaluate the significance of the results appendix a we can quantify the aggregation extent of emergy spatially by the help of this index mitchell 2005 the raster format data should be converted into features before using this tool 2 2 5 3 landscape development intensity index ldi ldi was proposed by brown and vivas 2005 and has been widely used to measure the gradients of human disturbance in wetlands carey et al 2011 zhang et al 2014a b areas with high levels of human disturbance are usually characterized by intensive material and energy consumption human activities and environmental pollution in this paper ldi index map is generated to see the spatial distribution characteristics of human disturbance gradients in the study area ldi index for each cell of the map can be calculated by eq 9 9 l d i i 10 l o g 10 u i r i where u i refers to the total renewable plus non renewable empower of the i th cell and r i refers to the renewable empower of the i th cell the spatial variation coefficient svc of ldi index of a region is the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean which can measure the dispersion of the distribution of ldi index of a region because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data for comparison between data sets with different means coefficient of variation is more comparable instead of the standard deviation a lower spatial variation coefficient means a more evenly distributed of human disturbance whereas a higher spatial variation coefficient means a more dispersed or unevenly distributed of human disturbance 3 results and discussions 3 1 nighttime lights saturation correction and the non renewable empower map as a result of saturation correction the dn range of the nighttime light imagery was expanded from the previous 0 63 to 0 1808 51 fig 6 b two night light profiles were created along an axis through the center of beijing fig 6 and the dn values of these two profiles are presented in fig 7 evidencing how much more detail can be gained through saturation correction it can be seen that before the correction the central area of the city showed a saturation value of 63 in a large range the dynamic characteristics of this part of the light were revealed after correction where the maximum corrected dn value is 1432 nearly 23 times higher than the maximum dn value before correction it is clear how light saturation correction is a crucial operational step especially in cities where the saturated pixels occupy a large proportion of the city area saturation correction can greatly enrich the understanding and visualization of the thermodynamic spatial characteristics of urban centers 3 2 renewable empower maps the emergy of renewable resources of the jing jin ji region was spatialized at a resolution of 30 arc second fig 8 it can be seen that the renewable emergy in jing jin ji region does not present a large spatial heterogeneity the driving force of the renewable emergy at each location can be identified by the spatial analysis tool highest position in arcgis under the influence of a typical monsoon climate wind and rain are the dominant renewable resources of the region fig 9 wind emergy is prominent in the north of zhangjiakou and chengde and rain chemical potential emergy is prominent in most other places in jing jin ji region cities can be ranked based on the available renewable emergy its density and the average density of different land use types of the jing jin jin region can be also ranked appendix b it can be seen that chengde and zhangjiakou rank the top two of total renewable emergy the flow of natural emergy in these two cities is relatively abundant mainly because of their large land area since the average density of renewable empowers of these two cities are not highly ranked although the total renewable emergy of qinhuangdao is not highly ranked because of its limited area it shows high values of renewable empower density langfang and hengshui are characterized by the lowest two of renewable emergy these cities have fewer natural resource availability and host less healthy environments compared to other cities in the region unused land has the highest renewable empower density values followed by water area forestland residential and constructive area and cropland ranks the lowest these messages can assist a better energy and land use planning for example we can see the distribution of renewable resources and use them where appropriate identifying ecosystems that with smaller renewable emergy might be relatively fragile so it needs to be carefully protected to maximize renewable resource availability unused land should not be developed as residential and constructive area etc 3 3 total empower density map total empower density map with a resolution of 30 arc second is shown in fig 10 it is almost the same as the non renewable empower density map because compared to non renewable emergy e 14 sej m 2 yr 1 the magnitude of renewable emergy e 10 sej m 2 yr 1 is too small there is nothing different when summing the renewable into the non renewable so non renewable empower density map is not specifically displayed in this paper as we can see from fig 10 beijing and tianjin have the largest and the most concentrated emergy consumption in jing jin ji region which indicates that they are the most developed in this region beijing has one large empower concentration area in the city center spreading outwards in a star shape while tianjin has two relatively independent emergy concentration areas in the city center and in the binhai new area but we can also see that the empower density of the two areas of tianjin is higher than that of beijing and has a tendency of connecting together as a whole if it is not controlled tianjin has the danger of forming a big pie like urban development like beijing other cities in the hebei province have much smaller emergy concentration areas at the city center or at the coastal area and the empower density suddenly decreases outward from the concentration area which shows that the sizes of the cities in hebei province are much smaller and less developed furthermore we can make comparisons of the empower density between cities table 4 it can be seen that the empower density in the urban area of tianjin 7 88e 14 is the highest in the jing jin ji region a little higher than macau 6 09e 14 but lower than manhattan new york 2 28e 15 and harlem new york 1 78e 15 the beijing urban area and province the tianjin province and the hebei urban areas have lower empower density than macao but larger than rome 8 11e 13 and taipei 6 76e 13 the hebei province ranks the lowest 3 83e 13 in terms of empower density among the cities and areas investigated table 4 in the jing jin ji region the empower densities in all urban areas are much greater than within the city boundaries in the tianjin urban area the emergy density is 2 42 times larger than its province the same ratio is 3 43 in beijing and 3 20 in hebei these results indicate that the level of urbanization and the wealth of residents of tianjin urban area are close to the cities of developed countries but there is still lots of room for improvement too much rural areas inside the city boundary in china have dragged down the total level of urbanization and the wealth of residents of the city 3 4 spatial autocorrelation of total empower in jing jin ji region the global moran s i index of each city investigated is above 0 85 which indicates that the total empower of all the cities in the jing jin ji region is very concentrated beijing tianjin and qinhuangdao show the highest concentration i e 0 982850 0 962132 and 0 937601 respectively appendix c the global moran s i of the entire region including the areas of all the provinces is 0 96 slightly smaller than the value for tianjin this indicates that the total emergy used in beijing and tianjin is not only very concentrated but also very large the results are statistically significant and all the confidence levels are greater than 99 appendix c 3 5 the human disturbance gradients map the distribution of the ldi index of the jing jin ji region is showed in fig 11 the darker spots indicate higher human disturbance to the ecosystem table 5 shows the ldi indices for each city in the jing jin ji region the average ldi of beijing is the fourth lowest among 13 cities just slightly higher than chengde zhangjiakou and qinhuangdao and significantly lower than its neighbors tianjin and langfang which can be an evidence that some of the high energy consumed industries have moved out of beijing to neighboring cities tianjin and langfang have the highest average ldi 32 54 and 30 25 and the lowest spatial variation coefficient svc 31 and 15 indicating that the human disturbance of the environment is large and the area developed and utilized by humans is large and uniform chengde and zhangjiakou have the lowest ldi average 3 94 and 6 06 and the highest svc 257 and 195 indicating that human disturbance is relatively small but uneven which means that some zones are characterized by high human disturbance degree in an overall relatively low human disturbance background table 6 shows the results of the overlay analysis of the ldi map and the land use map residential and constructive area have the highest ldi average 30 13 and the lowest svc 35 indicating that these areas have the highest intensity in human disturbance but evenly distributed energy and resource consumption patterns forestland and grassland have the lowest ldi averages 4 51 and 6 91 and the highest svcs 234 and 183 this shows that although the overall level of human disturbances in grassland and forestland is low there are significant differences in the level of disturbances some areas have ldi values as high as 49 35 and 52 52 cropland and water area also show high human disturbance levels ldi averages are 21 57 and 22 29 some of the areas where outside residential and constructive areas that show ldi values almost as high as residential and constructive areas on the one hand it can be explained that some non residential and constructive areas are also severely interfered by humans on the other hand it may technically due to the blooming effect of dmsp ols light data blooming effect means that the lit areas extend beyond the source s true illuminated area mainly because of the limited resolution and the producing procedure of the imagery averaging the adjacent input cells to produce output cell bennett and smith 2017 it is not difficult to understand that the lights of one area do not exactly light inside the boundary it definitely will illuminate adjacent areas include cropland grassland water area etc through the light transmission this issue is more pervasive over water and snow areas as these reflect nearby lights more than dark ground xie et al 2014 this problem is quite troublesome when studying cities because it can result in overestimation of features such as urban extent small and elvidge 2013 however when we studying the human disturbance in the landscape not only do we not think that it is a problem but we consider that it is a good indicator that reflects the spatial extent of human disturbance because the human disturbance of the ecosystem is probably not exactly inside the human settlements boundary as the land use map shows human activities inside the residential and constructive area may affect the adjacent cropland water area grassland and forest the human lights that intrude into the adjacent land can reflect the impact of human activities that penetrated to other land use types 3 6 limitations there are several limitations to this study regarding the renewable emergy due to the data availability some spatial data are only long term average values rather than specific values for the resource flow per year i e geothermal energy wind speed solar radiation and evapotranspiration in addition some of the distribution maps are obtained by interpolation of monitoring data and the resolution of some satellite based data is fairly low which may cause some uncertainties these limitations will be minimized with the improvement of monitoring and mapping technology and then people could retrieve better datasets another limitation is the transformities of renewable resources used in this study transformities of a specific energy flow can vary based on the processes or location lee and brown 2018 we used transformities from latest literature however it is well understood that transformities at the local scale may vary from the global average data the main limitation encountered regarding the spatialization of non renewable emergy emerged from the saturation correction method a linear regression model was applied to modify the 2010 2011 radiance calibration image in order to minimize the differences between its lights data and the stable lights data in 2012 it is assumed that the actual light radiation in the saturated part in stable lights image changed as the same mode as the unsaturated part between the two data however there is no available data to confirm that the actual radiation of the saturated lights in the urban centers of the jing jin ji region changes like that mode some researchers consider that since most of the cities in china are still in rapid development the actual radiation changes over time in light saturated areas of urban centers might be unpredictable ma et al 2014 but we are more willing to believe that it is not significant in one or two years 4 conclusions emergy is a measure of environmental support from an energy perspective that goes into the system it provides a quantitative way of measuring the global and the local impact on the environment the impact of cities goes far beyond its boundary because it must bring resources from all over the planet to support its development the impact globally can be measured by the quantity of emergy necessary to support it and the impact of locally can be measured by the ldi in this study we developed a method to spatialize a high resolution 30 arc second emergy distribution map of a region through which we can identify the hot spots of emergy use spatial patterns of emergy flows and human disturbance gradients etc which can monitor and map human activities and development and guide for more accurate and specific sustainable planning strategy that break through the limits of administrative boundaries based on gis technologies and environmental geospatial databases it is feasible to generate maps of the spatial distribution of renewable emergy due to the availability of statistical data non renewable emergy distribution map for a region usually display in administrative boundary patched way nighttime lights data is an applicable proxy for spatializing non renewable emergy which can further improve the spatial detail of emergy mapping it is noteworthy that the saturation correction for dmsp ols data is crucial especially in urban areas in order to study the spatial thermodynamics of a region better from the case study of jing jin ji region we can conclude that the empower density and ldi maps of cities for the year 2012 can be evidences of development status and policies implemented in the past as municipalities beijing and tianjin were most developed while cities in hebei were far away behind before and after 2008 olympics in order to ensure good environment conditions for the beijing large numbers of beijing s industrial enterprises migrated outward mainly to areas in neighboring cities such as tianjin langfang tangshan and cangzhou zhang et al 2014a b at the same time the upper reaches of beijing areas in chengde and zhangjiakou strictly controlled industrial development and protected the environment zhang 2009 long term research will better interpret the changes and transmissions of spatial thermodynamics of a region which is one of the future study scopes meanwhile from the ldi and land use map we found that some areas of cropland water area grassland and forest are suffering acute human disturbance which indicates that the real human disturbance can extend beyond the human settlements area that mapped in land use map the blooming effect of dmsp ols data may help to measure the real human disturbance spatial extent which is also one of the interesting points for further research acknowledgments this work is supported by the projects of sino italian cooperation of china natural science foundation cnsc no

25097,the generality and variability of the self thinning rule in plant populations have been intensively debated in the past decades recent studies on self thinning focus on understanding how the variability arises and are dedicated to a broader theory with different biotic and abiotic factors suggested to explain the variability of the self thinning line however the relative role and importance of different factors in altering the self thinning line are still unclear using a generic individual based model which simultaneously implements different modes symmetric versus asymmetric of both competition and facilitation among individual plants we explored the variability of the self thinning line in simulated plant populations we employed a machine learning approach random forests to evaluate the potential effect and importance of seven biotic and abiotic factors i e mode of competition mode of facilitation abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial distribution pattern threshold of death and method used for fitting self thinning lines on simulated self thinning lines simulations of the individual based model demonstrated a significant variation in self thinning lines our random forests models were able to explain and predict more than 98 of the variation in both the slope and intercept of the self thinning line these models identified mode of competition as being the most important factor that alters both the slope and intercept of the self thinning line for the variation of slope other factors were much less important than competition most of the factors were more important in altering the intercept rather than the slope of self thinning line changes of the slope and intercept in response to different factors indicated their divergent roles and partial effects on self thinning mechanisms our study demonstrates that different biotic and abiotic factors have distinct effects and importance in altering the self thinning rule implying context dependent outcomes and consequences we highlight that individual based models and machine learning approaches are powerful tools to evaluate driving factors and to understand hidden mechanisms underlying complex patterns the joint application of the two powerful tools will help to extend the framework of self thinning and foster other research in ecology keywords competition asymmetric facilitation density dependent mortality random forests metabolic theory of ecology 1 introduction self thinning is the process induced by density dependent mortality and is a phenomenon that widely exists in plant populations yoda et al 1963 westoby 1984 reynolds and ford 2005 chu et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 lin et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it is a dynamic equilibrium between living plants growth and death in crowded populations which is known as the so called self thinning rule yoda 1963 westoby 1984 the self thinning rule states that on a logarithmic scale the relationship between mean plant size m mean body mass and density of living plants n is a straight line i e self thinning line in a stand undergoing density dependent mortality this is usually modelled as log m γ log n k where γ and k denote the slope and intercept of the self thinning line respectively yoda et al 1963 proposed an empirical summary of self thinning lines with γ approximately equal to 3 2 and stated to hold for all plant species more recently the metabolic theory of ecology mte that is based on a fractal model and plant energetics predicted a universal self thinning line with γ equal to 4 3 enquist et al 1998 west et al 1999 enquist and niklas 2001 brown et al 2004 savage et al 2010 nevertheless the generality and variability of the self thinning line has been debated for a long time hamilton et al 1995 enquist et al 1998 morris 2003 reynolds and ford 2005 deng et al 2006 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 2014 ge et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 recent studies on self thinning have shifted from searching for a universal rule to understanding how the variability arises and could eventually lead to a broader theory of self thinning reynolds and ford 2005 chu et al 2010 li et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2017 several mechanisms are proposed to explain the variability of self thinning but competition among plants has been attributed as the major factor driving the self thinning process westoby 1984 berger et al 2008 lin et al 2013 2014 pommerening and sánchez meador 2018 the mode of plant competition can be either symmetric or asymmetric weiner 1990 schwinning and weiner 1998 under symmetric competition competing plants tend to share resources equally or proportionally to their sizes under asymmetric competition larger plants can obtain disproportionately more resources for growing and suppress smaller plants weiner 1990 different modes of competition can lead to quantitatively different consequences during plant population development for instance asymmetric competition can increase size inequality of plant populations and can accelerate density dependent mortality stoll and bergius 2005 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 in general above ground shoot competition for light is considered to be more asymmetric whereas below ground root competition for water and nutrients is considered to be more symmetric weiner 1990 berger et al 2008 although root competition seems to be also asymmetric in several cases fransen et al 2001 rewald and leuschner 2009 studies have shown that with belowground resource limitation belowground root competition dominates and alters the self thinning rule leading to shallower thinning lines morris 2003 deng et al 2006 and this altered slope of self thinning lines is mainly caused by different modes of competition rather than resource limitation chu et al 2010 lin et al 2014 nonetheless not all interactions among plants are competitive facilitation the positive interactions among plants has been well acknowledged in ecology over the past two decades callaway and walker 1997 callaway 2007 brooker et al 2008 lin et al 2012 he et al 2013 schöb et al 2014 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 facilitation among plants occurs via the enrichment to resources and or the moderation of biotic and abiotic stress leading to an increase in the survivorship growth and or reproduction of at least one of the interacting plants bertness and callaway 1994 lin et al 2012 facilitation can operate simultaneously with competition and plays an important role in driving population and community dynamics especially under harsh environmental conditions callaway 2007 brooker et al 2008 only a few theoretical studies have explored the effect of facilitation on the self thinning process and their findings suggest that facilitation can alter the self thinning line chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however the mode of facilitation considered in those studies was restricted to completely symmetric facilitation i e interacting plants receive the same amount of benefit from one another irrespective of their sizes just as in competition facilitation among plants can also be asymmetric where smaller plants receive disproportionally more benefits from larger plants lin et al 2012 a well known example of asymmetric facilitation is the nurse effect both empirical and theoretical studies have shown that the mode of facilitation can be quantitatively different and their effects on shaping plant populations and communities are also different holzapfel and mahall 1999 lin et al 2012 schöb et al 2014 lin et al 2016 by using both a simulation model and a greenhouse experiment lin et al 2016 showed that asymmetric facilitation can reduce size inequality in plant populations and resulted in delayed density dependent mortality in contrast to the effects of symmetric facilitation found by chu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2017 this implies that asymmetric facilitation may alter the self thinning line in a different way from symmetric facilitation and is a hypothesis that requires testing in addition to plant competition and facilitation there are other factors that potentially affect the self thinning line such as initial density weiner et al 2001 li et al 2013 spatial pattern weiner et al 2001 stoll and bergius 2005 lin et al 2012 resource level and abiotic stress level morris 2003 weiskittel et al 2009 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2014 species tolerance ability pretzsch 2006 weiskittel et al 2009 bravo oviedo et al 2018 and even the methods used for fitting the self thinning line bi et al 2000 zhang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 in addition the allometry of plants lin et al 2014 and plants adaptive behaviours peters et al 2018 can also lead to variation of the self thinning line however the relative effect and importance of different factors in altering self thinning is still unknown and have not yet to our knowledge been systematically explored it is difficult to test all these biotic and abiotic factors comprehensively and systematically via purely empirical experiments because a plantation experiments on self thinning are resource demanding and time consuming li et al 2013 b different factors can act simultaneously and to directly measure each factor and to separate their partial effect is nearly impossible because of practical difficulties lin et al 2012 2016 peters et al 2016 this justifies the application and domination of individual based simulation models ibms for studying this topic e g weiner et al 2001 chu et al 2009 2010 lin et al 2012 2013 2016 zhang et al 2017 ibms are a comprehensive environment for stepwise evaluations of the relative role and importance of each factor separately or in various combinations in ibms observed patterns at the system level emerge from the individual level and their interactions under different environmental conditions grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a this provides a useful tool to explore the relative role and importance of different factors at the individual and lower level in altering the self thinning at the system level and is valuable to further strengthen the link between ibms and empirical applications however to analyze and understand the behaviour of ibms and to make quantitative links between model variables inputs and observed patterns outputs is challenging grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a b ibms are usually sophisticated in their structures and contain a large number of parameters and variables at different levels making the emergent properties at higher levels highly diversified while similar observed patterns can also emerge from completely different mechanisms and scenarios combinations of variable settings furthermore correlations multicollinearity among different types of variables numeric or categorical nonlinearity of observed outputs and the huge size of simulation outputs are also difficulties associated with using classical methods for analyzing the outputs from ibms to overcome the difficulties mentioned above machine learning ml approaches have proved to be novel and useful tools for analyzing the outputs from ibms peters et al 2016 in a recent study peters et al 2016 used a new type of artificial neural network a so called self organizing map for analyzing a spatially explicit ibm of plant population dynamics their ml model successfully inferred the key driving variable from the remaining measurable variables and observed patterns demonstrating the great value of ml approaches to evaluate the outputs from ibms ml approaches are becoming more useful in biology and ecology cutler et al 2007 brieuc et al 2018 most of these ml algorithms are now readily available through commonly used statistical platforms such as r r core team 2017 these algorithms include artificial neural networks support vector machines gradient boosting trees and random forests rf all of which differ in their input requirements training tuning processes and performances among these ml approaches rf is one of the most widely used one in ecology because of its superior predictive performance and relatively simple implementation cutler et al 2007 rf is an ensemble ml approach that based on combining a large group of classification and regression trees carts breiman 2001 in rf each cart is an independent model of classification or regression for a randomly sampled subset of variables and data the prediction from an rf model is then made by averaging predictions of all carts for regression or by the majority voting of all carts for classification applications of rf in ecology include forest allometric scaling relationships duncanson et al 2015 tree species and patch distributions iverson et al 2008 veldhuis et al 2017 tree species richness and carbon storage lautenbach et al 2017 forest wind damage moore and lin in press forest coverage freeman et al 2015 and ecological genetics brieuc et al 2018 nevertheless the potential application of rf approach to self thinning and evaluating output from ibms has not been tested in this study we used a spatially explicit ibm to explore the relative role and importance of biotic and abiotic factors in altering the self thinning line in simulated plant populations the ibm we employed is based on fundamental physical principles and eco physiological mechanisms of individual plants which also includes different modes of both competition and facilitation simultaneously among plants under different environmental conditions lin et al 2012 2016 the self thinning process observed in the model is the pattern emerging from individual level plants and their interactions under different environmental conditions specifically we focused on two questions 1 what are the most important factors that alter the self thinning line 2 how does the self thinning line change in response to different factors to answer those questions we employed rf models for quantifying the extent and drivers of variations in the slope and intercept of the self thinning line we also used this study to highlight the joint application of ml approaches and ibms and their future applications in ecology 2 methods 2 1 individual based model and simulations the individual based pi model used in this study has been described in detail previously lin et al 2012 2013 2014 2016 and is based on the mte brown et al 2004 savage et al 2010 and zone of influence zoi approach weiner et al 2001 it includes different modes of both competition and facilitation among plants a detailed description of the model that follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing ibms grimm et al 2010 is enclosed in the supplementary material here we summarize the essential elements of the pi model the growth function of individual plants in our model is derived from an energy conservation equation of the mte west et al 2001 brown et al 2004 lin

competition and facilitation lin et al 2012 2016 the resource competition and facilitation under abiotic stress are incorporated into eq 1 through dimensionless indices fp and fq respectively 2 dm dt

which is consistent with other models e g chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 but is more general lin et al 2012 2016 we also set the species specific weighting constant of facilitation wi and wj to 1 in this study given that the likelihood of mortality for a plant is proportional to its mass specific metabolic rate brown et al 2004 marbà et al 2007 we assume in the model that an individual plant should die if its actual growth rate realistic metabolic rate falls below a threshold fraction of its basal metabolic rate i e proportion to m 3 4 thus the mortality of plants in the model can be attributed to the metabolic inactivation caused by local resource competition abiotic stress senescence or combinations thereof this threshold of death also represents the tolerance ability of plants in the individual based pi model the initial body size of plants follows a random normal distribution the initial spatial arrangement of all plants can be represented as a cluster random or regular hexagon lin et al 2012 and all plants are distributed over a wrap around space so as to avoid edge effects grimm and railsback 2005 the pi model and all simulations are implemented in the free software platform netlogo 4 1 3 wilensky 1999 the model with source code and simulation experiment settings is contained in a nlogo file in the supplementary material in our simulation experiments we

using different random seeds 1 2 3 4 and 5 the number of simulations conducted in total for this study was 16 200 2 2 self thinning line we collected average body mass of living plants and abundance of living plants in each scenario at each time step to fit the self thinning lines log log transformed data of mean body mass vs density of living plants observed in each scenario we selected data points based on a criterion of mortality westoby 1984 lin et al 2013 after density dependent mortality starts data points where the number of individual surviving plants was less than 90 of the initial density but more than 100 were selected for fitting self thinning lines in some scenarios plant populations collapsed very quickly e g plants have low level threshold of death under extremely high stress conditions and had insufficient self thinning trajectories therefore we only used self thinning trajectories that had more than three data points when fitting self thinning lines to explore the effects of different methods used to fit self thinning lines we employed three widely used methods to fit these lines zhang et al 2005 cubillo et al 2012 ordinary least square ols reduced major axis rma which considers errors in both dependent and independent variables and stochastic frontier analysis sfa the latter is purported to provide an efficient estimation of the self thinning boundary by considering random external factors and including all data points without subjective selection note that for the sfa method all data points were used and we did not select data points based on the criterion of mortality mentioned above for detailed descriptions see bi et al 2000 and zhang et al 2005 all linear fitting methods were conducted in r 3 4 4 r core team 2017 the ols and rma were applied by using the r package lmodel2 legendre 2014 and the sfa were carried out by using the r package frontier coelli and henningsen 2013 2 3 random forests model to evaluate the factors driving the variation in self thinning lines we employed rf models rf is a non parametric ensemble machine learning approach based on a large group of carts breiman 2001 each of the carts is a set of rules for splitting data its internal nodes denote tests on predictor variables and the data sample is split into two or more homogeneous subsets based on the most significant splitter value or category of predictor variables its leaves terminal nodes represent predictions for the value of target variables in the rf model each of the carts is trained and generated by a subset of data bootstrapped from the original data at the same time predictor variables are also randomly subsampled during the bootstrapping thus each of the carts in rf uses a different subsample of both the original data and the predictor variables which can de correlate variables and carts and introduce randomization by repeating this process rf trains and builds a large group of carts separately and uses those carts to make predictions the predictions are made by averaging predictions of carts for a regression purpose or by counting the majority voting of carts for a classification purpose we developed rf models of both the slope and intercept of self thinning lines to understand variability as a function of different factors the factors we used in the rf models as predictor variables were mode of competition mode of facilitation abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial distribution pattern threshold of death and method used for fitting self thinning lines the dataset of fitted self thinning lines slopes and intercepts was randomly divided into two parts a random sample of 75 of the full dataset which was used to train and tune the rf models and the remaining 25 of the full dataset which was used to validate the rf models training and tuning ml models is important but can be complicated for some ml models but is relatively easy for rf models compared to other ml models there are two important tuning parameters in the rf model freeman et al 2015 the first parameter mtry controls the number of predictor variables randomly sampled at each split in a cart although it has been proposed that the rf model is insensitive to mtry breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 we nevertheless tested five levels of mtry in our models for tuning 2 3 4 5 and 6 we found that the best predictive performance occurred when the value of mtry was 5 for both rf models although models performed very similarly at values of mtry higher than the default value of mtry 2 calculated as the number of total predictor variables divided by three the second parameter ntree determines the total number of carts to grow in a rf model it has been suggested not to use too few carts so that every input row can be predicted at least a few times liaw and wiener 2002 however the rf model with a large number of carts will be computationally expensive we used three levels of ntree for tuning 500 1000 and 2000 and found that ntree 1000 twice the default number of 500 gave the best outcome between model performance and computational expense when ntree was 2000 model performance was not improved significantly but this led to more than twice the computational time for both rf models to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables in our rf models we calculated the increase in mean squared error incmse of model predictions when a given variable was randomly permuted in the out of bag samples genuer et al 2010 a higher value of incmse indicates a more important predictor variable to make standardized measures of variable importance the importance of predictor variables was normalized by the maximum variable importance duncanson et al 2015 furthermore we used partial dependence plots to illustrate the changes of slope and intercept in response to different predictor variables under ceteris paribus conditions all rf models and analyses were implemented by using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 3 results simulations of the individual based pi model demonstrated that there was significant variation in self thinning lines fig 1 although the most frequent value of slope was close to the theoretical value of 4 3 deviation from the theoretical predictions was also extensive fig 1 this significant variation in self thinning lines was mostly produced by biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions rather than by the method of fitting as the patterns of slope and intercept distribution were similar among the different methods of fitting fig 1 both rf models showed consistencies in their high accuracy of predictions fig 2 the rf model of slope we trained was able to explain 98 17 of the variation in the slope of self thinning lines in the training dataset when tested against the independent validation dataset that was randomly sampled from the whole dataset the rf model was still able to explain 98 14 of the variation fig 2 similarly the rf model of intercept we trained was able to explain 98 14 of the variation in the intercept of self thinning lines in the training dataset when tested with the independent validation dataset the model was also able to explain 98 12 of the variation fig 2 for the slope of the self thinning line mode of competition was the most important variable identified by the rf model table 1 for the rf model of intercept mode of competition was also the most important variable while abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial pattern mode of facilitation and threshold of death were found to be other important variables table 1 we used partial dependence plots to illustrate the marginal effect of each predictor variable on the self thinning lines after excluding the other variables fig 3 in the rf model the slope of the self thinning lines became steeper more negative when the competitive asymmetry increased fig 3a the remaining variables were less important in the rf model the slope was shallower when the initial spatial pattern of plants was more regular fig 3b higher initial density also tended to make the slope shallower fig 3c the slope became steeper with increased abiotic stress level fig 3d and higher threshold of death for plants fig 3e in general facilitation can steepen the slope but this was not the case when facilitation was completely asymmetric which attenuated the slope in contrast to other modes of facilitation fig 3f compared with the slope fitted by the ols method the slope estimated by the rma method was slightly steeper but the slope given by the sfa method was slightly shallower fig 3g in the rf model for intercept most of the variables were found to be important the intercept of the self thinning line generally increased with the competitive asymmetry fig 3h from no stress condition to moderately harsh condition the intercept of the self thinning line was relatively constant but decreased rapidly with increased stress level fig 3i the intercept declined with increased initial density fig 3j when the initial spatial arrangement of plants became more regular the intercept decreased fig 3k when facilitation occurred the intercept was generally higher than without facilitation but this was not the case when facilitation was completely asymmetric which lowered the intercept fig 3l a higher threshold of death led to higher values of the intercept fig 3m the effect of fitting method on intercept was less important and there were only slight differences among different methods on the fitted intercept the rma method gave the highest estimation of the intercept the sfa method gave the lowest estimate of the intercept and the ols method gave estimates of the intercept between those from the other two methods fig 3n 4 discussion we used an individual based plant population model to explore how various biotic and abiotic factors affect the self thinning process in particular we employed the ml approach of rf models to evaluate and quantify the relative importance and extent of different factors in altering thinning lines of simulated plant populations the joint application of ibm and rf enabled us to assess a wide range of factors systematically and to reveal distinct effects and importance of each factor in altering the slope and intercept of the self thinning line our results showed that mode of competition was the most important factor among those investigated that can alter the self thinning line table 1 given that the self thinning process is density dependent mortality driven by local plant competition our finding is consistent with ecological expectations according to previous studies chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 2014 when competition is more symmetric it leads to flatter self thinning lines at a given density fig 3a this is because symmetric competition can moderate the onset of mortality among plants although their growth is reduced weiner et al 2001 as a consequence plants can survive and slowly grow at relatively high densities resulting in less average biomass being accumulated at a given density under symmetric competition stoll and bergius 2005 lin et al 2013 thus symmetric competition not only alters the slope of the thinning line but also the intercept which reflects biomass packing by plants this is something that has only been discussed to a limited extent previously li et al 2013 for the other factors we explored here their relative role in altering the slope of thinning line is much less important than competition but these factors still play important roles in altering the intercept of the thinning line table 1 more uniform initial spatial arrangement of plants and higher density tend to reduce the growth rates of competing plants in a rather homogeneous way resulting in smaller and more equally sized plants by reducing competitive divergence among them weiner et al 2001 consequently when spatial pattern is more regular and initial density is higher the slope of the self thinning line is flatter and the intercept is lower in agreement with our results li et al 2013 found that initial density did not significantly affect the slope of the self thinning lines in buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum moench populations but had a significant effect on the intercept our results are consist with their conclusion that initial density affects the intercept of the self thinning line rather than the slope the abiotic stress level is also an important factor in our model abiotic stress and resource limitation are modeled to reduce the growth of all plants under benign to moderate conditions mortality of plants is mainly driven by competition and abiotic stress is less important for plant death when environmental conditions become very harsh plants are more stressed consequently under these very harsh conditions the growth of surviving plants is reduced and the mortality is substantially increased suggesting a steeper and much lower thinning line under harsh conditions but flatter and higher thinning lines under benign to moderate conditions in a recent study ge et al 2017 analyzed 553 plots of china fir cunninghamia lanceolata lamb hook and found that the slope of self thinning line was steeper in the lower quality sites which is in agreement with our findings fig 3d although a common self thinning line has been observed in some experiments with different levels of abiotic stress and resource limitation reviewed in morris 2003 there have been numerous studies that show exceptions e g deng et al 2006 liu et al 2006 lin et al 2014 in some of these cases abiotic stress and resource limitation were shown to also alter the allometry of plants lin et al 2014 peters et al 2018 and the modes of both competition and facilitation lin et al 2012 2016 which can also lead to the variation of the self thinning line the threshold of death represents the tolerance ability of plants which can vary among different species our models show that the self thinning line in plant populations with a higher threshold of death tends to be steeper and higher this result is supported by empirical studies showing that the thinning line for tree species with higher shade tolerance also has a steeper slope and a higher intercept pretzsch 2006 weiskittel et al 2009 bravo oviedo et al 2018 indicating that the functional traits and life history strategies of different tree species are also important and should be considered in detail in future studies in addition we only explored the case of a mono culture but the case of mixed cultures is also important and can be easily explored by using the pi model recent studies on plant positive interactions have shown that facilitation plays an important role in driving plant population dynamics by using similar zoi models chu et al 2010 and zhang et al 2017 found that facilitation significantly increases the intercept of self thinning line but showed little effect on the slope which result is in agreement with our finding although chu et al 2010 suggested that facilitation tend to flatten the self thinning line whereas zhang et al 2017 concluded that facilitation steepens the self thinning line as we found however they only considered symmetric facilitation in their models when facilitation is asymmetric larger plants benefactors suffer the most from environmental stress whereas smaller plants beneficiaries can receive disproportionately more benefit from their neighbouring benefactors for maintenance and growth which can reduce size inequality and delay onset of mortality resulting in a shallower self thinning line apart from this the received benefit between interacting plants is more unidirectional towards smaller plants in asymmetric facilitation smaller plants can still survive and compete with neighbouring plants which leads to an overall reduced growth of all surviving plants thus lowering the self thinning line in comparison to symmetric facilitation this effect of asymmetric facilitation on self thinning has not been considered before and should be tested in future studies compared to other factors different methods used for fitting the self thinning line are much less important although there are slight differences among the three methods we explored their effects on the variation in slope and intercept terms is insignificant our finding is generally in agreement with previous empirical studies zhang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 the individual based pi model we used in this study has been proved to be realistic in its fundamental assumptions and model structure its multiple patterns observed at system level emerged from individual levels and have been validated by empirical observations lin et al 2013 2012 and experiments lin et al 2014 2016 there have been no presupposing assumptions made in the model on the relative importance of different factors in altering the self thinning process and the self thinning process explored in the model is a system level pattern that entirely emerged from individual plants and their interactions to changes of different factors to comprehensively explore and measure the relative effect and importance of those factors in empirical experiments requires massive efforts and is often impossible for instance competition and facilitation act simultaneously and the associated effects of the environmental stress and plant facilitation are impossible to separate in empirical experiments or observations lin et al 2012 2016 peters et al 2016 there are also other factors considered to be important in altering the self thinning line such as plant allometry li et al 2013 which are worth exploring in future studies by using similar modelling approaches as we employed here nevertheless ibms are indispensable tools for studying plant population dynamics in both theoretical and applied ecology using ibms enables us to explore the partial effect and importance of those factors and to understand the mechanism of system dynamics it can also support decision making and applications in ecological conservation agriculture and forestry grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a however ibms are usually criticized as being as difficult to understand as the real system for a well developed ibm that contains key elements of structural realism emergence and prediction a certain level of complexity is required grimm and berger 2016a this complexity can easily lead to multi hierarchical levels of model structure and tens of parameters and variables how to understand model outcomes and patterns emerging from different mechanisms and their changes in response to different scenarios represented by different model settings is a major challenge with complex ibms peters et al 2016 used a new type of artificial neural network for analyzing a spatially explicit ibm of plant population dynamics their study showed that a joint application of ibm with an ml approach was able to precisely predict ibm variables at individual level from emerged patterns observed at system level and helped to visualize multidimensional correlation patterns from ibm outputs to inputs in the study we present here rf models proved to be powerful in predicting patterns and dynamics at the system level from fundamental variables of the ibm in addition rf is able to evaluate the relative importance of all variables and their partial effects on the emerged patterns and dynamics at the system level providing a new and reverse way of understanding the ibm from inputs to outputs there are other powerful ml algorithms which differ in their input requirements training tuning processes and performances however what sets rf apart from those other approaches and prompted us to use rf are three key features the first is its relatively simple implementation and high predictive performance an rf model contains only two parameters which makes it very easy to implement and to tune in comparison to other ml approaches while its performance is still very good breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 moore and lin in press the ease of use is an important feature of rf for ecologists who may have limited experience in using other more complicated ml approaches the second feature is its novel way of evaluating variable importance rf models do not suffer some of the shortcomings of other variable selection methods such as identifying only one or two variables among a pool of predictors that are equally good but highly correlated as a nonparametric ensemble method rf aggregates the results of many carts that have been built in parallel and independently and variables that are correlated and or have similar importance are treated equally this is important for analyzing ibms in which the variables are highly correlated and there are strong interactions among them last but not least rf is a flexible tool that can deal with different data and can be used for different purposes including regression classification unsupervised learning and missing value imputation unlike many traditional statistical methods rf makes no distributional assumptions on the predictor or response variables and the variables can be either quantitative numeric or qualitative categorical based on the features we mentioned above rf is a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding complex ibms studies on self thinning now aim at understanding how the variability arises in response to different biotic and abiotic factors and to predict the changes in self thinning our study is the first to systematically evaluate the relative effect and importance of relevant factors in altering the self thinning line and it is also an attempt to jointly apply an ibm with an ml approach to analyze complex patterns and system dynamics our study confirms what is generally believed about the crucial role of competition in driving self thinning process and also highlights the distinct effects and importance of other factors in altering thinning lines the joint application of a mechanistic ibm with an ml approach provides us with new insights into the self thinning mechanisms which cannot be derived from purely empirical works suggesting the prospect of further synergy

25097,the generality and variability of the self thinning rule in plant populations have been intensively debated in the past decades recent studies on self thinning focus on understanding how the variability arises and are dedicated to a broader theory with different biotic and abiotic factors suggested to explain the variability of the self thinning line however the relative role and importance of different factors in altering the self thinning line are still unclear using a generic individual based model which simultaneously implements different modes symmetric versus asymmetric of both competition and facilitation among individual plants we explored the variability of the self thinning line in simulated plant populations we employed a machine learning approach random forests to evaluate the potential effect and importance of seven biotic and abiotic factors i e mode of competition mode of facilitation abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial distribution pattern threshold of death and method used for fitting self thinning lines on simulated self thinning lines simulations of the individual based model demonstrated a significant variation in self thinning lines our random forests models were able to explain and predict more than 98 of the variation in both the slope and intercept of the self thinning line these models identified mode of competition as being the most important factor that alters both the slope and intercept of the self thinning line for the variation of slope other factors were much less important than competition most of the factors were more important in altering the intercept rather than the slope of self thinning line changes of the slope and intercept in response to different factors indicated their divergent roles and partial effects on self thinning mechanisms our study demonstrates that different biotic and abiotic factors have distinct effects and importance in altering the self thinning rule implying context dependent outcomes and consequences we highlight that individual based models and machine learning approaches are powerful tools to evaluate driving factors and to understand hidden mechanisms underlying complex patterns the joint application of the two powerful tools will help to extend the framework of self thinning and foster other research in ecology keywords competition asymmetric facilitation density dependent mortality random forests metabolic theory of ecology 1 introduction self thinning is the process induced by density dependent mortality and is a phenomenon that widely exists in plant populations yoda et al 1963 westoby 1984 reynolds and ford 2005 chu et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 lin et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 it is a dynamic equilibrium between living plants growth and death in crowded populations which is known as the so called self thinning rule yoda 1963 westoby 1984 the self thinning rule states that on a logarithmic scale the relationship between mean plant size m mean body mass and density of living plants n is a straight line i e self thinning line in a stand undergoing density dependent mortality this is usually modelled as log m γ log n k where γ and k denote the slope and intercept of the self thinning line respectively yoda et al 1963 proposed an empirical summary of self thinning lines with γ approximately equal to 3 2 and stated to hold for all plant species more recently the metabolic theory of ecology mte that is based on a fractal model and plant energetics predicted a universal self thinning line with γ equal to 4 3 enquist et al 1998 west et al 1999 enquist and niklas 2001 brown et al 2004 savage et al 2010 nevertheless the generality and variability of the self thinning line has been debated for a long time hamilton et al 1995 enquist et al 1998 morris 2003 reynolds and ford 2005 deng et al 2006 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 2014 ge et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 recent studies on self thinning have shifted from searching for a universal rule to understanding how the variability arises and could eventually lead to a broader theory of self thinning reynolds and ford 2005 chu et al 2010 li et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2014 zhang et al 2017 several mechanisms are proposed to explain the variability of self thinning but competition among plants has been attributed as the major factor driving the self thinning process westoby 1984 berger et al 2008 lin et al 2013 2014 pommerening and sánchez meador 2018 the mode of plant competition can be either symmetric or asymmetric weiner 1990 schwinning and weiner 1998 under symmetric competition competing plants tend to share resources equally or proportionally to their sizes under asymmetric competition larger plants can obtain disproportionately more resources for growing and suppress smaller plants weiner 1990 different modes of competition can lead to quantitatively different consequences during plant population development for instance asymmetric competition can increase size inequality of plant populations and can accelerate density dependent mortality stoll and bergius 2005 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 in general above ground shoot competition for light is considered to be more asymmetric whereas below ground root competition for water and nutrients is considered to be more symmetric weiner 1990 berger et al 2008 although root competition seems to be also asymmetric in several cases fransen et al 2001 rewald and leuschner 2009 studies have shown that with belowground resource limitation belowground root competition dominates and alters the self thinning rule leading to shallower thinning lines morris 2003 deng et al 2006 and this altered slope of self thinning lines is mainly caused by different modes of competition rather than resource limitation chu et al 2010 lin et al 2014 nonetheless not all interactions among plants are competitive facilitation the positive interactions among plants has been well acknowledged in ecology over the past two decades callaway and walker 1997 callaway 2007 brooker et al 2008 lin et al 2012 he et al 2013 schöb et al 2014 lin et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 facilitation among plants occurs via the enrichment to resources and or the moderation of biotic and abiotic stress leading to an increase in the survivorship growth and or reproduction of at least one of the interacting plants bertness and callaway 1994 lin et al 2012 facilitation can operate simultaneously with competition and plays an important role in driving population and community dynamics especially under harsh environmental conditions callaway 2007 brooker et al 2008 only a few theoretical studies have explored the effect of facilitation on the self thinning process and their findings suggest that facilitation can alter the self thinning line chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however the mode of facilitation considered in those studies was restricted to completely symmetric facilitation i e interacting plants receive the same amount of benefit from one another irrespective of their sizes just as in competition facilitation among plants can also be asymmetric where smaller plants receive disproportionally more benefits from larger plants lin et al 2012 a well known example of asymmetric facilitation is the nurse effect both empirical and theoretical studies have shown that the mode of facilitation can be quantitatively different and their effects on shaping plant populations and communities are also different holzapfel and mahall 1999 lin et al 2012 schöb et al 2014 lin et al 2016 by using both a simulation model and a greenhouse experiment lin et al 2016 showed that asymmetric facilitation can reduce size inequality in plant populations and resulted in delayed density dependent mortality in contrast to the effects of symmetric facilitation found by chu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2017 this implies that asymmetric facilitation may alter the self thinning line in a different way from symmetric facilitation and is a hypothesis that requires testing in addition to plant competition and facilitation there are other factors that potentially affect the self thinning line such as initial density weiner et al 2001 li et al 2013 spatial pattern weiner et al 2001 stoll and bergius 2005 lin et al 2012 resource level and abiotic stress level morris 2003 weiskittel et al 2009 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2014 species tolerance ability pretzsch 2006 weiskittel et al 2009 bravo oviedo et al 2018 and even the methods used for fitting the self thinning line bi et al 2000 zhang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 in addition the allometry of plants lin et al 2014 and plants adaptive behaviours peters et al 2018 can also lead to variation of the self thinning line however the relative effect and importance of different factors in altering self thinning is still unknown and have not yet to our knowledge been systematically explored it is difficult to test all these biotic and abiotic factors comprehensively and systematically via purely empirical experiments because a plantation experiments on self thinning are resource demanding and time consuming li et al 2013 b different factors can act simultaneously and to directly measure each factor and to separate their partial effect is nearly impossible because of practical difficulties lin et al 2012 2016 peters et al 2016 this justifies the application and domination of individual based simulation models ibms for studying this topic e g weiner et al 2001 chu et al 2009 2010 lin et al 2012 2013 2016 zhang et al 2017 ibms are a comprehensive environment for stepwise evaluations of the relative role and importance of each factor separately or in various combinations in ibms observed patterns at the system level emerge from the individual level and their interactions under different environmental conditions grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a this provides a useful tool to explore the relative role and importance of different factors at the individual and lower level in altering the self thinning at the system level and is valuable to further strengthen the link between ibms and empirical applications however to analyze and understand the behaviour of ibms and to make quantitative links between model variables inputs and observed patterns outputs is challenging grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a b ibms are usually sophisticated in their structures and contain a large number of parameters and variables at different levels making the emergent properties at higher levels highly diversified while similar observed patterns can also emerge from completely different mechanisms and scenarios combinations of variable settings furthermore correlations multicollinearity among different types of variables numeric or categorical nonlinearity of observed outputs and the huge size of simulation outputs are also difficulties associated with using classical methods for analyzing the outputs from ibms to overcome the difficulties mentioned above machine learning ml approaches have proved to be novel and useful tools for analyzing the outputs from ibms peters et al 2016 in a recent study peters et al 2016 used a new type of artificial neural network a so called self organizing map for analyzing a spatially explicit ibm of plant population dynamics their ml model successfully inferred the key driving variable from the remaining measurable variables and observed patterns demonstrating the great value of ml approaches to evaluate the outputs from ibms ml approaches are becoming more useful in biology and ecology cutler et al 2007 brieuc et al 2018 most of these ml algorithms are now readily available through commonly used statistical platforms such as r r core team 2017 these algorithms include artificial neural networks support vector machines gradient boosting trees and random forests rf all of which differ in their input requirements training tuning processes and performances among these ml approaches rf is one of the most widely used one in ecology because of its superior predictive performance and relatively simple implementation cutler et al 2007 rf is an ensemble ml approach that based on combining a large group of classification and regression trees carts breiman 2001 in rf each cart is an independent model of classification or regression for a randomly sampled subset of variables and data the prediction from an rf model is then made by averaging predictions of all carts for regression or by the majority voting of all carts for classification applications of rf in ecology include forest allometric scaling relationships duncanson et al 2015 tree species and patch distributions iverson et al 2008 veldhuis et al 2017 tree species richness and carbon storage lautenbach et al 2017 forest wind damage moore and lin in press forest coverage freeman et al 2015 and ecological genetics brieuc et al 2018 nevertheless the potential application of rf approach to self thinning and evaluating output from ibms has not been tested in this study we used a spatially explicit ibm to explore the relative role and importance of biotic and abiotic factors in altering the self thinning line in simulated plant populations the ibm we employed is based on fundamental physical principles and eco physiological mechanisms of individual plants which also includes different modes of both competition and facilitation simultaneously among plants under different environmental conditions lin et al 2012 2016 the self thinning process observed in the model is the pattern emerging from individual level plants and their interactions under different environmental conditions specifically we focused on two questions 1 what are the most important factors that alter the self thinning line 2 how does the self thinning line change in response to different factors to answer those questions we employed rf models for quantifying the extent and drivers of variations in the slope and intercept of the self thinning line we also used this study to highlight the joint application of ml approaches and ibms and their future applications in ecology 2 methods 2 1 individual based model and simulations the individual based pi model used in this study has been described in detail previously lin et al 2012 2013 2014 2016 and is based on the mte brown et al 2004 savage et al 2010 and zone of influence zoi approach weiner et al 2001 it includes different modes of both competition and facilitation among plants a detailed description of the model that follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing ibms grimm et al 2010 is enclosed in the supplementary material here we summarize the essential elements of the pi model the growth function of individual plants in our model is derived from an energy conservation equation of the mte west et al 2001 brown et al 2004 lin et al 2012 1 dm dt am 3 4 bm am 3 4 1 m m 0 1 4 where m is the body mass of the individual plant a and b are species specific constants and m 0 a b 4 is the plant s asymptotic maximum body mass calculated for dm dt 0 in our spatially explicit individual based model each individual plant is characterized as a circular zoi in two dimensional space a plant s zoi a represents the physical space occupied by it and the resources potentially available to it the zoi is allometrically related to the plant s body mass m as a c 0 m 3 4 enquist and niklas 2001 lin et al 2012 where c 0 is a normalization constant plants interact with neighbours when their zois overlap and the effective size of overlapping zois alters plants growth as consequences of different strengths and modes of both competition and facilitation lin et al 2012 2016 the resource competition and facilitation under abiotic stress are incorporated into eq 1 through dimensionless indices fp and fq respectively 2 dm dt fp fq ca 1 m m 1 4 where fp is the index of competition fq is the index of facilitation under abiotic stress c a c 0 is the initial growth rate and m fpfq 4 m 0 is the maximum biomass achievable in the presence of competition and facilitation under abiotic stress to explicitly implement different modes of competition we describe the competitive index fp as 3 f p a n o k 1 n o v i m i p j 1 n j v j m j p a o k a where ano represents the area not overlapping with neighbors ao k represents the n o areas overlapping with nj different neighbors parameter p determines the mode of competition ranging from complete symmetry p 0 competing plants equally share resources independent of their relative sizes to complete asymmetry p approaching infinity the largest plants obtain all the contested resources see pi model odd in the supplementary material for details and examples this competition index denotes the fraction of resources available in the zoi area which plant i could obtain after competing with nj different neighbours of sizes mj schwinning and weiner 1998 weiner et al 2001 to simplify we assume the species specific weighting constant of competition vi and vj equal 1 in this study similar to the index of competition the index of facilitation under abiotic stress fq is defined as 4 f q 1 s a f 1 1 s k 1 n o 1 w i m i q j 1 n j w j m j q a o k 1 where s indicates the level of abiotic stress ranging from 0 no abiotic stress to 1 extreme abiotic stress and af refers to total benefits the plant receives from all interactive neighbors which is calculated as the sum of the areas zois overlapped with neighbour plants the mode of facilitation among plants is determined by parameter q ranging from complete symmetry q 0 all plants receive the same amount of benefit from each other irrespective of their species or sizes to complete asymmetry q approaching infinity the beneficiary plant receives all benefits with no advantage to the benefactor plants see pi model odd in the supplementary material for details and examples when af 0 eq 4 becomes 1 s reflecting the effect of the abiotic stress without facilitation when there was no environmental stress s 0 fq becomes 1 reflecting the absence of facilitative effect under benign conditions brooker et al 2008 chu et al 2010 lin et al 2012 this facilitation index reflects the facilitative effects of relieving stress which is consistent with other models e g chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 but is more general lin et al 2012 2016 we also set the species specific weighting constant of facilitation wi and wj to 1 in this study given that the likelihood of mortality for a plant is proportional to its mass specific metabolic rate brown et al 2004 marbà et al 2007 we assume in the model that an individual plant should die if its actual growth rate realistic metabolic rate falls below a threshold fraction of its basal metabolic rate i e proportion to m 3 4 thus the mortality of plants in the model can be attributed to the metabolic inactivation caused by local resource competition abiotic stress senescence or combinations thereof this threshold of death also represents the tolerance ability of plants in the individual based pi model the initial body size of plants follows a random normal distribution the initial spatial arrangement of all plants can be represented as a cluster random or regular hexagon lin et al 2012 and all plants are distributed over a wrap around space so as to avoid edge effects grimm and railsback 2005 the pi model and all simulations are implemented in the free software platform netlogo 4 1 3 wilensky 1999 the model with source code and simulation experiment settings is contained in a nlogo file in the supplementary material in our simulation experiments we focused on six factors and investigated different modes or levels of each factor four modes of competition p 0 complete symmetry p 1 size symmetry p 10 allometric asymmetry and p complete asymmetry five modes of facilitation q 0 complete symmetry q 1 size symmetry p 10 allometric asymmetry q complete asymmetry and af 0 no facilitation six abiotic stress levels s equal 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 ranging from no stress condition to extremely high stress condition three initial densities 1000 5000 and 10 000 individual plants per unit area three initial patterns of spatial distribution cluster random and regular hexagon and three levels of threshold of death 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 of basal metabolic rate for each scenario combination of parameter settings we conducted five simulation runs by using different random seeds 1 2 3 4 and 5 the number of simulations conducted in total for this study was 16 200 2 2 self thinning line we collected average body mass of living plants and abundance of living plants in each scenario at each time step to fit the self thinning lines log log transformed data of mean body mass vs density of living plants observed in each scenario we selected data points based on a criterion of mortality westoby 1984 lin et al 2013 after density dependent mortality starts data points where the number of individual surviving plants was less than 90 of the initial density but more than 100 were selected for fitting self thinning lines in some scenarios plant populations collapsed very quickly e g plants have low level threshold of death under extremely high stress conditions and had insufficient self thinning trajectories therefore we only used self thinning trajectories that had more than three data points when fitting self thinning lines to explore the effects of different methods used to fit self thinning lines we employed three widely used methods to fit these lines zhang et al 2005 cubillo et al 2012 ordinary least square ols reduced major axis rma which considers errors in both dependent and independent variables and stochastic frontier analysis sfa the latter is purported to provide an efficient estimation of the self thinning boundary by considering random external factors and including all data points without subjective selection note that for the sfa method all data points were used and we did not select data points based on the criterion of mortality mentioned above for detailed descriptions see bi et al 2000 and zhang et al 2005 all linear fitting methods were conducted in r 3 4 4 r core team 2017 the ols and rma were applied by using the r package lmodel2 legendre 2014 and the sfa were carried out by using the r package frontier coelli and henningsen 2013 2 3 random forests model to evaluate the factors driving the variation in self thinning lines we employed rf models rf is a non parametric ensemble machine learning approach based on a large group of carts breiman 2001 each of the carts is a set of rules for splitting data its internal nodes denote tests on predictor variables and the data sample is split into two or more homogeneous subsets based on the most significant splitter value or category of predictor variables its leaves terminal nodes represent predictions for the value of target variables in the rf model each of the carts is trained and generated by a subset of data bootstrapped from the original data at the same time predictor variables are also randomly subsampled during the bootstrapping thus each of the carts in rf uses a different subsample of both the original data and the predictor variables which can de correlate variables and carts and introduce randomization by repeating this process rf trains and builds a large group of carts separately and uses those carts to make predictions the predictions are made by averaging predictions of carts for a regression purpose or by counting the majority voting of carts for a classification purpose we developed rf models of both the slope and intercept of self thinning lines to understand variability as a function of different factors the factors we used in the rf models as predictor variables were mode of competition mode of facilitation abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial distribution pattern threshold of death and method used for fitting self thinning lines the dataset of fitted self thinning lines slopes and intercepts was randomly divided into two parts a random sample of 75 of the full dataset which was used to train and tune the rf models and the remaining 25 of the full dataset which was used to validate the rf models training and tuning ml models is important but can be complicated for some ml models but is relatively easy for rf models compared to other ml models there are two important tuning parameters in the rf model freeman et al 2015 the first parameter mtry controls the number of predictor variables randomly sampled at each split in a cart although it has been proposed that the rf model is insensitive to mtry breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 we nevertheless tested five levels of mtry in our models for tuning 2 3 4 5 and 6 we found that the best predictive performance occurred when the value of mtry was 5 for both rf models although models performed very similarly at values of mtry higher than the default value of mtry 2 calculated as the number of total predictor variables divided by three the second parameter ntree determines the total number of carts to grow in a rf model it has been suggested not to use too few carts so that every input row can be predicted at least a few times liaw and wiener 2002 however the rf model with a large number of carts will be computationally expensive we used three levels of ntree for tuning 500 1000 and 2000 and found that ntree 1000 twice the default number of 500 gave the best outcome between model performance and computational expense when ntree was 2000 model performance was not improved significantly but this led to more than twice the computational time for both rf models to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables in our rf models we calculated the increase in mean squared error incmse of model predictions when a given variable was randomly permuted in the out of bag samples genuer et al 2010 a higher value of incmse indicates a more important predictor variable to make standardized measures of variable importance the importance of predictor variables was normalized by the maximum variable importance duncanson et al 2015 furthermore we used partial dependence plots to illustrate the changes of slope and intercept in response to different predictor variables under ceteris paribus conditions all rf models and analyses were implemented by using the r package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 3 results simulations of the individual based pi model demonstrated that there was significant variation in self thinning lines fig 1 although the most frequent value of slope was close to the theoretical value of 4 3 deviation from the theoretical predictions was also extensive fig 1 this significant variation in self thinning lines was mostly produced by biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions rather than by the method of fitting as the patterns of slope and intercept distribution were similar among the different methods of fitting fig 1 both rf models showed consistencies in their high accuracy of predictions fig 2 the rf model of slope we trained was able to explain 98 17 of the variation in the slope of self thinning lines in the training dataset when tested against the independent validation dataset that was randomly sampled from the whole dataset the rf model was still able to explain 98 14 of the variation fig 2 similarly the rf model of intercept we trained was able to explain 98 14 of the variation in the intercept of self thinning lines in the training dataset when tested with the independent validation dataset the model was also able to explain 98 12 of the variation fig 2 for the slope of the self thinning line mode of competition was the most important variable identified by the rf model table 1 for the rf model of intercept mode of competition was also the most important variable while abiotic stress level initial density initial spatial pattern mode of facilitation and threshold of death were found to be other important variables table 1 we used partial dependence plots to illustrate the marginal effect of each predictor variable on the self thinning lines after excluding the other variables fig 3 in the rf model the slope of the self thinning lines became steeper more negative when the competitive asymmetry increased fig 3a the remaining variables were less important in the rf model the slope was shallower when the initial spatial pattern of plants was more regular fig 3b higher initial density also tended to make the slope shallower fig 3c the slope became steeper with increased abiotic stress level fig 3d and higher threshold of death for plants fig 3e in general facilitation can steepen the slope but this was not the case when facilitation was completely asymmetric which attenuated the slope in contrast to other modes of facilitation fig 3f compared with the slope fitted by the ols method the slope estimated by the rma method was slightly steeper but the slope given by the sfa method was slightly shallower fig 3g in the rf model for intercept most of the variables were found to be important the intercept of the self thinning line generally increased with the competitive asymmetry fig 3h from no stress condition to moderately harsh condition the intercept of the self thinning line was relatively constant but decreased rapidly with increased stress level fig 3i the intercept declined with increased initial density fig 3j when the initial spatial arrangement of plants became more regular the intercept decreased fig 3k when facilitation occurred the intercept was generally higher than without facilitation but this was not the case when facilitation was completely asymmetric which lowered the intercept fig 3l a higher threshold of death led to higher values of the intercept fig 3m the effect of fitting method on intercept was less important and there were only slight differences among different methods on the fitted intercept the rma method gave the highest estimation of the intercept the sfa method gave the lowest estimate of the intercept and the ols method gave estimates of the intercept between those from the other two methods fig 3n 4 discussion we used an individual based plant population model to explore how various biotic and abiotic factors affect the self thinning process in particular we employed the ml approach of rf models to evaluate and quantify the relative importance and extent of different factors in altering thinning lines of simulated plant populations the joint application of ibm and rf enabled us to assess a wide range of factors systematically and to reveal distinct effects and importance of each factor in altering the slope and intercept of the self thinning line our results showed that mode of competition was the most important factor among those investigated that can alter the self thinning line table 1 given that the self thinning process is density dependent mortality driven by local plant competition our finding is consistent with ecological expectations according to previous studies chu et al 2010 lin et al 2013 2014 when competition is more symmetric it leads to flatter self thinning lines at a given density fig 3a this is because symmetric competition can moderate the onset of mortality among plants although their growth is reduced weiner et al 2001 as a consequence plants can survive and slowly grow at relatively high densities resulting in less average biomass being accumulated at a given density under symmetric competition stoll and bergius 2005 lin et al 2013 thus symmetric competition not only alters the slope of the thinning line but also the intercept which reflects biomass packing by plants this is something that has only been discussed to a limited extent previously li et al 2013 for the other factors we explored here their relative role in altering the slope of thinning line is much less important than competition but these factors still play important roles in altering the intercept of the thinning line table 1 more uniform initial spatial arrangement of plants and higher density tend to reduce the growth rates of competing plants in a rather homogeneous way resulting in smaller and more equally sized plants by reducing competitive divergence among them weiner et al 2001 consequently when spatial pattern is more regular and initial density is higher the slope of the self thinning line is flatter and the intercept is lower in agreement with our results li et al 2013 found that initial density did not significantly affect the slope of the self thinning lines in buckwheat fagopyrum esculentum moench populations but had a significant effect on the intercept our results are consist with their conclusion that initial density affects the intercept of the self thinning line rather than the slope the abiotic stress level is also an important factor in our model abiotic stress and resource limitation are modeled to reduce the growth of all plants under benign to moderate conditions mortality of plants is mainly driven by competition and abiotic stress is less important for plant death when environmental conditions become very harsh plants are more stressed consequently under these very harsh conditions the growth of surviving plants is reduced and the mortality is substantially increased suggesting a steeper and much lower thinning line under harsh conditions but flatter and higher thinning lines under benign to moderate conditions in a recent study ge et al 2017 analyzed 553 plots of china fir cunninghamia lanceolata lamb hook and found that the slope of self thinning line was steeper in the lower quality sites which is in agreement with our findings fig 3d although a common self thinning line has been observed in some experiments with different levels of abiotic stress and resource limitation reviewed in morris 2003 there have been numerous studies that show exceptions e g deng et al 2006 liu et al 2006 lin et al 2014 in some of these cases abiotic stress and resource limitation were shown to also alter the allometry of plants lin et al 2014 peters et al 2018 and the modes of both competition and facilitation lin et al 2012 2016 which can also lead to the variation of the self thinning line the threshold of death represents the tolerance ability of plants which can vary among different species our models show that the self thinning line in plant populations with a higher threshold of death tends to be steeper and higher this result is supported by empirical studies showing that the thinning line for tree species with higher shade tolerance also has a steeper slope and a higher intercept pretzsch 2006 weiskittel et al 2009 bravo oviedo et al 2018 indicating that the functional traits and life history strategies of different tree species are also important and should be considered in detail in future studies in addition we only explored the case of a mono culture but the case of mixed cultures is also important and can be easily explored by using the pi model recent studies on plant positive interactions have shown that facilitation plays an important role in driving plant population dynamics by using similar zoi models chu et al 2010 and zhang et al 2017 found that facilitation significantly increases the intercept of self thinning line but showed little effect on the slope which result is in agreement with our finding although chu et al 2010 suggested that facilitation tend to flatten the self thinning line whereas zhang et al 2017 concluded that facilitation steepens the self thinning line as we found however they only considered symmetric facilitation in their models when facilitation is asymmetric larger plants benefactors suffer the most from environmental stress whereas smaller plants beneficiaries can receive disproportionately more benefit from their neighbouring benefactors for maintenance and growth which can reduce size inequality and delay onset of mortality resulting in a shallower self thinning line apart from this the received benefit between interacting plants is more unidirectional towards smaller plants in asymmetric facilitation smaller plants can still survive and compete with neighbouring plants which leads to an overall reduced growth of all surviving plants thus lowering the self thinning line in comparison to symmetric facilitation this effect of asymmetric facilitation on self thinning has not been considered before and should be tested in future studies compared to other factors different methods used for fitting the self thinning line are much less important although there are slight differences among the three methods we explored their effects on the variation in slope and intercept terms is insignificant our finding is generally in agreement with previous empirical studies zhang et al 2005 sun et al 2010 cubillo et al 2012 the individual based pi model we used in this study has been proved to be realistic in its fundamental assumptions and model structure its multiple patterns observed at system level emerged from individual levels and have been validated by empirical observations lin et al 2013 2012 and experiments lin et al 2014 2016 there have been no presupposing assumptions made in the model on the relative importance of different factors in altering the self thinning process and the self thinning process explored in the model is a system level pattern that entirely emerged from individual plants and their interactions to changes of different factors to comprehensively explore and measure the relative effect and importance of those factors in empirical experiments requires massive efforts and is often impossible for instance competition and facilitation act simultaneously and the associated effects of the environmental stress and plant facilitation are impossible to separate in empirical experiments or observations lin et al 2012 2016 peters et al 2016 there are also other factors considered to be important in altering the self thinning line such as plant allometry li et al 2013 which are worth exploring in future studies by using similar modelling approaches as we employed here nevertheless ibms are indispensable tools for studying plant population dynamics in both theoretical and applied ecology using ibms enables us to explore the partial effect and importance of those factors and to understand the mechanism of system dynamics it can also support decision making and applications in ecological conservation agriculture and forestry grimm and railsback 2005 grimm and berger 2016a however ibms are usually criticized as being as difficult to understand as the real system for a well developed ibm that contains key elements of structural realism emergence and prediction a certain level of complexity is required grimm and berger 2016a this complexity can easily lead to multi hierarchical levels of model structure and tens of parameters and variables how to understand model outcomes and patterns emerging from different mechanisms and their changes in response to different scenarios represented by different model settings is a major challenge with complex ibms peters et al 2016 used a new type of artificial neural network for analyzing a spatially explicit ibm of plant population dynamics their study showed that a joint application of ibm with an ml approach was able to precisely predict ibm variables at individual level from emerged patterns observed at system level and helped to visualize multidimensional correlation patterns from ibm outputs to inputs in the study we present here rf models proved to be powerful in predicting patterns and dynamics at the system level from fundamental variables of the ibm in addition rf is able to evaluate the relative importance of all variables and their partial effects on the emerged patterns and dynamics at the system level providing a new and reverse way of understanding the ibm from inputs to outputs there are other powerful ml algorithms which differ in their input requirements training tuning processes and performances however what sets rf apart from those other approaches and prompted us to use rf are three key features the first is its relatively simple implementation and high predictive performance an rf model contains only two parameters which makes it very easy to implement and to tune in comparison to other ml approaches while its performance is still very good breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 moore and lin in press the ease of use is an important feature of rf for ecologists who may have limited experience in using other more complicated ml approaches the second feature is its novel way of evaluating variable importance rf models do not suffer some of the shortcomings of other variable selection methods such as identifying only one or two variables among a pool of predictors that are equally good but highly correlated as a nonparametric ensemble method rf aggregates the results of many carts that have been built in parallel and independently and variables that are correlated and or have similar importance are treated equally this is important for analyzing ibms in which the variables are highly correlated and there are strong interactions among them last but not least rf is a flexible tool that can deal with different data and can be used for different purposes including regression classification unsupervised learning and missing value imputation unlike many traditional statistical methods rf makes no distributional assumptions on the predictor or response variables and the variables can be either quantitative numeric or qualitative categorical based on the features we mentioned above rf is a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding complex ibms studies on self thinning now aim at understanding how the variability arises in response to different biotic and abiotic factors and to predict the changes in self thinning our study is the first to systematically evaluate the relative effect and importance of relevant factors in altering the self thinning line and it is also an attempt to jointly apply an ibm with an ml approach to analyze complex patterns and system dynamics our study confirms what is generally believed about the crucial role of competition in driving self thinning process and also highlights the distinct effects and importance of other factors in altering thinning lines the joint application of a mechanistic ibm with an ml approach provides us with new insights into the self thinning mechanisms which cannot be derived from purely empirical works suggesting the prospect of further synergy

25098,large scale inter basin water diversion projects would have a set of ecological and environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems however knowledge regarding water transfer induced water quality changes in determining fish communities in the impounding ecosystems remain largely unknown in the current study we filled this research gap by using a set of machine learning algorithms to ensemble modelling fish community indices with water quality indicators in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of china s south to north water diversion project snwdp overall our results realed that water quality changes can be good predictors for the variation of fish community structures in these lakes although different model techniques highlighted different variable importance of water quality in determining fish communities there is generally a consensus that the hydrological related water quality indicators like water clarity e g total suspended solids and nutrient loading e g phosphate contributed the most to the changes of fish communities our results also indicated that water diversions could bring knock on effects on fish communities thus more attention should be paid to long term ecological effects from future water diversions keywords ensemble modelling fish communities ecological impacts machine learning south to north water diversion project water quality changes 1 introduction large scale inter basin water diversion projects have been developed around the world to alleviate water scarcity problems for instance the california north to south water transfer project and the central arizona project in usa the quebec water transfer project in canada the snowy mountains water transfer project in australia the west to north water transfer project in pakistan the moscow canal in russia bavaria water transfer project in germany the national river linking project in india and the south to north water diversion project in china chen 2004 wang et al 2008 zhuang 2016 although these projects can support socio economic developments in the receiving regions they are also considered to trigger potential ecological and environmental impacts and fundamental disturbances on the related freshwater ecosystems for example these projects could create invasion corridors for non native species clarkson 2004 alter river flow and substrates significantly change water quality and thus leading to shifts in floodplain habitats grimaldo et al 2009 however floodplain habitats are central to assemblage structuring of freshwater fishes meador and goldstein 2003 lin et al 2017 as such it is widely accepted that any large scale transfers of water are likely to modify downstream fish diversity and assemblages as well as the abundance thereof meador 1992 grimaldo et al 2009 lin et al 2017 still unknown to us is how transfer induced water quality changes will subsequent affect the fish communities the chinese government launched one of the world s largest water transfer programs i e the south to north water diversion project snwdp including eastern central and western routes to alleviate severe water scarcity in northern china where more than 300 325 million people living in a highly water stressed region berkoff 2003 ma et al 2006 the first phase of the eastern route of the snwdp started in operation since october 2013 pumping water from the lower reach of the yangtze river and connecting the yangtze river huaihe river yellow river and haihe river via the beijing hangzhou grand canal water transferred from the yangtze river will pass through and impound most of the largest lakes in eastern china including gaoyou lake hongze lake luoma lake nansi lake and dongping lake zhang 2009 zhuang 2016 although it is generally agreed that the snwdp will relieve northern china s water crisis there are still major ecological and environmental concerns surrounding the construction of the eastern route of the snwdp including 1 the ecological impacts of lake impoundment 2 water quality degradation along the canal 3 secondary salinization in the receiving areas and 4 invasion of alien species shen et al 2002 zhang 2009 among which water quality changes associated with the impoundment should be one of the most significant and direct impacts in regulated lakes since the eastern route passed through the most developed regions of china where of major concern is the water quality along the channel additionally agricultural activities cause nonpoint pollution to the riverine and lake systems zhang 2009 these lakes not only serve as drinking water sources but also represent important wetland ecosystems for plants fishes birds and mammals xie and chen 1999 however little is currently known about the response of fish communities to water quality changes arising from the snwdp although the determination of environmental factors structuring communities remains one of the major objectives in fish ecological studies albert and reis 2011 lujan et al 2013 olden et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 moreover comparisons of fish community structure in lakes conducted at the regional scale have highlighted predictable links between community structure and environmental variations the investigation of how environmental factors physico chemical shape the structure of natural assemblages can also produce acceptable explanations for community level problems under a wide variety of conditions tonn and magnuson 1982 the physico chemical parameters of the water bodies are generally revealed as the prevailing roles in structuring fish communities especially in regional scale or local scale studies i e zhao et al 2016 chea et al 2016 however the most important factors in determining species composition differ among water bodies ranging from physical habitat to water chemistry amarasinghe and welcomme 2002 petry et al 2003 zhao et al 2006 considering a regional scale the study of fish community structure related with environmental variations is always challenging because of the limitation in modelling the non linear relationships between fish community with environmental variations chea et al 2016 over the last several decades effectively modelling the composition of fish assemblages on the basis of biotic and abiotic environmental descriptors is considered important in ecology and many methods have been utilized to develop these models guisan and zimmermann 2000 increasingly numerous machine learning algorithms such as generalized linear models glms mccullagh and nelder 1989 generalized

complementary approaches i e multi mesh gillnet and ground cages from april to may in 2017 during the water transfer period fish sampling was conducted in eight to thirteen sections in each lake for instance 8 13 8 11 8 sampling sections were settled in gyl hzl lml nsl and dpl respectively depending mostly on the lake area and habitat heterogeneity a total of 48 sections was thus sampled in each sampling section one pelagic multi mesh gillnet one benthic multi mesh gillnet and one ground trap net were set together the multi mesh gillnet was modified from swedish standard methods which was composed of 12 panels knot to knot with mesh sizes from 5 to 55 mm i e 5 6 25 8 10 12 5 15 5 19 5 24 30 35 43 and 55 mm the size of each mutli mesh gillnet was 1 5 m high and 30 m long different mesh panels were assembled randomly but all gillnets have the same order of mesh panels appelberg 2000 the frame of the ground trap net was made of bamboo and covered with a net mesh size of 5 mm stone sinkers and plastic floats give stability to the trap when set on the bottom of the lake each trap net is a rectangular cuboid with about 25 m long the cuboid has been partitioned into 20 cubes with two openings of 10 cm diameter from front and behind for fish to enter the trap in all the studied lakes fish sampling was started in the afternoon approx 17 00 and finished in the next morning approx 5 00 with a total of around 12 h to avoid excessive accumulation of fish in the nets erős et al 2009 individuals collected were immediately identified to species counted weighed to the nearest gram fish species identified in the five impounded lakes were listed in table 1 2 8 response variables fish community metrics in the present study some metrics of fish community structure were calculated and considered as response variables including fish abundance a fish biomass b shannon wiener diversity h and pielou evenness j composition of fish communities in the impounded lakes are listed in table 1 to avoid bias the relative values of fish abundance and biomass in each site were employed in the predictive models species diversity and equitability were determined for each sampling site using a set of indicators as species richness sr shannon wiener diversity h and pielou evenness j index respectively with the following formulas 1 h i 1 s p i l o g 2 p i 2 j h lns where p i represents the relative abundance of each fish species and s represents total species richness the diversity indices were all calculated using vegan package jari et al 2018 in r r core team 2013 2 9 predictor variables water quality characteristics water samples were collected along with the fish sampling at the same sites and a set of 18 physico chemical water quality variables of the impounded lakes were monitored and analyzed water temperature wt conductivity cond dissolved oxygen do and ph were monitored using portable multi parameter water quality meter ysi professional plus water depth

ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n no2 n and total suspended solids tss were analyzed according to apha 2005 details of the predictor variables were listed in table 2 2 10 modelling techniques employed in our study we used 6 machine learning techniques which are frequently employed to quantifying the relations between aquatic communities and environmental variables they including k nearest neighbours knn partial least squares pls support vector machines svm classification and regression trees cart and artificial neural networks ann and generalized linear model glm 2 10 1 k nearest neighbours knn k nearest neighbours are a rather simple method of classification fix and hodges 1951 the algorithm finds a group of k observations closest to the test observation in terms of euclidean distance the proportion of the votes for the positive class is then returned as a probability the k nearest neighbors algorithm could be viewed as a nonparametric method for classification the basic idea of knn is to classify the test sample into some class according to its nearest neighbors 2 10 2 partial least squares pls this method extracts orthogonal latent factors for the covariates and the outcome and thus indirectly models the influence of the predictors on the outcome component scores are estimated to optimize the covariance between the scores and the response variable it has less strict model assumptions than for instance linear discriminant analysis lda 2 10 3 support vector machines svm svm originally developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 is arguably one of the most successful machine learning algorithms developed over the last decade svm is a computational algorithm that learns by example to assign labels to objects svms have several appealing characteristics for modellers for instance they are based on statistics rather than on loose analogies with natural learning systems and they theoretically guarantee performance cristianini and scholkopf 2002 svms use a functional relationship known as a kernel to map data onto a new hyperspace in which complicated patterns can be represented more simply muller et al 2001 a full svm analysis requires three steps and ideally in each of these three steps a separate part of the data is used 1 model selection 2 fitting and 3 validation 2 10 4 classification and regression trees cart cart originally introduced by breiman et al 1984 is a statistical technique that from a large number of explanatory variables x can select those that are most important in determining the response variable y to be explained carts are regression trees if the response variable is numerical and classification trees if the response variable is categorical cart is done by growing a tree structure which partitions the data into mutually exclusive groups nodes each as pure or homogeneous as possible concerning their response variable such a tree starts with a root node containing all the objects which are divided into nodes by recursive binary splitting each split is defined by a simple rule based on a single explanatory variable 2 10 5 artificial neural networks ann anns is a biologically inspired modelling approach mcculloch and pitts 1943 rumelhart et al 1986 the flexibility of ann techniques has led to their widespread use in various domains including business chemical technology computing sciences engineering and environmental and ecological sciences widespread applications of ann in ecology and environmental sciences appeared in the late 1990s several ann models and algorithms have been employed in handling complex data and solving complex problems in ecology and environmental sciences here in the current model package the generalized term of ann was used 2 10 6 generalized linear model glm glm is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution the glm generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value hastie and tibshirani 1990 2 11 model calibration and evaluation generally three repeats of 10 fold cross validation was used as the resampling method to calibrate the predictive models this method partitions the data into 10 subsets while maintaining the proportionality of group representations the model is then trained on 9 of the subsets and uses the remaining subset to assess its accuracy this process is then repeated until all subsets have been used as training and test sets since this method can overestimate model accuracies we then used the remaining 20 of each original library as another test of the accuracies of the final models since all the predictive models in our study are regression models three different performance measures such as mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to evaluate model performance all the models were performed with caret package kuhn 2008 which contains a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models all the data analysis and plots were generated in r platform r development core team 2013 3 results 3 1 model performance performance of all the 7 predictive models were showed in fig 2 a b c and d significant differences were found among the 7 predictive models especially when predicting different response variables the mean values of r2 from the 7 predictive models for predicting fish total abundance total biomass shannon wiener indices and pielou evenness indices of each site were 0 60 0 08 0 70 0 03 0 64 0 04 and 0 63 0 06 respectively the fish community structure was well predicted by the selected water quality parameters specifically when predicting total fish abundance glm knn and rf predicted better than other models fig 2a when predicting total fish biomass rf cart and knn performed better than others fig 2b when predicting h index glm pls and rf gave better predictions fig 2c while rf glm and cart gave better predictions in predicting pielou evenness indices fig 2d 3 2 variable importance in predicting species abundance and biomass when predicting fish community structure with water quality parameters different predictive models selected different predictors with variable importance fig 3 and fig 4 for instance in predicting fish species abundance in each sampling site glm showed that tss wt po4 ph no2n tp and nh4n were important cart showed that cond tss th tur sd wt do were important knn showed that tss cond do th tur no3n cl were important svm showed tss cond do th tur no3n cl were important variables ann found that tss th do wt cl cod tur were important predictors pls showed cond th tur tss chla do wt were important variables fig 3 a b when predicting fish species biomass in each sampling site glm showed that tss po4 nh4n ph wd cod and chla were important cart showed that tss cond sd do th tp chla were important knn showed that cond th tss cl do sd tur were important svm showed cond th tss cl do sd tur were important variables ann found that cond th tss wt do tur ph were important predictors pls showed tss th tur cl cond cod chla were important variables fig 4a b 3 3 variable importance in predicting biodiversity indices in predicting shannon wiener indices glm showed that tur wt no3n po4 tn ph wd were important cart showed that tur cond sd th do wt po4 were important knn showed that tur th sd do cond cl tp were important svm showed tur th sd do cond cl tp were important variables ann found that tur th wt cod tss chla cond were important predictors pls showed tur th tss cond chla cl cod were important variables fig 5 a b in predicting pielou evenness indices glm showed that wt tur po4 no3n tn cl ph were important cart showed that sd tur cond do th tss chla were important knn showed that tur th cond sd do cl wt were important svm showed tur th sd do cond cl wt were important variables ann found that cond wt cod th cl do tss were important predictors pls showed tur cond tss th cl chla cod were important variables fig 6 a b 4 discussions it is widely accepted that predictions from different models could vary a lot even if for one given species outcomes of prediction may vary from model to model with much uncertainties convertino et al 2014 guo et al 2015 as different predictive models rely on different mathematical functions machine learning algorithms will give a variety of results without doubt up until now numerous studies have compared accuracy and performance of predictions from different statistical techniques elith and leathwick 2007 and confirmed that results derived from different model techniques or different model building assumptions can occasionally differ grossly thuiller 2003 luoto et al 2005 in the current study model performance differed from each of the predictive model and even if for one specific model the model performance varied with response variables our results also highlighted that predictions from single species distribution model sdm were so variable for all species while ensemble approaches could yield more reliable predictions more attentions should be paid when we select the right predictive model for the data analysis although the high predictive abilities for predicting future scenarios of these models the present study didn t intend to investigate the predictive performance and uncertainties in real predictions and projections rather than to relate fish communities with potential variables future works could be expected to extend our current model by doing some projections in future hypothetical scenarios in fact if these models were used for prediction in future a global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses gsua is a robust method and strongly recommended to be used to globally investigate the uncertainty of sdms and the importance of species distributions drivers in space and time convertino et al 2014 servadio and convertino 2018 following the snwdp all water level regulated lakes will experience similar environmental changes including increased water level surface area and water quality changes these changes in hydrology and water quality are highly likely to further alter biota and ecosystem functions generally when the ratio of water depth to transparency is greater than 2 5 5 9 in shallow lakes of the yangtze river basin the reproduction and growth of submerged macrophytes are affected liang and liu 1995 for instance the transparency values in most regions of the impounded hongze lake are fairly low thus after the snwdp becomes operational an increase in water depth should reduce the abundance and distribution of submerged macrophytes overall the present study showed that physic chemical parameters of water quality such as tss tur sd cond po4 no3 n cod chla were very good predictors in determining fish community structure these findings were consistent with many other previous studies in shallow lakes cheng et al 2012 this indicates that electric conductivity clarity and trophic states of lake water could be good predictors for variations of fish communities our findings were generally in accordance with many other previous studies in european lakes brucet et al 2013 asian lakes cheng et al 2010 south american lakes tejerina garro et al 1998 and north american lakes amarasinghe and welcomme 2002 however the most interesting finding in our study was that these significant water quality variables were all directly linked to the water transfer project as the snwdp would inevitably change the hydrological process the routinely fluctuations of water level the water clarity and conductivity will thus be forecasted to change considerably along the water transfer it is therefore that major knock on effects would be expected on fish communities in the impounded lakes lin et al 2017 in fact the physic chemical factors related with water transparency tss tur sd cond chla which is usually significantly positively correlated with macrophytes van donk and van de bund 2002 was a surrogate to the submerged macrophytes contribution to affect fish communities submerged macrophytes are usually considered as the main factor determining fish assemblages in lakes due to their functions of providing habitat complexity and heterogeneity which support niche segregation brosse et al 2007 cheng et al 2012 as suggested that macrophytes in lakes can benefit water quality the disappearance of macrophytes could deteriorate water conditions e g increase of trophic status decrease of water clarity indeed a reversal of the hydrologic regime in these lakes along with an increase in lake water level could severely impact the vascular plant communities in these lakes it is estimated that the aquatic plant biomass will decrease by 0 2 0 25 million tons in dongping lake from the water transfer zhou et al 1994 wan et al 2003 water depth is also a key factor in structuring fish communities as it acts directly on water transparency lin et al 2017 considering that all the impounding lakes is a shallow lake where water depth is generally less than 3 m the differences in physic chemical parameters caused by water depth are likely to be limited therefore the contribution of water depth could be due to its high positive correlation with macrophytes as shown by liu et al 2006 as we mentioned that the water diversion in the eastern route was mainly conducted using pump stations to increase the water level in those lakes it is therefore that the water clarity the opposite of turbidity and tss and sd would significantly decrease during the water transfer period due to the large scale water exchange zhang 2009 this phenomenon was more apparent in hzl and gyl as these two lakes were serving as transitional lakes all the time and water exchanges in these two lakes were very common wang and dou 1998 moreover navigation in hzl and gyl sand mining in these lakes especially in lml and dpl may also contribute to the water quality degradation such as decreased clarity and increased conductivity and sometimes increased concentrations of nutrients chen et al 2017a the other potential reason for the variation of water quality in the five lakes could attribute to the urbanization and economic development in the basin chen et al 2017b the eastern route of the snwdp is located on one of the most developed regions of china large amounts of untreated industrial wastewater are released into the lakes liu and zheng 2002 although the government has been very active on pollution control in past several decades monitoring results suggest efforts are not very effective for instance water quality parameters such as chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen species concentrations were deteriorated from south to north along the beijing hangzhou grand canal mao et al 2001 wan et al 2003 previous studies also found that nutrients such as total phosphorus and total nitrogen also had significant correlations with fish composition and diversity in shallow lakes of the yangtze river basin cheng et al 2012 therefore changes in nutrient flux and water pollution would have an influence on the structure of fish assemblages as well as population densities cheng et al 2010 in conclusion our study quantified the relationships between fish community structure and physical chemical parameters of water quality in the context of large scale water diversion project using a set of machine learning models although there was still no consistent high performance among all the model outputs we highlighted that water quality changes can be good predictors for fish community variations and the facts that water quality changes associated with water diversion would have knock on effects on fish communities acknowledgements we are grateful to the fisheries management commissions of hongze lake luoma lake gao bao shaobo lake dongping lake and nansi lake for providing

25098,large scale inter basin water diversion projects would have a set of ecological and environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems however knowledge regarding water transfer induced water quality changes in determining fish communities in the impounding ecosystems remain largely unknown in the current study we filled this research gap by using a set of machine learning algorithms to ensemble modelling fish community indices with water quality indicators in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of china s south to north water diversion project snwdp overall our results realed that water quality changes can be good predictors for the variation of fish community structures in these lakes although different model techniques highlighted different variable importance of water quality in determining fish communities there is generally a consensus that the hydrological related water quality indicators like water clarity e g total suspended solids and nutrient loading e g phosphate contributed the most to the changes of fish communities our results also indicated that water diversions could bring knock on effects on fish communities thus more attention should be paid to long term ecological effects from future water diversions keywords ensemble modelling fish communities ecological impacts machine learning south to north water diversion project water quality changes 1 introduction large scale inter basin water diversion projects have been developed around the world to alleviate water scarcity problems for instance the california north to south water transfer project and the central arizona project in usa the quebec water transfer project in canada the snowy mountains water transfer project in australia the west to north water transfer project in pakistan the moscow canal in russia bavaria water transfer project in germany the national river linking project in india and the south to north water diversion project in china chen 2004 wang et al 2008 zhuang 2016 although these projects can support socio economic developments in the receiving regions they are also considered to trigger potential ecological and environmental impacts and fundamental disturbances on the related freshwater ecosystems for example these projects could create invasion corridors for non native species clarkson 2004 alter river flow and substrates significantly change water quality and thus leading to shifts in floodplain habitats grimaldo et al 2009 however floodplain habitats are central to assemblage structuring of freshwater fishes meador and goldstein 2003 lin et al 2017 as such it is widely accepted that any large scale transfers of water are likely to modify downstream fish diversity and assemblages as well as the abundance thereof meador 1992 grimaldo et al 2009 lin et al 2017 still unknown to us is how transfer induced water quality changes will subsequent affect the fish communities the chinese government launched one of the world s largest water transfer programs i e the south to north water diversion project snwdp including eastern central and western routes to alleviate severe water scarcity in northern china where more than 300 325 million people living in a highly water stressed region berkoff 2003 ma et al 2006 the first phase of the eastern route of the snwdp started in operation since october 2013 pumping water from the lower reach of the yangtze river and connecting the yangtze river huaihe river yellow river and haihe river via the beijing hangzhou grand canal water transferred from the yangtze river will pass through and impound most of the largest lakes in eastern china including gaoyou lake hongze lake luoma lake nansi lake and dongping lake zhang 2009 zhuang 2016 although it is generally agreed that the snwdp will relieve northern china s water crisis there are still major ecological and environmental concerns surrounding the construction of the eastern route of the snwdp including 1 the ecological impacts of lake impoundment 2 water quality degradation along the canal 3 secondary salinization in the receiving areas and 4 invasion of alien species shen et al 2002 zhang 2009 among which water quality changes associated with the impoundment should be one of the most significant and direct impacts in regulated lakes since the eastern route passed through the most developed regions of china where of major concern is the water quality along the channel additionally agricultural activities cause nonpoint pollution to the riverine and lake systems zhang 2009 these lakes not only serve as drinking water sources but also represent important wetland ecosystems for plants fishes birds and mammals xie and chen 1999 however little is currently known about the response of fish communities to water quality changes arising from the snwdp although the determination of environmental factors structuring communities remains one of the major objectives in fish ecological studies albert and reis 2011 lujan et al 2013 olden et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 moreover comparisons of fish community structure in lakes conducted at the regional scale have highlighted predictable links between community structure and environmental variations the investigation of how environmental factors physico chemical shape the structure of natural assemblages can also produce acceptable explanations for community level problems under a wide variety of conditions tonn and magnuson 1982 the physico chemical parameters of the water bodies are generally revealed as the prevailing roles in structuring fish communities especially in regional scale or local scale studies i e zhao et al 2016 chea et al 2016 however the most important factors in determining species composition differ among water bodies ranging from physical habitat to water chemistry amarasinghe and welcomme 2002 petry et al 2003 zhao et al 2006 considering a regional scale the study of fish community structure related with environmental variations is always challenging because of the limitation in modelling the non linear relationships between fish community with environmental variations chea et al 2016 over the last several decades effectively modelling the composition of fish assemblages on the basis of biotic and abiotic environmental descriptors is considered important in ecology and many methods

fish species identified in the five impounded lakes were listed in table 1 2 8 response variables fish community metrics in the present study some metrics of fish community structure were calculated and considered as response variables including fish abundance a fish biomass b shannon wiener diversity h and pielou evenness j composition of fish communities in the impounded lakes are listed in table 1 to avoid bias the relative values of fish abundance and biomass in each site were employed in the predictive models species diversity and equitability were determined for each sampling site using a set of indicators as species richness sr shannon wiener diversity h and pielou evenness j index respectively with the following formulas 1 h i 1 s p i l o g 2 p i 2 j h lns where p i represents the relative abundance of each fish species and s represents total species richness the diversity indices were all calculated using vegan package jari et al 2018 in r r core team 2013 2 9

ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n no2 n and total suspended solids tss were analyzed according to apha 2005 details of the predictor variables were listed in table 2 2 10 modelling techniques employed in our study we used 6 machine learning techniques which are frequently employed to quantifying the relations between aquatic communities and environmental variables they including k nearest neighbours knn partial least squares pls support vector machines svm classification and regression trees cart and artificial neural networks ann and generalized linear model glm 2 10 1 k nearest neighbours knn k nearest neighbours are a rather simple method of classification fix and hodges 1951 the algorithm finds a group of k observations closest to the test observation in terms of euclidean distance the proportion of the votes for the positive class is then returned as a probability the k nearest neighbors algorithm could be viewed as a nonparametric method for classification the basic idea of knn is to classify the test sample into some class according to its nearest neighbors 2 10 2 partial least squares pls this method extracts orthogonal latent factors for the covariates and the outcome and thus indirectly models the influence of the predictors on the outcome component scores are estimated to optimize the covariance between the scores and the response variable it has less strict model assumptions than for instance linear discriminant analysis lda 2 10 3 support vector machines svm svm originally developed by cortes and vapnik 1995 is arguably one of the most successful machine learning algorithms developed over the last decade svm is a computational algorithm that learns by example to assign labels to objects svms have several appealing characteristics for modellers for instance they are based on statistics rather than on loose analogies with natural learning systems and they theoretically guarantee performance cristianini and scholkopf 2002 svms use a functional relationship known as a kernel to map data onto a new hyperspace in which complicated patterns can be represented more simply muller et al 2001 a full svm analysis requires three steps and ideally in each of these three steps a separate part of the data is used 1 model selection 2 fitting and 3 validation 2 10 4 classification and regression trees cart cart originally introduced by breiman et al 1984 is a statistical technique that from a large number of explanatory variables x can select those that are most important in determining the response variable y to be explained carts are regression trees if the response variable is numerical and classification trees if the response variable is categorical cart is done by growing a tree structure which partitions the data into mutually exclusive groups nodes each as pure or homogeneous as possible concerning their response variable such a tree starts with a root node containing all the objects which are divided into nodes by recursive binary splitting each split is defined by a simple rule based on a single explanatory variable 2 10 5 artificial neural networks ann anns is a biologically inspired modelling approach mcculloch and pitts 1943 rumelhart et al 1986 the flexibility of ann techniques has led to their widespread use in various domains including business chemical technology computing sciences engineering and environmental and ecological sciences widespread applications of ann in ecology and environmental sciences appeared in the late 1990s several ann models and algorithms have been employed in handling complex data and solving complex problems in ecology and environmental sciences here in the current model package the generalized term of ann was used 2 10 6 generalized linear model glm glm is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution the glm generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value hastie and tibshirani 1990 2 11 model calibration and evaluation generally three repeats of 10 fold cross validation was used as the resampling method to calibrate the predictive models this method partitions the data into 10 subsets while maintaining the proportionality of group representations the model is then trained on 9 of the subsets and uses the remaining subset to assess its accuracy this process is then repeated until all subsets have been used as training and test sets since this method can overestimate model accuracies we then used the remaining 20 of each original library as another test of the accuracies of the final models since all the predictive models in our study are regression models three different performance measures such as mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to evaluate model performance all the models were performed with caret package kuhn 2008 which contains a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models all the data analysis and plots were generated in r platform r development core team 2013 3 results 3 1 model performance performance of all the 7 predictive models were showed in fig 2 a b c and d significant differences were found among the 7 predictive models especially when predicting different response variables the mean values of r2 from the 7 predictive models for predicting fish total abundance total biomass shannon wiener indices and pielou evenness indices of each site were 0 60 0 08 0 70 0 03 0 64 0 04 and 0 63 0 06 respectively the fish community structure was well predicted by the selected water quality parameters specifically when predicting total fish abundance glm knn and rf predicted better than other models fig 2a when predicting total fish biomass rf cart and knn performed better than others fig 2b when predicting h index glm pls and rf gave better predictions fig 2c while rf glm and cart gave better predictions in predicting pielou evenness indices fig 2d 3 2 variable importance in predicting species abundance and biomass when predicting fish community structure with water quality parameters different predictive models selected different predictors with variable importance fig 3 and fig 4 for instance in predicting fish species abundance in each sampling site glm showed that tss wt po4 ph no2n tp and nh4n were important cart showed that cond tss th tur sd wt do were important knn showed that tss cond do th tur no3n cl were important svm showed tss cond do th tur no3n cl were important variables ann found that tss th do wt cl cod tur were important predictors pls showed cond th tur tss chla do wt were important variables fig 3 a b when predicting fish species biomass in each sampling site glm showed that tss po4 nh4n ph wd cod and chla were important cart showed that tss cond sd do th tp chla were important knn showed that cond th tss cl do sd tur were important svm showed cond th tss cl do sd tur were important variables ann found that cond th tss wt do tur ph were important predictors pls showed tss th tur cl cond cod chla were important variables fig 4a b 3 3 variable importance in predicting biodiversity indices in predicting shannon wiener indices glm showed that tur wt no3n po4 tn ph wd were important cart showed that tur cond sd th do wt po4 were important knn showed that tur th sd do cond cl tp were important svm showed tur th sd do cond cl tp were important variables ann found that tur th wt cod tss chla cond were important predictors pls showed tur th tss cond chla cl cod were important variables fig 5 a b in predicting pielou evenness indices glm showed that wt tur po4 no3n tn cl ph were important cart showed that sd tur cond do th tss chla were important knn showed that tur th cond sd do cl wt were important svm showed tur th sd do cond cl wt were important variables ann found that cond wt cod th cl do tss were important predictors pls showed tur cond tss th cl chla cod were important variables fig 6 a b 4 discussions it is widely accepted that predictions from different models could vary a lot even if for one given species outcomes of prediction may vary from model to model with much uncertainties convertino et al 2014 guo et al 2015 as different predictive models rely on different mathematical functions machine learning algorithms will give a variety of results without doubt up until now numerous studies have compared accuracy and performance of predictions from different statistical techniques elith and leathwick 2007 and confirmed that results derived from different model techniques or different model building assumptions can occasionally differ grossly thuiller 2003 luoto et al 2005 in the current study model performance differed from each of the predictive model and even if for one specific model the model performance varied with response variables our results also highlighted that predictions from single species distribution model sdm were so variable for all species while ensemble approaches could yield more reliable predictions more attentions should be paid when we select the right predictive model for the data analysis although the high predictive abilities for predicting future scenarios of these models the present study didn t intend to investigate the predictive performance and uncertainties in real predictions and projections rather than to relate fish communities with potential variables future works could be expected to extend our current model by doing some projections in future hypothetical scenarios in fact if these models were used for prediction in future a global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses gsua is a robust method and strongly recommended to be used to globally investigate the uncertainty of sdms and the importance of species distributions drivers in space and time convertino et al 2014 servadio and convertino 2018 following the snwdp all water level regulated lakes will experience similar environmental changes including increased water level surface area and water quality changes these changes in hydrology and water quality are highly likely to further alter biota and ecosystem functions generally when the ratio of water depth to transparency is greater than 2 5 5 9 in shallow lakes of the yangtze river basin the reproduction and growth of submerged macrophytes are affected liang and liu 1995 for instance the transparency values in most regions of the impounded hongze lake are fairly low thus after the snwdp becomes operational an increase in water depth should reduce the abundance and distribution of submerged macrophytes overall the present study showed that physic chemical parameters of water quality such as tss tur sd cond po4 no3 n cod chla were very good predictors in determining fish community structure these findings were consistent with many other previous studies in shallow lakes cheng et al 2012 this indicates that electric conductivity clarity and trophic states of lake water could be good predictors for variations of fish communities our findings were generally in accordance with many other previous studies in european lakes brucet et al 2013 asian lakes cheng et al 2010 south american lakes tejerina garro et al 1998 and north american lakes amarasinghe and welcomme 2002 however the most interesting finding in our study was that these significant water quality variables were all directly linked to the water transfer project as the snwdp would inevitably change the hydrological process the routinely fluctuations of water level the water clarity and conductivity will thus be forecasted to change considerably along the water transfer it is therefore that major knock on effects would be expected on fish communities in the impounded lakes lin et al 2017 in fact the physic chemical factors related with water transparency tss tur sd cond chla which is usually significantly positively correlated with macrophytes van donk and van de bund 2002 was a surrogate to the submerged macrophytes contribution to affect fish communities submerged macrophytes are usually considered as the main factor determining fish assemblages in lakes due to their functions of providing habitat complexity and heterogeneity which support niche segregation brosse et al 2007 cheng et al 2012 as suggested that macrophytes in lakes can benefit water quality the disappearance of macrophytes could deteriorate water conditions e g increase of trophic status decrease of water clarity indeed a reversal of the hydrologic regime in these lakes along with an increase in lake water level could severely impact the vascular plant communities in these lakes it is estimated that the aquatic plant biomass will decrease by 0 2 0 25 million tons in dongping lake from the water transfer zhou et al 1994 wan et al 2003 water depth is also a key factor in structuring fish communities as it acts directly on water transparency lin et al 2017 considering that all the impounding lakes is a shallow lake where water depth is generally less than 3 m the differences in physic chemical parameters caused by water depth are likely to be limited therefore the contribution of water depth could be due to its high positive correlation with macrophytes as shown by liu et al 2006 as we mentioned that the water diversion in the eastern route was mainly conducted using pump stations to increase the water level in those lakes it is therefore that the water clarity the opposite of turbidity and tss and sd would significantly decrease during the water transfer period due to the large scale water exchange zhang 2009 this phenomenon was more apparent in hzl and gyl as these two lakes were serving as transitional lakes all the time and water exchanges in these two lakes were very common wang and dou 1998 moreover navigation in hzl and gyl sand mining in these lakes especially in lml and dpl may also contribute to the water quality degradation such as decreased clarity and increased conductivity and sometimes increased concentrations of nutrients chen et al 2017a the other potential reason for the variation of water quality in the five lakes could attribute to the urbanization and economic development in the basin chen et al 2017b the eastern route of the snwdp is located on one of the most developed regions of china large amounts of untreated industrial wastewater are released into the lakes liu and zheng 2002 although the government has been very active on pollution control in past several decades monitoring results suggest efforts are not very effective for instance water quality parameters such as chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen species concentrations were deteriorated from south to north along the beijing hangzhou grand canal mao et al 2001 wan et al 2003 previous studies also found that nutrients such as total phosphorus and total nitrogen also had significant correlations with fish composition and diversity in shallow lakes of the yangtze river basin cheng et al 2012 therefore changes in nutrient flux and water pollution would have an influence on the structure of fish assemblages as well as population densities cheng et al 2010 in conclusion our study quantified the relationships between fish community structure and physical chemical parameters of water quality in the context of large scale water diversion project using a set of machine learning models although there was still no consistent high performance among all the model outputs we highlighted that water quality changes can be good predictors for fish community variations and the facts that water quality changes associated with water diversion would have

25099,the sloss single large or several small reserves debate is central to species conservation and habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction as a result habitat loss is crucial for exploring the debate this study investigates the effect of nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with individual migration and disturbance the results suggest that 1 if the spatial distribution of lost habitats is dispersed a few large reserves are optimal for the protected species and if it is clustered many small reserves are optimal 2 the effects of the spatial distribution of lost habitats on the debate depends on individual migration and if there are more individuals migrating among reserves the spatial distribution of lost habitats has greater impacts 3 if disturbance rate is low many small reserves are optimal and increasing disturbance rate tends to favor the implementation of few large reserves and the spatial distribution of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance rate is amplified this study facilitates improving the nature reserve planning strategies keywords nature reserve species conservation sloss debate nonrandom habitat loss 1 introduction since the convention on biological diversity cbd was opened for signatures at the 1992 earth summit the conservation of endangered species has been a focus of theoretical and experimental ecology as nature reserves are one of the most important tools for species conservation soule 1991 gong et al 2017 kendal et al 2017 li et al 2018 reserve planning strategies have long been of interest to ecologists biogeographers and conservationists cuonga et al 2017 li et al 2018 for reserve planning strategies one question is very important given the limits on the area of suitable land for establishing nature reserves is it better to implement a few large or many small reserves this question is the subject of the famous sloss debate zhou and wang 2006 the results of previous studies related to this issue varies and the proposed optimal number of reserves ranges from one to many mccarthy et al 2005 2011 dapporto and dennis 2008 baker et al 2013 lindenmayer et al 2015 roux et al 2015 depending on environmental factors and species idiosyncrasies such as habitat fragmentation roux et al 2015 environmental carrying capacity quinn and hastings 1987 individual migration pelletier 2000 disturbance robert 2009 and population growth reed 2004 in particular in fragmented landscapes many small or an intermediate reserves are beneficial lindenmayer et al 2015 kendal et al 2017 however in continuous landscapes few large reserves are better roux et al 2015 liu et al 2017 when environmental carrying capacity is low few large reserves are optimal and increasing environmental carrying capacity tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves quinn and hastings 1987 robert 2009 when no individual migration is allowed between reserves many small reserves are optimal when migration is allowed few large reserve are optimal regardless of how high the migration mortality rate is pelletier 2000 robert 2009 suggest that if the spatial correlation of disturbances is intermediate many small reserves are optimal otherwise few large reserves are better increasing population growth rate tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves reed 2004 from above we know that no consistent conclusion to the sloss debate exists in the literature and the literature still indicates environmental factors and species idiosyncrasies determine this issue however many additional factors that are also important for the issue have not been well studied habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction aunders et al 1991 especially for endangered species johnstone et al 2014 barredo et al 2016 heinrichs et al 2016 deane et al 2017 pardini et al 2018 as the sloss debate is central to species conservation it is important to explore the effects of habitat loss on this issue and there have already been some studies which explore the effects of habitat loss for example pelletier 2000 demonstrates that habitat loss affects the optimal reserve number by affecting migration mortality other studies have examined the influence of factors such as disturbance population growth and environmental carrying capacity assuming that the proportion of lost habitats is kept constant or changes with the total number of reserves reed 2004 robert 2009 in these studies the spatial distribution of lost habitats is assumed to be random though some studies boales et al 2010 yu and cho 2013 have demonstrated that the spatial distribution of lost habitats is always nonrandom furthermore some studies suggest that even though the proportion of lost habitats in an entire region is kept constant the spatial distribution of lost habitats still have great impacts on the viability of species hiebeler 2000 king and with 2002 heinrichs et al 2016 as a result an exploration of nonrandom habitat loss is urgently needed individual migration is a significant factor influencing the sloss debate individual migration is beneficial for species through demographic and genetic rescue richards 2000 and insulates populations from local environmental fluctuations however individual migration may also affect species negatively by introducing diseases or parasites daszak et al 2000 harding and mcnamara 2002 even without considering diseases and parasites debate remains over whether the viability of species is increased debinski and holt 2000 or decreased burkey 1997 by individual migration one hypothesis is that individual migration has two opposite effects individual migration increases the viability of small populations by the rescue effect which is beneficial for species in contrast individual migration mortality increases population mortality rate which is adverse to survival as individual migration has complex impacts on species the effects of individual migration on the debate may be very complex when the spatial distribution of lost habitat is random pelletier 2000 demonstrates that individual migration greatly affects it however that study only considers random habitat loss therefore an exploration of the interaction of nonrandom habitat loss and individual migration is useful disturbance is another significant factor influencing the sloss debate disturbance is caused by fires floods and other types of artificially or naturally induced destruction affecting not only local populations but also environmental carrying capacity following disturbance local populations and environmental carrying capacity may recover thomas 1994 eber and brandl 1996 thomas et al 1996 gyllenberg and hanski 1997 stelter et al 1997 hanski 1999 keymer et al 2000 therefore a comprehensive understanding of how protected species change in the disturbance regime is very useful for solving the debate kweyana et al 2017 li et al 2017 here we examine the influence of the interaction between disturbance disturbance rate and nonrandom habitat loss in order to explore the sloss debate this study provides a theoretical model and systematically investigates how nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with individual migration and disturbance affect by simulating the theoretical model 2 model following the overview design concepts details protocol odd for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 the model is introduced 2 1 purpose this study investigates how nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with species idiosyncrasies affect the sloss debate specifically in a landscape suffered from nonrandom habitat loss the area of suitable habitats in it is kept constant a theoretical model is to systematically explore whether few large or many small reserves should be distributed in these suitable habitats and how the issue responds to the spatial distribution of lost habitats and its interactions with migration rate migration mortality rate and disturbance rate 2 2 entities and state variables from the center of a landscape suffered from nonrandom habitat loss we select a region so that the area of suitable habitats in it is constant however the area of unsuitable habitats is not constant and if habitat loss is more severe the area of unsuitable habitats is larger and thus the selected region is also larger there are two types of entities in the model lost habitats and reserves lost habitats are the unsuitable habitats all suitable habitats are established as nature reserves and thus reserves are the suitable habitats every reserve has its environmental carrying capacity for every reserve there are some individuals living in it and these individuals are regarded as a local population in addition every local population is characterized by its population size 2 3 process overview and scheduling this study uses a discrete time model in discrete space landscapes initially according to the nonrandom habitat loss the spatial distribution of reserves and lost habitats is determined see section 2 5 below for details within every time step fig 1 the environmental carrying capacity of every reserve and the size of every local population grow respectively every reserve may be affected by disturbance and if disturbance occurs in a reserve its environmental carrying capacity and the size of the local population living in the reserve will decrease for every reserve some individuals living in it may migrate to the neighbouring reserves if the number of individuals in all reserves is less than a the minimum number of individuals of a species that it can save from extinction then this study considers the species to be extinct and terminate the whole process see section 2 6 below for details 2 4 design concepts since the area of suitable habitats that are established as nature reserves is kept constant the total area of reserves are given and kept constant in reality not all reserves are identical in their environmental quality area and geometry but we ignore these differences and assume that all reserves are identical in terms of environmental quality area and geometry in addition we assume all initial local populations are identical in population size the species extinction probability is the standard of whether to implement few large or many small reserves specifically the optimal number of reserves should be obtained firstly and the optimal reserve number associates with the minimum species extinction probability as the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in the area we can obtain the area of each reserve by the optimal number of reserves then according to the optimal number of reserves and the area of each reserve we determine whether to implement few large or many small reserves in order to obtain the optimal number of reserves firstly we divide all suitable habitats into l 2 l 2 ranges from few to many reserves and then 20 000 independently replicated simulations i e replicate these 20 000 simulations only by one set of parameters are run for every l 2 the species extinction probability is estimated from these 20 000 independently replicated simulations as the ratio of the number of simulations where the protected species goes extinct to the total number of simulations i e 20 000 20 000 independently replicated simulations can help to expel the effect of stochasticity on the species extinction probability because increasing the number of independently replicated simulations from 20 000 does not have obvious impacts on the species extinction probability finally we pick out the minimum species extinction probability and the corresponding l 2 is the optimal number of reserves that we need the stochasticity of model only reflects on disturbance events because every reserve is affected by disturbance and disturbance probability is μ 2 5 initialization cellular automata is used to simulate models and every cell of the cellular automata corresponds to a reserve or a lost habitat in the cellular automata the number of cells is l 1 2 l 1 4 5 30 the number of reserves is l 2 l 1 2 1 p 0 p 0 is the proportion of lost habitats in the selected region and the number of lost habitats is l 1 2 p 0 therefore the number of reserves l 2 can range from few 16 1 p 0 to many 900 1 p 0 and the number of cells l 1 2 is not too large to guarantee the simulation feasibility because the complexity of simulation is positively correlated with the number of cells l 1 2 the area of the selected region is indicated by s s 1 is used to indicate the area of all reserves and s 2 is used to indicate the area of all lost habitats therefore s 1 s 1 p 0 and s 2 s p 0 as mentioned in section 2 4 at the initial time all reserves are identical in environmental quality area and geometry so the area of each reserve is s 1 l 2 the area of each lost habitat is s 2 l 1 2 p 0 s 2 p 0 l 1 2 s l 1 2 s 1 p 0 l 1 2 1 p 0 s 1 l 2 which means the area of each lost habitat is the same as reserve and the initial environmental carrying capacity of each reserve is k tot l 2 where k tot is the initial environmental carrying capacity of all reserves we set that each initial local population is at half of the initial environmental carrying capacity of reserve i e k tot 2 l 2 the nonrandom habitat loss reflects on the nonrandom spatial distribution of lost habitats the spatial distribution of lost habitats is determined by p 0 and q 0 0 when p 0 is kept constant if q 0 0 is higher the spatial distribution of lost habitats is more clustered and the spatial distribution of reserves is therefore also more clustered fig 2 reserves take up the rest of space the method which is proposed by hiebeler 2000 is used to generate p 0 and q 0 0 according to the number of reserves there are two modes in which nature reserves can be distributed mode 1 few large reserves fig 2a c and e mode 2 many small reserves fig 2b d and f 2 6 submodels 2 6 1 environmental carrying capacity the initial environmental carrying capacity of a single reserve is k k tot is the initial environmental carrying capacity of all reserves and l 2 is the number of reserves as mentioned previously k k tot l 2 after a disturbance event occurs in a reserve the environmental carrying capacity decreases immediately eq 3 subsequently it can gradually recover and at time t for reserve i the environmental carrying capacity is calculated as follows johst and drechsler 2003 1 k i t r k 1 k i t 1 1 r k k i t 1 k where r k 0 is the recovery rate after disturbance eq 1 shows the actual growth rate is r k 1 1 r k k i t 1 k 1 if k i t 1 is closer to k r k 1 1 r k k i t 1 k 1 is smaller and the actual growth rate is lower if k i t 1 k the actual growth rate is 0 and in this study k i t k from beginning to end 2 6 2 local population growth at time t the local population in reserve i is indicated by n i t johst and drechsler 2003 2 n i t g n 1 n i t 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 where g n 0 is the reproductive rate without considering competition eq 2 shows the actual growth rate is g n 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 1 if n i t 1 is closer to k i t 1 g n 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 1 is smaller and the actual growth rate is lower if n i t 1 k i t 1 the actual growth rate is 0 and if n i t 1 k i t 1 the actual growth rate is negative and n i t decreases and in this study n i t k i t from beginning to end 2 6 3 disturbance disturbance affects local populations and environmental carrying capacity and every reserve is affected by disturbance with probability μ at time t if a disturbance event occurs in reserve i the dynamics of environmental carrying capacity and local population are calculated as follows 3 1 d disturbance k i t 4 1 d disturbance n i t where d disturbance 0 d disturbance 1 is used to characterize the influence of disturbance on environmental carrying capacity and local population 2 6 4 migration in nature some individuals can migrate over great distances or pass through lost habitats however we ignore these issues and assume that some individuals in a reserve only migrate to the neighboring reserves i e those reserves with a common boundary or vertex fig 3 at time t x ij t the number of individuals migrating from reserve i to j is calculated as follows 5 x ij t m n i t z 8 d ij j 1 s e t d i j 1 1 d migration o i t 6 o i t 1 i f n i t 0 2 k i t 0 o t h e r w i s e where m is migration rate d migration is migration mortality rate and d ij is the reciprocal of the distance between the center of reserve i and the center of reserve j reserve i has neighboring z reserves fig 3 green cells and lost habitats fig 3 blue cells we give an ensemble s e t that contains these neighboring z reserves in fig 3 z 5 at time t eq 5 shows that the number of individuals which leave reserve i to migrate is m n i t z 8 and if z is larger i e reserve i has more neighboring reserves or m migration rate is larger more individuals leave eq 5 also shows if d ij is larger i e the distance between the center of reserve i and the center of reserve j is shorter d ij j 1 s e t d i j 1 is larger and for the individuals which leave reserve i a higher proportion of them migrate to reserve j eq 6 shows if n i t 0 2 k i t then o i t 0 and x ij t 0 thus if the number of individuals in reserve i is much lower than the environmental carrying capacity no individuals leave reserve i to migrate 2 6 5 species extinction in nature if the number of individuals is too small it is considered to be already ecologically extinct as a result the species is considered to be extinct if the number of individuals is less than a major parameters in model are listed in table 1 2 7 simulation experiments c language is used to implement the model moore neighborhoods kier et al 2005 and periodic boundary conditions kier et al 2005 are used in the simulations the simulation process proceeded along the following steps 1 the initial landscape and individuals are generated according to section 2 5 and l 1 4 2 we then let all individuals dynamically change in the landscape according to sections 2 3 and 2 6 to account for stochasticity 20 000 independently replicated simulations are run 3 let l 1 5 6 30 and repeat step 1 and 2 finally according to section 2 4 we can determine whether to implement few large or many small reserves 3 results in section 3 1 we explore the influence of nonrandom habitat loss on the sloss debate in section 3 2 we explore the influence of the interactions between nonrandom habitat loss and individual migration and in section 3 3 we explore the effects of the interactions between disturbance and nonrandom habitat loss 3 1 if the spatial distribution of lost habitats is dispersed few large reserves are optimal otherwise many small reserves are optimal as shown in fig 4 if q 0 0 0 4 the optimal reserve number is quite few as q 0 0 increases the optimal number of reserves also increases and when q 0 0 0 7 the optimal reserve number is many since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area if the optimal number of reserves is few the area of each reserve is large and if the optimal number of reserves is many it is small section 2 5 as a result fig 4 shows if the degree of clustering of lost habitats is low few large reserves are optimal and increasing the degree of clustering tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves 3 2 effect of the spatial distribution of lost habitats depends on migration fig 5 shows that when q 0 0 increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the optimal reserve number also increases from few to many however fig 5a shows when m 0 15 the change in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when m 0 1 and fig 5b shows when d migration 0 2 the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when d migration 0 4 when m 0 15 or d migration 0 2 migration rate is high or migration mortality rate is low and thus there are many individuals who can successfully migrate to other reserves as a result if there are many individuals who can successfully migrate to other reserves when the degree of clustering of lost habitats increases the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area section 2 5 if the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger the decrease in the area of each reserve is also much larger as a result the effect of the degree of clustering of lost habitats depends on individual migration and if there are more individuals migrating to other reserves the degree of clustering has greater impacts on the issue 3 3 effect of disturbance on the sloss debate depends the spatial feature of habitat loss as shown in fig 6 if disturbance rate is 0 12 the optimal reserve number is high if it is 0 17 the optimal number of reserves is few moreover when q 0 0 0 7 if disturbance rate changes then the change in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when q 0 0 0 4 therefore the increase in the disturbance rate causes the optimal number of reserves to decrease until it is quite few the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold and if the degree of clustering exceeds the threshold the decrease in the optimal reserve number with an increasing disturbance rate is more noticeable since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area section 2 5 if the optimal number of reserves is high the area of each reserve is small and if the optimal number of reserves decreases the area of each reserve will increase as a result if disturbance rate is low many small reserves are optimal and increasing disturbance rate tends to favor the implementation of few large reserves the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance rate is amplified 4 discussion increasingly serious habitat loss has been leading many species to become endangered schlosser and pfirman 2012 and nature reserve is one useful tool to save the endangered species as a result the sloss debate as a vital part of nature reserve planning strategies has became a focus since many endangered species live in the fragmented landscapes habitat loss and its interacting with individual migration and disturbance can affect the dynamics of endangered species to cope with this situation for the constant suitable land which can be established as nature reserves this study investigates the effects of nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with individual migration and disturbance on the sloss debate the results suggest that even if the proportion of lost habitats remains constant the degree of clustering of lost habitats also greatly affects in particular when the degree of clustering of lost habitats is low few large reserves are optimal for the protected species and increasing the degree of clustering tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves however individual migration can affect the effect of the degree of clustering of lost habitats and if there are more individuals migrating to other reserves the degree of clustering of lost habitats has greater impacts the degree of clustering of lost habitats can also affects the influence of disturbance on the issue in particular the optimal reserve number increases with decreasing disturbance rate and the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance rate is amplified the model has some assumptions which do not represent reality first of all the model ignores the differences in the environmental quality area and geometry among reserves huang et al 2019 and assume that all reserves are identical in terms of environmental quality area and geometry it is a very common assumption in the research robert 2009 mccarthy et al 2011 liu et al 2017 however the assumption may affects the conclusions as a result exploring the differences in the environmental quality area and geometry may further solves of this issue secondly this model only considers the basic components of disturbance i e disturbance rate jeltsch et al 1998 johst and drechsler 2003 turner 2010 karakoç et al 2017 though the method is simple it meets the basic requirements of this study and the method can get some supports from previous studies johst and drechsler 2003 hiebeler 2005 finally only short range migration is considered in the model and the long range migration jacobs and sluckin 2015 mohd et al 2018 is ignored as a result this study only applies to the species with short range migration this study has in many cases extended the domain of previous results on one hand the previous studies pelletier 2000 reed 2004 robert 2009 have only explored the effect of random habitat loss despite the fact that some studies have indicated that the spatial distribution of lost habitats is always nonrandom boales et al 2010 yu and cho 2013 however this study explores by nonrandom habitat loss and the results show that decreasing the degree of clustering of lost habitats tends to favor the implementation of few large reserves on the other hand this study has explored the effect of the interactions between nonrandom habitat loss and individual migration and disturbance and the results show that 1 the degree of clustering of lost habitats only has great impacts when many individual migration are allowed between reserves 2 the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance is amplified the conclusions of this study facilitate solving the sloss debate however more work is required to solve some important problems firstly this study uses a theoretical model and get some theoretical results however these results just give a trend whether to implement few large or many small reserves and cannot give the exact values how many reserves should be built secondly the research needs to explore how the differences in the environmental quality area and geometry among reserves affect thirdly some species exhibit long range migration arias et al 2018 mohd et al 2018 and the range of migration interacting with the spatial distribution of lost habitats greatly affects the dynamics of species in particular if the spatial distribution of lost habitats is more clustered the species with short range migration will benefit otherwise the species with long range migration will benefit hiebeler 2004 liao et al 2013 so long and short range migration and its interactions with nonrandom habitat loss affect the dynamics of species and thus the nature reserve planning strategies as a result in the future research we need to improve the design of initial nature reserves according to the real nature reserves and consider how migration distance and its interaction

25099,the sloss single large or several small reserves debate is central to species conservation and habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction as a result habitat loss is crucial for exploring the debate this study investigates the effect of nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with individual migration and disturbance the results suggest that 1 if the spatial distribution of lost habitats is dispersed a few large reserves are optimal for the protected species and if it is clustered many small reserves are optimal 2 the effects of the spatial distribution of lost habitats on the debate depends on individual migration and if there are more individuals migrating among reserves the spatial distribution of lost habitats has greater impacts 3 if disturbance rate is low many small reserves are optimal and increasing disturbance rate tends to favor the implementation of few large reserves and the spatial distribution of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance rate is amplified this study facilitates improving the nature reserve planning strategies keywords nature reserve species conservation sloss debate nonrandom habitat loss 1 introduction since the convention on biological diversity cbd was opened for signatures at the 1992 earth summit the conservation of endangered species has been a focus of theoretical and experimental ecology as nature reserves are one of the most important tools for species conservation soule 1991 gong et al 2017 kendal et al 2017 li et al 2018 reserve planning strategies have long been of interest to ecologists biogeographers and conservationists cuonga et al 2017 li et al 2018 for reserve planning strategies one question is very important given the limits on the area of suitable land for establishing nature reserves is it better to implement a few large or many small reserves this question is the subject of the famous sloss debate zhou and wang 2006 the results of previous studies related to this issue varies and the proposed optimal number of reserves ranges from one to many mccarthy et al 2005 2011 dapporto and dennis 2008 baker et al 2013 lindenmayer et al 2015 roux et al 2015 depending on environmental factors and species idiosyncrasies such as habitat fragmentation roux et al 2015 environmental carrying capacity quinn and hastings 1987 individual migration pelletier 2000 disturbance robert 2009 and population growth reed 2004 in particular in fragmented landscapes many small or an intermediate reserves are beneficial lindenmayer et al 2015 kendal et al 2017 however in continuous landscapes few large reserves are better roux et al 2015 liu et al 2017 when environmental carrying capacity is low few large reserves are optimal and increasing environmental carrying capacity tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves quinn and hastings 1987 robert 2009 when no individual migration is allowed between reserves many small reserves are optimal when migration is allowed few large reserve are optimal regardless of how high the migration mortality rate is pelletier 2000 robert 2009 suggest that if the spatial correlation of disturbances is intermediate many small reserves are optimal otherwise few large reserves are better increasing population growth rate tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves reed 2004 from above we know that no consistent conclusion to the sloss debate exists in the literature and the literature still indicates environmental factors and species idiosyncrasies determine this issue however many additional factors that are also important for the issue have not been well studied habitat loss is the primary cause of species extinction aunders et al 1991 especially for endangered species johnstone et al 2014 barredo et al 2016 heinrichs et al 2016 deane et al 2017 pardini et al 2018 as the sloss debate is central to species conservation it is important to explore the effects of habitat loss on this issue and there have already been some studies which explore the effects of habitat loss for example pelletier 2000 demonstrates that habitat loss affects the optimal reserve number by affecting migration mortality other studies have examined the influence of factors such as disturbance population growth and environmental carrying capacity assuming that the proportion of lost habitats is kept constant or changes with the total number of reserves reed 2004 robert 2009 in these studies the spatial distribution of lost habitats is assumed to be random though some studies boales et al 2010 yu and cho 2013 have demonstrated that the spatial distribution of lost habitats is always nonrandom furthermore some studies suggest that even though the proportion of lost habitats in an entire region is kept constant the spatial distribution of lost habitats still have great impacts on the viability of species hiebeler 2000 king and with 2002 heinrichs et al 2016 as a result an exploration of nonrandom habitat loss is urgently needed individual migration is a significant factor influencing the sloss debate individual migration is beneficial for species through demographic and genetic rescue richards 2000 and insulates populations from local environmental fluctuations however individual migration may also affect species negatively by introducing diseases or parasites daszak et al 2000 harding and mcnamara 2002 even without considering diseases and parasites debate remains over whether the viability of species is increased debinski and holt 2000 or decreased burkey 1997 by individual migration one hypothesis is that individual migration has two opposite effects individual migration increases the viability of small populations by the rescue effect which is beneficial for species in contrast individual migration mortality increases population mortality rate which is adverse to survival as individual migration has complex impacts on species the effects of individual migration on the debate may be very complex when the spatial distribution of lost habitat is random pelletier 2000 demonstrates that individual migration greatly affects it however that study only considers random habitat loss therefore an exploration of the interaction of nonrandom habitat loss and individual migration is useful disturbance is another significant factor influencing the sloss debate disturbance is caused by fires floods and other types of artificially or naturally induced destruction affecting not only local populations but also environmental carrying capacity following disturbance local populations and environmental carrying capacity may recover thomas 1994 eber and brandl 1996 thomas et al 1996 gyllenberg and hanski 1997 stelter et al 1997 hanski 1999 keymer et al 2000 therefore a comprehensive understanding of how protected species change in the disturbance regime is very useful for solving the debate kweyana et al 2017 li et al 2017 here we examine the influence of the interaction between disturbance disturbance rate and nonrandom habitat loss in order to explore the sloss debate this study provides a theoretical model and systematically investigates how nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with individual migration and disturbance affect by simulating the theoretical model 2 model following the overview design concepts details protocol odd for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 the model is introduced 2 1 purpose this study investigates how nonrandom habitat loss and its interactions with species idiosyncrasies affect the sloss debate specifically in a landscape suffered from nonrandom habitat loss the area of suitable habitats in it is kept constant a theoretical model is to systematically explore whether few large or many small reserves should be distributed in these suitable habitats and how the issue responds to the spatial distribution of lost habitats and its interactions with migration rate migration mortality rate and disturbance rate 2 2 entities and state variables from the center of a landscape suffered from nonrandom habitat loss we select a region so that the area of suitable habitats in it is constant however the area of unsuitable habitats is not constant and if habitat loss is more severe the area of unsuitable habitats is larger and thus the selected region is also larger there are two types of entities in the model lost habitats and reserves lost habitats are the unsuitable habitats all suitable habitats are established as nature reserves and thus reserves are the suitable habitats every reserve has its environmental carrying capacity for every reserve there are some individuals living in it and these individuals are regarded as a local population in addition every local population is characterized by its population size 2 3 process overview and scheduling this study uses a discrete time model in discrete space landscapes initially according to the nonrandom habitat loss the spatial distribution of reserves and lost habitats is determined see section 2 5 below for details within every time step fig 1 the environmental carrying capacity of every reserve and the size of every local population grow respectively every reserve may be affected by disturbance and if disturbance occurs in a reserve its environmental carrying capacity and the size of the local population living in the reserve will decrease for every reserve some individuals living in it may migrate to the neighbouring reserves if the number of individuals in all reserves is less than a the minimum number of individuals of a species that it can save from extinction then this study considers the species to be extinct and terminate the whole process see section 2 6 below for details 2 4 design concepts since the area of suitable habitats that are established as nature reserves is kept constant the total area of reserves are given and kept constant in reality not all reserves are identical in their environmental quality area and geometry but we ignore these differences and assume that all reserves are identical in terms of environmental quality area and geometry in addition we assume all initial local populations are identical in population size the species extinction probability is the standard of whether to implement few large or many small reserves specifically the optimal number of reserves should be obtained firstly and the optimal reserve number associates with the minimum species extinction probability as the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in the area we can obtain the area of each reserve by the optimal number of reserves then according to the optimal number of reserves and the area of each reserve we determine whether to implement few large or many small reserves in order to obtain the optimal number of reserves firstly we divide all suitable habitats into l 2 l 2 ranges from few to many reserves and then 20 000 independently replicated simulations i e replicate these 20 000 simulations only by one set of parameters are run for every l 2 the species extinction probability is estimated from these 20 000 independently replicated simulations as the ratio of the number of simulations where the protected species goes extinct to the total number of simulations i e 20 000 20 000 independently replicated simulations can help to expel the effect of stochasticity on the species extinction probability because increasing the number of independently replicated simulations from 20 000 does not have obvious impacts on the species extinction probability finally we pick out the minimum species extinction probability and the corresponding l 2 is the optimal number of reserves that we need the stochasticity of model only reflects on disturbance events because every reserve is affected by disturbance and disturbance probability is μ 2 5 initialization cellular automata is used to simulate models and every cell of the cellular automata corresponds to a reserve or a lost habitat in the cellular automata the number of cells is l 1 2 l 1 4 5 30 the number of reserves is l 2 l 1 2 1 p 0 p 0 is the proportion of lost habitats in the selected region and the number of lost habitats is l 1 2 p 0 therefore the number of reserves l 2 can range from few 16 1 p 0 to many 900 1 p 0 and the number of cells l 1 2 is not too large to guarantee the simulation feasibility because the complexity of simulation is positively correlated with the number of cells l 1 2 the area of the selected region is indicated by s s 1 is used to indicate the area of all reserves and s 2 is used to indicate the area of all lost habitats therefore s 1 s 1 p 0 and s 2 s p 0 as mentioned in section 2 4 at the initial time all reserves are identical in environmental quality area and geometry so the area of each reserve is s 1 l 2 the area of each lost habitat is s 2 l 1 2 p 0 s 2 p 0 l 1 2 s l 1 2 s 1 p 0 l 1 2 1 p 0 s 1 l 2 which means the area of each lost habitat is the same as reserve and the initial environmental carrying capacity of each reserve is k tot l 2 where k tot is the initial environmental carrying capacity of all reserves we set that each initial local population is at half of the initial environmental carrying capacity of reserve i e k tot 2 l 2 the nonrandom habitat loss reflects on the nonrandom spatial distribution of lost habitats the spatial distribution of lost habitats is determined by p 0 and q 0 0 when p 0 is kept constant if q 0 0 is higher the spatial distribution of lost habitats is more clustered and the spatial distribution of reserves is therefore also more clustered fig 2 reserves take up the rest of space the method which is proposed by hiebeler 2000 is used to generate p 0 and q 0 0 according to the number of reserves there are two modes in which nature reserves can be distributed mode 1 few large reserves fig 2a c and e mode 2 many small reserves fig 2b d and f 2 6 submodels 2 6 1 environmental carrying capacity the initial environmental carrying capacity of a single reserve is k k tot is the initial environmental carrying capacity of all reserves and l 2 is the number of reserves as mentioned previously k k tot l 2 after a disturbance event occurs in a reserve the environmental carrying capacity decreases immediately eq 3 subsequently it can gradually recover and at time t for reserve i the environmental carrying capacity is calculated as follows johst and drechsler 2003 1 k i t r k 1 k i t 1 1 r k k i t 1 k where r k 0 is the recovery rate after disturbance eq 1 shows the actual growth rate is r k 1 1 r k k i t 1 k 1 if k i t 1 is closer to k r k 1 1 r k k i t 1 k 1 is smaller and the actual growth rate is lower if k i t 1 k the actual growth rate is 0 and in this study k i t k from beginning to end 2 6 2 local population growth at time t the local population in reserve i is indicated by n i t johst and drechsler 2003 2 n i t g n 1 n i t 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 where g n 0 is the reproductive rate without considering competition eq 2 shows the actual growth rate is g n 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 1 if n i t 1 is closer to k i t 1 g n 1 1 g n n i t 1 k i t 1 1 is smaller and the actual growth rate is lower if n i t 1 k i t 1 the actual growth rate is 0 and if n i t 1 k i t 1 the actual growth rate is negative and n i t decreases and in this study n i t k i t from beginning to end 2 6 3 disturbance disturbance affects local populations and environmental carrying capacity and every reserve is affected by disturbance with probability μ at time t if a disturbance event occurs in reserve i the dynamics of environmental carrying capacity and local population are calculated as follows 3 1 d disturbance k i t 4 1 d disturbance n i t where d disturbance 0 d disturbance 1 is used to characterize the influence of disturbance on environmental carrying capacity and local population 2 6 4 migration in nature some individuals can migrate over great distances or pass through lost habitats however we ignore these issues and assume that some individuals in a reserve only migrate to the neighboring reserves i e those reserves with a common boundary or vertex fig 3 at time t x ij t the number of individuals migrating from reserve i to j is calculated as follows 5 x ij t m n i t z 8 d ij j 1 s e t d i j 1 1 d migration o i t 6 o i t 1 i f n i t 0 2 k i t 0 o t h e r w i s e where m is migration rate d migration is migration mortality rate and d ij is the reciprocal of the distance between the center of reserve i and the center of reserve j reserve i has neighboring z reserves fig 3 green cells and lost habitats fig 3 blue cells we give an ensemble s e t that contains these neighboring z reserves in fig 3 z 5 at time t eq 5 shows that the number of individuals which leave reserve i to migrate is m n i t z 8 and if z is larger i e reserve i has more neighboring reserves or m migration rate is larger more individuals leave eq 5 also shows if d ij is larger i e the distance between the center of reserve i and the center of reserve j is shorter d ij j 1 s e t d i j 1 is larger and for the individuals which leave reserve i a higher proportion of them migrate to reserve j eq 6 shows if n i t 0 2 k i t then o i t 0 and x ij t 0 thus if the number of individuals in reserve i is much lower than the environmental carrying capacity no individuals leave reserve i to migrate 2 6 5 species extinction in nature if the number of individuals is too small it is considered to be already ecologically extinct as a result the species is considered to be extinct if the number of individuals is less than a major parameters in model are listed in table 1 2 7 simulation experiments c language is used to implement the model moore neighborhoods kier et al 2005 and periodic boundary conditions kier et al 2005 are used in the simulations the simulation process proceeded along the following steps 1 the initial landscape and individuals are generated according to section 2 5 and l 1 4 2 we then let all individuals dynamically change in the landscape according to sections 2 3 and 2 6 to account for stochasticity 20 000 independently replicated simulations are run 3 let l 1 5 6 30 and repeat step 1 and 2 finally according to section 2 4 we can determine whether to implement few large or many small reserves 3 results in section 3 1 we explore the influence of nonrandom habitat loss on the sloss debate in section 3 2 we explore the influence of the interactions between nonrandom habitat loss and individual migration and in section 3 3 we explore the effects of the interactions between disturbance and nonrandom habitat loss 3 1 if the spatial distribution of lost habitats is dispersed few large reserves are optimal otherwise many small reserves are optimal as shown in fig 4 if q 0 0 0 4 the optimal reserve number is quite few as q 0 0 increases the optimal number of reserves also increases and when q 0 0 0 7 the optimal reserve number is many since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area if the optimal number of reserves is few the area of each reserve is large and if the optimal number of reserves is many it is small section 2 5 as a result fig 4 shows if the degree of clustering of lost habitats is low few large reserves are optimal and increasing the degree of clustering tends to favor the implementation of many small reserves 3 2 effect of the spatial distribution of lost habitats depends on migration fig 5 shows that when q 0 0 increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the optimal reserve number also increases from few to many however fig 5a shows when m 0 15 the change in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when m 0 1 and fig 5b shows when d migration 0 2 the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when d migration 0 4 when m 0 15 or d migration 0 2 migration rate is high or migration mortality rate is low and thus there are many individuals who can successfully migrate to other reserves as a result if there are many individuals who can successfully migrate to other reserves when the degree of clustering of lost habitats increases the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area section 2 5 if the increase in the optimal reserve number is much larger the decrease in the area of each reserve is also much larger as a result the effect of the degree of clustering of lost habitats depends on individual migration and if there are more individuals migrating to other reserves the degree of clustering has greater impacts on the issue 3 3 effect of disturbance on the sloss debate depends the spatial feature of habitat loss as shown in fig 6 if disturbance rate is 0 12 the optimal reserve number is high if it is 0 17 the optimal number of reserves is few moreover when q 0 0 0 7 if disturbance rate changes then the change in the optimal reserve number is much larger than when q 0 0 0 4 therefore the increase in the disturbance rate causes the optimal number of reserves to decrease until it is quite few the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold and if the degree of clustering exceeds the threshold the decrease in the optimal reserve number with an increasing disturbance rate is more noticeable since the area of all reserves is kept constant and all reserves are identical in their area section 2 5 if the optimal number of reserves is high the area of each reserve is small and if the optimal number of reserves decreases the area of each reserve will increase as a result if disturbance rate is low many small reserves are optimal and increasing disturbance rate tends to favor the implementation of few large reserves the degree of clustering of lost habitats exhibits a threshold above which the response of the optimal reserve number to disturbance rate is amplified 4 discussion increasingly serious habitat loss has been leading many species to become endangered schlosser and pfirman 2012 and nature reserve is one useful tool to save the endangered species as a result the sloss debate as a vital part of nature reserve planning strategies
