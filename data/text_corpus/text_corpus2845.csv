14225,pome consists of a high concentration of nutrients and organic materials that can pollute the environment if it is not properly treated in conventional treatment of pome the ponding system emitted ghgs to the surrounding indigenous microalgae species have the potential for treating pome and capture co2 this work demonstrates the capability of the indigenous strains scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp cultivated in the integrated treatment system to treat the industrial wastewater which is palm oil mill effluent pome and to capture co2 from the flue gas the objective of this research is to study the integration system of effluent treatment and co2 fixation the microalgae growth study was done by analysing the dry cell weight of the biomass the nutrient reduction such as tn po₄ ³ cod and toc were analysed as the responses while the co2 fixation rate was calculated based on the final microalgae biomass obtained the biomass biochemical components such as lipid carbohydrate and protein were analysed by the solvent extraction method the nutrient reduction from the integrated system of effluent treatment and the co2 fixation by scenedesmus sp ukm9 and chlorella sp ukm2 were 86

specifically protein carbohydrate and lipid were tested to propose the use of microalgae biomass as resources for the industrial applications keywords biological treatment phycoremediation carbon capture scenedesmus sp chlorella sp 1 introduction palm oil is the backbone of malaysia s commodity sector and a vital part of the country economic development as it contributes a major fraction of the country s gross domestic product gdp the palm oil industry is prognosticated to increase production up to 25 million tonnes in the year 2035 1 however there are challenges that this industry is facing now which require a new standard to be established with respect to their environmental management approximately 0 2 tonnes of crude palm oil cpo are being produced from every tonne of fresh fruit bunch ffb and the processing of cpo would generate to an amount of wastewater known as palm oil mill effluent pome and it is considered as a significant source of water pollution to the industry 2 4 about 2 5 3 75 tonnes of pome is discharged from every tonne of cpo produced while 5 7 5 tonnes of water is required to process the cpo and this contributes to 50 of the wastewater generated 5 besides that the palm oil industry is facing a major problem with the pome discharges due to the high palm oil based nutrient content which considered as a source of water pollution this highly concentrated nutrient content effluent however needs to be treated before being discharged according to the department of environment doe malaysia standard around 85 of the total palm oil mills operating in malaysia were implemented with the ponding system as the approach to treat their effluent this conventional pome treatment which is the ponding system requires huge space and long treatment period up to 3 4 months to treat pome the other issue arises is this ponding system is also contributing to the emission of ghgs such as co2 and ch4 due to the degradation of organic matter by bacteria other than the ponding system the flue gas released by the palm oil mill also contributed to a major amount of co2 emission to the atmosphere co2 emissions for example have contributed up to 52 of the total cause of global warming and a direct influence on the global climate change 6 researchers have proven the co2 level will keep rising as the industrialisation happens 2 7 microalgae are potent candidates for bioremediation of wastewater due to their ability to assimilate the contaminants which for them is considered as growth nutrient 8 pome serves as a growth nutrient for microalgae as it contains an abundance amount of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the year in malaysia 9 their cultivation techniques have been investigated by researchers with the target to reduce the pollutants using various microalgae strains 10 11 for instance previous findings have shown the capability of scenedesmus sp to reduce nutrient in pome by assimilating them for growth 12 other than treating wastewater microalgae hold the potential to produce biomass rapidly for useful product commercialisation 2 11 13 in comparison to terrestrial plants microalgae growth is 100 times faster and it can double up the biomass within a short period of time which is usually less than 24 h 14 the simple cell structure with a large surface area per unit volume of the microalgae cell explained the rapid growth and cell division of microalgae this special characteristic of microalgae allows them to consume nutrients at a high rate which can also be beneficial to treat flue gas by capturing the co2 released 15 16 this biological co2 capturing method caught the attention of the researchers to explore further about this approach as it is environmentally friendly and cost effective 17 up until now the research has expanded from laboratory scale to plant scale on microalgae cultivation by using flue gas as the source of inorganic carbon however the composition of the flue gas varies depending on the source of flue gas generated and commonly the presence of h2s nox sox and other particulate matters has caused a significant issue in this microalgae based co2 capturing system these toxic gases caused a highly acidic environment and major stress to microalgae growth there are various studies done on microalgae cultivation by different sources of flue gas such from the fossil fuel plant coal fired thermal power plant and flue gas from the incineration system 18 some findings illustrate the inhibitory effect of the flue gas on the cultivated microalgae 19 with continuous gas supply to the cultivation system thus high tolerant microalgae are preferred and comprehensive strategies need to be implemented to overcome the microalgae gas inhibition the application of microalgae in treating wastewater and co2 fixing is not being widely practiced in malaysia especially in pome treatment microalgae as a mechanism for wastewater treatment in malaysia is considered a new approach and studies done in this area are still insufficient for the implementation of this microalgae based treatment system microalgae cultivation and their maintenance are considered challenging and costly when it comes to the construction of cultivation column and piping system the cost to attain and preserve the microalgae strain as well as the cost of nutrient growth medium supply throughout microalgae cultivation these challenges can be overcomed through studies on the alternative microalgae nutrient source such as pome and indigenous microalgae species as substitutes for the expensive commercialised microalgae strain the good performance of microalgae as treatment agent has been proven by many researchers throughout the globe however they are differences in microalgae growth and performance depending on their species surrounding environment and operation conditions since malaysia climate is hot and humid throughout the year which is different from other countries further research is desired for microalgae species that will be cultivated in malaysia current research is focused on the indigenous microalgae strains uses to treat pome which have not been studied yet as most wastewater treatment studies were done using commercial microalgae microalgae strains such as chlorella sp ukm2 was isolated from palm oil mill treatment pond while scenedesmus sp ukm9 was isolated from rubber wastewater pond indigenous microalgae cultivation approaches can enhance and shorten the period of a treatment since they are acclimated to the same surrounding where they are originated from 20 this research is worth the study as the uses of microalgae have various benefits including the biomass production that can be further commercialised as a source for pharmaceutical human and animal food and for the benefit of bioenergy sectors this research aims to analyse the nutrient reduction and amount of co2 captured by indigenous microalgae from the integrated treatment system nutrient reduction microalgae growth and biomass productivity are the important responses to indicate the effectiveness of this pome treatment system and at the same time to fix co2 emissions these indigenous species of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp were selected based on their performance in treating pome from the previous studies done by 12 21 11 in the previous studies the adaptability and nutrient reduction in pome by these indigenous microalgae species were discussed the studies have been proven that scenedesmus sp ukm9 is able to reduce nutrients in pome at a maximum reduction in comparison to other isolated species of microalgae 12 21 this has made scenedesmus sp as the best candidate to be selected for pome treatment operation chlorella sp ukm2 is chosen to be used in the co2 fixation experiment is because it is the dominant microalgae species in pome the other reason is chlorella sp is potent to high co2 concentration and capable of fixing co2 at the highest rate 22 23 the findings obtained shown promising benefits from the integrated system of effluent treatment and co2 fixation to protect the environment pome itself serves as a nutrient rich media for microalgae growth and in return valuable products are produced from the microalgae biomass pome has great potential as growth nutrient reconcilable to the synthetic nutrient medium and flue gas as the source of carbon to support microalgae growth this approach is considered as cost effective and eco friendly in a long term operation 2 the strategy of using microalgae as a biological treatment agent is safe for the environment in comparison to other chemical treatment operations however the issue of algal bloom may occur as the result of excess nutrients particularly phosphorus and nitrogen in the system massive algal bloom will cause the microalgae to become inefficient in taking up nutrients and directly affects the pollutant reduction performance in the treatment system this issue can be prevented by having a microalgae based treatment system with optimum parameters considering the cultivation period nutrient feed concentration mixing rate and harvesting frequency based on the preliminary studies done the optimum cultivation period for scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in pome is 20 days as these species of microalgae will typically reach the stationary phase after 20 days 24 beyond this period of cultivation microalgae growth and nutrient assimilation will decelerate and this is the point where harvesting is required to remove the microalgae biomass ghgs such as ch4 and co2 released from the conventional pome treatment operation can be overcomed and hence will mitigate the causes of global warming microalgae as the alternative to treat pome and fix co2 has the potential to be operated at a low cost within a short period of treatment this shows an added advantage for the integrated treatment system of pome and flue gas for the palm oil industry in achieving its aim for sustainable operation in addition final biomass harvested from this treatment operation has shown a profitable future for the production of nutritious animals feed products hence further studies need to be conducted to improve microalgae adaptability in pome and microalgae tolerance to high co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 indigenous microalgae cultivation two microalgae strains used in this study were scenedesmus sp ukm9 and chlorella sp ukm2 both strains were locally isolated from the wastewater where scenedesmus sp was isolated from rubber wastewater while chlorella sp was isolated from pome itself locally isolated strains were used so that biosafety issues can be avoided and at the same time they have high adaptability to the local environment 25 research done by khalid et al 26 has proven that the locally isolated microalgae strain has higher adaptability compared to the commercial microalgae strain chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were maintained in bold s basal medium bbm at the temperature of 25 2 c and constantly illuminated 25 with white fluorescent light with an intensity approximately 14 000 lx 2 2 pome pre treatment and preparation anaerobic pome was used as a nutrient medium for this treatment operation it was collected from the palm oil mill and stored at 4 c 8 the pome sample was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min before the experiment this is to ensure that the suspended solid is removed from the pome sample before using it for microalgae cultivation pome has poor light penetration due to the high turbidity of 460 ntu and dark color medium the characteristics of anaerobic pome are stated in table 1 2 3 experimental procedure this experiment was carried out in triplicate as an integrated treatment system of pome treatment stage 1 and co2 fixation stage 2 as shown in fig 1 in the first stage of pome treatment scenedesmus sp was used to treat pome which represents the nutrient growth medium and agitation speed at 99 rpm was provided for aeration purpose 30 v v of inoculum seed was introduced to the diluted pome with the dilution rate of 84 v v in the second stage of treatment co2 fixation chlorella sp was used to further treat the treated pome from the first stage and capture the inorganic carbon in the form of co2 gas chlorella sp has been proven as a species that posseses the ability to tolerate a high concentration of co2 and converting it into biomass 22 after 25 days of pome treatment experiment stage 1 the effluent was centrifuged to harvest and separate the scenedesmus sp biomass from the effluent 25 the centrifuged effluent was directly used for the second stage with 25 v v of inoculum seed cultivated 10 v v of co2 gas mixed with compressed air was sparged continuously into the co2 fixation system at the flow rate of 1666 ml min for 15 days the cultivation conditions were selected based on the optimum parameter values obtained from the optimisation experiment that was done previously as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the continuous light supply and surrounding temperature were at a fixed value of 14 000 lx at 25 2 c in this research the light source was maintained at constant in order to imitate the real scenario condition wherein the outdoor microalgae cultivation the sunlight is uncontrollable and sometimes may fluctuate depending on the surrounding atmosphere the period of cultivation was decided according to the species growth pattern in the preliminary experiment 24 the cultivation period should not be too short as the microalgae will not have enough time to completely adapt and assimilate nutrients at a maximal rate 27 however too long cultivation period will also give negative effects to the growth since the growth has reached the stationary stage and the biomass accumulation can cause light limitation for microalgae the cultivation period is important for harvesting and previous research suggested that optimum harvesting frequency is required to overcome species competition due to limited nutrients left in the system and algae bloom problem 28 2 4 nutrient analysis the nutrient reduction analysis was done at a certain period of treatment which incudes the sampling of pome before and after microalgae being introduced to each stage of pome treatment and co2 fixation experiments the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the dichromate reactor digestion method 29 the concentration of total organic carbon toc was determined by hach tnt organic carbon direct method mid range hach the concentration of total nitrogen tn was determined by the hach tlnt persulfate digestion method 29 the concentration of phosphate po4 3 was determined by the hach molybdovanadate method with persulfate digestion 29 the removal percentage of cod toc tn and phosphate were measured based on the nutrient concentration from the start to the end of the microalgae cultivation period 15 ml of the sample was collected and the nutrient concentration was analysed using hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer the reduction of nutrients was calculated by using the formula eq 1 1 removal c 1 c 2 c 1 100 c1 and c2 are the concentration at the beginning of cultivation and at the end of cultivation respectively 2 5 co2 gas analysis pressure regulators were used in controlling both co2 and compressed air pressure to 1 bar before they are mixed in a gas chamber the mixed gas was channeled to the flow meters where each flow meter has its own flow rate controller 10 v v of co2 gas was measured by the co2 analyzer and 1666 ml min flow rate was set by using flow meter high resistance rubber tubing was used for the gas sparging from the gas source to the flow meter and the culture flasks through stainless steel top flange inlet the flange consists of two tubings specifically for gas sparging inlet and outlet for gas sampling purposes the light source was white fluorescent light with the intensity of 14 000 lx in the co2 fixation experiment the percentage of co2 gas captured by the system was compared with the control set up wherein control flask there were no microalgae introduced in the system the percentage of the co2 fixed by microalgae was calculated based on the balanced photosynthesis chemical reaction theoretical formula eq 2 2 4c o 2 nutrient h 2 o light 4c o 0 48 h 1 83 n 0 11 p 0 01 3 1 2 o 2 4

international journal conference 30 32 the amount of co2 captured can also be estimated by using the ratio of biomass yield as 1 kg of microalgae dry cell weight that is equivalent to 1 83 kg of co2 captured 17 the co2 assimilated by microalgae from the photosynthesis process will be converted into sugar and the oxygen will be generated during the process conversion light and water are the energy and electron source during photosynthesis as shown in the equation eq 3 3 c o 2 h 2 o light c h 2 o n o 2 2 6 microalgae growth rate and biomass productivity microalgae growth was evaluated through the period of cultivation which was 25 days for pome treatment and 15 days for the co2 fixation stage the cultivation period was based on the growth pattern of microalgae and the experiment was discontinued once the growth curve reached the stationary phase 15 ml of the sample was collected and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the biomass pellet was washed twice with distilled water to ensure the removal of suspended solid originated from pome the dry cell weight dcw method was used to indicate the weight of biomass obtained from the harvesting 33 0 45 μm micro fiberglass filter paper gf c was used to filter the biomass and the filtered biomass was dried in 105 c drying oven for 24 h the dcw was then determined by eq 4 4 dcw g l 1 weight of filtered microalgae biomass weight of blank filter paper volume of sample collected the growth kinetics of microalgae was determined by the logistic equation the entire growth profile can be explained from the lag exponential to the stationary phase without taking substrate consumption into consideration 34 based on dry cell weight analysis results the growth curve was plotted from the logistic model using matlab curve fitting tool the biomass productivity ρ and specific growth rate μ can be obtained from this logistic model 35 eq 5 5 x x 0 x max e μ max t x max x 0 x 0 e μ max t x microalgae concentration in the medium 2 7 biomass biochemical composition analysis at the end of each treatment stage a pome sample was collected for further biomass biochemical composition analysis the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and microalgae biomass was collected for protein lipid and carbohydrate analysis protein from microalgae biomass was extracted using the bradford method 36 lipid analysis was conducted as described by folch 37 while the carbohydrate composition was determined using the dubois method 38 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient reduction analysis the amount of nutrient reduced from the medium generally depends on the assimilation of microalgae which will then be converted into biomass 24 there are several characteristics of nutrient measured such as cod toc tn and phosphate to indicate the amount of nutrient reduced from the treatment process 3 2 chemical oxygen demand cod the chemical oxidation rate of compounds present in wastewater is determined in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod significant oxidation of nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus reduces the cod value of treated wastewater a cod removal can also be achieved from microalgae photosynthetic activities which require abundant carbon for microalgae growth requirement the cod reduction indicates that the concentration of the substrate was decreased due to the consumption by microalgae 25 however a slight increment of cod might happen even though microalgae growth is progressing the excretion of photosynthesis by product of microalgae such as algogenic organic matter aom might be the cause behind the cod increment nutrient medium recycling and broth aging are the main reasons that have caused the accumulation of the aom in the cultivation system 39 in the current research broth aging and accumulated aom were avoided through harvesting and microalgae was cultivated with an optimum cultivation period thus the insignificant amount of organic matter degraded by microalgae during the cultivation can be neglected the initial cod of the 84 v v diluted pome is about 2727 mg l and it was reduced to 1710 mg l once the 30 v v of scenedesmus sp seed was introduced to the system after 25 days of pome treatment about 40 of cod was reduced and the final cod value was 1030 mg l at the end of the pome treatment stage at the beginning of the co2 fixation stage the cod value was about 1027 mg l when 25 v v of chlorella sp was added after 15 days the cod has reduced to 900 mg l as shown in fig 4 about 48 of the total cod reduction was observed and it was considered high in comparison to the other pome treatments done by other researchers which were around 20 30 indigenous characium sp ukm 1 was used to treat pome at 50 dilution using final effluent that reduced 21 5 of cod 26 the other finding shows that chlamydomonas sp ukm 6 was cultivated in pome with different volume ratios of 25 16 7 and 12 5 of pome and distilled water reduced about 8 59 29 13 of cod 21 table 2 shows the independent and total cod reduction of the integrated pome treatment and co2 fixation the integrated treatment system exhibited a higher cod reduction when more than one microalgae species were used with a series of treatments 3 3 total organic carbon toc the initial total organic carbon toc of 84 v v diluted pome is about 1270 mg l fig 5 demonstrates the reduction of toc from 1250 mg l to 320 mg l with a toc reduction of 74 in the pome treatment stage however the toc level started to increase once co2 is introduced to the system as shown in table 3 in the co2 fixation stage 14 of toc has increased as shown in fig 6 the reason for the elevated toc value is due to the inorganic carbon from the co2 gas that has been converted into carbonic acid in the medium the changes in toc value was compared with the control set up the finding shows that toc value from 320 mg l has increased to 450 mg l and a higher increment of toc value was observed in the control column the presence of microalgae has demonstrated the co2 fixation capability of microalgae in the cultivation system the toc increment in the co2 fixation system can also be explained by the changes in the ph value of the medium as summarised in fig 7 the co2 that has been converted into carbonic acid has caused the acidic medium environment however in the control column the ph dropped drastically to ph 6 which is below neutral condition and unfavorable for microalgae growth the microalgae assimilation of co2 somehow will raise back the ph value of the medium due to the reduction of carbonic acid in the system 40 the uptake of nitrate by microalgae is the reason for the alkalinity to increase which is due to the oh production in the medium 41 microalgae assimilation of carbon from the co2 supplemented system helped to maintain the ph and directly balanced the microalgae growth environment other than microalgae carbon uptake the ph of the medium can be controlled by the amount of organic matter load in the system even so excessive organic matter in the system will restrain nutrient assimilation by the microalgae 42 in some cases when the ph exceeds 9 most of the inorganic carbon is in the form of carbonate ion which cannot be assimilated by microalgae the solubility of carbon dioxide is somehow related to the ph of the medium where the inorganic carbon from the co2 channeled to the system is either converted into bicarbonate or carbonate 43 44 at high ph environment nutrient stripping will occur due to ammonia volatilisation and phosphorus precipitation that will also lead to ineffective microalgae nutrient uptake and growth 45 nevertheless the nutrient stripping should be neglected as the main nutrient reduction is caused by microalgae assimilation 26 3 4 total nitrogen tn fig 8 and table 4 show that the initial tn concentration of 84 diluted pome is about 316 mg l which was reduced to 233 mg l once scenedesmus sp cultivated into the first stage of pome treatment about 37 of tn reduction obtained after 25 days of pome treatment tn was further reduced to 33 mg l at the end of the second stage treatment which is the co2 fixation the overall reduction was about 86 and the finding is comparatively similar to the finding of selvam et al 11 where 88 6 of tn reduction obtained by culturing the indigenous strain of characium sp in pome for 20 days of treatment 3 5 reactive phosphate po4 3 reactive phosphate poˉ³4 also known as orthophosphate is the form of inorganic phosphorus that is most preferred by microalgae for assimilation when this form of inorganic phosphate becomes limited the organic phosphate will be converted to orthophosphate 46 in this integrated treatment system the total reduction of reactive phosphate was about 85 where 52 was from the first stage of pome treatment by and it was further reduced in the second stage of treatment as stated in table 5 as illustrated in fig 9 the initial concentration of phosphate was 257 7 mg l has dropped to 25 mg l at the end of the integrated treatment operation 3 6 co2 fixation by microalgae the inorganic form of carbon from the co2 gas supply was converted into either bicarbonate or carbonate ion when it dissolved in medium depending on the ph of the medium 43 44 the chart in fig 10 shows about 35 of the inlet co2 was captured by the system while approximately 24 of that amount was assimilated by chlorella sp cultivated in the system the remaining co2 captured remained in the system in the form of carbonic acid which causes the ph to drop as microalgae co2 fixation rate and biomass productivity are interconnected the ratio formula of 1 co2g l 1day 1 to 1 882 biomass g l 1day 1 was adopted to calculate the amount of co2 fixed by microalgae 30 3217 in this integrated treatment system 10 of co2 was continuously supplied in the co2 fixation stage and the maximum growth rate obtained was 0 5858 day 1 table 6 presents about 0 8287 g of co2 l 1 day 1 was obtained from the productivity of 0 4403 g biomass l 1 day 1 with 12 43 g l total recovery of co2 after 15 days of co2 fixation by chlorella sp the current finding of co2 fixation by microalgae was compared with other studies and it was discovered that higher growth and bio fixation rate can be obtained when the co2 concentration is at low value as reported by pourjamshidian et al 47 1 11 day 1 of specific growth rate and 2 79 g co2 l 1 day 1 obtained from chlorella sp culture with 1 75 v v co2 however the lower co2 concentration of 0 5 v v resulted in the lower specific growth rate of 1 032 day 1 and co2 fixation rate 0 3731 g co2 l 1 day 1 48 as a conclusion co2 concentration lower than 10 v v is desired to improve the co2 bio fixation by microalgae specifically for chlorella sp 3 7 microalgae growth and biomass biochemical composition nutrient reduction efficiency is related to microalgae biomass productivity the maximum growth rate μ and biomass productivity were calculated from the plotted growth curve of each species in both stages of treatment in table 7 scenedesmus sp showed a lower maximum growth rate μ and biomass productivity in comparison to chlorella sp the contrast between these two species might be because of the co2 supplemented to chlorella sp cultivation system the co2 addition to the system has enhanced microalgae growth and caused rapid nutrient assimilation besides high nutrient concentration and light limitation due to high turbidity of pome at the beginning of the treatment stage prolonged the adaptation of scenedesmus sp to pome as a nutrient medium scenedesmus sp seed was first transferred from the synthetic nutrient medium bbm to pome has caused a sudden impact to its environment and this slows down the growth and adaptability to the new environment pome acclimatization strategy can be implemented to overcome this adaptability issue research has proven that the adapted microalgae can reduce the lag phase and speed up nutrient assimilation by microalgae in pome 26 the final biomass of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp produced from both stages of treatment were collected and analysed to specify the biochemical composition as demonstrated in figs 11 and 12 the biochemical composition of microalgae varies depending on the microalgae species 33 the major composition of both species is protein which was in the range of 48 58 followed by lipid and carbohydrates the high protein content in the biomass displays a satisfactory requirement for aquaculture and animal feed production the amount of lipid for both species is slightly the same and it is considered low for biodiesel production one of the reasons for low lipid content in biomass explained by yoo et al 49 is due to the high co2 supplemented to the cultivation system studies done by kamyab et al 25 proved that the production of lipid can be enhanced under the nutrient starvation condition the same studies affirmed that microalgae do not store lipid as the storage product while the lipid will be used throughout the cultivation period to synthesis protein for energy storage 25 carbohydrate composition in scenedesmus sp was 20 lower in comparison to carbohydrate presents in chlorella sp and this is associated with the environmental stress factors involving light temperature and nutrient supply the light available for scenedesmus sp is lower compared to the light available for chlorella sp as in the first stage of treatment the high turbidity of pome has caused light limitation to scenedesmus sp growth in the second stage of treatment the optical density of pome has reduced and it can be concluded that chlorella sp received higher light exposure throughout the cultivation period this finding is supported by ho et al 19 by stating that the content of carbohydrates in scenedesmus obliquus increased when they are exposed to higher light intensity the finding also proved that nitrogen limitation enhanced the biosynthesis of carbohydrates to microalgae current research shows that lower nitrogen available for chlorella sp assimilation has caused more carbohydrate produced 4 conclusion the overall objective of this research was to examine the capability of microalgae cultivated in pome to assimilate nutrients and capture co2 in the integrated treatment operation both microalgae species are able to show the positive results where up to 40 of cod 86 of tn and 85 phosphate reduced through the treatment chlorella sp has demonstrated the ability to capture co2 and directly reduce the toc value chlorella sp manifested about 0 829 g of co2 g of co2 l 1 day 1 captured with a total recovery of co2 12 435 g l after 15 days of co2 fixation operation the findings signified that the integrated treatment operation has a higher nutrient reduction in pome and more co2 fixed in comparison to the independent treatment operation two microalgae species with different metabolic traits were used in this integrated system to enhance treatment performance scenedesmus sp is heterotrophic that preferred organic nutrients while chlorella sp is autotrophic that preferred inorganic form of nutrient for growth furthermore by having this integrated treatment operation the available nutrients in pome from the first stage is further utilised in the second stage and directly reduce more pollutant in pome scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp biomass biochemical composition specifically protein carbohydrate and lipid were evaluated to suggest the future use of the biomass as resources for industrial application results also suggested that the growth of microalgae especially scenedesmus sp can be enhanced by improving the light penetration through pome pre treatment or dilution and acclimatization of microalgae seed in pome can also be done to counteract microalgae adaptability issues acclimatization of microalgae strain in pome can enhance the adaptability and shorten the lag phase of microalgae growth this could help to improve the tolerance of microalgae to a highly concentrated nutrient medium such as pome from the findings obtained microalgae biomass has the potential to be used for aquaculture feed and biofertilizer it is suggested to further analyse the essential nutrients contained in the biomass and the npk ratios to meet the production target acknowledgments the author gratefully acknowledges

the country s gross domestic product gdp the palm oil industry is prognosticated to increase production up to 25 million tonnes in the year 2035 1 however there are challenges that this industry is facing now which require a new standard to be established with respect to their environmental management approximately 0 2 tonnes of crude palm oil cpo are being produced from every tonne of fresh fruit bunch ffb and the processing of cpo would generate to an amount of wastewater known as palm oil mill effluent pome and it is considered as a significant source of water pollution to the industry 2 4 about 2 5 3 75 tonnes of pome is discharged from every tonne of cpo produced while 5 7 5 tonnes of water is required to process the cpo and this contributes to 50 of the wastewater generated 5 besides that the palm oil industry is facing a major problem with the pome discharges due to the high palm oil based nutrient content which considered as a source of water pollution this highly concentrated nutrient content effluent however needs to be treated before being discharged according to the department of environment doe malaysia standard around 85 of the total palm oil mills operating in malaysia were implemented with the ponding system as the approach to treat their effluent this conventional pome treatment which is the ponding system requires huge space and long treatment period up to 3 4 months to treat pome the other issue arises is this ponding system is also contributing to the emission of ghgs such as co2 and ch4 due to the degradation of organic matter by bacteria other than the ponding system the flue gas released by the palm oil mill also contributed to a major amount of co2 emission to the atmosphere co2 emissions for example have contributed up to 52 of the total cause of global warming and a direct influence on the global climate change 6 researchers have proven the co2 level will keep rising as the industrialisation happens 2 7 microalgae are potent candidates for bioremediation of wastewater due to their ability to assimilate the contaminants which for them is considered as growth nutrient 8 pome serves as a growth nutrient for microalgae as it contains an abundance amount of nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the year in malaysia 9 their cultivation techniques have been investigated by researchers with the target to reduce the pollutants using various microalgae strains 10 11 for instance previous findings have shown the capability of scenedesmus sp to reduce nutrient in pome by assimilating them for growth 12 other than treating wastewater microalgae hold the potential to produce biomass rapidly for useful product commercialisation 2 11 13 in comparison to terrestrial plants microalgae growth is 100 times faster and it can double up the biomass within a short period of time which is usually less than 24 h 14 the simple cell structure with a large surface area per unit volume of the microalgae cell explained the rapid growth and cell division of microalgae this special characteristic of microalgae allows them to consume nutrients at a high rate which can also be beneficial to treat flue gas by capturing the co2 released 15 16 this biological co2 capturing method caught the attention of the researchers to explore further about this approach as it is environmentally friendly and cost effective 17 up until now the research has expanded from laboratory scale to plant scale on microalgae cultivation by using flue gas as the source of inorganic carbon however the composition of the flue gas varies depending on the source of flue gas generated and commonly the presence of h2s nox sox and other particulate matters has caused a significant issue in this microalgae based co2 capturing system these toxic gases caused a highly acidic environment and major stress to microalgae growth there are various studies done on microalgae cultivation by different sources of flue gas such from the fossil fuel plant coal fired thermal power plant and flue gas from the incineration system 18 some findings illustrate the inhibitory effect of the flue gas on the cultivated microalgae 19 with continuous gas supply to the cultivation system thus high tolerant microalgae are preferred and comprehensive strategies need to be implemented to overcome the microalgae gas inhibition the application of microalgae in treating wastewater and co2 fixing is not being widely practiced in malaysia especially in pome treatment microalgae as a mechanism for wastewater treatment in malaysia is considered a new approach and studies done in this area are still insufficient for the implementation of this microalgae based treatment system microalgae cultivation and their maintenance are considered challenging and costly when it comes to the construction of cultivation column and piping system the cost to attain and preserve the microalgae strain as well as the cost of nutrient growth medium supply throughout microalgae cultivation these challenges can be overcomed through studies on the alternative microalgae nutrient source such as pome and indigenous microalgae species as substitutes for the expensive commercialised microalgae strain the good performance of microalgae as treatment agent has been proven by many researchers throughout the globe however they are differences in microalgae growth and performance depending on their species surrounding environment and operation conditions since malaysia climate is hot and humid throughout the year which is different from other countries further research is desired for microalgae species that will be cultivated in malaysia current research is focused on the indigenous microalgae strains uses to treat pome which have not been studied yet as most wastewater treatment studies were done using commercial microalgae microalgae strains such as chlorella sp ukm2 was isolated from palm oil mill treatment pond while scenedesmus sp ukm9 was isolated from rubber wastewater pond indigenous microalgae cultivation approaches can enhance and shorten the period of a treatment since they are acclimated to the same surrounding where they are originated from 20 this research is worth the study as the uses of microalgae have various benefits including the biomass production that can be further commercialised as a source for pharmaceutical human and animal food and for the benefit of bioenergy sectors this research aims to analyse the nutrient reduction and amount of co2 captured by indigenous microalgae from the integrated treatment system nutrient reduction microalgae growth and biomass productivity are the important responses to indicate the effectiveness of this pome treatment system and at the same time to fix co2 emissions these indigenous species of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp were selected based on their performance in treating pome from the previous studies done by 12 21 11 in the previous studies the adaptability and nutrient reduction in pome by these indigenous microalgae species were discussed the studies have been proven that scenedesmus sp ukm9 is able to reduce nutrients in pome at a maximum reduction in comparison to other isolated species of microalgae 12 21 this has made scenedesmus sp as the best candidate to be selected for pome treatment operation chlorella sp ukm2 is chosen to be used in the co2 fixation experiment is because it is the dominant microalgae species in pome the other reason is chlorella sp is potent to high co2 concentration and capable of fixing co2 at the highest rate 22 23 the findings obtained shown promising benefits from the integrated system of effluent treatment and co2 fixation to protect the environment pome itself serves as a nutrient rich media for microalgae growth and in return valuable products are produced from the microalgae biomass pome has great potential as growth nutrient reconcilable to the synthetic nutrient medium and flue gas as the source of carbon to support microalgae growth this approach is considered as cost effective and eco friendly in a long term operation 2 the strategy of using microalgae as a biological treatment agent is safe for the environment in comparison to other chemical treatment operations however the issue of algal bloom may occur as the result of excess nutrients particularly phosphorus and nitrogen in the system massive algal bloom will cause the microalgae to become inefficient in taking up nutrients and directly affects the pollutant reduction performance in the treatment system this issue can be prevented by having a microalgae based treatment system with optimum parameters considering the cultivation period nutrient feed concentration mixing rate and harvesting frequency based on the preliminary studies done the optimum cultivation period for scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp in pome is 20 days as these species of microalgae will typically reach the stationary phase after 20 days 24 beyond this period of cultivation microalgae growth and nutrient assimilation will decelerate and this is the point where harvesting is required to remove the microalgae biomass ghgs such as ch4 and co2 released from the conventional pome treatment operation can be overcomed and hence will mitigate the causes of global warming microalgae as the alternative to treat pome and fix co2 has the potential to be operated at a low cost within a short period of treatment this shows an added advantage for the integrated treatment system of pome and flue gas for the palm oil industry in achieving its aim for sustainable operation in addition final biomass harvested from this treatment operation has shown a profitable future for the production of nutritious animals feed products hence further studies need to be conducted to improve microalgae adaptability in pome and microalgae tolerance to high co2 concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 indigenous microalgae cultivation two microalgae strains used in this study were scenedesmus sp ukm9 and chlorella sp ukm2 both strains were locally isolated from the wastewater where scenedesmus sp was isolated from rubber wastewater while chlorella sp was isolated from pome itself locally isolated strains were used so that biosafety issues can be avoided and at the same time they have high adaptability to the local environment 25 research done by khalid et al 26 has proven that the locally isolated microalgae strain has higher adaptability compared to the commercial microalgae strain chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were maintained in bold s basal medium bbm at the temperature of 25 2 c and constantly illuminated 25 with white fluorescent light with an intensity approximately 14 000 lx 2 2 pome pre treatment and preparation anaerobic pome was used as a nutrient medium for this treatment operation it was collected from the palm oil mill and stored at 4 c 8 the pome sample was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min before the experiment this is to ensure that the suspended solid is removed from the pome sample before using it for microalgae cultivation pome has poor light penetration due to the high turbidity of 460 ntu and dark color medium the characteristics of anaerobic pome are stated in table 1 2 3 experimental procedure this experiment was carried out in triplicate as an integrated treatment system of pome treatment stage 1 and co2 fixation stage 2 as shown in fig 1 in the first stage of pome treatment scenedesmus sp was used to treat pome which represents the nutrient growth medium and agitation speed at 99 rpm was provided for aeration purpose 30 v v of inoculum seed was introduced to the diluted pome with the dilution rate of 84 v v in the second stage of treatment co2 fixation chlorella sp was used to further treat the treated pome from the first stage and capture the inorganic carbon in the form of co2 gas chlorella sp has been proven as a species that posseses the ability to tolerate a high concentration of co2 and converting it into biomass 22 after 25 days of pome treatment experiment stage 1 the effluent was centrifuged to harvest and separate the scenedesmus sp biomass from the effluent 25 the centrifuged effluent was directly used for the second stage with 25 v v of inoculum seed cultivated 10 v v of co2 gas mixed with compressed air was sparged continuously into the co2 fixation system at the flow rate of 1666 ml min for 15 days the cultivation conditions were selected based on the optimum parameter values obtained from the optimisation experiment that was done previously as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the continuous light supply and surrounding temperature were at a fixed value of 14 000 lx at 25 2 c in this research the light source was maintained at constant in order to imitate the real scenario condition wherein the outdoor microalgae cultivation the sunlight is uncontrollable and sometimes may fluctuate depending on the surrounding atmosphere the period of cultivation was decided according to the species growth pattern in the preliminary experiment 24 the cultivation period should not be too short as the microalgae will not have enough time to completely adapt and assimilate nutrients at a maximal rate 27 however too long cultivation period will also give negative effects to the growth since the growth has reached the stationary stage and the biomass accumulation can cause light limitation for microalgae the cultivation period is important for harvesting and previous research suggested that optimum harvesting frequency is required to overcome species competition due to limited nutrients left in the system and algae bloom problem 28 2 4 nutrient analysis the nutrient reduction analysis was done at a certain period of treatment which incudes the sampling of pome before and after microalgae being introduced to each stage of pome treatment and co2 fixation experiments the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the dichromate reactor digestion method 29 the concentration of total organic carbon toc was determined by hach tnt organic carbon direct method mid range hach the concentration of total nitrogen tn was determined by the hach tlnt persulfate digestion method 29 the concentration of phosphate po4 3 was determined by the hach molybdovanadate method with persulfate digestion 29 the removal percentage of cod toc tn and phosphate were measured based on the nutrient concentration from the start to the end of the microalgae cultivation period 15 ml of the sample was collected and the nutrient concentration was analysed using hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer the reduction of nutrients was calculated by using the formula eq 1 1 removal c 1 c 2 c 1 100 c1 and c2 are the concentration at the beginning of cultivation and at the end of cultivation respectively 2 5 co2 gas analysis pressure regulators were used in controlling both co2 and compressed air pressure to 1 bar before they are mixed in a gas chamber the mixed gas was channeled to the flow meters where each flow meter has its own flow rate controller 10 v v of co2 gas was measured by the co2 analyzer and 1666 ml min flow rate was set by using flow meter high resistance rubber tubing was used for the gas sparging from the gas source to the flow meter and the culture flasks through stainless steel top flange inlet the flange consists of two tubings specifically for gas sparging inlet and outlet for gas sampling purposes the light source was white fluorescent light with the intensity of 14 000 lx in the co2 fixation experiment the percentage of co2 gas captured by the system was compared with the control set up wherein control flask there were no microalgae introduced in the system the percentage of the co2 fixed by microalgae was calculated based on the balanced photosynthesis chemical reaction theoretical formula eq 2 2 4c o 2 nutrient h 2 o light 4c o 0 48 h 1 83 n 0 11 p 0 01 3 1 2 o 2 4 moles of c o 2 4 moles of microalgae biomass 4x44 0095g mole c o 2 4x23 385g mole biomass ratio c o 2 biomass 1 882 fixation rate of c o 2 1 882 x biomass g da y 1 adopted and verified by 3 international journal conference 30 32 the amount of co2 captured can also be estimated by using the ratio of biomass yield as 1 kg of microalgae dry cell weight that is equivalent to 1 83 kg of co2 captured 17 the co2 assimilated by microalgae from the photosynthesis process will be converted into sugar and the oxygen will be generated during the process conversion light and water are the energy and electron source during photosynthesis as shown in the equation eq 3 3 c o 2 h 2 o light c h 2 o n o 2 2 6 microalgae growth rate and biomass productivity microalgae growth was evaluated through the period of cultivation which was 25 days for pome treatment and 15 days for the co2 fixation stage the cultivation period was based on the growth pattern of microalgae and the experiment was discontinued once the growth curve reached the stationary phase 15 ml of the sample was collected and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the biomass pellet was washed twice with distilled water to ensure the removal of suspended solid originated from pome the dry cell weight dcw method was used to indicate the weight of biomass obtained from the harvesting 33 0 45 μm micro fiberglass filter paper gf c was used to filter the biomass and the filtered biomass was dried in 105 c drying oven for 24 h the dcw was then determined by eq 4 4 dcw g l 1 weight of filtered microalgae biomass weight of blank filter paper volume of sample collected the growth kinetics of microalgae was determined by the logistic equation the entire growth profile can be explained from the lag exponential to the stationary phase without taking substrate consumption into consideration 34 based on dry cell weight analysis results the growth curve was plotted from the logistic model using matlab curve fitting tool the biomass productivity ρ and specific growth rate μ can be obtained from this logistic model 35 eq 5 5 x x 0 x max e μ max t x max x 0 x 0 e μ max t x microalgae concentration in the medium 2 7 biomass biochemical composition analysis at the end of each treatment stage a pome sample was collected for further biomass biochemical composition analysis the sample was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and microalgae biomass was collected for protein lipid and carbohydrate analysis protein from microalgae biomass was extracted using the bradford method 36 lipid analysis was conducted as described by folch 37 while the carbohydrate composition was determined using the dubois method 38 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient reduction analysis the amount of nutrient reduced from the medium generally depends on the assimilation of microalgae which will then be converted into biomass 24 there are several characteristics of nutrient measured such as cod toc tn and phosphate to indicate the amount of nutrient reduced from the treatment process 3 2 chemical oxygen demand cod the chemical oxidation rate of compounds present in wastewater is determined in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod significant oxidation of nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus reduces the cod value of treated wastewater a cod removal can also be achieved from microalgae photosynthetic activities which require abundant carbon for microalgae growth requirement the cod reduction indicates that the concentration of the substrate was decreased due to the consumption by microalgae 25 however a slight increment of cod might happen even though microalgae growth is progressing the excretion of photosynthesis by product of microalgae such as algogenic organic matter aom might be the cause behind the cod increment nutrient medium recycling and broth aging are the main reasons that have caused the accumulation of the aom in the cultivation system 39 in the current research broth aging and accumulated aom were avoided through harvesting and microalgae was cultivated with an optimum cultivation period thus the insignificant amount of organic matter degraded by microalgae during the cultivation can be neglected the initial cod of the 84 v v diluted pome is about 2727 mg l and it was reduced to 1710 mg l once the 30 v v of scenedesmus sp seed was introduced to the system after 25 days of pome treatment about 40 of cod was reduced and the final cod value was 1030 mg l at the end of the pome treatment stage at the beginning of the co2 fixation stage the cod value was about 1027 mg l when 25 v v of chlorella sp was added after 15 days the cod has reduced to 900 mg l as shown in fig 4 about 48 of the total cod reduction was observed and it was considered high in comparison to the other pome treatments done by other researchers which were around 20 30 indigenous characium sp ukm 1 was used to treat pome at 50 dilution using final effluent that reduced 21 5 of cod 26 the other finding shows that chlamydomonas sp ukm 6 was cultivated in pome with different volume ratios of 25 16 7 and 12 5 of pome and distilled water reduced about 8 59 29 13 of cod 21 table 2 shows the independent and total cod reduction of the integrated pome treatment and co2 fixation the integrated treatment system exhibited a higher cod reduction when more than one microalgae species were used with a series of treatments 3 3 total organic carbon toc the initial total organic carbon toc of 84 v v diluted pome is about 1270 mg l fig 5 demonstrates the reduction of toc from 1250 mg l to 320 mg l with a toc reduction of 74 in the pome treatment stage however the toc level started to increase once co2 is introduced to the system as shown in table 3 in the co2 fixation stage 14 of toc has increased as shown in fig 6 the reason for the elevated toc value is due to the inorganic carbon from the co2 gas that has been converted into carbonic acid in the medium the changes in toc value was compared with the control set up the finding shows that toc value from 320 mg l has increased to 450 mg l and a higher increment of toc value was observed in the control column the presence of microalgae has demonstrated the co2 fixation capability of microalgae in the cultivation system the toc increment in the co2 fixation system can also be explained by the changes in the ph value of the medium as summarised in fig 7 the co2 that has been converted into carbonic acid has caused the acidic medium environment however in the control column the ph dropped drastically to ph 6 which is below neutral condition and unfavorable for microalgae growth the microalgae assimilation of co2 somehow will raise back the ph value of the medium due to the reduction of carbonic acid in the system 40 the uptake of nitrate by microalgae is the reason for the alkalinity to increase which is due to the oh production in the medium 41 microalgae assimilation of carbon from the co2 supplemented system helped to maintain the ph and directly balanced the microalgae growth environment other than microalgae carbon uptake the ph of the medium can be controlled by the amount of organic matter load in the system even so excessive organic matter in the system will restrain nutrient assimilation by the microalgae 42 in some cases when the ph exceeds 9 most of the inorganic carbon is in the form of carbonate ion which cannot be assimilated by microalgae the solubility of carbon dioxide is somehow related to the ph of the medium where the inorganic carbon from the co2 channeled to the system is either converted into bicarbonate or carbonate 43 44 at high ph environment nutrient stripping will occur due to ammonia volatilisation and phosphorus precipitation that will also lead to ineffective microalgae nutrient uptake and growth 45 nevertheless the nutrient stripping should be neglected as the main nutrient reduction is caused by microalgae assimilation 26 3 4 total nitrogen tn fig 8 and table 4 show that the initial tn concentration of 84 diluted pome is about 316 mg l which was reduced to 233 mg l once scenedesmus sp cultivated into the first stage of pome treatment about 37 of tn reduction obtained after 25 days of pome treatment tn was further reduced to 33 mg l at the end of the second stage treatment which is the co2 fixation the overall reduction was about 86 and the finding is comparatively similar to the finding of selvam et al 11 where 88 6 of tn reduction obtained by culturing the indigenous strain of characium sp in pome for 20 days of treatment 3 5 reactive phosphate po4 3 reactive phosphate poˉ³4 also known as orthophosphate is the form of inorganic phosphorus that is most preferred by microalgae for assimilation when this form of inorganic phosphate becomes limited the organic phosphate will be converted to orthophosphate 46 in this integrated treatment system the total reduction of reactive phosphate was about 85 where 52 was from the first stage of pome treatment by and it was further reduced in the second stage of treatment as stated in table 5 as illustrated in fig 9 the initial concentration of phosphate was 257 7 mg l has dropped to 25 mg l at the end of the integrated treatment operation 3 6 co2 fixation by microalgae the inorganic form of carbon from the co2 gas supply was converted into either bicarbonate or carbonate ion when it dissolved in medium depending on the ph of the medium 43 44 the chart in fig 10 shows about 35 of the inlet co2 was captured by the system while approximately 24 of that amount was assimilated by chlorella sp cultivated in the system the remaining co2 captured remained in the system in the form of carbonic acid which causes the ph to drop as microalgae co2 fixation rate and biomass productivity are interconnected the ratio formula of 1 co2g l 1day 1 to 1 882 biomass g l 1day 1 was adopted to calculate the amount of co2 fixed by microalgae 30 3217 in this integrated treatment system 10 of co2 was continuously supplied in the co2 fixation stage and the maximum growth rate obtained was 0 5858 day 1 table 6 presents about 0 8287 g of co2 l 1 day 1 was obtained from the productivity of 0 4403 g biomass l 1 day 1 with 12 43 g l total recovery of co2 after 15 days of co2 fixation by chlorella sp the current finding of co2 fixation by microalgae was compared with other studies and it was discovered that higher growth and bio fixation rate can be obtained when the co2 concentration is at low value as reported by pourjamshidian et al 47 1 11 day 1 of specific growth rate and 2 79 g co2 l 1 day 1 obtained from chlorella sp culture with 1 75 v v co2 however the lower co2 concentration of 0 5 v v resulted in the lower specific growth rate of 1 032 day 1 and co2 fixation rate 0 3731 g co2 l 1 day 1 48 as a conclusion co2 concentration lower than 10 v v is desired to improve the co2 bio fixation by microalgae specifically for chlorella sp 3 7 microalgae growth and biomass biochemical composition nutrient reduction efficiency is related to microalgae biomass productivity the maximum growth rate μ and biomass productivity were calculated from the plotted growth curve of each species in both stages of treatment in table 7 scenedesmus sp showed a lower maximum growth rate μ and biomass productivity in comparison to chlorella sp the contrast between these two species might be because of the co2 supplemented to chlorella sp cultivation system the co2 addition to the system has enhanced microalgae growth and caused rapid nutrient assimilation besides high nutrient concentration and light limitation due to high turbidity of pome at the beginning of the treatment stage prolonged the adaptation of scenedesmus sp to pome as a nutrient medium scenedesmus sp seed was first transferred from the synthetic nutrient medium bbm to pome has caused a sudden impact to its environment and this slows down the growth and adaptability to the new environment pome acclimatization strategy can be implemented to overcome this adaptability issue research has proven that the adapted microalgae can reduce the lag phase and speed up nutrient assimilation by microalgae in pome 26 the final biomass of scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp produced from both stages of treatment were collected and analysed to specify the biochemical composition as demonstrated in figs 11 and 12 the biochemical composition of microalgae varies depending on the microalgae species 33 the major composition of both species is protein which was in the range of 48 58 followed by lipid and carbohydrates the high protein content in the biomass displays a satisfactory requirement for aquaculture and animal feed production the amount of lipid for both species is slightly the same and it is considered low for biodiesel production one of the reasons for low lipid content in biomass explained by yoo et al 49 is due to the high co2 supplemented to the cultivation system studies done by kamyab et al 25 proved that the production of lipid can be enhanced under the nutrient starvation condition the same studies affirmed that microalgae do not store lipid as the storage product while the lipid will be used throughout the cultivation period to synthesis protein for energy storage 25 carbohydrate composition in scenedesmus sp was 20 lower in comparison to carbohydrate presents in chlorella sp and this is associated with the environmental stress factors involving light temperature and nutrient supply the light available for scenedesmus sp is lower compared to the light available for chlorella sp as in the first stage of treatment the high turbidity of pome has caused light limitation to scenedesmus sp growth in the second stage of treatment the optical density of pome has reduced and it can be concluded that chlorella sp received higher light exposure throughout the cultivation period this finding is supported by ho et al 19 by stating that the content of carbohydrates in scenedesmus obliquus increased when they are exposed to higher light intensity the finding also proved that nitrogen limitation enhanced the biosynthesis of carbohydrates to microalgae current research shows that lower nitrogen available for chlorella sp assimilation has caused more carbohydrate produced 4 conclusion the overall objective of this research was to examine the capability of microalgae cultivated in pome to assimilate nutrients and capture co2 in the integrated treatment operation both microalgae species are able to show the positive results where up to 40 of cod 86 of tn and 85 phosphate reduced through the treatment chlorella sp has demonstrated the ability to capture co2 and directly reduce the toc value chlorella sp manifested about 0 829 g of co2 g of co2 l 1 day 1 captured with a total recovery of co2 12 435 g l after 15 days of co2 fixation operation the findings signified that the integrated treatment operation has a higher nutrient reduction in pome and more co2 fixed in comparison to the independent treatment operation two microalgae species with different metabolic traits were used in this integrated system to enhance treatment performance scenedesmus sp is heterotrophic that preferred organic nutrients while chlorella sp is autotrophic that preferred inorganic form of nutrient for growth furthermore by having this integrated treatment operation the available nutrients in pome from the first stage is further utilised in the second stage and directly reduce more pollutant in pome scenedesmus sp and chlorella sp biomass biochemical composition specifically protein carbohydrate and lipid were evaluated to suggest the future use of the biomass as resources for industrial application results also suggested that the growth of microalgae especially scenedesmus sp can be enhanced by improving the light penetration through pome pre treatment or dilution and acclimatization of microalgae seed in pome can also be done to counteract microalgae adaptability issues acclimatization of microalgae strain in pome can enhance the adaptability and shorten the lag phase of microalgae growth this could help to improve the tolerance of microalgae to a highly concentrated nutrient medium such as pome from the findings obtained microalgae biomass has the potential to be used for aquaculture feed and biofertilizer it is suggested to further analyse the essential nutrients contained in the biomass and the npk ratios to meet the production target acknowledgments the author gratefully acknowledges

14226,the recovery of ammonium nh4 from model nh4 2so4 solutions as well as from sludge liquor of a communal waste water treatment plant was studied on the laboratory scale using the ion exchanger loop stripping process ils the ils process combines ion exchange and air stripping in a hybrid process and works with fixed bed columns containing natural zeolite mainly clinoptilolite which is alternately loaded and regenerated the sodium hydroxide naoh regeneration fluid is simultaneously air stripped ammonium is recovered in a subsequent acid scrubber as concentrated ammonium sulfate solution which is a suitable reducing agent for industrial nox recovery lab scale experiments with four loading and regeneration cycles demonstrate the technical feasibility of the process the ammonium equilibrium increased after the first loading and regeneration cycles and ammonium uptake reached concentrations of 3 to 4 mg nh4 l 1 over four consecutive cycles naoh regeneration at ph values 11 5 recovered nearly the total amount of previously adsorbed ammonium the stripped amount of nh4 increased over the investigated cycles and in the final regeneration sequence approximately the whole amount of desorbed ammonium was simultaneously stripped ammonium exchange and recovery characteristics did not significantly change when real sludge liquor samples were used keywords ion exchanger loop stripping process natural zeolite wastewater treatment 1 introduction primary and secondary sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants contains high amounts of bio degradable organic substances which can cause odor nuisance as well as health issues caused by pathogenic germs to minimize these problems related to the biologically highly active sludge fractions different biological chemical or thermal methods of sludge stabilization are applied among the biological methods anaerobic sludge treatment fermentation is nowadays commonly applied in wastewater treatment plants 20000 population equivalents to stabilize the biosolids reduce the sludge amounts and recover energy in form of biogas the anaerobic digestion of organic nitrogen bearing compounds leads to the formation of soluble nitrogen in form of ammonium nh4 n the major share of ammonium is present in the liquid phase of the digested sludge sludge liquor after mechanical dewatering 1 with typical concentrations in the range of 250 1500 mg nh4 l 1 sometimes even higher 2 3 these concentrations are above typical effluent discharge limits and therefore further treatment of sludge liquor is necessary in most cases this treatment is done by returning the liquid phase to the aerobic nitrification basin in the wastewater treatment plant mainstream treatment this may result in a nitrogen back loading of up to 20 depending on the total amount of nitrogen in the wastewater feed 4 5 thus recirculated ammonium engrosses a significant part of the cleaning capacity of the aeration basin causing high energy costs e g for the fan operation to maintain sufficient basin aeration moreover the designed capacity for nh4 removal of many wastewater treatment plants is currently approached 3 the treatment of sludge liquor by additional alternative processes side stream treatment offers a possibility to avoid a cost intensive enlargement of the aeration basin in most cases side stream treatment requires less space than enlargement of the aeration basin while at the same time it reduces the mainstream treatment burden biological and chemical physical methods are common for side stream treatment of sludge liquor the biological side stream treatment processes are summarized in jardin et al 5 as well as those of chemical physical struvite precipitation chemical and physical methods like air stripping and ion exchange allow the selective recovery of ammonium which can be used for example in agriculture as fertilizer ammonium can be stripped from the liquid phase by transferring it into physically dissolved ammonia to shift the nh4 nh3 dissociation equilibrium almost completely to the side of ammonia temperatures of around 50 c are required at a given ph value of 11 6 the ph value of the sludge liquor is increased by adding of lye in the mixing tank usually the high ph values after stripping have to be lowered again by adding acids in order to enable sludge liquor recirculation the large consumption of chemicals for ph adjustment together with the possible accumulation of bio solids in the stripping columns and heat exchangers lead to high operating and maintenance costs for conventional air stripping methods conventional ammonia strippers have been successfully installed in large scale treatment plants in europe for the side stream treatment of sludge liquor 8 plants were installed until 2005 5 nevertheless ammonia stripping is only used when plants are already operating close to their capacity limits as the efficiency of the stripping process increases with high nitrogen concentrations 5 ammonium recovery by ion exchange processes with artificial or natural zeolites is an alternative treating method for waste water zeolites comprise many unique properties such as high treatment capacity high removal efficiency and fast kinetics 7 8 natural clinoptilolite are the most commonly used zeolite used as ion exchanger to remove ammonium from waste water due to their low costs and high selectivity for ammonium adsorption 9 11 ammonium removal via ion exchange is an effective method when concentrations of ammonium are low 100 mg l 1 7 however large quantities of salt solutions e g nacl are needed to achieve high regeneration rates 12 low concentrations of ammonium in the regeneration fluid of ion exchange processes increase the regeneration rates which can be realized by using large volumes of fresh regeneration fluid or much more effective by simultaneous air stripping of ammonia thereby the concentration of ammonia decreases in the regeneration solution and due to this the driving force for the ion exchange increases sherman 13 describes a combined process ammonia removal and recovery process arrp for ammonium recovery from wastewater with clinoptilolite as ion exchanger and subsequent stripping of the regeneration fluid nacl naoh in an acid scrubber in virginia and california two large scale plants for the treatment of municipal waste water with nitrogen levels lower than 50 mg n l 1 9 were put into operation in the 1970s deng et al 14 also performed ammonium recovery experiments using zeolite and subsequent regeneration with a nacl solution the ammonium exchange capacity of their continuous flow column experiments decreased with increasing regeneration frequency when nh4cl solutions with input concentrations of 30 mg n l 1 were treated another option for sidestream nitrogen recovery is the ion exchanger loop stripping process ils investigated in this work the hybrid ils process combines the benefits of the ion exchanger and the air stripping process ammonium is selectively separated from wastewater and preconcentrated by ion exchange on natural zeolite the main mineral used is clinoptilolite fixed bed columns are used for ammonium removal which are alternately loaded and regenerated the ion exchanger material is regenerated with naoh solutions which are simultaneously air stripped stripped ammonia is captured in sulfuric acid scrubber to form a nox removal agent for off gas cleaning in industrial processes e g in cement works hence the ils process has the advantages of providing an all year round supply of recovered nitrogen 15 together with lower investment and operating costs compared to conventional stripping processes 16 lower investment and operating costs are a consequence of compact design sizes and a less energy intensive stripping process due to preconcentration furthermore the ils process reduces salting of the treated sludge liquor due to ph adjustment and prevents potential clogging scaling of the stripping columns due to a separation of the ion exchange and stripping cycles these advantages can foster the implementation

was determined by sampling the receiver tank and stripping vessel samples of 20 ml ammonium concentrations were determined using the kjeldahl method regeneration samples were acidified to ph values of around 4 with sulfuric acid 96 immediately after sampling to avoid ammonia losses washing bottle solutions were analyzed for accumulated ammonium after each regeneration sequence using the same method to determine the influence of ion exchange on natural zeolite on the composition of nh4 2so4 solution and sludge liquor samples of the original and the treated loading solutions were analyzed for cod toc cl so4 2 po4 3 ion chromatography as well as ca2 mg2 k and na icp ms and total hardness table 3 loading cycles in all experiments lasted 60 min starting with the first overflow of treated liquid on the top of the column after loading was finished the flow direction of the flexible tube pumps was reversed to discharge the column and transfer residual loading solution from the zeolite column back into the receiving tank each loading cycle was followed by flushing the zeolite bed with deionized water for about 10 min to remove residual ammonium after discharging the remaining washing fluid from the reactor the regeneration cycle was started flushing and discharging of the zeolite bed was performed after each loading regeneration cycle regeneration cycles lasted 120 min each the

final loading of 3 96 mg nh4 g 1 zeolite was achieved m1 l ion exchange equilibrium of the subsequent regeneration m1 r was obtained at 2 43 mg nh4 g 1 despite this residual ammonium content nearly the same amount of ammonium was adsorbed in the second loading sequence resulting in a final loading of 6 27 mg nh4 g 1 m2 l in the following regeneration and loading sequences adsorbed and regenerated ammonium amounts equilibrated with stable ammonium contents after loading around 6 mg nh4 g 1 and regeneration around 3 mg nh4 g 1 the difference in the ammonium contents of the zeolite represents the amount of desorbed ammonium which is either found in the liquid phase or as stripped ammonia in the acid washing bottle fig 2 b left y axis in the first regeneration sequence approximately 30 of the desorbed ammonium amount was stripped m1 r the stripped ammonium amount increased to 45 in the second to 81 in the third and finally to 92 in the fourth regeneration sequence m2 4 r the ammonium concentration of the regeneration solution fig 2 b right y axis increased continuously to the next regeneration sequence and is therefore regarded as the major factor influencing the stripping performance the minor decrease in the ammonium concentration between the third and the fourth regeneration sequence indicates that ammonium concentrations in the regeneration solution probably reach a stable equilibrium between ion exchange and stripping performance after three regeneration cycles the difference of the initial and the final ammonium concentration of the regeneration solutions was high during the first two regeneration sequences due to the high ratio of desorbed to stripped ammonia as the amount of stripped ammonium increases the ammonium concentrations before and after regeneration converge at concentration levels of around 700 800 mg nh4 l 1 fig 2 b the test series using real sludge liquor yielded similar results fig 3 a in the first loading sequence a final loading of 3 71 mg nh4 g 1 was reached s1 l ion exchange equilibrium at 1 71 mg nh4 g 1 was reached after 120 min of regeneration s1 r the ammonium content of the zeolite increased over all loadings with 5 73 mg nh4 g 1 after the final loading sequence s4 l whereby approximately the same amount of ammonium was adsorbed after the first loading about 3 2 mg nh4 g 1 the regenerated nh4 amount increased from the first to the second regeneration and remained nearly stable during the subsequent regeneration sequences around 2 8 mg nh4 g 1 the amount of desorbed ammonium during the fourth regeneration cycle was about 8 lower than during the two previous ones fig 3 b s4 r this is due to the increased concentration of the regeneration solution fig 3 b right y axis as the solution volume was reduced by half a liter each sequence due to sampling from 10 l s1 r to 8 5 l s4 r the share of stripped ammonium increased over all regeneration cycles starting with 29 in the first and ending up with 82 in the fourth regeneration sequence the difference of the initial and the final concentration of the regeneration solution followed the same trends as those of the nh4 2so4 solutions it increased from the first to the second regeneration and decreased in the subsequent regeneration steps fig 3 b comparing the two experimental runs conducted with model solutions and sludge liquor samples revealed similar results hence ammonium exchange characteristics and specific uptake were not significantly affected by the use of sludge liquor nevertheless a stable ion exchange equilibrium was already reached in the second loading sequence with the model solution indicated by constant ammonium loadings of around 6 mg nh4 g 1 in sequences m2 4 l fig 2 a in contrast the ammonium content of the experiments using sludge liquor increased successively over the four cycles and reached 6 mg nh4 g 1 not before the fourth loading sequence s4 l the ils process is designed for numerous consecutive loading and regeneration sequences hence loading sequences three and four are the most meaningful due to the multiple steps of na regeneration the total amounts of adsorbed ammonium from sludge liquor at incoming concentrations of 1042 11 mg nh4 l 1 are between 3 14 s3 l and 3 39 s4 l mg nh4 g 1 these values correspond to 3 08 m3 l and 3 48 m4 l mg nh4 g 1 when model solution with 972 26 mg nh4 l 1 was used under the same experimental conditions 3 2 removal rates the removal rates of ammonium obtained in the two test series showed similar trends table 2 the highest removal rate was achieved in both test series in the first loading sequence with 60 2 m1 using nh4 2so4 solution and 53 2 s1 using sludge liquor the removal rates decreased in the following two loading sequences successively but increased again in the fourth loading sequence to 53 0 m4 and 48 3 s4 on average the removal rate of the four cycles using nh4 2so4 solution was slightly higher compared to the treatment of sludge liquor 3 3 influence of zeolite ion exchange on liquid compositions as shown by the results from the first loading sequence of the model solution ammonium ions were primarily exchanged for ca2 followed by k na and even small amounts of mg2 table 3 these cations represent the dominant non framework cations of the applied clinoptilolite the first loading sequence with sludge liquor showed similar results despite the higher selectivity of clinoptilolite for k over nh4 and na 17 18 potassium concentrations in model solution and in sludge liquor increased during the first loading sequence indicating that bonding of k in the clinoptilolite cages is weaker and high k contents may therefore enhance ion exchange the smaller increase of calcium in the first sludge liquor loading sequence compared to model solutions could be due to the precipitation of insoluble phases by reaction of ca2 with phosphate 15 naoh regeneration influenced the ion exchange significantly table 3 in the third loading sequence after two naoh regenerations ammonium ions in sludge liquor were primarily exchanged for na and only minor amounts of k ca2 and mg2 were adsorbed by na exchanged zeolite hence in course of the ils process naoh regenerated natural clinoptilolite showed the same characteristics as nacl pretreated natural clinoptilolite c f 15 na enriched zeolites typically show an enhanced nh4 exchange capacity caused by na replacement of the natural cation loading homoionization c f 19 which is also an explanation for the observed increase of ammonium removal rates in the fourth loading sequence with model solution and sludge liquor table 2 chapter 3 2 chlorine concentrations remain stable in sludge liquor over all analyzed loading sequences due to the use of naoh instead of nacl for regeneration 10 12 14 also a minor decrease of toc and cod was observed this reduction could be the result of mechanical filtering effects of the zeolite bed 4 conclusions lab scale experiments with the ion exchanger loop stripping process showed that ammonium recovery with natural zeolite clinoptilolite from model nh4 2so4 solutions as well as sludge liquor samples from a communal sewage treatment plant was successful neither ammonium exchange characteristics nor specific uptake were significantly influenced by the use of sludge liquor instead of model solutions nevertheless stable values of ammonium loading 6 mg nh4 g 1 were approached faster with model solutions after the second sequence in the experiments with sludge liquor four loading and regeneration cycles were needed to obtain the same zeolite loading in the fourth regeneration sequence simultaneous air stripping of the regeneration solution naoh ph 11 5 desorbed nearly the same ammonium amount that was removed in the previous loading cycle these results indicate the formation of a stable ion exchange equilibrium after several loading regeneration cycles with a constant basic loading of the zeolite of around 3 mg nh4 g 1 at the same time the total amounts of adsorbed desorbed ammonium at typical incoming concentrations of about 1000 mg nh4 l 1 were between 3 1 and 3 5 mg nh4 g 1 zeolite the increasing ammonium concentration in the regeneration solution from one to the next regeneration sequence is the major factor influencing the stripping performance hence nearly the whole amount of desorbed ammonium was stripped in the final regeneration sequence the stripping performance can be further enhanced for example by applying a packing column instead of the bubble column used in the lab experiments providing the opportunity to increase the efficiency of ammonium recovery during the first loading the ammonium in the sludge liquor was mainly exchanged for calcium potassium sodium and small amounts of magnesium after naoh regeneration ammonium ions were primarily exchanged for sodium whereas potassium calcium and magnesium exchange became less important hence naoh regenerated clinoptilolite showed similar ion exchange characteristics as nacl pretreated clinoptilolite 15 based on the present results a zeolite mass of about 270 kg would be needed for the treatment of 1 m³ sludge liquor with a typical feed concentration of 1000 mg nh4 l 1 assuming that a loading similar to the experiments conducted in this study 3 0 mg nh4 g 1 zeolite with a removal rate of 80 is achieved a setup with three alternately loaded and regenerated ion exchanger columns would provide a continuous sludge liquor treatment due to the regeneration time of 120 min compared to a loading time of 60 min as executed in the experiments the regeneration sequences of the three columns have to be operated parallel in a continuous process the combination of ion exchange and simultaneous air stripping in ils facilitates process intensification and significantly reduces the amount of energy and chemicals for nitrogen recovery compared to the conventional stripping process feed and regeneration cycles are kept separate in ils to prevent scaling and clogging of the stripper packings in the ils process only the regeneration solution has to be heated to 60 c for efficient stripping which enables the use of low temperature excess heat in the present study we showed that a successful recovery of ammonium from a total volume of approximately 60 l of feed solution model solution or sludge liquor is possible by using only 10 l of continuously stripped regeneration fluid hence a lower quantity of liquid must be heated with ils in comparison to conventional strippers where the whole amount of feed solution is heated liquid analysis suggests that a recirculation of ils treated effluents to the biological cycle of the waste water treatment plant is possible without restrictions effluent ph does not rise significantly max ph 9 s3 table 3 and the addition of chemicals for ph adjustment is superseded the higher na contents instead of nh4 do not negatively influence the subsequent waste water treatment processes or effluent discharge limits overall the combination of ion exchange and stripping enables process intensification and a beneficial operation of ils with regard to chemical and energy demands the results obtained in this study are favorable for up scaling of the ion exchanger loop stripping process from the lab to the pilot plant scale in a pilot plant the influence of real sludge liquor on the stability of the used zeolite and ammonium recovery rates over numerous loading and regeneration cycles has to be investigated under natural conditions to

14226,the recovery of ammonium nh4 from model nh4 2so4 solutions as well as from sludge liquor of a communal waste water treatment plant was studied on the laboratory scale using the ion exchanger loop stripping process ils the ils process combines ion exchange and air stripping in a hybrid process and works with fixed bed columns containing natural zeolite mainly clinoptilolite which is alternately loaded and regenerated the sodium hydroxide naoh regeneration fluid is simultaneously air stripped ammonium is recovered in a subsequent acid scrubber as concentrated ammonium sulfate solution which is a suitable reducing agent for industrial nox recovery lab scale experiments with four loading and regeneration cycles demonstrate the technical feasibility of the process the ammonium equilibrium increased after the first loading and regeneration cycles and ammonium uptake reached concentrations of 3 to 4 mg nh4 l 1 over four consecutive cycles naoh regeneration at ph values 11 5 recovered nearly the total amount of previously adsorbed ammonium the stripped amount of nh4 increased over the investigated cycles and in the final regeneration sequence approximately the whole amount of desorbed ammonium was simultaneously stripped ammonium exchange and recovery characteristics did not significantly change when real sludge liquor samples were used keywords ion exchanger loop stripping process natural zeolite wastewater treatment 1 introduction primary and secondary sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants contains high amounts of bio degradable organic substances which can cause odor nuisance as well as health issues caused by pathogenic germs to minimize these problems related to the biologically highly active sludge fractions different biological chemical or thermal methods of sludge stabilization are applied among the biological methods anaerobic sludge treatment fermentation is nowadays commonly applied in wastewater treatment plants 20000 population equivalents to stabilize the biosolids reduce the sludge amounts and recover energy in form of biogas the anaerobic digestion of organic nitrogen bearing compounds leads to the formation of soluble nitrogen in form of ammonium nh4 n the major share of ammonium is present in the liquid phase of the digested sludge sludge liquor after mechanical dewatering 1 with typical concentrations in the range of 250 1500 mg nh4 l 1 sometimes even higher 2 3 these concentrations are above typical effluent discharge limits and therefore further treatment of sludge liquor is necessary in most cases this treatment is done by returning the liquid phase to the aerobic nitrification basin in the wastewater treatment plant mainstream treatment this may result in a nitrogen back loading of up to 20 depending on the total amount of nitrogen in the wastewater feed 4 5 thus recirculated ammonium engrosses a significant part of the cleaning capacity of the aeration basin causing high energy costs e g for the fan operation to maintain sufficient basin aeration moreover the designed capacity for nh4 removal of many wastewater treatment plants is currently approached 3 the treatment of sludge liquor by additional alternative processes side stream treatment offers a possibility to avoid a cost intensive enlargement of the aeration basin in most cases side stream treatment requires less space than enlargement of the aeration basin while at the same time it reduces the mainstream treatment burden biological and chemical physical methods are common for side stream treatment of sludge liquor the biological side stream treatment processes are summarized in jardin et al 5 as well as those of chemical physical struvite precipitation chemical and physical methods like air stripping and ion exchange allow the selective recovery of ammonium which can be used for example in agriculture as fertilizer ammonium can be stripped from the liquid phase by transferring it into physically dissolved ammonia to shift the nh4 nh3 dissociation equilibrium almost completely to the side of ammonia temperatures of around 50 c are required at a given ph value of 11 6 the ph value of the sludge liquor is increased by adding of lye in the mixing tank usually the high ph values after stripping have to be lowered again by adding acids in order to enable sludge liquor recirculation the large consumption of chemicals for ph adjustment together with the possible accumulation of bio solids in the stripping columns and heat exchangers lead to high operating and maintenance costs for conventional air stripping methods conventional ammonia strippers have been successfully installed in large scale treatment plants in europe for the side stream treatment of sludge liquor 8 plants were installed until 2005 5 nevertheless ammonia stripping is only used when plants are already operating close to their capacity limits as the efficiency of the stripping process increases with high nitrogen concentrations 5 ammonium recovery by ion exchange processes with artificial or natural zeolites is an alternative treating method for waste water zeolites comprise many unique properties such as high treatment capacity high removal efficiency and fast kinetics 7 8 natural clinoptilolite are the most commonly used zeolite used as ion exchanger to remove ammonium from waste water due to their low costs and high selectivity for ammonium adsorption 9 11 ammonium removal via ion exchange is an effective method when concentrations of ammonium are low 100 mg l 1 7 however large quantities of salt solutions e g nacl are needed to achieve high regeneration rates 12 low concentrations of ammonium in the regeneration fluid of ion exchange processes increase the regeneration rates which can be realized by using large volumes of fresh regeneration fluid or much more effective by simultaneous air stripping of ammonia thereby the concentration of ammonia decreases in the regeneration solution and due to this the driving force for the ion exchange increases sherman 13 describes a combined process ammonia removal and recovery process arrp for ammonium recovery from wastewater with clinoptilolite as ion exchanger and subsequent stripping of the regeneration fluid nacl naoh in an acid scrubber in virginia and california two large scale plants for the treatment of municipal waste water with nitrogen levels lower than 50 mg n l 1 9 were put into operation in the 1970s deng et al 14 also performed ammonium recovery experiments using zeolite and subsequent regeneration with a nacl solution the ammonium exchange capacity of their continuous flow column experiments decreased with increasing regeneration frequency when nh4cl solutions with input concentrations of 30 mg n l 1 were treated another option for sidestream nitrogen recovery is the ion exchanger loop stripping process ils investigated in this work the hybrid ils process combines the benefits of the ion exchanger and the air stripping process ammonium is selectively separated from wastewater and preconcentrated by ion exchange on natural zeolite the main mineral used is clinoptilolite fixed bed columns are used for ammonium removal which are alternately loaded and regenerated the ion exchanger material is regenerated with naoh solutions which are simultaneously air stripped stripped ammonia is captured in sulfuric acid scrubber to form a nox removal agent for off gas cleaning in industrial processes e g in cement works hence the ils process has the advantages of providing an all year round supply of recovered nitrogen 15 together with lower investment and operating costs compared to conventional stripping processes 16 lower investment and operating costs are a consequence of compact design sizes and a less energy intensive stripping process due to preconcentration furthermore the ils process reduces salting of the treated sludge liquor due to ph adjustment and prevents potential clogging scaling of the stripping columns due to a separation of the ion exchange and stripping cycles these advantages can foster the implementation of the ils process in compact retrofitting units at existing waste water treatment plants with column experiments ellersdorfer 15 demonstrated the successful ammonium recovery with clinoptilolite from

ammonium from sludge liquor at incoming concentrations of 1042 11 mg nh4 l 1 are between 3 14 s3 l and 3 39 s4 l mg nh4 g 1 these values correspond to 3 08 m3 l and 3 48 m4 l mg nh4 g 1 when model solution with 972 26 mg nh4 l 1 was used under the same experimental conditions 3 2 removal rates the removal rates of ammonium obtained in the two test series showed similar trends table 2 the highest removal rate was achieved in both test series in the first loading sequence with 60 2 m1 using nh4 2so4 solution and 53 2 s1 using sludge liquor the removal rates decreased in the following two loading sequences successively but increased again in the fourth loading sequence to 53 0 m4 and 48 3 s4 on average the removal rate of the four cycles using nh4 2so4 solution was slightly higher compared to the treatment of sludge liquor 3 3 influence of zeolite ion exchange on liquid compositions as shown by the results from the first loading sequence of the model solution ammonium ions were primarily exchanged for ca2 followed by k na and even small amounts of mg2 table 3 these cations represent the dominant non framework cations of the applied clinoptilolite the first loading sequence with sludge liquor showed similar results despite the higher selectivity of clinoptilolite for k over nh4 and na 17 18 potassium concentrations in model solution and in sludge liquor increased during the first loading sequence indicating that bonding of k in the clinoptilolite cages is weaker and high k contents may therefore enhance ion exchange the smaller increase of calcium in the first sludge liquor loading sequence compared to model solutions could be due to the precipitation of insoluble phases by reaction of ca2 with phosphate 15 naoh regeneration influenced the ion exchange significantly table 3 in the third loading sequence after two naoh regenerations ammonium ions in sludge liquor were primarily exchanged for na and only minor amounts of k ca2 and mg2 were adsorbed by na exchanged zeolite hence in course of the ils process naoh regenerated natural clinoptilolite showed the same characteristics as nacl pretreated natural clinoptilolite c f 15 na enriched zeolites typically show an enhanced nh4 exchange capacity caused by na replacement of the natural cation loading homoionization c f 19 which is also an explanation for the observed increase of ammonium removal rates in the fourth loading sequence with model solution and sludge liquor table 2 chapter 3 2 chlorine concentrations remain stable in sludge liquor over all analyzed loading sequences due to the use of naoh instead of nacl for regeneration 10 12 14 also a minor decrease of toc and cod was observed this reduction could be the result of mechanical filtering effects of the zeolite bed 4 conclusions lab scale experiments with the ion exchanger loop stripping process showed that ammonium recovery with natural zeolite clinoptilolite from model nh4 2so4 solutions as well as sludge liquor samples from a communal sewage treatment plant was successful neither ammonium exchange characteristics nor specific uptake were significantly influenced by the use of sludge liquor instead of model solutions nevertheless stable values of ammonium loading 6 mg nh4 g 1 were approached faster with model solutions after the second sequence in the experiments with sludge liquor four loading and regeneration cycles were needed to obtain the same zeolite loading in the fourth regeneration sequence simultaneous air stripping of the regeneration solution naoh ph 11 5 desorbed nearly the same ammonium amount that was removed in the previous loading cycle these results indicate the formation of a stable ion exchange equilibrium after several loading regeneration cycles with a constant basic loading of the zeolite of around 3 mg nh4 g 1 at the same time the total amounts of adsorbed desorbed ammonium at typical incoming concentrations of about 1000 mg nh4 l 1 were between 3 1 and 3 5 mg nh4 g 1 zeolite the increasing ammonium concentration in the regeneration solution from one to the next regeneration sequence is the major factor influencing the stripping performance hence nearly the whole amount of desorbed ammonium was stripped in the final regeneration sequence the stripping performance can be further enhanced for example by applying a packing column instead of the bubble column used in the lab experiments providing the opportunity to increase the efficiency of ammonium recovery during the first loading the ammonium in the sludge liquor was mainly exchanged for calcium potassium sodium and small amounts of magnesium after naoh regeneration ammonium ions were primarily exchanged for sodium whereas potassium calcium and magnesium exchange became less important hence naoh regenerated clinoptilolite showed similar ion exchange characteristics as nacl pretreated clinoptilolite 15 based on the present results a zeolite mass of about 270 kg would be needed for the treatment of 1 m³ sludge liquor with a typical feed concentration of 1000 mg nh4 l 1 assuming that a loading similar to the experiments conducted in this study 3 0 mg nh4 g 1 zeolite with a removal rate of 80 is achieved a setup with three alternately loaded and regenerated ion exchanger columns would provide a continuous sludge liquor treatment due to the regeneration time of 120 min compared to a loading time of 60 min as executed in the experiments the regeneration sequences of the three columns have to be operated parallel in a continuous process the combination of ion exchange and simultaneous air stripping in ils facilitates process intensification and significantly reduces the amount of energy and chemicals for nitrogen recovery compared to the conventional stripping process feed and regeneration cycles are kept separate in ils to prevent scaling and clogging of the stripper packings in the ils process only the regeneration solution has to be heated to 60 c for efficient stripping which enables the use of low temperature excess heat in the present study we showed that a successful recovery of ammonium from a total volume of approximately 60 l of feed solution model solution or sludge liquor is possible by using only 10 l of continuously stripped regeneration fluid hence a lower quantity of liquid must be heated with ils in comparison to conventional strippers where the whole amount of feed solution is heated liquid analysis suggests that a recirculation of ils treated effluents to the biological cycle of the waste water treatment plant is possible without restrictions effluent ph does not rise significantly max ph 9 s3 table 3 and the addition of chemicals for ph adjustment is superseded the higher na contents instead of nh4 do not negatively influence the subsequent waste water treatment processes or effluent discharge limits overall the combination of ion exchange and stripping enables process intensification and a beneficial operation of ils with regard to chemical and energy demands the results obtained in this study are favorable for up scaling of the ion exchanger loop stripping process from the lab to the pilot plant scale in a pilot plant the influence of real sludge liquor on the stability of the used zeolite and ammonium recovery rates over numerous loading and regeneration cycles has to be investigated under natural conditions to

14227,although ultrafiltration uf membranes have gained considerable attention in water separation and purification process most of the materials used for commercial uf membranes fabrication do not able to degrade decompose easily and tend to cause severe environmental problem when they are discarded in view of this an environmentally friendly hydrophilic polymeric material polylactic acid pla has been considered in this work aiming to reduce not only the environmental impacts caused by the existing membranes but also to improve membrane water flux and antifouling resistance in this study

bovine serum albumin the findings of this work demonstrated that biodegradable pla is potential to be used to modify the characteristics of uf membranes leading to enhanced water treatment process keywords ultrafiltration polylactic acid polyvinylidene fluoride water treatment 1 introduction natural organic matter nom found in the water environment is ubiquitous and chemically complex organic compound studies showed that nom is one of the main pollutants in drinking water production mainly because of the generation of disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas when nom interacts with chlorine in water 1 direct exposure to the dbps can cause cancers miscarriages and nervous system complications 2 4 therefore effective removal of nom is a significant and challenging research topic in the current development of water purification humic acid ha is the major species in nom and account for 50 90 of the total freshwater organic matters 3 4 scientists always considered ha as a model compound in the studies of water treatment process using membrane based technology 2 4 ultrafiltration uf membrane process receives a wider attention compared to other membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and microfiltration mf due to its good balance between water flux and rejections against colloids macromolecules and suspended particles 5 9 one of the main polymeric materials that is widely used for the commercial uf membranes fabrication is polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf compared to polysulfone psf and polyethersulfone pes pvdf offers greater thermal stability and mechanical property as well as outstanding chemical and oxidation resistance 5 8 10 12 however pvdf is not made of biodegradable material and requires longer time to achieve complete degradation upon dump site disposal 13 in view of this it is a great significance if a novel membrane material is able to be developed using biodegradable polymer biodegradable materials can be broken down by microorganisms producing harmless compounds for nature these kinds of materials have already been widely used in food packaging daily necessities containers and medical instruments 10 13 among the biodegradable materials polylactic acid pla formula c3h4o2 n a polymer produced from natural sources like corn is widely reported in the literature 10 13 statistics from the scopus reveal that there are more than 3000 papers reporting the use of pla for various applications over the past 10 years 2007 2018 pla is possibly degraded in soil compost or human body in a composting environment the pla is hydrolyzed into smaller molecules e g oligomers dimers and monomers after 45 60 days at 50 60 c these smaller molecules are then degraded into co 2 and h 2 o by microorganisms in compost 14 15 incorporation of hydrophilic biopolymer like xanthan gum xa into pes membrane had been previously reported for ha removal the modified pes membrane was reported to exhibit enhanced water permeability 24 8 l m 2 h bar with ha rejection above than 80 16 similar to xa pla which is also a hydrophilic biopolymer has potential to be used for membrane modification previous studies have investigated the potential of using pla and its derivatives for membrane fabrication for instance pla poly lactic acid block poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate pla phema membranes with high pla phema contents exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity water permeability and anti fouling resistance 17 upon addition of 15 wt pla phema the water flux of the resultant membrane was reported to be about 236 l m 2 h bar with bovine serum albumin bsa clearance as low as 0 31 ml min 17 shen et al 18 on the other hand reported that the incorporation of pla based copolymer could improve the hydrophilicity of membrane by decreasing water contact angle from around 80 to 60 leading to enhanced water permeability and greater antifouling properties previous studies have shown that hydrophilic pla could be used to modify the properties of psf nanofiber membrane with respect to pore dimension 19 and oil sorption capacity 20 but using pla as additive for asymmetric uf membrane fabrication has yet to be reported in the literature it must be pointed out that the membranes made of pure pla are not likely to be used for pressure driven process owing to the poor mechanical properties of pla film 16 17 thus pla can only be considered as additive to modify the existing membranes in view of this the main objective of this work is to modify pvdf based hollow fiber membrane using biodegradable pla aiming to produce environmentally friendly membranes with enhanced water flux and antifouling properties for water treatment process the impacts of pla quantity and air gap during spinning process on the properties of resultant membranes will be investigated using analytical instruments and filtration based method the developed pla modified pvdf membrane is aimed to treat water source containing ha and bsa producing water that is good enough for drinking 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercial pvdf kynar 760 mw 440 000 g mol in pellet form purchased from

co ltd humic acid ha obtained from acros organic and bovine serum albumin bsa mw 66 000 g mol obtained from sigma aldrich were used to prepare feed solution by dissolving respective component in ultrapure water 2 2 hollow fiber membrane fabrication all hollow fiber membranes were prepared via phase inversion method using spinning machine the compositions of dope solutions used for fabricating twelve types of membranes are shown in table 1 prior to dope preparation pvdf and pla pellets were first dried in vacuum oven at 60 overnight to remove moisture afterwards 5 wt of pvp was dissolved in 77 wt nmp under stirring rate of 350 rpm and at temperature of 40 after 30 min mixing the stirring rate and temperature were increased to 550 rpm and 60 respectively the pla at different pla pvdf ratios from 0 3 to 3 was then added into the mixture once pla was completely dissolved pvdf was added slowly into the homogenous solution for all the dope solutions prepared the total weight of polymer was fixed at 23 wt including water soluble pvp at last the solution was subject to 30 min ultrasonication to remove microbubbles before it could be used for membrane fabrication the viscosity of the dope solution was measured at 25 using a basic viscometer model ew 98965 40 cole palmer the measurement was performed by driving a spindle which was immersed in the dope solution through a calibrated spring the viscous drag of the solution against the spindle was then measured by the rotary transducer to yield the results using the solutions prepared the hollow fiber membranes were fabricated at room conditions via spinning technique during spinning process all the parameters were kept constant except the air gap which was adjusted to either 0 cm wet spinning or 8 cm dry jet wet spinning the dope solution was first delivered at dope extrusion rate der of 4 ml min through a spinneret with an orifice diameter inner diameter of 1 3 0 5 mm with the help of a gear pump the bore fluid i e pure water was channelled simultaneously through the inner diameter of spinneret at flow rate of 2 ml min using a constant flow syringe pump coagulation medium used to initiate phase inversion process was tap water at room temperature the spun fibers were then collected at the speed of 8 m min using wind up drum the resultant hollow fiber membranes were then immersed in pure water bath for 24 h to remove remaining solvent at last the membranes were post treated with 10 wt glycerol solution for 24 h to avert the membrane structure from collapsing before being used for characterization 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry all the resultant hollow fiber membranes were dried in a desiccator for a minimum of 24 h prior to ftir analysis the changes in the functional groups of the membranes upon pla modification were determined using an attenuated total reflectance ftir model nicolet is10 thermo scientific spectrometer the ftir measurements were carried out on diamond plate with the scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 20 21 2 3 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal properties of the membrane samples were characterized using a thermogravimetric analyser model sdta 851e mettler toledo approximately 20 mg of hollow fiber membranes were used during tga analysis that was carried out under nitrogen gas over a temperature range of 30 600 at a 10 min heating rate thermal degradation profile of hollow fiber membranes was then established 10 23 2 3 3 scanning electron microscopy sem the cross sectional morphologies of pvdf membranes with and without pla modification were examined using sem model tm3000 hitachi for each sample one fiber was fractured in liquid nitrogen to obtain clear and smooth cross section before sticking onto a metal plate using double sided carbon tape for the membrane surface examination a small piece of each sample was mounted on the metal plate horizontally prior to sem analysis all membranes samples were sputter coated with gold to increase surface conductivity and to improve contrast of the images taken 10 24 25 2 3 4 atomic force microscopy afm the membrane surface roughness was examined using afm model nanowizard jpk instruments first the sample was fixed on a glass plate and placed into the holder of an afm 5 0 μm 5 0 μm scan area of the membrane outer surface was acquired with a silicon probe tap300 g all membrane images were analysed and processed with the jpk image processing software associated to the instrument 8 17 22 2 3 5 mechanical strength analysis mechanical strength of hollow fiber membranes was tested using universal testing machine model instron 5567 instron according to astm882 12 the gauge length and gauge running speed were fixed at 50 mm and 2 mm min respectively every membrane sample was tested more than five times and its mechanical property stress strain and young modulus was evaluated with respect to ultimate tensile strength using instron bluehill software 26 2 3 6 hydrophilicty and membrane porosity analysis the membrane surface hydrophilicity was determined using contact angle goniometer model oca 15pro dataphysics 0 5 μ l deionized water was dropped on the outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes using a micro syringe and the contact angle was measured for each membrane sample three strands of fibers were randomly chosen for contact angle measurement at least ten measurements were taken for each strand the average value of contact angle was then reported membrane porosity was measured by cutting a hollow fiber into segments followed by drying in a desiccator for overnight before weighing the overall porosity ε was calculated using the following equation 1 ε 1 m 3 4 π l ρ p o d i d 2 100 where m is mass of the hollow fiber segment ρ p is blend of pvdf and pla polymer density of hollow fiber membrane l od and id were the length outer and inner diameters of the hollow fiber membranes respectively 20 27 the mean pore radius of membrane r was determined using guerout elford ferry equation as expressed in eq 2 7 2 r 2 9 1 75ε 8 nl q ε a δp where n is the water viscosity at 25 c l is the membrane thickness m q is the volume of permeate water per unit time m 3 s a is the effective area of membrane m 2 and δp is the operating pressure pa membrane pore size diameter could be obtained by multiplying r by 2 2 4 membrane performance evaluation to evaluate membrane performance cross flow filtration system with a feed flow rate of 1 l min was used prior to any measurement each membrane potted in module was first compacted at 1 5 bar using pure water for 30 min this is to ensure membrane achieved steady flux conditions prior to any measurement filtration experiment was then carried out at 1 bar gauge and the membrane pure water flux j w 1 was calculated using eq 3 3 j w 1 v a δ t where v l is the volume of permeate a m 2 is the effective area of the hollow fiber membrane and t h is the filtration time to collect v volume the filtration experiment was continued by replacing the pure water with 1000 mg l ha solution and the membrane was tested under the same operating conditions as in the pure water permeation test the ha rejection r was calculated using eq 4 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p and c f are the ha concentration mg l of the permeate and feed respectively the ha concentrations in the permeate and feed samples were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach with absorbance measured at 283 nm where the maximum absorption occurs the membrane flux recovery rate frr was also studied to compare antifouling properties of modified membranes against foulants deposition this experiment was started with pure water flux j w 1 evaluation followed by filtration of feed solution containing 1000 mg l bsa both filtration processes were performed under the same operating conditions after 2 h of the uf experiment with bsa the feed solution tank was refilled with pure water again and the membrane was cleaned by letting the ultrapure water flow for 30 min under the same condition as pure water permeation test then the pure water flux j w 2 was re measured to obtain r fr as expressed in eq 5 5 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 the rejection of membranes against bsa was also measured using eq 3 and the bsa concentrations in permeate and feed samples were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach with absorbance measured at 280 nm where the maximum absorption occurs extended protein flux profile was studied by starting with pure water flux for 30 min followed by feed solution with higher bsa concentration 1500 mg l for 2 h this procedure was repeated for three times with washing membrane with ultrapure water about 30 min after 2 h with bsa solution to study the leaching of pla from the membrane 1 g of the resultant membrane was cut into small pieces and immersed in 100 ml ultrapure water under vigorous magnetic stirring the solution was continuously stirred for 5 days before it was collected for total organic carbon toc analysis using toc analyser model toc lcpn shimadzu to determine the possible pla leaching from the membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of hollow fiber membranes fig 1 compares the ftir spectra of pvdf membranes modified with and without pla as changing air gap during spinning process would not affect the surface chemistry of the membrane only the results of the membranes spun at 8 cm air gap were shown as can be clearly seen all the pla modified pvdf membranes exhibited additional absorption band at 1760 cm 1 in comparison to the pure pvdf membrane the presence of this band is originated from the carbonyl strecth of pla ester 19 20 28 the signal was found to increase with increasing the quantity of the pla in the membrane matrix suggesting the resultant membranes contained increasing amount of secondary polymer other important bands that were detected in these membranes could be attributed to the pvdf material for instance peak at 3025 cm 1 is assigned to c f stretching of pvdf 30 peaks at 1400 and 1177 cm 1 meanwhile are corresponded to the stretching and deformation vibration of ch 2 and cf 2 group of pvdf respectively 22 peak at 1664 cm 1 is assigned to the cc adsorption of pvdf 22 β phase of pvdf is visible at 840 cm 1 21 the vibrations bands at 1170 cm 1 and 1204 cm 1 are due to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of cf 2 respectively 31 even though pure pla dope solution was also prepared in this work it was not able to be used for membrane fabrication mainly because of the following reasons the first reason is the extremely low viscosity 449 cp of this solution compared to other solutions making its almost impossible to form hollow fiber membrane second reason is that pla dissolves quickly in water owing to its high degree of hydrophilicity the degradation of membranes spun at 8 cm air gap was also investigated and their respective tga profile is presented in fig 2 for the control pvdf membrane there were two stages of thermal degradation the first stage is the degradation of carbonyl bond cleavage that took place between carbon and nitrogen atoms nc o from the remaining pvp present in the membrane matrix at temperature 350 23 the second stage meanwhile was the degradation of main membrane forming material pvdf at temperature between 350 and 480 32 comparing the degradation rate of pvdf membrane with the pvdf pla membranes it was found that the modified membranes required lower temperature to degrade the higher the amount of the pla in the pvdf membrane the lower the temperature required to achieve the same weight loss the results were very significant particularly in the region of 350 450 the main reasons on why modified pvdf membranes to exhibit faster degradation rate are due to the lower amount of pvdf in the resultant membranes and the lower degradation rate of the pla from its ester group that normally occurs at 250 300 29 figs 3 and 4 show the cross section and surface morphologies of all resultant membranes spun at different air gap respectively as can be observed all the membranes exhibited asymmetric structure where there was a very thin skin layer outer surface of fiber supported by either finger like structure or irregular microvoid structure depending on the dope formulation the formation of asymmetric membrane structure is due to the fabrication technique employed in this work i e phase inversion method by increasing the content of pla in the dope formulation from pvdf to pla pvdf 1 it was found that the finger like structure of the pvdf membrane was suppressed causing the formation of large microvoids further increase in the pla content in the dope solution from pla pvdf 1 to pla pvdf 3 showed that the membranes with poor structural integrity composed of irregular voids and spongy like structure were produced this suggested that the existence of high amount of pla in the membrane could result in poor compatibility with pvdf matrix leading to the formation of undesirable membrane structure increasing pla concentration made the cross sectional voids became irregular due to the decrease in the mobility of pla molecules 24 the poor structural integrity is likely to affect membrane mechanical properties chen et al 21 also reported that introducing excessive amount of pla into the pvdf nanofiber mat could affect the structural integrity of the mat which in turn affected its properties particularly mechanical strength the effect of air gap on the membrane morphology was also evaluated increasing air gap tended to form larger membrane pore size table 2 this is due to moisture induced phase inversion which occurs at higher air gap creating bigger pores at the outer surface of membrane before the membrane entered the coagulation bath the longer the membrane takes to reach the coagulation bath the larger the pore size 33 with respect to porosity it can be seen from table 2 that larger membrane pore size would always have higher overall porosity compared to the membranes with smaller pore size fig 5 shows the 3d afm images of the outer surface of hollow fiber membrane with and without pla modification as can be seen variation in the air gap from zero to 8 cm during spinning process has negligible role in affecting membrane surface roughness nevertheless the incorporation of pla had significant impact on the membrane surface roughness the ra value of control pvdf membrane was remarkably reduced when pla was added into dope solution at pla pvdf ratio of 1 the reduced ra value for the pvdf pla 1 membrane can be explained by the good compatibility between pvdf and pla however further increasing pla amount in the dope solution to pla pvdf ratio of 3 had resulted in the formation of rougher surface the results are in good agreement with the sem images figs 3 and 4 that are caused by the poor compatibility between two polymers fig 6 a shows the engineering stress strain curves of hollow fiber membrane with different pla pvdf ratio it is seen that all samples exhibited a typical plastic deformation a yield region and a cold drawing region in comparison to the control pvdf membrane the pla modified pvdf hollow fiber membranes exhibited much lower tensile strength fig 6 b meanwhile compares the percent elongation and young modulus of all membranes from the results it was found that the percent elongation of pvdf membrane was reduced with increasing the quantity of pla in the membrane matrix this suggested that the flexibility of membrane is negatively affected by the presence of pla thus the addition of pla into pvdf membrane should be properly controlled the pvdf pla 3 membrane have the highest young modulus and this could be due to the use of excessive amount of pla that affected the membrane brittleness 26 29 34 3 2 filtration performance fig 7 presents the properties of pvdf and pvdf pla membranes spun at different air gap with respect to pure water flux and ha rejection as can be clearly seen the pure water flux of the pvdf based membranes was reported to increase with increasing the pla amount in the dope solution regardless of air gap however it must be noted that the water flux of membrane spun at higher air gap 8 cm always displayed greater values than those of membranes spun at zero air gap for instance pvdf and pvdf pla 1 membrane exhibited pure water flux of 29 4 and 311 6 l m2 h bar respectively at zero air gap and the performance was increased to 36 3 and 376 7 l m2 h bar respectively at 8 cm air gap the increase in the water flux is mainly due to formation of irregular microvoids coupled with higher membrane porosity at 8 cm air gap see table 2 it is also noted that the water flux of the modified pvdf membranes is dramatically dropped when the pla pvdf ratio in the dope solution exceeds 1 0 this phenomenon could be attributed to the poor structural integrity of these membranes i e irregular mircovoids formation as shown in fig 3 that increases membrane tortuosity leading to increased water transport resistance with respect to water contact angle as shown in fig 8 all the modified membranes exhibited lower contact angle values than that of pure pvdf membrane the modified membranes exhibited the lowest contact angle value when small quantity of pla was introduced owing to the hydrophilic characteristics of pla however the membrane contact angle values were increased in the cases where higher amount of pla was used to modify the membranes the increased contact angle value can be explained by the significant changes on the membrane surface roughness see fig 5 that altered the contact angle due to the cassie wenzel effects 35 with respect to separation efficiency it is found that the ha rejection of all the pla modified pvdf membranes was marginally compromised in comparison to the control pvdf membrane results showed that the control membrane was able to remove 98 99 ha higher rejection in the case of zero air gap from the feed water while the pla modified pvdf membranes could remove ha in the range of 95 97 overall it can be said that the pla modified pvdf membranes outperformed the control pvdf membrane given the significant increment in water flux up to 938 from 36 3 and 376 7 l m2 h bar for 8 cm air gap with slight decrease in ha rejection by considering that the membrane mechanical property is also critical during filtration process the use of membranes made of high pla pvdf ratio 1 0 is not recommended owing to their poor mechanical strength see fig 6 in view of this only pvdf pvdf pla 0 3 and pvdf pla 1 membranes were selected for further investigation to determine membrane anti fouling resistance 3 3 anti fouling performance of membranes fig 9 shows the water flux of membranes as a function of time during 3 steps filtration process even though the control pvdf membranes pvdf a and pvdf b were able to recover 78 89 water flux after bsa solution filtration their water fluxes were still significantly lower compared to the rest of the pvdf pla membranes during pure water flux and bsa water flux determination both pvdf pla 0 3 and pvdf pla 1 membranes demonstrated higher frr of 81 9 93 8 and 85 3 90 9 respectively the findings indicated that pla is not only able to improve membrane water flux but also its frr by enhancing membrane antifouling resistance against bsa fig 10 further compares the antifouling properties of membranes for longer period of filtration time up to 450 min using feed solution containing higher solute concentration 1500 mg l bsa similar to the results shown in fig 9 the pvdf pla 1 membrane demonstrated the highest water flux thus greatest antifouling properties compared to other membranes for the entire filtration period however owing to the presence of higher amount of bsa in the feed solution the water fluxes of all membranes were reduced as a result of higher degree of concentration polarization on the other hand it must be pointed out that the leaching issue of pla from the membrane was negligible as the toc results of all three membrane samples including the control pvdf membrane after 5 days of immersion in pure water showed very similar value i e in the range of 8 06 8 47 ppm the findings indicated the good compatibility of pla with the pvdf membrane 4 conclusions in this work the properties of pvdf membranes for uf filtration process were improved by incorporating biodegradable polymer pla into the membrane matrix the results showed that the incorporation of small quantity of pla with pla pvdf weight ratio of 1 0 could significantly improve membrane water flux from 30 to 376 7 l m2 h bar without compromising ha rejection 95 97 more importantly the pla modified pvdf membranes required remarkably lower temperature to decompose compared to the pure pvdf membrane reducing environmental impacts when they are discarded owing to the improved surface hydrophilicity lower water contact angle the pla modified pvdf membranes in particular pvdf pla 1 also exhibited higher frr than that of pure pvdf membrane indicating the improved antifouling resistance against bsa our work demonstrated that biodegradable pla is potential to be used to modify the characteristics of uf membranes leading to

haloacetic acids haas when nom interacts with chlorine in water 1 direct exposure to the dbps can cause cancers miscarriages and nervous system complications 2 4 therefore effective removal of nom is a significant and challenging research topic in the current development of water purification humic acid ha is the major species in nom and account for 50 90 of the total freshwater organic matters 3 4 scientists always considered ha as a model compound in the studies of water treatment process using membrane based technology 2 4 ultrafiltration uf membrane process receives a wider attention compared to other membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and microfiltration mf due to its good balance between water flux and rejections against colloids macromolecules and suspended particles 5 9 one of the main polymeric materials that is widely used for the commercial uf membranes fabrication is polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf compared to polysulfone psf and polyethersulfone pes pvdf offers greater thermal stability and mechanical property as well as outstanding chemical and oxidation resistance 5 8 10 12 however pvdf is not made of biodegradable material and requires longer time to achieve complete degradation upon dump site disposal 13 in view of this it is a great significance if a novel membrane material is able to be developed using biodegradable polymer biodegradable materials can be broken down by microorganisms producing harmless compounds for nature these kinds of materials have already been widely used in food packaging daily necessities containers and medical instruments 10 13 among the biodegradable materials polylactic acid pla formula c3h4o2 n a polymer produced from natural sources like corn is widely reported in the literature 10 13 statistics from the scopus reveal that there are more than 3000 papers reporting the use of pla for various applications over the past 10 years 2007 2018 pla is possibly degraded in soil compost or human body in a composting environment the pla is hydrolyzed into smaller molecules e g oligomers dimers and monomers after 45 60 days at 50 60 c these smaller molecules are then degraded into co 2 and h 2 o by microorganisms in compost 14 15 incorporation of hydrophilic biopolymer like xanthan gum xa into pes membrane had been previously reported for ha removal the modified pes membrane was reported to exhibit enhanced water permeability 24 8 l m 2 h bar with ha rejection above than 80 16 similar to xa pla which is also a hydrophilic biopolymer has potential to be used for membrane modification previous studies have investigated the potential of using pla and its derivatives for membrane fabrication for instance pla poly lactic acid block poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate pla phema membranes with high pla phema contents exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity water permeability and anti fouling resistance 17 upon addition of 15 wt pla phema the water flux of the resultant membrane was reported to be about 236 l m 2 h bar with bovine serum albumin bsa clearance as low as 0 31 ml min 17 shen et al 18 on the other hand reported that the incorporation of pla based copolymer could improve the hydrophilicity of membrane by decreasing water contact angle from around 80 to 60 leading to enhanced water permeability and greater antifouling properties previous studies have shown that hydrophilic pla could be used to modify the properties of psf nanofiber membrane with respect to pore dimension 19 and oil sorption capacity 20 but using pla as additive for asymmetric uf membrane fabrication has yet to be reported in the literature it must be pointed out that the membranes made of pure pla are not likely to be used for pressure driven process owing to the poor mechanical properties of pla film 16 17 thus pla can only be considered as additive to modify the existing membranes in view of this the main objective of this work is to modify pvdf based hollow fiber membrane using biodegradable pla aiming to produce environmentally friendly membranes with enhanced water flux and antifouling properties for water treatment process the impacts of pla quantity and air gap during spinning process on the properties of resultant membranes will be investigated using analytical instruments and filtration based method the developed pla modified pvdf membrane is aimed to treat water source containing ha and bsa producing water that is good enough for drinking 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercial pvdf kynar 760 mw 440 000 g mol in pellet form purchased from arkema inc philadelphia usa was used as main membrane forming material n methyl pyrrolidone nmp 98 50 used as solvent during polymeric dope solution preparation was obtained from elite advanced material sdn bhd polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp k29 32 mw 58 000 g mol in powder form was obtained from acros organic biodegradable polymer pla in pellet form was kindly supplied by shanghai guanghe biotech co ltd humic acid ha obtained from acros organic and bovine serum albumin bsa mw 66 000 g mol obtained from sigma aldrich were used to prepare feed solution by dissolving respective component in ultrapure water 2 2 hollow fiber membrane fabrication all hollow fiber membranes were prepared via phase inversion method using spinning machine the compositions of dope solutions used for fabricating twelve types of membranes are shown in table 1 prior to dope preparation pvdf and pla pellets were first dried in vacuum oven at 60 overnight to remove moisture afterwards 5 wt of pvp was dissolved in 77 wt nmp under stirring rate of 350 rpm and at temperature of 40 after 30 min mixing the stirring rate and temperature were increased to 550 rpm and 60 respectively the pla at different pla pvdf ratios from 0 3 to 3 was then added into the mixture once pla was completely dissolved pvdf was added slowly into the homogenous solution for all the dope solutions prepared the total weight of polymer was fixed at 23 wt including water soluble pvp at last the solution was subject to 30 min ultrasonication to remove microbubbles before it could be used for membrane fabrication the viscosity of the dope solution was measured at 25 using a basic viscometer model ew 98965 40 cole palmer the measurement was performed by driving a spindle which was immersed in the dope solution through a calibrated spring the viscous drag of the solution against the spindle was then measured by the rotary transducer to yield the results using the solutions prepared the hollow fiber membranes were fabricated at room conditions via spinning technique during spinning process all the parameters were kept constant except the air gap which was adjusted to either 0 cm wet spinning or 8 cm dry jet wet spinning the dope solution was first delivered at dope extrusion rate der of 4 ml min through a spinneret with an orifice diameter inner diameter of 1 3 0 5 mm with the help of a gear pump the bore fluid i e pure water was channelled simultaneously through the inner diameter of spinneret at flow rate of 2 ml min using a constant flow syringe pump coagulation medium used to initiate phase inversion process was tap water at room temperature the spun fibers were then collected at the speed of 8 m min using wind up drum the resultant hollow fiber membranes were then immersed in pure water bath for 24 h to remove remaining solvent at last the membranes were post treated with 10 wt glycerol solution for 24 h to avert the membrane structure from collapsing before being used for characterization 2 3 membrane characterization 2 3 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometry all the resultant hollow fiber membranes were dried in a desiccator for a minimum of 24 h prior to ftir analysis the changes in the functional groups of the membranes upon pla modification were determined using an attenuated total reflectance ftir model nicolet is10 thermo scientific spectrometer the ftir measurements were carried out on diamond plate with the scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 20 21 2 3 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga the thermal properties of the membrane samples were characterized using a thermogravimetric analyser model sdta 851e mettler toledo approximately 20 mg of hollow fiber membranes were used during tga analysis that was carried out under nitrogen gas over a temperature range of 30 600 at a 10 min heating rate thermal degradation profile of hollow fiber membranes was then established 10 23 2 3 3 scanning electron microscopy sem the cross sectional morphologies of pvdf membranes with and without pla modification were examined using sem model tm3000 hitachi for each sample one fiber was fractured in liquid nitrogen to obtain clear and smooth cross section before sticking onto a metal plate using double sided carbon tape for the membrane surface examination a small piece of each sample was mounted on the metal plate horizontally prior to sem analysis all membranes samples were sputter coated with gold to increase surface conductivity and to improve contrast of the images taken 10 24 25 2 3 4 atomic force microscopy afm the membrane surface roughness was examined using afm model nanowizard jpk instruments first the sample was fixed on a glass plate and placed into the holder of an afm 5 0 μm 5 0 μm scan area of the membrane outer surface was acquired with a silicon probe tap300 g all membrane images were analysed and processed with the jpk image processing software associated to the instrument 8 17 22 2 3 5 mechanical strength analysis mechanical strength of hollow fiber membranes was tested using universal testing machine model instron 5567 instron according to astm882 12 the gauge length and gauge running speed were fixed at 50 mm and 2 mm min respectively every membrane sample was tested more than five times and its mechanical property stress strain and young modulus was evaluated with respect to ultimate tensile strength using instron bluehill software 26 2 3 6 hydrophilicty and membrane porosity analysis the membrane surface hydrophilicity was determined using contact angle goniometer model oca 15pro dataphysics 0 5 μ l deionized water was dropped on the outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes using a micro syringe and the contact angle was measured for each membrane sample three strands of fibers were randomly chosen for contact angle measurement at least ten measurements were taken for each strand the average value of contact angle was then reported membrane porosity was measured by cutting a hollow fiber into segments followed by drying in a desiccator for overnight before weighing the overall porosity ε was calculated using the following equation 1 ε 1 m 3 4 π l ρ p o d i d 2 100 where m is mass of the hollow fiber segment ρ p is blend of pvdf and pla polymer density of hollow fiber membrane l od and id were the length outer and inner diameters of the hollow fiber membranes respectively 20 27 the mean pore radius of membrane r was determined using guerout elford ferry equation as expressed in eq 2 7 2 r 2 9 1 75ε 8 nl q ε a δp where n is the water viscosity at 25 c l is the membrane thickness m q is the volume of permeate water per unit time m 3 s a is the effective area of membrane m 2 and δp is the operating pressure pa membrane pore size diameter could be obtained by multiplying r by 2 2 4 membrane performance evaluation to evaluate membrane performance cross flow filtration system with a feed flow rate of 1 l min was used prior to any measurement each membrane potted in module was first compacted at 1 5 bar using pure water for 30 min this is to ensure membrane achieved steady flux conditions prior to any measurement filtration experiment was then carried out at 1 bar gauge and the membrane pure water flux j w 1 was calculated using eq 3 3 j w 1 v a δ t where v l is the volume of permeate a m 2 is the effective area of the hollow fiber membrane and t h is the filtration time to collect v volume the filtration experiment was continued by replacing the pure water with 1000 mg l ha solution and the membrane was tested under the same operating conditions as in the pure water permeation test the ha rejection r was calculated using eq 4 4 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p and c f are the ha concentration mg l of the permeate and feed respectively the ha concentrations in the permeate and feed samples were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach with absorbance measured at 283 nm where the maximum absorption occurs the membrane flux recovery rate frr was also studied to compare antifouling properties of modified membranes against foulants deposition this experiment was started with pure water flux j w 1 evaluation followed by filtration of feed solution containing 1000 mg l bsa both filtration processes were performed under the same operating conditions after 2 h of the uf experiment with bsa the feed solution tank was refilled with pure water again and the membrane was cleaned by letting the ultrapure water flow for 30 min under the same condition as pure water permeation test then the pure water flux j w 2 was re measured to obtain r fr as expressed in eq 5 5 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 the rejection of membranes against bsa was also measured using eq 3 and the bsa concentrations in permeate and feed samples were determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer model dr5000 hach with absorbance measured at 280 nm where the maximum absorption occurs extended protein flux profile was studied by starting with pure water flux for 30 min followed by feed solution with higher bsa concentration 1500 mg l for 2 h this procedure was repeated for three times with washing membrane with ultrapure water about 30 min after 2 h with bsa solution to study the leaching of pla from the membrane 1 g of the resultant membrane was cut into small pieces and immersed in 100 ml ultrapure water under vigorous magnetic stirring the solution was continuously stirred for 5 days before it was collected for total organic carbon toc analysis using toc analyser model toc lcpn shimadzu to determine the possible pla leaching from the membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of hollow fiber membranes fig 1 compares the ftir spectra of pvdf membranes modified with and without pla as changing air gap during spinning process would not affect the surface chemistry of the membrane only the results of the membranes spun at 8 cm air gap were shown as can be clearly seen all the pla modified pvdf membranes exhibited additional absorption band at 1760 cm 1 in comparison to the pure pvdf membrane the presence of this band is originated from the carbonyl strecth of pla ester 19 20 28 the signal was found to increase with increasing the quantity of the pla in the membrane matrix suggesting the resultant membranes contained increasing amount of secondary polymer other important bands that were detected in these membranes could be attributed to the pvdf material for instance peak at 3025 cm 1 is assigned to c f stretching of pvdf 30 peaks at 1400 and 1177 cm 1 meanwhile are corresponded to the stretching and deformation vibration of ch 2 and cf 2 group of pvdf respectively 22 peak at 1664 cm 1 is assigned to the cc adsorption of pvdf 22 β phase of pvdf is visible at 840 cm 1 21 the vibrations bands at 1170 cm 1 and 1204 cm 1 are due to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching of cf 2 respectively 31 even though pure pla dope solution was also prepared in this work it was not able to be used for membrane fabrication mainly because of the following reasons the first reason is the extremely low viscosity 449 cp of this solution compared to other solutions making its almost impossible to form hollow fiber membrane second reason is that pla dissolves quickly in water owing to its high degree of hydrophilicity the degradation of membranes spun at 8 cm air gap was also investigated and their respective tga profile is presented in fig 2 for the control pvdf membrane there were two stages of thermal degradation the first stage is the degradation of carbonyl bond cleavage that took place between carbon and nitrogen atoms nc o from the remaining pvp present in the membrane matrix at temperature 350 23 the second stage meanwhile was the degradation of main membrane forming material pvdf at temperature between 350 and 480 32 comparing the degradation rate of pvdf membrane with the pvdf pla membranes it was found that the modified membranes required lower temperature to degrade the higher the amount of the pla in the pvdf membrane the lower the temperature required to achieve the same weight loss the results were very significant particularly in the region of 350 450 the main reasons on why modified pvdf membranes to exhibit faster degradation rate are due to the lower amount of pvdf in the resultant membranes and the lower degradation rate of the pla from its ester group that normally occurs at 250 300 29 figs 3 and 4 show the cross section and surface morphologies of all resultant membranes spun at different air gap respectively as can be observed all the membranes exhibited asymmetric structure where there was a very thin skin layer outer surface of fiber supported by either finger like structure or irregular microvoid structure depending on the dope formulation the formation of asymmetric membrane structure is due to the fabrication technique employed in this work i e phase inversion method by increasing the content of pla in the dope formulation from pvdf to pla pvdf 1 it was found that the finger like structure of the pvdf membrane was suppressed causing the formation of large microvoids further increase in the pla content in the dope solution from pla pvdf 1 to pla pvdf 3 showed that the membranes with poor structural integrity composed of irregular voids and spongy like structure were produced this suggested that the existence of high amount of pla in the membrane could result in poor compatibility with pvdf matrix leading to the formation of undesirable membrane structure increasing pla concentration made the cross sectional voids became irregular due to the decrease in the mobility of pla molecules 24 the poor structural integrity is likely to affect membrane mechanical properties chen et al 21 also reported that introducing excessive amount of pla into the pvdf nanofiber mat could affect the structural integrity of the mat which in turn affected its properties particularly mechanical strength the effect of air gap on the membrane morphology was also evaluated increasing air gap tended to form larger membrane pore size table 2 this is due to moisture induced phase inversion which occurs at higher air gap creating bigger pores at the outer surface of membrane before the membrane entered the coagulation bath the longer the membrane takes to reach the coagulation bath the larger the pore size 33 with respect to porosity it can be seen from table 2 that larger membrane pore size would always have higher overall porosity compared to the membranes with smaller pore size fig 5 shows the 3d afm images of the outer surface of hollow fiber membrane with and without pla modification as can be seen variation in the air gap from zero to 8 cm during spinning process has negligible role in affecting membrane surface roughness nevertheless the incorporation of pla had significant impact on the membrane surface roughness the ra value of control pvdf membrane was remarkably reduced when pla was added into dope solution at pla pvdf ratio of 1 the reduced ra value for the pvdf pla 1 membrane can be explained by the good compatibility between pvdf and pla however further increasing pla amount in the dope solution to pla pvdf ratio of 3 had resulted in the formation of rougher surface the results are in good agreement with the sem images figs 3 and 4 that are caused by the poor compatibility between two polymers fig 6 a shows the engineering stress strain curves of hollow fiber membrane with different pla pvdf ratio it is seen that all samples exhibited a typical plastic deformation a yield region and a cold drawing region in comparison to the control pvdf membrane the pla modified pvdf hollow fiber membranes exhibited much lower tensile strength fig 6 b meanwhile compares the percent elongation and young modulus of all membranes from the results it was found that the percent elongation of pvdf membrane was reduced with increasing the quantity of pla in the membrane matrix this suggested that the flexibility of membrane is negatively affected by the presence of pla thus the addition of pla into pvdf membrane should be properly controlled the pvdf pla 3 membrane have the highest young modulus and this could be due to the use of excessive amount of pla that affected the membrane brittleness 26 29 34 3 2 filtration performance fig 7 presents the properties of pvdf and pvdf pla membranes spun at different air gap with respect to pure water flux and ha rejection as can be clearly seen the pure water flux of the pvdf based membranes was reported to increase with increasing the pla amount in the dope solution regardless of air gap however it must be noted that the water flux of membrane spun at higher air gap 8 cm always displayed greater values than those of membranes spun at zero air gap for instance pvdf and pvdf pla 1 membrane exhibited pure water flux of 29 4 and 311 6 l m2 h bar respectively at zero air gap and the performance was increased to 36 3 and 376 7 l m2 h bar respectively at 8 cm air gap the increase in the water flux is mainly due to formation of irregular microvoids coupled with higher membrane porosity at 8 cm air gap see table 2 it is also noted that the water flux of the modified pvdf membranes is dramatically dropped when the pla pvdf ratio in the dope solution exceeds 1 0 this phenomenon could be attributed to the poor structural integrity of these membranes i e irregular mircovoids formation as shown in fig 3 that increases membrane tortuosity leading to increased water transport resistance with respect to water contact angle as shown in fig 8 all the modified membranes exhibited lower contact angle values than that of pure pvdf membrane the modified membranes exhibited the lowest contact angle value when small quantity of pla was introduced owing to the hydrophilic characteristics of pla however the membrane contact angle values were increased in the cases where higher amount of pla was used to modify the membranes the increased contact angle value can be explained by the significant changes on the membrane surface roughness see fig 5 that altered the contact angle due to the cassie wenzel effects 35 with respect to separation efficiency it is found that the ha rejection of all the pla modified pvdf membranes was marginally compromised in comparison to the control pvdf membrane results showed that the control membrane was able to remove 98 99 ha higher rejection in the case of zero air gap from the feed water while the pla modified pvdf membranes could remove ha in the range of 95 97 overall it can be said that the pla modified pvdf membranes outperformed the control pvdf membrane given the significant increment in water flux up to 938 from 36 3 and 376 7 l m2 h bar for 8 cm air gap with slight decrease in ha rejection by considering that the membrane mechanical property is also critical during filtration process the use of membranes made of high pla pvdf ratio 1 0 is not recommended owing to their poor mechanical strength see fig 6 in view of this only pvdf pvdf pla 0 3 and pvdf pla 1 membranes were selected for further investigation to determine membrane anti fouling resistance 3 3 anti fouling performance of membranes fig 9 shows the water flux of membranes as a function of time during 3 steps filtration process even though the control pvdf membranes pvdf a and pvdf b were able to recover 78 89 water flux after bsa solution filtration their water fluxes were still significantly lower compared to the rest of the pvdf pla membranes during pure water flux and bsa water flux determination both pvdf pla 0 3 and pvdf pla 1 membranes demonstrated higher frr of 81 9 93 8 and 85 3 90 9 respectively the findings indicated that pla is not only able to improve membrane water flux but also its frr by enhancing membrane antifouling resistance against bsa fig 10 further compares the antifouling properties of membranes for longer period of filtration time up to 450 min using feed solution containing higher solute concentration 1500 mg l bsa similar to the results shown in fig 9 the pvdf pla 1 membrane demonstrated the highest water flux thus greatest antifouling properties compared to other membranes for the entire filtration period however owing to the presence of higher amount of bsa in the feed solution the water fluxes of all membranes were reduced as a result of higher degree of concentration polarization on the other hand it must be pointed out that the leaching issue of pla from the membrane was negligible as the toc results of all three membrane samples including the control pvdf membrane after 5 days of immersion in pure water showed very similar value i e in the range of 8 06 8 47 ppm the findings indicated the good compatibility of pla with the pvdf membrane 4 conclusions in this work the properties of pvdf membranes for uf filtration process were improved by incorporating biodegradable polymer pla into the membrane matrix the results showed that the incorporation of small quantity of pla with pla pvdf weight ratio of 1 0 could significantly improve membrane water flux from 30 to 376 7 l m2 h bar without compromising ha rejection 95 97 more importantly the pla modified pvdf membranes required remarkably lower temperature to decompose compared to the pure pvdf membrane reducing environmental impacts when they are discarded owing to the improved surface hydrophilicity lower water contact angle the pla modified pvdf membranes in particular pvdf pla 1 also exhibited higher frr than that of pure pvdf membrane indicating the improved antifouling resistance against bsa our work demonstrated that biodegradable pla is potential to be used to modify the characteristics of uf membranes leading to

14228,saline groundwater is presently used when feasible for hydraulic fracturing operations of unconventional shale resources in certain geographies the saline groundwater possesses high boron concentration which is incompatible with the field fracking chemicals hence a low boron concentration is desired the present investigation evaluated a novel chelating ion exchange resin that has potential to remove boron at neutral ph bench scale isotherm experiments at various ph revealed negligible difference in removal efficiency between ph 7 and 10 experiments conducted at 25 c and 70 c showed higher sorption of boron removal at lower temperature flow through bench column test using deep well saline groundwater 25 mg l boron and 2 5 tds from south texas showed boron effluent concentration of 0 1 mg l and a resin capacity of 5 0 mg g experimental data from pilot study using same saline groundwater showed the resin was very effective in removing boron to low concentrations 0 5 mg l the resin capacity was in the range of 4 4 to 3 1 mg g operated under different flowrates which agreed with thomas model predicted capacity of 3 8 mg g the resin was successfully regenerated multiple times by using 7 hcl and 4 naoh solutions consecutively overall the study elucidated that this emerging resin can be applied for large scale applications for selective boron removal from saline groundwater sources keywords boron ion exchange resin isotherm pilot investigation 1 introduction boron is an inorganic ion found mostly in soil rocks seawater and groundwater boron behaves as a lewis acid and exists primarily as undissociated boric acid at lower ph or borate ions at higher ph b o h 3 o h b o h 4 the boric acid pka value is 8 60 and 9 24 for seawater and fresh water 1 the nonionic form of boron boric acid yields a very stable molecule which is difficult to selectively remove from water stream in seawater groundwater the boron level is around 0 5 9 6 mg l 1 and 0 3 100 mg l respectively 2 the boron specification for potable agriculture and municipal effluent applications varies for different regions with environmental protection agency epa and world health organization who specification for potable water is 0 6 and 0 5 ppm respectively the limit for eu and singapore is 1 0 ppm while uae australia and canada are 1 5 ppm 6 in spite of the new guidelines water treatment services keep their boron level at 0 5 ppm for agricultural applications 2 3 in shale play hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling were considered as new frontier technological developments for producing oil gas from vast hydrocarbon resources of united states 4 5 hydraulic fracturing is usually carried out by pumping water and sand to create small fractures to stimulate oil gas production from the wells one research found that water volumes for hydraulic fracturing averaged in united states ranges roughly from 2600 gallons to 9 7 million gallons per well 6 water supply concerns to meet hydraulic fracturing demand can be severe in drought region 7 hypersaline groundwater can be utilized for well completion in water scarce region similarly produced water reuse for hydraulic fracturing purposes has been increasing in the permian basin and other shale plays 7 both produced and groundwater can contain high boron concentration 100 ppm which can lead to compatibility issues especially when guar borate type fluid was used 8 the most common high ph guar borate fluid uses borate salt as cross linking agent to increase fluid viscosity the free boron present in produced water or hypersaline groundwater can cause pre mature crosslinking resulting in fluid pumping issues zirconium is an alternative cross linking agent that can be used to prevent premature crosslinking issues however it is more expensive more recently many operators have switched to slick water fluid where a salt tolerant friction reducer is added to reduce fluid pumping pressure however this type of fluid is not universally applicable to all formation types even though it is boron tolerant therefore boron removal from hyper saline groundwater or produced water is needed for use with guar borate cross link fluid in hydraulic fracturing higher boron concentration in the range of 5 95 mg l and 50 60 mg l were observed in conventional oil and gas field produced water respectively 9 similarly produced water from coal seam gas csg can contain elevated levels of boron the csg industry is mature in the us and is rapidly developing in queensland region of australia 10 the csg produced water varies in organic moieties salinity and total dissolved solids in comparison to other conventional produced water resources in surat basin comprising 150 wells from 3 fields showed a boron levels 1 mg l 11 geochemical records from 3000 cbm wells in rocky region showed an average boron concentrations of three basins were 1 15 mg l 0 17 mg l and 1 30 mg l 12 the boron concentration in the maramaura csg basin of new zealand is 2 4 mg l 13 they must be further treated for regulatory requirements prior to surface discharge or irrigation requirements in the middle east two pass seawater reverse osmosis swro technology is widely used for seawater desalination 3 14 15 achieving 0 5 mg l of boron in the single pass ro is challenging as boron exists in uncharged boric acid form at 25 c the first pass ro permeate ph is increased above the pka value of boric acid to convert a majority fraction of boron to borate anion due to the negative membrane charge the second pass ro membrane removes borate anion greater than 90 95 16 the two pass configuration increases the size of the first pass ro along with upsizing of any upstream pre treatment equipment therefore the second pass for targeted removal of boron increases capital and operational costs along with increasing the energy requirement for desalinating the water 3 17 ion exchange ix is an alternative technology to the second pass ro membrane for the targeted removal of boron various separation technologies are applied for the boron removal which includes adsorption 16 reverse osmosis ro 18 21 bipolar membrane electrodialysis 22 ion exchange 23 27 electrocoagulation 28 donnan dialysis 29 and chemical coagulation 30 31 various adsorbents include activated carbon natural minerals biological substances oxides silica nanomaterials mixed matrix membranes and selective ion exchange resins 32 34 are also effective in removing boron electrocoagulation process produces hydroxide flocs aluminum hydroxide as coagulants by chemical reaction by solubilization of anode material the process consumed higher concentration 1100 mg l of aluminum is not feasible for large scale application and achieved 60 boron removal for feed boron concentration of 126 mg l 35 chemical coagulation using alum ferric chloride polyvinyl alcohol lime magnesium oxide magnesium chloride and double layered hydroxide dlh compounds can also be applied for removing boron from wastewater 36 37 boron is usually removed by using anion exchange resin wherein ph is raised around 10 34 to convert boric acid to borate fig 1 the increase in ph also cause hardness ions to precipitate therefore anion exchange resins often require softening pre treatment recently a particular vendor has developed a resin to allow boron removal while it is in the acidic form b oh 3 38 the present investigation evaluated novel ion exchange chelating resins for the boron removal from a hypersaline groundwater at neutral ph the resin can also be applied for other boron containing water streams such as seawater and wastewater the chelating resins possess hydroxyl groups as ligands that has high attraction to boron and does not interact with other inorganic moieties the hydroxyl groups can form different esters with boric acid and dissociate rapidly by releasing protons to form borate complex 2 the objective of this investigation is to assess the performance of novel resin on high salinity groundwater from a deep aquifer in south texas various isotherm tests were conducted in bench scale to assess the resin capacity at different temperatures and ph the experimental data for the batch studies were validated using langmuir isotherm boron removal efficiency was assessed in a flow through small scale column test the resin performance was investigated at pilot scale with increasing hydraulic loading and the results were validated with thomas model 40 the resin regeneration efficiency and chemical consumption requirements were also estimated 2 material methods 2 1 bench scale setup before starting the experiments the resins were regenerated by 5 hydrochloric acid and 5 sodium hydroxide followed by rinsing with di water the resins were dried overnight using vacuum oven kept at 25 c to evaluate the capacity the experiments were carried out in jar tester the boron removal was evaluated as a function of time 4 g of resin was added to 1 l of di water containing 30 mg l boron the solution was slowly stirred at ambient temperature 25 c the boron was added in dissolved form from stock solution 1000 mg l of boron prepared from boric acid 5 7 g in 1000 ml samples 5 ml was taken at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 5 2 4 6 and 24 h and filtered through 0 45 μm filter the experiment was also repeated at 70 c to evaluate the resin performance at higher temperature the solution was kept at the desired temperature using a hot plate with an external temperature probe both experiments were carried out at neutral ph 7 isotherm experiments at different ph values 7 and 10 were conducted by adding different amount of resin 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 g to 100 ml of a synthetic solution containing 30 mg l boron the ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide the samples were slowly stirred for 24 h and then filtered through 0 45 μm filter to remove the resin and analyzed for boron the feed used in the flow through column experiment was brackish groundwater from a 5000 ft deep well in south texas the feed and effluent solutions were analyzed by various analytical methods the cations such as sodium magnesium calcium and boron were analyzed by inductive coupled plasma technique with axial mode using thermo icap 6500 analytical instrument the alkalinity was analyzed based on potentiometric titration using auto titrator titrando 858 metrohm the ph of the sample was measured by orion 3 star ph meter the groundwater quality is shown in table 1 to evaluate the breakthrough capacity of the resin a flow through column was designed in which 12 g of resins was packed inside a ½ od pfa tube the resin properties provided by the vendor is given in table 2 table 3 shows details about the test conditions in the flow through column an hplc isocratic pump dionex ics 900 was used to pump the feed through the column the effluent was fractionated for every 12 5 ml using an autosampler the entire process was programmed using labview software fig 2 shows a picture of the experimental set up 2 2 pilot scale setup the pilot scale unit was shown in fig 3 consists of a single vessel 0 76 m in diameter and 1 22 m height of volume 0 283 m3 of ion exchange resin the capacity of the pilot unit is 350 bbl d the influent ground water characteristics of the unit is given in table 1 the pilot system was designed for a feed flow rate of 37 85 l min with 8 bv hr but capable to operate at a wider range flow through an ion exchange system is specified in terms of bed volumes per hour which is a measure of time available for the resin to react with the feed water at a given flow rate since the resin volume is constant higher flow rates would result in higher bed volumes per hour bv h and lower reaction contact times higher bv h results in smaller foot print but can cause short circuiting of flow within the bed and subsequent leakage of boron in the effluent for full scale operations 15 40 bv hr are used for demineralizing polishing and ro applications 41 3 results discussion the ix resin used in this investigation is a chelating resin tailored for boron removal the resin has 5 hydroxyl oh groups which can form complexes with boron by exchanging 2 active sites as shown in fig 4 23 42 this was considered in meq calculation 3 1 bench scale investigation 3 1 1 resin performance at 25 c and 70 c fig 5 shows the percent removal of boron at two different temperatures 25 c and 70 c after 24 h the percent removal was 80 at 25 c and 62 at 70 c respectively it was observed that boron sorption was fast for initial few hours as shown in fig 5 a contact time of 4 h is adequate to achieve 68 boron removal at room temperature experimental results showed higher sorption of boron removal at lower temperature 6 5 mg g vs 4 9 mg g the differences in removal capacities as a function of temperature was only evident for the longer equilibration period 3 1 2 resin performance as function of ph isotherm test isotherm test were conducted at different ph values 7 10 the removal efficiency at ph 7 and ph 10 at higher resin concentration 600 mg l are 91 and 94 respectively as shown in fig 6 there is negligible difference in boron removal efficiencies between ph 7 and 10 which confirms that caustic addition is not needed for this resin the ph dependence of boron uptake by the resin is attributed to the dissociation process of h3bo3 in aqueous solutions with bidentate formation of borate ions the resin s oh groups have slightly higher attraction for b oh 4 ions in comparison with b oh 3 species fig 7 shows the capacity changes in mg g eq l with boron effluent concentration in solution at various ph values langmuir isotherm 44 was used to fit the experimental data as shown in fig 8 the linearized form of the isotherm is given below c a q a 1 b a q m c a q m where qa rate capacity mg of boron adsorbed g of resin ca equilibrium concentration of

fig 8 for the effluent boron concentration at 25 mg l 3 1 3 flow through bench top column experiments the groundwater sample from a deep well was passed through a column packed of the resin the experiment was carried out at room temperature results showed that boron level was below detection dl 0 1 mg l for the first 65 bed volumes after 82 bed volumes the boron concentration in the effluent

was 6 mg g 0 78 eq l of resin the experimental data was fitted with thomas kinetic model fig 9 the model can predict the performance and augment in design the full scale system the model assumes langmuir kinetics of sorption with no axial dispersion the breakthrough curve shape and time were important parameters to design the ion exchange column for full scale operation the thomas model 40

depends on the target effluent concentration fig 10 shows the resin capacity as a function of the boron effluent concentration the resin capacity was calculated based on the amount of boron retained in the column by considering the volume and resin mass 3 2 pilot scale investigation the design flow was kept at 37 85 l min 8 bv h evaluated over a total of seven service runs 3 runs at pilot s design boron loading rate of 8 bv h and one run each at different loading rates of 10 12 14 and 16 bv h the resin was regenerated after each run using 7 hcl and 4 naoh solutions with an objective to regenerate resin after each cycle the influent and effluent concentration showed the cations and anions concentration in the groundwater ref table 1 remain constant fig 11 shows the boron breakthrough curves for the resin at different test flow rates the run time for the breakthrough decreased from 126 to 104 bed volumes when the flow rate was increased from 38 to 76 l min 8 to 16 bv h the resin was very selective in removing boron as the influent and effluent concentrations of other ions did not change substantially during the treatment as shown in table 4 the measured capacity of the resin decreased by 30 from 4 4 to 3 1 mg boron g resin when the flow rate was doubled from 38 to 76 l min 8 to 16 bv h it should be noted that the measured capacity of the resin was either close to or higher than that claimed by the vendor s operational capacity 3 6 mg boron g resin for flow rates of up to 14 bv h the experimental data from pilot plant obtained from last trial was validated using thomas model rate constant 0 279 ml min mg and capacity 5 5 mg g obtained from bench scale flow through column test the rate constant and capacity were used as input parameter to predict the breakthrough boron effluent concentration of the pilot unit the thomas model predicted the experimental data as shown in fig 12 higher flow rates larger mass of resins channeling and changes in hydrodynamic conditions in the pilot unit may have significant impact in prediction with experimental data the predicted capacity by thomas model was 3 8 mg g which is consistent with the measured capacity as shown in table 4 3 2 1 resin regeneration profiles and chemical consumption the resin was regenerated after each test run with an intent to recover the resin capacity to remove boron as shown in fig 13 majority of the boron was released from the resin when a 7 hcl solution was injected in the resin to disrupt the boron resin complex and release boron in the solution the resin is converted back to its neutral active state with 4 naoh solution the regeneration cycle lasted for 4 5 h during which approximately 473 l 1 7 bv of 7 hcl solution and 510 l 1 8 bv of 4 naoh solution was utilized each time when the resin was regenerated the outlet boron concentration was below detectable level which confirmed that resin regeneration method was effective 4 conclusion bench scale experiments conducted at 25 and 70 c showed higher sorption of boron removal at lower temperature 6 5 mg g vs 4 9 mg g isotherm test at different ph values revealed negligible difference in boron removal efficiencies between ph 7 and 10 which confirms that caustic addition is not needed for this resin langmuir isotherm was used to fit the experimental data and the maximum adsorbent phase concentration of boron qm were found as 6 94 and 8 91 mg g for ph 7 and 10 test conditions flow through column test was carried out using real groundwater and results showed boron concentration was 0 1 mg l for the first 65 bed volumes with capacity of 5 0 mg g the resin got saturated after 135 bed volumes with corresponding capacity of 6 mg g 0 78 eq l the column was regenerated multiple times

14228,saline groundwater is presently used when feasible for hydraulic fracturing operations of unconventional shale resources in certain geographies the saline groundwater possesses high boron concentration which is incompatible with the field fracking chemicals hence a low boron concentration is desired the present investigation evaluated a novel chelating ion exchange resin that has potential to remove boron at neutral ph bench scale isotherm experiments at various ph revealed negligible difference in removal efficiency between ph 7 and 10 experiments conducted at 25 c and 70 c showed higher sorption of boron removal at lower temperature flow through bench column test using deep well saline groundwater 25 mg l boron and 2 5 tds from south texas showed boron effluent concentration of 0 1 mg l and a resin capacity of 5 0 mg g experimental data from pilot study using same saline groundwater showed the resin was very effective in removing boron to low concentrations 0 5 mg l the resin capacity was in the range of 4 4 to 3 1 mg g operated under different flowrates which agreed with thomas model predicted capacity of 3 8 mg g the resin was successfully regenerated multiple times by using 7 hcl and 4 naoh solutions consecutively overall the study elucidated that this emerging resin can be applied for large scale applications for selective boron removal from saline groundwater sources keywords boron ion exchange resin isotherm pilot investigation 1 introduction boron is an inorganic ion found mostly in soil rocks seawater and groundwater boron behaves as a lewis acid and exists primarily as undissociated boric acid at lower ph or borate ions at higher ph b o h 3 o h b o h 4 the boric acid pka value is 8 60 and 9 24 for seawater and fresh water 1 the nonionic form of boron boric acid yields a very stable molecule which is difficult to selectively remove from water stream in seawater groundwater the boron level is around 0 5 9 6 mg l 1 and 0 3 100 mg l respectively 2 the boron specification for potable agriculture and municipal effluent applications varies for different regions with environmental protection agency epa and world health organization who specification for potable water is 0 6 and 0 5 ppm respectively the limit for eu and singapore is 1 0 ppm while uae australia and canada are 1 5 ppm 6 in spite of the new guidelines water treatment services keep their boron level at 0 5 ppm for agricultural applications 2 3 in shale play hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling were considered as new frontier technological developments for producing oil gas from vast hydrocarbon resources of united states 4 5 hydraulic fracturing is usually carried out by pumping water and sand to create small fractures to stimulate oil gas production from the wells one research found that water volumes for hydraulic fracturing averaged in united states ranges roughly from 2600 gallons to 9 7 million gallons per well 6 water supply concerns to meet hydraulic fracturing demand can be severe in drought region 7 hypersaline groundwater can be utilized for well completion in water scarce region similarly produced water reuse for hydraulic fracturing purposes has been increasing in the permian basin and other shale plays 7 both produced and groundwater can contain high boron concentration 100 ppm which can lead to compatibility issues especially when guar borate type fluid was used 8 the most common high ph guar borate fluid uses borate salt as cross linking agent to increase fluid viscosity the free boron present in produced water or hypersaline groundwater can cause pre mature crosslinking resulting in fluid pumping issues zirconium is an alternative cross linking agent that can be used to prevent premature crosslinking issues however it is more expensive more recently many operators have switched to slick water fluid where a salt tolerant friction reducer is added to reduce fluid pumping pressure however this type of fluid is not universally applicable to all formation types even though it is boron tolerant therefore boron removal from hyper saline groundwater or produced water is needed for use with guar borate cross link fluid in hydraulic fracturing higher boron concentration in the range of 5 95 mg l and 50 60 mg l were observed in conventional oil and gas field produced water respectively 9 similarly produced water from coal seam gas csg can contain elevated levels of boron the csg industry is mature in the us and is rapidly developing in queensland region of australia 10 the csg produced water varies in organic moieties salinity and total dissolved solids in comparison to other conventional produced water resources in surat basin comprising 150 wells from 3 fields showed a boron levels 1 mg l 11 geochemical records from 3000 cbm wells in rocky region showed an average boron concentrations of three basins were 1 15 mg l 0 17 mg l and 1 30 mg l 12 the boron concentration in the maramaura csg basin of new zealand is 2 4 mg l 13 they must be further treated for regulatory requirements prior to surface discharge or irrigation requirements in the middle east two pass seawater reverse osmosis swro technology is widely used for seawater desalination 3 14 15 achieving 0 5 mg l of boron in the single pass ro is challenging as boron exists in uncharged boric acid form at 25 c the first pass ro permeate ph is increased above the pka value of boric acid to convert a majority fraction of boron to borate anion due to the negative membrane charge the second pass ro membrane removes borate anion greater than 90 95 16 the two pass configuration increases the size of the first pass ro along with upsizing of any upstream pre treatment equipment therefore the second pass for targeted removal of boron increases capital and operational costs along with increasing the energy requirement for desalinating the water 3 17 ion exchange ix is an alternative technology to the second pass ro membrane for the targeted removal of boron various separation technologies are applied for the boron removal which includes adsorption 16 reverse osmosis ro 18 21 bipolar membrane electrodialysis 22 ion exchange 23 27 electrocoagulation 28 donnan dialysis 29 and chemical coagulation 30 31 various adsorbents include activated carbon natural minerals biological substances oxides silica nanomaterials mixed matrix membranes and selective ion exchange resins 32 34 are also effective in removing boron electrocoagulation process produces hydroxide flocs aluminum hydroxide as coagulants by chemical reaction by solubilization of anode material the process consumed higher concentration 1100 mg l of aluminum is not feasible for large scale application and achieved 60 boron removal for feed boron concentration of 126 mg l 35 chemical coagulation using alum ferric chloride polyvinyl alcohol lime magnesium oxide magnesium chloride and double layered hydroxide dlh compounds can also be applied for removing boron from wastewater 36 37 boron is usually removed by using anion exchange resin wherein ph is raised around 10 34 to convert boric acid to borate fig 1 the increase in ph also cause hardness ions to precipitate therefore anion exchange resins often require softening pre treatment recently a particular vendor has developed a resin to allow boron removal while it is in the acidic form b oh 3 38 the present investigation evaluated novel ion exchange chelating resins for the boron removal from a hypersaline groundwater at neutral ph the resin can also be applied for other boron containing water streams such as seawater and wastewater the chelating resins possess hydroxyl groups as ligands that has high attraction to boron and does not interact with other inorganic moieties the hydroxyl groups can form different esters with boric acid and dissociate rapidly by releasing protons to form borate complex 2 the objective of this investigation is to assess the performance of novel resin on high salinity groundwater from a deep aquifer in south texas various isotherm tests were conducted in bench scale to assess the resin capacity at different temperatures and ph the experimental data for the batch studies were validated using langmuir isotherm boron removal efficiency was assessed in a flow through small scale column test the resin performance was investigated at pilot scale with increasing hydraulic loading and the results were validated with thomas model 40 the resin regeneration efficiency and chemical consumption requirements were also estimated 2 material methods 2 1 bench scale setup before starting the experiments the resins were regenerated by 5 hydrochloric acid and 5 sodium hydroxide followed by rinsing with di water the resins were dried overnight using vacuum oven kept at 25 c to evaluate the capacity the experiments were carried out in jar tester the boron removal was evaluated as a function of time 4 g of resin was added to 1 l of di water containing 30 mg l boron the solution was slowly stirred at ambient temperature 25 c the boron was added in dissolved form from stock solution 1000 mg l of boron prepared from boric acid 5 7 g in 1000 ml samples 5 ml was taken at 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 1 5 2 4 6 and 24 h and filtered through 0 45 μm filter the experiment was also repeated at 70 c to evaluate the resin performance at higher temperature the solution was kept at the desired temperature using a hot plate with an external temperature probe both experiments were carried out at neutral ph 7 isotherm experiments at different ph values 7 and 10 were conducted by adding different amount of resin 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 g to 100 ml of a synthetic solution containing 30 mg l boron the ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide the samples were slowly stirred for 24 h and then filtered through 0 45 μm filter to remove the resin and analyzed for boron the feed used in the flow through column experiment was brackish groundwater from a 5000 ft deep well in south texas the feed and effluent solutions were analyzed by various analytical methods the cations such as sodium magnesium calcium and boron were analyzed by inductive coupled plasma technique with axial mode using thermo icap 6500 analytical instrument the alkalinity was analyzed based on potentiometric titration using auto titrator titrando 858 metrohm the ph of the sample was measured by orion 3 star ph meter the groundwater quality is shown in table 1 to evaluate the breakthrough

14229,dyes are priority pollutants commonly found at significant concentrations in textile effluents the presence of dyes stuffs in wastewater can cause severe problems to aquatic life and human beings therefore the removal of dyes from wastewater is important in order to minimize their hazardous effects on the environment one way of removing dyes is to use nanosized manganese oxides mnos to date there has been much work reported on the use of nanosized mnos as sorbents for dyestuffs they are promising sorbents for commercial use due to their amorphous nature high specific surface areas ssa mesoporous structure and low to the moderate point of zero charge phpzc this review summarizes the toxicity and recent advances for removing dyes from wastewater using nanosized mno sorbents the article also describes the various experimental parameters necessary for adsorption optimization such as adsorption time ph initial dye concentration amount of sorbent and temperature adsorption mechanisms investigated by various modeling approaches are also discussed in particular it was observed that much work has been reported on the use of birnessite and its composites for dye removal there are many papers reporting on the use of mno in batch mode dye removal but very few that report on the use of mno in continuous column removal systems therefore there is still a considerable need for further research to develop effective and economical large scale mno column systems for commercial use keywords dye removal nano manganese oxide sorbents optimization adsorption wastewater 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious problem in an era of rapid population growth climate change urbanization and industrialization the main groups of environmental pollutants commonly encountered are metal ions metalloids anions organic dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides natural organic matters and aromatic compounds 1 the enormous use of dyes in many industries such as paint textile tannery paper leather rubber cosmetics and plastics has resulted in the release of large amounts of colored toxic effluent and contaminated surface groundwater 2 3 about 10 000 types of commercial dyes are commonly used with around 7 105 tonnes of dyestuffs produced annually 4 around 2 of them are released in effluents 4 these dyestuffs also have a wide range of physical chemical and toxicological properties 5 responsible disposal of these dyes is a big challenge with more effective economically dye effluent treatment processes required to be developed this task is challenging as the dye concentrations in effluent water need to be very low before releasing into the environment dyestuffs are susceptible to heat chemical reagent and have the capability to generate mutagens and cancer the dyes present in water effect different aquatic lives 5 6 therefore the removal of dyes from effluents before their discharge into the aquatic environment is of great demand textile industries produce large volumes of dye effluents because of the high amounts of water used in dyeing processes 7 a number of different treatment methods for dye removal from effluent water have been investigated these are chemical oxidation 8 adsorption 1 9 11 chemical reduction 12 photo degradation 13 electrochemical oxidation 14 15 coagulation flocculation 16 membrane separation 17 18 fenton oxidation 19 and biological methods 20 each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations the adsorption process has received particular attention as it is simple generally inexpensive and may allow effective recycling of adsorbent material among metal oxide minerals nanosized manganese oxide mno is a common component of soil sediment and aquifers 21 31 naturally these occur colloidal discrete particles mixed gels and are found intermixed with iron or other minerals 32 34 they show potential in regulating environmental fate and mobility of pollutants via adsorption photochemical degradation abiotic oxidation and catalytic pathways 35 37 for example they have been shown to be effective scavengers for metal ions and dyes due to their high specific surface areas ssa low to moderate surface charge smaller particle size polymorphous and amorphous nature 36 38 42 a low point of zero charge phpzc means that cationic dyes are strongly sorbed onto their surfaces while anionic dye sorb less readily 36 43 mno is a common natural oxidant and exists in various forms consisting of layered or tunnel structures made up of mno6 octahedra 21 38 44 mno mineral materials have been investigated for a number of applications including ion exchange sensing batteries 44 45 and as dye degradation catalysts 40 45 46 as natural mno minerals contain various impurities assessing their effectiveness as sorbents to remove particular dyes can vary depending on their composition and structure consequently synthesized mno minerals with accurately known composition and structure have been used by several research groups to more effectively assess their ability as sorbents to remove dyes from solution 43 47 48 in addition manganese oxide composite or coating can be important in redox transition zones mnos coating of alumina silica and clay minerals have been characterized elsewhere 49 50 it has been suggested that mnos as a coating material or as part of composite results in a mineral material with better specific surface area ssa porosity particle size and physicochemical properties of the substrate for more effective dye adsorption 37 49 therefore in recent years mnos coating or composites have been promising sorbents for dye removal from effluents 49 51 there have been several review reports published on the removal of dye from water using sorbents these include reviews on the use of activated carbon 52 53 agricultural waste 3 4 agricultural solid waste 54 activated carbon and low cost sorbents 10 carbon nanotubes 55 mesoporous silicas 7 nanoparticles 56 low cost sorbents 57 63 cost effective and non conventional sorbents 64 biosorbents 65 functional oxide nanomaterials and nanocomposites 66 nano zero valent iron oxide 67 alternative sorbents 68 immobilised fungi 69 whole bacterial cells 70 chitosan and its derivatives 71 and clay and modified clay 72 in addition several groups have published reviews focussing on the removal of dye from wastewater 10 73 75 bharati et al 4 summarised the use of various agricultural based low cost sorbents such as coir pith orange peel rice husk straw date pit and peanut hull in removing organic dyes from wastewater they also outlined the important experimental factors involved in dye removal including the adsorption mechanism process remucal et al 76 published a systematic review focussing on the catalytic reactivity of mnos towards model organic contaminants such as phenol and its derivatives anilines antibacterial agents chelating agents endocrine disruptors dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides and surfactants they also discussed the use of manganese oxide in treating wastewater after an extensive literature survey of several years whilst there were several reviews related to the general synthesis and characterization of manganese oxide there was no review discussing the application of manganese oxide and composites as adsorbents for the removal of dye from aqueous environment therefore the purpose of the review is to summarize and discuss recently reported work on dye adsorption onto mnos together with proposed models to explain the dye adsorption mechanism applications of manganese oxides in dye adsorption processes for possible application in water treatment are discussed in addition there is a discussion on the limitations of the available data and suggestions for future research in this area 2 toxicity of dyes the textile industry produces huge amounts of contaminated water which seriously affects the environment many problems are being confronted due to dyes pollution in water in fact it is one of the most polluting industries in the world the wastewater of dye industries is the maximum polluting place among all the industrial segments producing a huge volume of effluent textile industries yield tons of dyes that are discharged as wastewater every year throughout the dyeing procedures the dyeing procedure has increased substantial care due to numerous type of contaminations prior to the 19th century all dyes were obtained from natural sources with the discovery of mauvine dye in 1856 by perkin the dye industry was revolutionized many synthetic dyes have been developed since then and comprise most of the dyes in current use after that there has been no observed back in the manufacture of synthetic dyes as these are cheap to produce have good dye properties e g respectable color stronghold and are available in a wide range of colors the most significant feature of these dyes is that these are informal to harvest on an industrial level consequently the textile industry is responsible for manufacturing and using huge amounts of dyes more than ten thousand diverse dyes are made annually with around 700 000 tons of synthetic dyes and other dying materials produced annually 77 however a large quantity of them ends up in waterways creating serious environmental issues due to their toxicity 78 79 typically a great quantity of dyes and breakdown by products are poisonous to aquatic creatures 80 textile industries use other chemicals such as detergents oils fixing waxes sizing and wetting agents waxing latex glues softeners and binders which have adverse effects on the environment that become a concluding yield of fabric wastewater and released into the atmosphere much of the toxic properties of the dyes and their release as waste products have caused in numerous difficulties the dyes that are creating as carcinogens like benzidine are maximum poisonous constant disclosure to such industrialized discards having dyes affect respiratory and skin portions the release of such dyes into water and lakes is certainly disagreeable these contaminants present in wastewaters are carcinogenic mutagenic and very toxic to all forms of life and affecting severe danger to water alive creatures wastewater from industries like coloring cosmetic textile paper food printing paint and pharmaceutical 81 82 consists of non biodegradable dyes moreover the color of these dyes can cause changes in turbidity chemical oxygen demand ph and temperature in water bodies 83 this contaminated water revises the color of lakes and streams and disturbs indigenous populace this color hinders light infiltration to profound water worrying ecology of water 84 this color disturbs clearness and class of water bodies such as lakes and rivers producing grim injury to water atmosphere the reduction in light due to the presence of dyes in lakes and rivers deceases the rate photosynthesis in aquatic plants thereby affecting aquatic populations further up the food chain aquatic life is significantly affected by obstruction of sunlight in water the decrease in light also delays the development of several types of microorganisms and produce micro toxicity for various animals including fish 85 87 because of decrease photosynthesis plants are significantly affected 87 sulphur dyes and sulphides in rivers and lakes can lower the amount of dissolved oxygen which affects the overall health of an aquatic system 87 dye polluted wastewater can also enter deep soil layers affecting groundwater quality which could be a severe fitness matter for humans and aquatic life infiltration of this sort of contaminated water into deep soil layers results in groundwater systems 88 dye waste in manufacturing sewages is a straight health danger toxic dyes reduce oxygen amount in ponds and lakes limiting the downstream utilization of water like irrigation and drinking the contact to numerous color sewages effects creature s leukaemia affecting the circulatory respiratory disease allergic reactions neurobehavioral and immune suppression disorders numerous sorts of cancers in the kidney liver and urinary bladder of labors in textile industries are described attendance of compounds like benzene toluene phenols and other hydrocarbons creates manufacturing waste cancer causing bacteriological inhabitants and mammalians are significantly affected by dyestuff industrial and textile trades azo dyes comprise 60 70 of all the carbon based dyes manufactured globally they are widely used in the cosmetic pharmaceutical textile leather paint food and paper industries unfortunately contact with azo dyes can cause skin lungs and gastrointestinal problems they also have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and being very stable they persist in the environment for a long time these dyes can arrive body simply by digestion and roots damaging to haemoglobin dna material and persuades cancer in humans and animals unfortunately they are hard to remove from wastewater before they released into the environment maximum industrial releases cannot be salted and therefore dyes can seepage to water assets and persevere in environment owing to their constancy to light temperature soaps oxidizing agents detergent biological treatments and chemicals owing to great photo and thermal permanency to fight biodegradation dyes may continue in the atmosphere for lengthy passé of time the manufacturing sewages affect water quality and urban societies that depend on getting water quantity from these sources without any satisfactory management synthetic dyes create solely and severe ecological difficulties dyes are also found in air pollution too most of the procedures that are done in fabric industries generate the release of toxic gases and other products gaseous releases are recognized as the highest reason for air contaminations these types contaminants released from fabric industries are extensive but unluckily no information is existing to us that can correctly and precisely evaluate air quality caused by textile engineering processes toxicity information on some commonly used azo dyes is given in table 1 3 common dyes in wastewater dyes are complex organic molecules that are used commonly to impart color and to meet aesthetic appeal as priority and most available contaminants dyes are important pollutants found in most effluents 72 in order to understand the adsorption properties of dyes it is necessary to classify them normally dyes are classified into cationic anionic and non ionic dyes common cationic dyes that have been removed using mnos and their composites include methylene blue mb 40 41 46 crystal violet cv 90 brilliant green bg 91 92 and malachite green mg 93 anionic dyes include direct dyes reactive dyes and acid dyes they are responsible for severe dye pollution in the environment it is important to be able to effectively remove them from wastewater streams examples of anionic dyes include methyl orange mo 94 congo red cr 95 acid red b arb 96 rhodamine b rhb 43 orange green og 97 prussian red pr 98 alizarin red 99 rose bengal 100 basic yellow 28 and pinacyanol chloride 101 it was found from the literature that mnos have been used as sorbents to remove mb mo rhb cv and cr dye molecules from solution 4 removal of dye using manganese oxides in recent years manganese oxides their polymorphs coatings or composites have been shown to be very good sorbents to treat dye polluted water 23 commonly used manganese sorbents are hydrous manganese dioxide or birnessite δ mno2 pyrolusite β mno2 hausmannite mn3o4 manganite mnooh cryptomelane α mno2 mn2o3 and their numerous composites or coatings which are normally made by integrating them with other natural or synthetic materials 23 30 the detailed usage of various mnos in case of dye removal is discussed below the following subheadings 4 1 methylene blue methylene blue mb is a basic cationic dye of thiazine group and is also referred to as swiss blue and trimethyl thionines 59 102 it produces a blue color when dissolved in water and has numerous applications in paper coloring solar cells wool or cotton dyeing coating for paper stock and as a temporary hair color 103 mb is the most common found dye in textile effluent with numerous attempts made to remove mb from textile effluent 21 59 60 104 in particular the use of mnos and composites in mb removal has shown to be effective 21 36 38 47 76 105 111 for example huong et al 9 recently investigated the effectiveness of manganese ferrite graphene oxides go in removing mb shanghai chemical reagent co ltd china from water they noted that an increase in the amount of go from 10 wt to 50 wt resulted in an increase from 91 to 95 in dye removal capacity mb adsorption data followed pseudo second order kinetics with isotherm data fitting well to the langmuir equation they proposed a plausible mechanism for this study in terms of the main four factors fig 1 mechanism i involves electrostatic or ionic interactions and this has been attributed to the electrostatic attractions of positively charged mb molecule and negatively charged oh groups on the substrate mechanism ii involves oxygen containing groups such as hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh and epoxy c o on the basal planes and edges of go sheets in this instance surface functional groups play the role of active binding sites for mb adsorption mechanism iii involves π π conjugation which is associated with π π electron donor acceptor interactions with graphene surfaces since mb contains cc bonds and π electrons the π electrons may readily interact with the π electrons of benzene rings on the go surface by π π electron coupling mechanism iv involves photodegradation and mn fe redox synergetic effect this comprises the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis which leads to the efficient decomposition of mb moreover mn fe redox synergetic mechanism is vital in mfo catalysts for mb degradation fig 1 chen et al 111 synthesized an mn fe composite nanostructure at room temperature rt using a system containing kmno4 fe3o4 and oleic acid this composite had a high mb guang dong xilong chemical company china adsorption capacity due to a high specific surface area 96 m2 g large pore volume 0 335 cm3 g 1 and mesoporous structure it strongly bound mb due to a combination of h bonding and electrostatic attraction zhu et al 37 synthesized discrete mno2 and three mno2 coated montmorillonite composites with varying amounts of mno2 4 8 34 9 and studied the adsorption of mb beijing yili company china onto these substrates they noted that mb removal improved with an increasing amount of composite and the initial rate of mb removal increased linearly with increasing mno2 loadings the presence of h2o2 notably increased dye removal performance huang et al 112 assembled a core shell hausmannite birnessite composite which was characterized by x ray diffractometry xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and uv vis they then investigated its ability to remove mb from the solution where they found mb uptake followed pseudo second order kinetics the composite displayed a higher mb uptake capacity than pure hausmannite due to the high specific surface area ssa and nano sheet shell structure of the composite they suggested that this composite shows promise as a substrate for wastewater treatment ullah et al 109 prepared hausmannite mn3o4 using kmno4 and glycol at 80 c after characterization of the substrate they used it for the oxidative degradation of mb merck germany in water they observed it could remove nearly 80 of the dye within 1 h of contact time with dye degradation higher at lower ph dye degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics they proposed that mb degradation involved the formation of surface precursor complex between the dye and the surface functional groups and identified degradation products using hplc to be thionines resulting from n demethylation of mb debnath et al 40 used four manganese oxides such as mno bixbyite α mn2o3 hausmannite mn3o4 birnessite δ mno2 to treat water polluted with mb they observed that hausmannite was the most effective and was able to degrade 99 3 dye with an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l mb in the presence of h2o2 at 80 c contact time 1 h the greater capacity of hausmannite has been attributed to its small particle size 20 nm compared to the other minerals which had a diameter range of 26 35 nm for hausmannite mb degradation efficiency was strongly dependent on temperature increasing from 26 8 to 99 3 in 1 h as temperature increased from 30 to 80 c dye degradation was observed to a follow pseudo first order kinetics they further studied the mechanism of mb degradation with hausmannite by means of electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy esi ms analysis the degradation processes were found to be n methylation and decarboxylation of mb they proposed that oh 1o2 and o2 radicals are generated during degradation forming oh and 1o2 after 30 min and it was these reactive species that were mainly responsible for dye degradation they proposed the following reactions for the formation of these reactive species mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh mn iii h2o2 mn ii o2 2h o2 h2o oh h2o2 mn ii o2 mn iii h2o2 mn iii o2 mn ii 1o2 multiple oxidation states of mn in hausmannite mno mn2o3 accelerated the interfacial electron transfer thereby enhancing mb degradation in the presence of h2o2 various mnos reported as sorbents for the removal of mb are given in table 2 together with experimental parameters and modeling results from a large number of manganese oxides have been used as sorbents for the removal of mb composite materials have been the most effective dye removal performance has been commonly expressed in percent dye removal in most cases pseudo second order degradation kinetics was observed with a reasonable fit of the isotherm data to the langmuir equation 4 2 malachite green malachite green mg is an important cationic dye used to dye materials such as leather silk paper jute wool and cotton it is also used as a food additive and coloring agent biocide medical disinfectant etc 137 139 unfortunately the release of mg into lakes and rivers colors the water decreasing sunlight penetration it is also toxic to aquatic life due to its carcinogenic mutagenic genotoxic and teratogenic properties 139 140 despite a large amount of available toxicity data the dye is still used widely in aquaculture and other allied industries therefore the removal of mg from wastewater before releasing is necessary and very important 141 due to its emergent harmful effects research scientists have attempted to treat mg polluted water using mnos and composites 137 138 porous manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve oms 2 cryptomelane phase nanorods were prepared by hajnajafi et al 137 with a specific surface area of 93 m2 g and a pore diameter of 3 9 nm the effectiveness of this substrate was tested in catalytic degradation of 5 mg l malachite green mg in naio4 media and the results showed that the substrate could degrade 99 of the dye during 1 h at room temperature via pseudo first order kinetics furthermore they performed reusability of the spent catalyst after mg degradation in the presence of a common oxidant 30 h2o2 they noticed that after five consecutive recycle tests only a 4 decrease in degradation efficiency was observed santhi et al 93 prepared a nanocomposite of activated carbon loaded mno2 and used this composite to treat malachite green mg s d fine chem ltd india polluted water under their experimental conditions it was found that as ph of solution increased the percentage of dye removal also increased at ph 7 35 about 74 86 dye with an initial concentration of 40 mg l was removed in 30 min mg adsorption kinetic data followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data could be well described by both the langmuir and freundlich equations in another investigation hashemian et al 142 used a manganese ferrite spined composite mnfe2o4 to remove malachite green mg merck chemical company germany from water they observed that a maximum amount of dye 80 was sorbed at ph 2 0 in 30 min with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and a solid dose of 0 4 g l at 25 c the effect of the solid dose was also studied and they found that dye removal increased from 33 to 94 when the amount of composite increased from 10 mg to 40 mg this has been ascribed to the greater number of active sites available for the dye to sorb onto the substrate dye adsorption data reasonably followed a pseudo second order kinetic model work on the use of mnos and composites to treat mg polluted water together with experimental conditions and maximum removal capacity is summarised in table 3 from the table it is evident that most works had focussed on the use of composites to remove mg from water 4 3 methyl orange methyl orange mo is one of the most important classes of synthetic anionic azo dyes 147 it is widely used in the textile printing photographic and allied industries resulting in large volumes of waste mo entering the environment 148 there has also been much work on the use of manganese oxides and composites in removing mo from wastewater 94 149 150 liu et al 94 prepared two protons containing and two k containing birnessite nano structured birnessite by hydrothermal precipitation method they found that these substrates were excellent sorbents for the removal of methyl orange mo from aqueous solution the uptake of mo indicated that physical adsorption including electrostatic interactions played a dominant role in the adsorption mechanism the order of mo removal capacity over the ph range studied were h birnessite δ mno2 nanoparticles h birnessite nano sheets k birnessite nanoparticles k birnessite nano sheets superior mo removal performance of h birnessite δ mno2 indicated that k cation in the layered δ mno2 have an unfavorable effect on the mo adsorption process and the proton exchange process could be useful to improve mo adsorption affinity on δ mno2 fig 2 pandit et al 150 investigated the degradation of methyl red mr and methyl orange mo sigma aldrich usa using colloidal mno2 and found that a decolorization maximum 100 was observed below ph 5 0 with a 60 to 75 min contact time enough to completely decolorize both of the azo dyes the efficiency of decolorization also increased with increasing temperature it was found that the amount of mr removed increased from 91 72 to 100 when the temperature was increased from 26 to 50 c compared to 98 9 to 100 for removal of mo dang et al 133 investigated the removal of mb and mo using manganese oxide coated diatomite they proposed that dye degradation was responsible for a combined effect of physicochemical processes zhang et al 151 prepared two composites using birnessite δ mno2 hausmannite mn3o4 and magnesium m wire such as mno2 m and mno2 mn3o4 m and successfully used these composites as oxidants or catalysts to treat mo from wastewater in presence hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fig 3 with a contact time of 2 h 25 c and ph 2 5 the removal capacity of mo was in the order of 76 for mno2 m and 54 for mno2 mn3o4 m the promising performance of mno2 m has been ascribed to its surface morphology where birnessite provided more active sites for mn iv to be reduced to mn ii also there was no notable difference in mo removal observed with increasing solution temperature from 25 to 45 c contact time of 2 h they proposed a fenton like mechanism for mo degradation reactions involving free radical species over mno2 nanosheets the degradation proceeds by an adsorption oxidation desorption process fig 3 application of mnos and composites that have been used as sorbents for mo removal together with experimental parameters and modeling are listed in table 4 in most cases pseudo second order degradation kinetics is observed with langmuir models fitting the data well for mo removal although several research groups have dealt with mo adsorption only a few papers explain the mechanism of mo adsorption onto mnos this could be a potential future research area 4 4 rhodamine b rhodamine b rhb is a cationic xanthene dye and has been extensively used as a dye in textile and printing laser gain media flow cytometry photography tracer dye fluorescence microscopy and as a biological stain 154 156 it is severely toxic towards human and animals causing allergic dermatitis mutations skin irritations and cancer posing a significant health risk due to its large scale release from industry 154 157 158 therefore it is necessary to remove rhb from industrial effluents before they discharge into the aquatic environment in the few years several research groups have focused on the use of mnos and composites to remove degrade rhb from wastewater via oxidation 154 155 158 161 hao et al 161 investigated the adsorption of rhodamine b rhb onto hausmannite λ mno2 composite and the results unveiled that both decolorization and degradation rate could reach up to 97 and 90 respectively in 1 h reaction time at ph 3 0 the effectiveness of raw mno2 acid activated mno2 nio and zno as catalysts for oxidation of rhb merck india in aqueous medium under ambient conditions was reported by das et al 158 they noted that acid activated mno2 was able to oxidize nearly 100 of the dye with an initial dye concentration of 1 mg l and a sorbent dose of 2 5 g l with dye oxidation following pseudo first order kinetics with a view to decolorize rhb cui et al 155 prepared three different manganese oxides cryptomelane α mno2 pyrolusite β mno2 and birnessite δ mno2 to decolorize rhb solutions their specific surface areas were 84 28 and 40 m2 g respectively whereas their phpzc were 4 7 3 8 and 3 4 respectively they noticed that in all cases the dye decolorization efficiency improved with decreasing solution ph under the same conditions different minerals showed the different percentage of dye removal indicating that decolorization of rhb by minerals depend on the phpzc crystal type solution ph cryptomelane showed the maximum decolorization ability in the ph range 2 0 6 0 they proposed the dye degradation proceeded by following three steps i cleavage of ethyl groups ch3ch2 from the dye to form rh ii additional destruction of carboxylic cooh and carbonamide cnh2 groups from rhb to yield smaller species and iii mineralization of these molecular species into h2o co2 no3 and nh4 sun et al 162 tested the ability of mno2 aerogels to oxidize rhb tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china in aqueous solution the aerogel was able to remove 97 6 within 10 min at ph 2 5 the high removal efficiency is thought to be due to the high surface area ssa of the three dimensional aerogel the aerogel also degraded 86 7 of mb in 70 min they speculated that rhb adsorption onto the substrate involves the formation of nitrogen centered radicals which undergoes a two step reaction of n deethylation and consequent destruction of the backbone and mno2 aerogel was reduced from mn iv to mn ii by rhb and its derivatives to demonstrate the catalytic activity of the mn2o3 graphene composite chandra et al 120 used rhb mb and eosin merck india under uv irradiation together with 30 hydrogen peroxide initial concentrations of 12 4 and 25 μmol l respectively they noted that the composite exhibited excellent dye removal performance compared to pure manganese oxide and graphene the composite was able to degrade nearly 84 80 and 60 of mb eosin and rhb respectively under irradiation times of 2 4 h 2 2 h and 1 h respectively qin et al 163 studied the removal of rhb shanghai chemical reagent company china using the three dimensional micro flower birnessite ssa 19 7 m2 g they found for an initial concentration of 10 mg l and a sorbent dose of 0 4 g l at ph 1 0 the substrate was able to degrade nearly 100 of the dye li et al 134 prepared a flower like three dimensional composite fe3o4 kxmno2 from k birnessite nanosheets and fe3o4 microspheres with a surface area of 73 8 m2 g it was used to remove mb and rhb dye polluted water at ph 7 0 with a contact time of 2 h at 25 c the initial dye concentration was 0 5 to 5 mg l with a sorbent dose of 0 2 g l the results showed that the composite could remove over 98 rhb and 94 mb under these experimental conditions the dye removal data fits both langmuir and freundlich equations reasonably well from the literature the mechanism for rhb degradation with manganese oxides involves either the molecular approach or the electrochemical approach 154 in the molecular approach mineral hydroxyl groups or lattice oxygen can form excited oxygen species due to electron transfer in the tunnel pyrolusite structure 107 and these species cause the oxidation reaction of the rhb in the electrochemical approach mn iv is reduced to mn ii by rhb acting as a reductant reaction kinetics is dominated by the redox potential of mnox mn ii which is related to the concentration of h 164 165 a reduced ph in a suspension containing mnox increases the reduction of mnox mn ii thereby increasing dye oxidation at lower ph a summary of reported work using various manganese oxides and composites to degrade rhb is given in table 5 it is evident from this table that while much work has reported on rhb removal from wastewater using mnos and composites there has been little reported work on adsorption modeling for these systems 4 5 congo red congo red cr is a typical benzamide based anionic diazo dye 171 this type of dye is not easily biodegradable and yields a carcinogenic amine on degradation 172 many studies have investigated the effectiveness of mnos in removing cr from wastewater 45 95 173 zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr shanghai chemical reagent company china onto synthetic α mno2 micronests they found that the amount of cr sorbed significantly increased from 114 mg to 282 mg g with an increase in initial cr concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l with temperature having little effect on the amount sorbed dye adsorption data followed pseudo second order kinetics whereas isotherm data satisfactorily described the langmuir equation with a maximum surface coverage of 625 mg g at 22 c and ph 7 5 it was also shown that dye adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic in nature chakrabarti et al 172 investigated the adsorption of cr loba chemie india onto activated manganese oxide mnox ssa 7 55 m2 g and found it followed pseudo second order kinetics isotherm data fitted the langmuir equation well with a maximum surface loading of 38 6 mg g at an initial dye concentration of 50 500 mg l sorbent dose of 12 g l at 3 h and 25 c recently khan et al 174 studied uv and visible light photocatalytic degradation of cr sigma aldrich usa using mno2 ac composite the result showed that the composite degraded the dye more efficiently than mno2 the superior degradation capacity of the composite was due to the synergistic effect between dye adsorption on ac followed by rapid photodegradation by supported mno2 at 5 min irradiation time the composite could degrade 98 5 cr while mno2 could degrade 66 6 of the dye they proposed the probable dye degradation mechanism which could be easily understood from fig 4 during dye degradation a positively charged hole h is generated in the valence band due to excitation of mno2 molecule from the valence band to the conduction band when light falls on the surface pure mno2 mostly exist in agglomerated form and a larger portion of created electron hole pairs recombine leading to less photocatalytic activity the hole reacts with a water molecule to produce hydroxyl radical while electron present in conduction band reacts with an oxygen molecule to produce superoxide anion radical these radicals are highly reactive and degraded dye molecule into simpler species fig 4 table 6 summarises the use of various mnos for removing of congo red cr from wastewater from table 6 it is noticeable that there are only a limited number of reports on congo red cr removal using mnos and with most of them not providing any kinetic or isotherm modeling 4 6 crystal violet crystal violet cv is a typical triphenylmethane synthetic cationic dye commonly used to color paper leather wool silk leather nylon fertilizer detergent and ink for pens 177 as with many other basic dyes it is carcinogenic and a skin irritant and therefore poses a risk to the environment 177 178 so far manganese oxide and composites employed to treat cv polluted water include mno2 loaded activated carbon 91 layered nano mno2 and nanocomposite mno2 mnfe2o4 177 binary iron manganese oxide coated kaolinite 179 and nanostructure mn2o3 180 all of these investigations have suggested that a fenton type oxidation mechanism is likely to occur via the generation of hydroxyl radicals by photocatalysis or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 177 asfaram et al 91 investigated the adsorption of mb crystal violet cv and brilliant green bg merck germany using mno2 loaded activated carbon ssa 612 03 m2 g dye adsorption increased with increasing solution ph in all cases adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data fitted well to the langmuir equation maximum surface loading capacities for the composite at ph 7 0 contact time 4 h were 263 mg g for cv 234 mg g for mb and 206 mg g for br karan et al 177 investigated the degradation of cv sigma aldrich usa from water using layered nano mno2 and core shell nanocomposite mno2 mnfe2o4 in presence of h2o2 fig 5 they showed that cv degradation was faster with layered nano mno2 and reached nearly 100 in 20 min at room temperature with an initial dye concentration of 200 mg l and surface dose of 0 1 g l using electrospray ionization quadruple time of flight mass spectrometry esi q tof ms they proposed that the main degradation products identified were 4 isocyanobenzaldehyde and bis 4 dimethylamino phenyl methanone michler s ketone these products could be potentially biodegraded to harmless mineralization products table 7 summarises reported work on the use of mnos and its composites to treat cv polluted water together with experimental parameters and maximum removal capacity only two reports have dealt with kinetic and isotherm modeling in all cases the data followed pseudo second order the isotherm data described by the langmuir equation 4 7 miscellaneous dyes apart from the previously described dyes other dyes such as ethylene blue eb procion red pr basic yellow 28 basic fuchsin basic green brilliant green etc are also used extensively in the paper and textile industries 92 182 183 these dyes are usually non biodegradable and pose serious problems when released into the environment 184 they have been known to cause eye burns fast breathing and cancer several research scientists have explored the use of mnos in removing these dyes from wastewater 98 100 185 using a molten salt route sui et al 167 prepared two manganese dioxides with one dimensional crystalline structures cryptomelane α mno2 ssa 89 3 m2 g and pyrolusite β mno2 ssa 41 1 m2 g the effectiveness of these minerals as catalysts to break down dyes were tested on rhb congo red cr and ethylene blue eb using an initial concentration of 10 mg l and a sorbent dose of 30 mg at ph 7 they found that for both oxides rhb decomposition increased from 60 to 90 when contact time increased from 20 min to 60 min while α mno2 was also able to decompose nearly 90 of cr and eb within 1 h the dye degradation mechanism involved fenton like reactions procion red pr is a common highly water soluble monoazo dye it is commonly used for dyeing nylon cellulose wool and silk 178 chowdhury et al 98 investigated the oxidative decolorization of mb and procion red pr merck germany using mn3o4 in acidic media and found that at ph 3 0 the mineral was able to decolorize more than 75 of mb within 1 min with nearly 100 of the dye decolorized within 24 h observation period similar results were found for pr removal basic yellow 28 by28 is a toxic cationic dye widely used in textile industries that has long term toxic effects on aquatic life the effectiveness of zno znmn2o4 composite ssa 25 m2 g and phpzc 9 7 as a sorbent to remove basic yellow 28 by 28 from aqueous solutions was investigated by konicki et al 186 the dye adsorption data at ph 7 0 and 30 c followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data were described by the langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption capacity of 48 8 mg g the effectiveness of binary iron manganese oxide coated kaolinite in removing basic fuchsin bf and crystal violet cv from aqueous solution was investigated by khan et al 179 they found that dye degradation data followed pseudo second order kinetics whereas isotherm data satisfactorily described by both the langmuir and toth models producing the maximum dye adsorption capacities for bf and cv was 10 36 mg g and 20 64 mg g respectively calculated thermodynamic parameters showed dye adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous in order to understand the catalytic degradation processes of six different organic dyes such basic green bg methyl violet mv orange ii oii methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb yao et al 170 investigated evaluated experiment of their degradation towards comn2o4 in the presence of peroxymonosulphate pms oxidant at 6 29 and 25 c the study showed that the decolorization efficiency of the various dyes was in the order bg mv oii rhb mb fb these differences are thought to be due to the difference in their molecular structures in addition the authors examined the effect of different oxidants such as peroxymonosulphate pms pds and h2o2 on rhb degradation with comn2o4 under the same experimental conditions the results show that the order of activity for dye removal was pms 100 pds 4 h2o2 1 wu et al 49 prepared four low cost mno fe2o3 composites with varying mn fe mole ratios which they then used to remove acid red b arb dye from wastewater individual surfaces and their composites removed significant amounts of arb with a ph 5 favorable for the partitioning of arb the maximum uptake capacity was 105 3 mg g however the presence of sulphate 0 05 m dramatically decreased the removal of arb from 98 to 10 7 table 8 lists work that reports on the removal of various dyes using mnos and composites under various experimental conditions it is apparent that various organic dyes are effectively removed using mnos and composites from effluents in most cases dye removal follows pseudo second order kinetics with isotherm data described satisfactorily using the langmuir equation 5 competitive dye removal studies multiple contaminants commonly exist together in the aquatic environment adsorption behavior of one contaminant in the presence of other pollutants can notably change their adsorption behavior it is therefore crucial to carry out competitive adsorption behavior experiments in order to better understand how they behave in the natural environment unfortunately only a limited number of research groups have investigated the competitive adsorption of dyes 37 144 170 196 the presence of other metal ions dyes or organic ligands such as humic substances can either enhance or inhibit the rate of degradation of organic contaminants depending upon the nature and concentration of dye as well as other reaction conditions 170 therefore the presence of other substance has a profound impact on the efficiency of dye adsorption processes wang et al 196 investigated the competitive adsorption of mb and rhb onto fe3o4 c mno2 nanocomposites the presence of rhb increased the amount of mb sorbed notably because of a synergetic effect whereas the presence of mb reduced the amount of rhb sorbed due to a competitive effect they found both single and binary solute systems kinetic data followed a pseudo second order model reasonably well for single solute systems data for both dyes were well fitted with the langmuir model isotherm data in binary solute systems followed the extended langmuir equation and sheindorf rehbun sheintuch srs models zhu et al 37 investigated the effect ha cosolute on decolorization of mb by δ mno2 montmorillonite composite mn mt 2 under two conditions i at ph 4 0 but varying the initial concentration of ha from 12 to 30 mg l and ii at a fixed ha concentration 12 mg l but varying ph from 4 0 to 5 5 they observed under these conditions that an increase of humic acid ha concentration increased the removal of mb markedly whereas the enhancement of degradation was significantly suppressed at lower ph it was suggested this is due to the promotive effect of mn ii ha complexation and competitive adsorption of mn ii and ha yao et al 170 investigated the effect of fulvic acid fa on rhb degradation by cobalt manganese oxides coxmn3 x o4 in water with an initial rhb concentration of 30 mg l sorbent dose of 20 mg l ph 6 29 with the solution at 25 c it was noted that the presence of fa reduced rhb degradation as initial the fa concentration increased from 0 0 to 80 mg l degradation reduced from 100 to 48 1 3 h reaction time suggesting that fa competed with rhb for reactive chemical groups on the substrate similarly the effect of ha on mg and rhb adsorption onto mno2 coated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts has been investigated by ji et al 144 they found the presence of ha reduced the amount of both dyes sorbed onto the composite they suggested that there were repulsive electrostatic interactions between negatively charged ha and the surface and they also speculated the involvement of van der waals forces π π electron coupling and h bonding ha exhibited high adsorption capacity onto the surface thereby causing a competitive effect on adsorption both of dyes 6 comparative dye removal studies in order to develop more effective mno materials for dye removal it is important to investigate and compare the dye removal performance of various mnos and their related composites dye removal is also strongly dependent on experimental conditions such as ph initial dye concentration amount of solid and temperature in general composite materials have been found to have better dye removal performance than their original components working alone there have been several research groups focussing on comparative dye removal studies using mnos and composites with other substrates 128 recently amer et al 128 investigated the photodegradation of mb using four samples of mnos e g mn3o4 mn3o4 and graphene oxide composites g1m1 g3m1 and g1m3 where numbers indicate the weight ratio between components with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l sorbent dose of 1 g l 1 h of contact time at room temperature they noticed that mb followed a pseudo first order kinetic model the order of the degradation of mb dye was g3m1 100 g1m1 92 g1m3 70 mn3o4 30 zhu et al 37 reported mb removal using four manganese based minerals such as pure birnessite and three birnessite coated with montmorillonite composites with varying the amounts of birnessite mn mt 1 mn mt 2 and mn mt 3 the ssa of these substrates were 234 31 and 91 m2 g respectively they observed that dye degradation increased with a higher loading of mn oxides coatings the removal capacity under an initial mb concentration of 80 mg l and sorbent dose of 0 5 g l at 27 0 5 c was in the order of mn mt 1 90 mn mt 2 50 mn mt 3 48 birnessite 40 the different adsorption affinity and redox activity are likely due to the different crystallinity of the substrates where a decrease in crystallinity leads to an increase of ssa and redox reactivity li et al 197 investigated congo red cr removal using manganese dioxides with three different morphologies such as commercial mno2 γ mno2 microplates ssa 52 1 m2 g and γ mno2 microspheres ssa 50 2 m2 g under the same experimental conditions with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l ph 7 2 and sorbent dose of 0 1 g l they found that cr adsorption capacity was in the order γ mno2 microspheres 80 γ mno2 microplates 55 commercial mno2 25 the cr adsorption mechanism was suggested to be due to the electrostatic attraction between the porous substrate and the dye in solution at ph 7 2 as an example of the potential application of mnos in wastewater treatment fei et al 95 carried out a comparative investigation of the removal of congo red cr using synthetic mno2 hollow microspheres commercial mno2 and γ fe2o3 nanoparticles they found that synthetic mno2 exhibited a better dye removal capacity 90 compared to commercial mno2 and γ fe2o3 under an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and a sorbent dose of 1 g l at ph 7 6 and room temperature the superior dye removal capacity of the synthetic mno2 was thought to be due to its hierarchical hollow microstructure in another comparative study zhai et al 175 investigated a number of magnetic core mno shell nanostructures for removing congo red cr from wastewater these were manganese ferrite nanoparticles substrate 1 manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 for 1 h at room temperature substrate 2 manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 at 95 c for 3 h substrate 3 layered birnessite ssa 576 4 m2 g and manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 at 95 c for 20 h substrate 4 ssa 794 2 m2 g it was found that substrate 3 was able to remove more than 85 cr with an initial concentration of 80 mg l and a sorbent dose of 1 8 g l in 1 h at room temperature while s1 was only able to remove 43 cr furthermore the nanoparticles could be recovered by combustion at 300 c they also noted that the recovered materials were still able to remove the almost similar amount of cr even after the 3rd cycle in a previous report he et al 132 investigated the effect of birnessite mno2 nanosheets mno2 nanosheets mmt mno2 nanowires mmt montmorillonite and pure montmorillonite mmt on mb degradation at an initial concentration of 50 mg l with a contact time of 2 h at ph 2 0 and at 30 c they found that the relative degradation capacities of the minerals were in the order of mno2 nanosheets mmt 98 mno2 nanosheets 90 mno2 nanowires mmt 60 mmt 27 the high removal efficiency of the first two substrates is thought to be due to the special lamellar structure of birnessite mno2 combined with the larger ssa of the mmt 132 86 m2 g peng et al 117 synthesized four manganese oxides mno2 nanofibers mn2o3 nanostructures mn3o4 nanofibers and mnooh nanofibers whose bet surface areas were 50 20 71 and 104 m2 g respectively they then studied the catalytic degradation of mb using these substrates and tio2 in the presence of h2o2 with an initial dye concentration of 25 mg l and sorbent dose of 0 2 g l at room temperature at a contact time of 2 h dye degradation efficiency was in the order mn3o4 93 tio2 86 mnooh 85 mno2 80 mn2o3 75 the differences in dye degradation performance were thought to be due to the differences in the specific surface areas and valence states of the mn ions cao et al 121 investigated substrates consisting of mn2o3 coated onto the walls of ordered mesoporous silica sba 15 the effectiveness of these substrates to remove mb and ethanol from wastewater was then determined the substrates used were sba 15 20 mn2o3 sba 15 40 mn2o3 sba 15 and 60 mn2o3 sba 15 whose ssa were 626 402 361 and 334 m2 g respectively the results show that 40 mn2o3 sba 15 was able to sorb more mb effectively than other substrates this was thought to be due to good distribution of mn2o3 in the sba 15 mesopores while it maintained a mesoporous structure which enhanced the mb degradation at ph 7 0 and at 30 c 7 factors affecting dye removal there are several factors that play a significant role in dye removal contact time solution ph initial dye concentration amount of sorbent and temperature 173 therefore the optimization of these parameters is essential for maximum dye removal performance on a large scale in the following section some of the important factors are discussed briefly 7 1 contact time contact time is the most frequently used parameter for dye adsorption study 173 the effect of contact time is performed during dye removal by preparing a system containing known concentrations of dye and sorbent which is continually stirred and samples taken at regular time intervals 91 typically the amount of dye removal increases with increasing contact time until it reaches equilibrium 186 after this point a further increase in contact time does not change the extent of adsorption due to unavailability of surface sites in the past several research groups have investigated the effect of the contact time on dye removal using mnos 91 136 149 173 186 for instance salam et al 136 explored the effect of contact on the removal of mb by manganese oxide nanocorals moncs from an initial concentration of 5 mg l of mb using 20 mg of the sorbent at ph 8 0 and 24 c they noticed that mb adsorption reached equilibrium within 20 min with 97 of dye sorbed with no obvious difference in adsorption observed after 2 h contact time in another work kumar et al 138 examined the effect of contact time on malachite green mg adsorption onto mno2 nanoparticles they pointed out that mg adsorption initially increased very rapidly with more than 96 dye sorbed onto the substrate by 30 min after this point adsorption was very slow as saturation of the active surface sites did not permit further adsorption to take place similarly kim et al 153 investigated the degradation of mb onto mno2 carbon hybrids at three different dye concentrations 25 50 and 100 mg l to study the effect of contact time on adsorption fig 6 it was observed that rapid adsorption occurred within 10 min after which equilibrium was attained gradually the initial rapid adsorption phase was attributed to the presence of a large number of active sites the subsequent slowdown in adsorption was due to the decrease in the availability of surface sites it was also found that adsorption capacity improved with increasing initial dye concentration 7 2 solution ph ph is one of the most important factors affecting dye adsorption 121 132 186 the ph of the solution changes the surface properties sorbent as well as the speciation of the sorbate the influence of ph is usually studied by making a suspension in an electrolyte solution and then adding sorbate to the equilibrated suspension the ph of the solution is then maintained by adding standard hno3 and naoh solution until the required ph is reached typically the amount of cationic dye sorbed increases with increasing solution ph while the amount of anionic dye decreases with increasing ph 41 132 138 149 151 179 186 generally solution ph is optimized during dye removal to achieve a maximum dye removal capacity table 2 7 however the value of optimum ph is found to depend on the nature of the dye the type of mnos used and or composites investigated the effect of solution ph from 3 4 to 11 0 was studied by konicki et al 186 for basic yellow 28 by 28 adsorption onto zno znmn2o4 composite at 30 c with an initial dye concentration of 30 mg l they found that the amount of dye sorbed increased with increasing solution ph with an increase in ph from 3 4 to 11 resulting in an increase in dye adsorption from 36 4 to 55 4 mg g this is due to the sorbent having a point of zero charge phpzc of 9 7 below the phpzc there was an electrostatic interaction between positively charged surface sites and the cationic dye molecules qin et al 41 studied the effect solution ph 3 0 9 0 on mb adsorption onto freshly prepared mno2 and found that the amount of mb sorbed decreased with increasing ph up to ph 6 0 and then slightly increased across the ph range of 6 0 9 0 the amount of mb sorbed at ph 3 0 96 1 was greater than at ph 6 0 56 3 recently bhomik et al 149 studied the effect of ph on the adsorption of mo onto fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite fig 7 they found that the maximum removal of mo occurred at ph 2 0 and varied between 70 35 to 98 78 for various sorbent doses of 0 25 g l to 1 0 g l for an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l the phpzc of the composite was 7 1 so the surface was positively charged in acidic ph range therefore it is likely that electrostatic attraction between anionic mo and the nanocomposite surface is the main adsorption mechanism 7 3 initial dye concentration initial dye concentration is another important factor in which dye removal highly depends 151 173 the effect of initial dye concentration is determined by preparing a sorbate surface suspension with a fixed amount of sorbent and various initial dye concentrations with regular samples taken until equilibrium is reached 149 151 several papers have also investigated the effect of initial dye concentration on dye degradation using mnos 41 132 173 186 zhang et al 151 explored the effect of methyl orange mo concentration during its removal onto mno2 m magnesium and found that mo removal increased from 43 to 77 when dye concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l at ph 2 5 and 25 c note that a further increase in dye concentration after this point did not increase the amount of dye removal qin et al 41 investigated the effect of initial mb concentration onto mno2 and noticed that as the concentration of dye increased the amount of dye sorbed increased very rapidly and then reached equilibrium for further increase of concentration due to limited available surface sites fig 8 the shape of the curve can be considered as high affinity type adsorption at low initial dye concentration sufficient adsorption sites are available where 92 6 dye is removed at an initial concentration of 5 mg l konicki et al 186 investigated the influence of initial basic yellow 28 by 28 concentration during it adsorption onto zno znmn2o4 composite and showed that an increase of initial dye concentration from 10 to 50 mg l leads to an increase of adsorption from 25 9 to 44 mg g at ph 7 0 and 30 c this indicates that initial dye concentration plays an important role in dye adsorption onto the composite 7 4 amount of adsorbent the influence of sorbent amount on the adsorption process can be determined by first preparing a sorbate surface solution with various amounts of the sorbent then an aliquot of known initial concentration dye is added shaken and the resulting solution allowed to reach equilibrium the effect of sorbent dose was investigated by a number of researchers for dye removal using mnos 41 132 138 172 chakrabarti et al 172 demonstrated the effect of sorbent dose for congo red cr removal onto activated manganese oxide mnox and found that for an initial concentration of 500 mg l the removal capacity of cr increased from 32 to 46 when sorbent doses increased from 0 4 to 0 6 w v at 25 c and ph 7 5 this was due to the fact that increasing the amount of sorbent increases the number of active surface sites available for adsorption recently qin et al 41 investigated mb adsorption onto mno2 as a function of sorbent dose fig 9 and noted that there was a notable increase in percentage removal of mb with increasing sorbent dose with maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at a dose of 50 mg l this may be attributed to the specific surface area and available surface sites on the mno2 at a low dose the surface is likely saturated with mb so the residual mb concentration in the solution will large however at higher doses there would be excess adsorption sites leading to relatively less adsorption amount at higher sorbent dose salam et al 136 perceived the effect of sorbent dose on the adsorption of mb using manganese oxide nanocorals moncs in a dye concentration of 5 mg l ph 8 0 2 h at 24 c the results showed that increasing the sorbent dose resulted in a slight increase in the amount of mb sorbed increasing the mass of sorbent from 20 mg to 40 mg to 60 mg yielded 94 6 97 9 and 98 of the dye sorbed respectively obviously no notable increase in the dye sorbed was found by increasing the sorbent concentration 7 5 temperature textile effluents are released into the environment at a moderately high temperature it is found that solution temperature is one of the important factors they greatly affect the feasibility of environmental remediation of adsorption treatment 121 136 temperature increases the energy of activation and thereby increases the rate of dye degradation 121 136 the impact of temperature on the adsorption process can be determined by preparing a sorbate surface solutions with different initial dye concentrations mixtures are then thermostated at different temperature and allowed to come to equilibrium before determining the of adsorption is determined from these experiments enthalpy gibbs free energy and entropy in their standard state can be determined and the nature of adsorption processes can be predicted e g is it spontaneous endothermic and exothermic 72 much work has been reported on the effect of temperature during dye removal using mnos 121 136 172 173 179 186 salam et al 136 evaluated the effect of solution temperature 10 20 35 and 50 c on the removal of mb by manganese oxide nanocorals moncs adsorption was high at 10 c 90 with increase temperature only slightly increasing the amount of mb adsorbed the thermodynamic data showed that mb adsorption was both spontaneous and endothermic in nature konicki et al 186 investigated the change in solution temperature as a function of adsorption of basic yellow 28 by 28 onto zno znmn2o4 composite from 20 to 60 c at ph 7 0 and an initial concentration of 30 mg l they noted that increasing temperature caused the increase of dye adsorption from 37 8 to 45 mg g results of thermodynamic calculation confirm the dye adsorption process was driven by endothermic and physisorption process in another report chakrabarti et al 172 conducted experiments to check out the effect of temperature onto activated manganese oxide in isotherm experiments at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c where initial dye concentration was in the range of 50 500 mg l they observed that the maximum amount of dye sorbed increased from 38 61 mg g to 58 1 mg g when the temperature of the system was increased from 25 to 45 c fig 10 the adsorption process was endothermic in nature 8 adsorption mechanism a mechanistic approach is important when studying dye adsorption onto mnos as it assists in optimizing adsorption desorption and regeneration processes however no single technique can provide a complete description of sorbate mineral surface phenomena to date in order to understand the adsorption phenomena and its wide implications a combined approach of empirical surface complexation model scm and spectroscopic methods have been used 198 200 interaction of dye with mnos is usually driven by physisorption and chemisorption processes physical adsorption involves the interaction of the dye with the surface by means of van der waals forces h bonding hydrophobic polarity and steric attraction dipole dipole interaction π π interaction or combination of them 144 201 on the other hand chemisorption involves electrostatic attraction sharing of electrons transfer of electrons and formation surface precursor complexes or inner and outer sphere complexes 144 201 in addition when the diffusion mechanism is important film diffusion and particle diffusion models are considered 201 in order to understand dye degradation or adsorption processes as well as to develop an effective design model for dye removal from aqueous solution adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics equilibrium isotherm and thermodynamic data are necessary several propositions for the probable adsorption reactions taking place with these systems is discussed in the following sections 8 1 dye adsorption data modeling empirical models based on the mathematical relationship have been developed for describing both equilibrium isotherm and kinetic systems 179 202 205 up to date several kinetic and isotherm modeling has been used by researchers is summarized in table 9 8 1 1 dye adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption kinetic experiments provide information on how much time is necessary for a system to reach equilibrium for a specific sorbate mineral system 125 172 202 these studies are essential for the prediction of optimum experimental conditions in large scale adsorption processes ideally for removal of dyes from wastewater we require fast reaction rates as well as a high adsorption performance in investigating the rate controlling step and to obtain useful information regarding the adsorption process different kinetic models have been used table 9 from reported work usually it is either pseudo first order pfo and second order pso kinetic models used for describing the adsorption process onto mnos and composites 21 91 132 172 173 202 nevertheless the pseudo second order model was found to fit well for most mnos adsorption systems 21 91 149 172 however several researchers have also been used intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich e models to describe adsorption kinetics 206 recently bhowmik et al 149 utilized the pseudo first second and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models to fit the experimental data obtained for methyl orange mo adsorption onto mixed phase fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite results indicated that the adsorption process followed a pseudo second order kinetic model chen et al 21 investigated the adsorption of mb onto porous mno2 microspheres the result exhibited good fit with a second order kinetic model that may support the surface uptake as a rate controlling mechanism in another study zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr onto synthetic α mno2 micronests and fitted the adsorption kinetic data with pseudo first and second models the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 999 gave a good description of cr assimilation onto α mno2 micronests further confirming the predominant mechanism of specific adsorption li et al 134 reported on the removal of mb and rhb onto crystalline fe3o4 kxmno2 composite and employed pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models to the data a pseudo second order model best described r2 0 999 the adsorption of the dye composite system in another study he et al 132 showed the kinetic data followed a pseudo second order model for the uptake of mb onto mno2 nanosheets mmt recently an adsorption study of mb onto manganese oxide nanocorals moncs by salam et al 136 found the data to fit well with a pseudo second order model r2 0 99 a pseudo second order approach was also found to provide a better fit than a pseudo first order kinetic model for the adsorption of methyl orange mo onto α mno2 152 8 1 2 dye adsorption isotherm modeling the equilibrium adsorption isotherm provides important information in explaining how a dye molecule will interact with the substrate 132 186 203 the adsorption isotherm is a useful tool in the adsorption process proving information about how sorbate interacts with the surface the adsorption isotherm is highly relevant to study on how sorbate mineral interact and elucidate the maximum adsorption capacity 132 186 isotherms are also necessary for the proper analysis optimization of the sorbate mineral system surface properties and successful design of the adsorption experiment because they explain how pollutants interact with the mineral surface 207 isotherm models can describe the adsorption data and relate the quantity of a sorbate in solution to the amount sorbed at a constant temperature however these models cannot provide information on the influence of the variable chemical and experimental conditions such as solution ph on uptake reactions as well as the mechanism of adsorption 179 208 moreover can be overcome by applying the thermodynamic based surface complexation model scm several empirical approaches are also briefly discussed in subsequent sections in recent years several isotherm models have been used to describe dye adsorption data in order to determine adsorption equilibrium 132 152 209 212 these models have involved either a two parameters langmuir l the linear isotherm freundlich f dubinin radushkevin d r redlich peterson r p and temkin t or b three parameters freundlich langmuir or sips isotherm s toth and multilayer isotherm such as brunauer emmet teller bet 21 among them single site langmuir and freundlich models have been widely used because of the convenience in estimating model parameters table 9 41 152 186 202 209 however a multisite site langmuir equation sometimes provides a better fit than a single site equation 207 however a lot more data is required for the adequate fitting of the multi site equation a langmuir model considers that the uptake takes place on the homogeneous surface forming a monolayer without chemical interaction or bond formation 213 on the other hand a freundlich model assumes adsorption onto a heterogeneous surface with unequal sites forming a multilayer 213 however the freundlich model does not predict the adsorption maxima while the langmuir does predict the adsorption maxima both models are useful for comparing the maximum adsorption capacities of a sorbate species as can be seen in tables 2 8 both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are widely used to explain the adsorption equilibria of pollutants onto mnos for example bhowmik et al 149 used langmuir freundlich and temkin models for the adsorption of mo onto mixed phase fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite a reasonably good fit was observed using the langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr onto synthetic α mno2 micronests and fitted the cr adsorption isotherm data to langmuir and freundlich equations they observed that the data followed the langmuir model better than the freundlich model indicating cr accumulation onto a homogeneous substrate forming a monolayer chen et al 21 investigated the adsorption of mb onto porous mno2 microspheres and fitted isotherm data was fitted to both the langmuir and freundlich models there was a better fit r2 0 999 with the freundlich model indicating heterogeneous adsorption behavior qin et al 41 applied langmuir and freundlich models to describe the adsorption isotherm data of mb onto freshly prepared mno2 and found that experimental data fitted better the langmuir model r2 0 997 when compared to the freundlich model r2 0 860 the maximum mb loading capacity onto the mno2 surface at ph 6 0 was 627 1 mg g which was higher than most of the average minerals more recently he et al 132 applied the langmuir and freundlich models to determine the adsorption mechanism of mb onto mno2 nanosheets mmt they found there was a much better fit of the data to the langmuir model in another example liu et al 152 used langmuir and freundlich models to explain the adsorption of mo onto α mno2 along with some other mnos such as birnessite pyrolusite hausmannite mn2o3 and γ mno2 results demonstrated a better fit to the langmuir model r2 0 99 at 20 c when compared to the freundlich model r2 0 79 9 regeneration desorption of spent mnos ease of reusability is an important aspect for any promising sorbent in order to minimize processing costs regeneration of mnos is necessary for wastewater treatment chemical desorption is the most frequently used regeneration process used and includes the use of reagents such as naoh hcl h2so4 methanol ethanol acetone acetic acid even water or combination of both acid and alkali 201 several papers have dealt with the regeneration of spent sorbents after dye adsorption 2 48 186 recently gong et al 2 investigated rhodamine b rhb degradation using pure mno2 and its composite mno2 m sio2 the results show good dye degradation using the composite mno2 m sio2 84 9 compared to 61 2 when using mno2 at 1 5 h of contact time an initial dye concentration of 5 mg ml ph 2 5 and sorbent dose of 0 5 g l they also conducted desorption studies under the same experimental conditions it was found that after six consecutive cycles the percentage of dye degradation for the composite and mno2 were 98 2 and 71 1 respectively indicating good reusability of the composite to assess the regeneration capacity of zno znmn2o4 composite konicki et al 186 performed desorption studies after the adsorption of basic yellow 28 by 28 onto the substrate using ethanol they point out that after three consecutive cycles the dye adsorption reduced from 42 1 to 37 2 mg g indicating good reusability of the composite salam et al 136 studied the regeneration recycling and reuse of spent manganese oxide nanocorals moncs ssa 169 m2 g used for the removal of mb using acetone as the desorption solution the spent mineral was soaked in acetone for 2 h afterward it was filtered washed in water dried and reused they found that almost the same amount of mb 98 3 sorbed after four cycles thus the spent sorbent showed an excellent recyclability capacity towards dye removal in another study by lan et al 48 explored the reusability of ultra long α mno2 nanowires for the removal of methyl violet mv from water after adsorption the spent mineral was washed repeatedly in water recovered by filtration and then regenerated under calcination at 400 c it was found that after five cycles the removal capacity of the regenerated mineral was still 99 for mv removal indicating excellent recyclability of the substrate in a report investigating rhb degradation using a comn2o4 catalyst yao et al 170 determined catalyst efficiency after five consecutive rounds at ph 6 29 rhb removal efficiency reduced slightly from 100 to 87 after 5 cycles with no obvious reduction in catalytic activity recorded furthermore the chemical stability of the catalyst was tested using x ray diffractometry xrd little change was observed in the spectra after 5 cycles indicating there was little structural change in the catalyst the stability of novel pyrolusite β mno2 nanopincers in mb degradation was tested by recycling in presence of 30 h2o2 an initial mb concentration of 10 mg l catalyst dose of 0 06 g l and 2 h contact time 221 results showed that nearly 95 of the mb could still be decomposed after three repeated cycles suggesting high stability of the catalyst in dye degradation 10 conclusions and future potential work in this review the use of a wide range of mnos as potential sorbents for removing dyes has been reported mnos have been shown to be promising substrates for dye removal on a commercial scale moreover they can be used to treat a wide range of dyes e g mb mo rhb etc in wastewater manganese based coatings or composites have exhibited superior dye removal capacity and faster initial kinetic rate for the oxidation of dye as compared to the pure substrate this is attributed to an increase in specific surface area ssa and a decrease in surface charge however there is only limited information on the reactivity of mnos coatings or composites although their importance in the natural environment has long been recognized in the case of cationic dye little or no adsorption was observed at low ph while notably higher adsorption was achieved at higher ph depending on the surface charge of adsorbents the opposite behavior was remarked for anionic dyes in most cases adsorption edges and isotherm models have been applied extensively to elucidate dye removal mechanism pseudo second order pso kinetic and langmuir models fitted dye removal data nicely in most studies most of the previous studies proposed that dye degradation involved a fenton like oxidation mechanism proceeding through hydroxyl radicals produced by photocatalysis or from peroxide generally dye adsorption was found to decrease in presence of another dye metal ion and humic acid ha due to the competition of both species for a finite number of surface sites or formation of dye metal complexes in solution it is thought that formation of surface precursor complexes through adsorption onto mnos is the prerequisite to oxidation of dyes and either electron transfer or surface complexation is the rate limiting step most workers have described the dye adsorption process rather than providing a detailed mechanism of adsorption of late although some workers have investigated the interaction between dye and sorbent there is limited work on using a surface complexation model scm and spectroscopic measurements for these systems this is crucial to understand the dye removal mechanism at the molecular level due to the presence of multiple contaminants in effluents there is more focus on competitive adsorption studies however such studies are not common for dye removal using mnos so there is a definite need for more work in this area dye degradation mechanism depends on the chemical nature of the dye the type of manganese oxide and experimental conditions such as removal time ph initial dye concentration dosage and temperature therefore these factors need to be optimized for maximum dye removal our investigation shows that there is a need for more research on the dye removal process recommendations for future work can be summarised as follows there are a large number of dyes in use with removal efficiency based on various factors including size structure of mno particles the influence of functional groups of both sorbate and the surface reaction conditions etc therefore there needs to be further research on its effects on removal efficiency as multiple pollutants are found in the dye effluents there needs to be more work focussing on the competitive adsorption of dyes from mixtures most previous studies have focused on laboratory batch or column adsorption so more work needs to focus on large scale environmental removal systems using real effluent samples more work into the recyclability of spent mnos and composites needs to be performed more spectroscopic investigations using dynamic light scattering dls for zeta potential estimation attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray absorption near edge structure xas are necessary to understand actual dye adsorption mechanism occurs at the mineral water interface although thermodynamic calculation study is an important aspect of dye adsorption only several papers have dealt with thermodynamic studies using mnos nowadays the application of density functional theory dft has been popular in the estimation of dye adsorption geometry electronic structure and energy 222 223 however such type of study is not yet applied for dye manganese oxide systems recently statistical analysis has been also applied in dye adsorption study however there are only a few studies involving statistical analysis for dye adsorption onto mnos 91 224 this could be an important research area this study should assist researchers to choose and develop more effective and robust mno systems for dye removal from wastewater declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the first author m a islam is the recipient of both

14229,dyes are priority pollutants commonly found at significant concentrations in textile effluents the presence of dyes stuffs in wastewater can cause severe problems to aquatic life and human beings therefore the removal of dyes from wastewater is important in order to minimize their hazardous effects on the environment one way of removing dyes is to use nanosized manganese oxides mnos to date there has been much work reported on the use of nanosized mnos as sorbents for dyestuffs they are promising sorbents for commercial use due to their amorphous nature high specific surface areas ssa mesoporous structure and low to the moderate point of zero charge phpzc this review summarizes the toxicity and recent advances for removing dyes from wastewater using nanosized mno sorbents the article also describes the various experimental parameters necessary for adsorption optimization such as adsorption time ph initial dye concentration amount of sorbent and temperature adsorption mechanisms investigated by various modeling approaches are also discussed in particular it was observed that much work has been reported on the use of birnessite and its composites for dye removal there are many papers reporting on the use of mno in batch mode dye removal but very few that report on the use of mno in continuous column removal systems therefore there is still a considerable need for further research to develop effective and economical large scale mno column systems for commercial use keywords dye removal nano manganese oxide sorbents optimization adsorption wastewater 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious problem in an era of rapid population growth climate change urbanization and industrialization the main groups of environmental pollutants commonly encountered are metal ions metalloids anions organic dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides natural organic matters and aromatic compounds 1 the enormous use of dyes in many industries such as paint textile tannery paper leather rubber cosmetics and plastics has resulted in the release of large amounts of colored toxic effluent and contaminated surface groundwater 2 3 about 10 000 types of commercial dyes are commonly used with around 7 105 tonnes of dyestuffs produced annually 4 around 2 of them are released in effluents 4 these dyestuffs also have a wide range of physical chemical and toxicological properties 5 responsible disposal of these dyes is a big challenge with more effective economically dye effluent treatment processes required to be developed this task is challenging as the dye concentrations in effluent water need to be very low before releasing into the environment dyestuffs are susceptible to heat chemical reagent and have the capability to generate mutagens and cancer the dyes present in water effect different aquatic lives 5 6 therefore the removal of dyes from effluents before their discharge into the aquatic environment is of great demand textile industries produce large volumes of dye effluents because of the high amounts of water used in dyeing processes 7 a number of different treatment methods for dye removal from effluent water have been investigated these are chemical oxidation 8 adsorption 1 9 11 chemical reduction 12 photo degradation 13 electrochemical oxidation 14 15 coagulation flocculation 16 membrane separation 17 18 fenton oxidation 19 and biological methods 20 each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations the adsorption process has received particular attention as it is simple generally inexpensive and may allow effective recycling of adsorbent material among metal oxide minerals nanosized manganese oxide mno is a common component of soil sediment and aquifers 21 31 naturally these occur colloidal discrete particles mixed gels and are found intermixed with iron or other minerals 32 34 they show potential in regulating environmental fate and mobility of pollutants via adsorption photochemical degradation abiotic oxidation and catalytic pathways 35 37 for example they have been shown to be effective scavengers for metal ions and dyes due to their high specific surface areas ssa low to moderate surface charge smaller particle size polymorphous and amorphous nature 36 38 42 a low point of zero charge phpzc means that cationic dyes are strongly sorbed onto their surfaces while anionic dye sorb less readily 36 43 mno is a common natural oxidant and exists in various forms consisting of layered or tunnel structures made up of mno6 octahedra 21 38 44 mno mineral materials have been investigated for a number of applications including ion exchange sensing batteries 44 45 and as dye degradation catalysts 40 45 46 as natural mno minerals contain various impurities assessing their effectiveness as sorbents to remove particular dyes can vary depending on their composition and structure consequently synthesized mno minerals with accurately known composition and structure have been used by several research groups to more effectively assess their ability as sorbents to remove dyes from solution 43 47 48 in addition manganese oxide composite or coating can be important in redox transition zones mnos coating of alumina silica and clay minerals have been characterized elsewhere 49 50 it has been suggested that mnos as a coating material or as part of composite results in a mineral material with better specific surface area ssa porosity particle size and physicochemical properties of the substrate for more effective dye adsorption 37 49 therefore in recent years mnos coating or composites have been promising sorbents for dye removal from effluents 49 51 there have been several review reports published on the removal of dye from water using sorbents these include reviews on the use of activated carbon 52 53 agricultural waste 3 4 agricultural solid waste 54 activated carbon and low cost sorbents 10 carbon nanotubes 55 mesoporous silicas 7 nanoparticles 56 low cost sorbents 57 63 cost effective and non conventional sorbents 64 biosorbents 65 functional oxide nanomaterials and nanocomposites 66 nano zero valent iron oxide 67 alternative sorbents 68 immobilised fungi 69 whole bacterial cells 70 chitosan and its derivatives 71 and clay and modified clay 72 in addition several groups have published reviews focussing on the removal of dye from wastewater 10 73 75 bharati et al 4 summarised the use of various agricultural based low cost sorbents such as coir pith orange peel rice husk straw date pit and peanut hull in removing organic dyes from wastewater they also outlined the important experimental factors involved in dye removal including the adsorption mechanism process remucal et al 76 published a systematic review focussing on the catalytic reactivity of mnos towards model organic contaminants such as phenol and its derivatives anilines antibacterial agents chelating agents endocrine disruptors dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides and surfactants they also discussed the use of manganese oxide in treating wastewater after an extensive literature survey of several years whilst there were several reviews related to the general synthesis and characterization of manganese oxide there was no review discussing the application of manganese oxide and composites as adsorbents for the removal of dye from aqueous environment therefore the purpose of the review is to summarize and discuss recently reported work on dye adsorption onto mnos together with proposed models to explain the dye adsorption mechanism applications of manganese oxides in dye adsorption processes for possible application in water treatment are discussed in addition there is a discussion on the limitations of the available data and suggestions for future research in this area 2 toxicity of dyes the textile industry produces huge amounts of contaminated water which seriously affects the environment many problems are being confronted due to dyes pollution in water in fact it is one of the most polluting industries in the world the wastewater of dye industries is the maximum polluting place among all the industrial segments producing a huge volume of effluent textile industries yield tons of dyes that are discharged as wastewater every year throughout the dyeing procedures the dyeing procedure has increased substantial care due to numerous type of contaminations prior to the 19th century all dyes were obtained from natural sources with the discovery of mauvine dye in 1856 by perkin the dye industry was revolutionized many synthetic dyes have been developed since then and comprise most of the dyes in current use after that there has been no observed back in the manufacture of synthetic dyes as these are cheap to produce have good dye properties e g respectable color stronghold and are available in a wide range of colors the most significant feature of these dyes is that these are informal to harvest on an industrial level consequently the textile industry is responsible for manufacturing and using huge amounts of dyes more than ten thousand diverse dyes are made annually with around 700 000 tons of synthetic dyes and other dying materials produced annually 77 however a large quantity of them ends up in waterways creating serious environmental issues due to their toxicity 78 79 typically a great quantity of dyes and breakdown by products are poisonous to aquatic creatures 80 textile industries use other chemicals such as detergents oils fixing waxes sizing and wetting agents waxing latex glues softeners and binders which have adverse effects on the environment that become a concluding yield of fabric wastewater and released into the atmosphere much of the toxic properties of the dyes and their release as waste products have caused in numerous difficulties the dyes that are creating as carcinogens like benzidine are maximum poisonous constant disclosure to such industrialized discards having dyes affect respiratory and skin portions the release of such dyes into water and lakes is certainly disagreeable these contaminants present in wastewaters are carcinogenic mutagenic and very toxic to all forms of life and affecting severe danger to water alive creatures wastewater from industries like coloring cosmetic textile paper food printing paint and pharmaceutical 81 82 consists of non biodegradable dyes moreover the color of these dyes can cause changes in turbidity chemical oxygen demand ph and temperature in water bodies 83 this contaminated water revises the color of lakes and streams and disturbs indigenous populace this color hinders light infiltration to profound water worrying ecology of water 84 this color disturbs clearness and class of water bodies such as lakes and rivers producing grim injury to water atmosphere the reduction in light due to the presence of dyes in lakes and rivers deceases the rate photosynthesis in aquatic plants thereby affecting aquatic populations further up the food chain aquatic life is significantly affected by obstruction of sunlight in water the decrease in light also delays the development of several types of microorganisms and produce micro toxicity for various animals including fish 85 87 because of decrease photosynthesis plants are significantly affected 87 sulphur dyes and sulphides in rivers and lakes can lower the amount of dissolved oxygen which affects the overall health of an aquatic system 87 dye polluted wastewater can also enter deep soil layers affecting groundwater quality which could be a severe fitness matter for humans and aquatic life infiltration of this sort of contaminated water into deep soil layers results in groundwater systems 88 dye waste in manufacturing sewages is a straight health danger toxic dyes reduce oxygen amount in ponds and lakes limiting the downstream utilization of water like irrigation and drinking the contact to numerous color sewages effects creature s leukaemia affecting the circulatory respiratory disease allergic reactions neurobehavioral and immune suppression disorders numerous sorts of cancers in the kidney liver and urinary bladder of labors in textile industries are described attendance of compounds like benzene toluene phenols and other hydrocarbons creates manufacturing waste cancer causing bacteriological inhabitants and mammalians are significantly affected by dyestuff industrial and textile trades azo dyes comprise 60 70 of all the carbon based dyes manufactured globally they are widely used in the cosmetic pharmaceutical textile leather paint food and paper industries unfortunately contact with azo dyes can cause skin lungs and gastrointestinal problems they also have mutagenic and carcinogenic properties and being very stable they persist in the environment for a long time these dyes can arrive body simply by digestion and roots damaging to haemoglobin dna material and persuades cancer in humans and animals unfortunately they are hard to remove from wastewater before they released into the environment maximum industrial releases cannot be salted and therefore dyes can seepage to water assets and persevere in environment owing to their constancy to light temperature soaps oxidizing agents detergent biological treatments and chemicals owing to great photo and thermal permanency to fight biodegradation dyes may continue in the atmosphere for lengthy passé of time the manufacturing sewages affect water quality and urban societies that depend on getting water quantity from these sources without any satisfactory management synthetic dyes create solely and severe ecological difficulties dyes are also found in air pollution too most of the procedures that are done in fabric industries generate the release of toxic gases and other products gaseous releases are recognized as the highest reason for air contaminations these types contaminants released from fabric industries are extensive but unluckily no information is existing to us that can correctly and precisely evaluate air quality caused by textile engineering processes toxicity information on some commonly used azo dyes is given in table 1 3 common dyes in wastewater dyes are complex organic molecules that are used commonly to impart color and to meet aesthetic appeal as priority and most available contaminants dyes are important pollutants found in most effluents 72 in order to understand the adsorption properties of dyes it is necessary to classify them normally dyes are classified into cationic anionic and non ionic dyes common cationic dyes that have been removed using mnos and their composites include methylene blue mb 40 41 46 crystal violet cv 90 brilliant green bg 91 92 and malachite green mg 93 anionic dyes include direct dyes reactive dyes and acid dyes they are responsible for severe dye pollution in the environment it is important to be able to effectively remove them from wastewater streams examples of anionic dyes include methyl orange mo 94 congo red cr 95 acid red b arb 96 rhodamine b rhb 43 orange green og 97 prussian red pr 98 alizarin red 99 rose bengal 100 basic yellow 28 and pinacyanol chloride 101 it was found from the literature that mnos have been used as sorbents to remove mb mo rhb cv and cr dye molecules from solution 4 removal of dye using manganese oxides in recent years manganese oxides their polymorphs coatings or composites have been shown to be very good sorbents to treat dye polluted water 23 commonly used manganese sorbents are hydrous manganese dioxide or birnessite δ mno2 pyrolusite β mno2 hausmannite mn3o4 manganite mnooh cryptomelane α mno2 mn2o3 and their numerous composites or coatings which are normally made by integrating them with other natural or synthetic materials 23 30 the detailed usage of various mnos in case of dye removal is discussed below the following subheadings 4 1 methylene blue methylene blue mb is a basic cationic dye of thiazine group and is also referred to as swiss blue and trimethyl thionines 59 102 it produces a blue color when dissolved in water and has numerous applications in paper coloring solar cells wool or cotton dyeing coating for paper stock and as a temporary hair color 103 mb is the most common found dye in textile effluent with numerous attempts made to remove mb from textile effluent 21 59 60 104 in particular the use of mnos and composites in mb removal has shown to be effective 21 36 38 47 76 105 111 for example huong et al 9 recently investigated the effectiveness of manganese ferrite graphene oxides go in removing mb shanghai chemical reagent co ltd china from water they noted that an increase in the amount of go from 10 wt to 50 wt resulted in an increase from 91 to 95 in dye removal capacity mb adsorption data followed pseudo second order kinetics with isotherm data fitting well to the langmuir equation they proposed a plausible mechanism for this study in terms of the main four factors fig 1 mechanism i involves electrostatic or ionic interactions and this has been attributed to the electrostatic attractions of positively charged mb molecule and negatively charged oh groups on the substrate mechanism ii involves oxygen containing groups such as hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh and epoxy c o on the basal planes and edges of go sheets in this instance surface functional groups play the role of active binding sites for mb adsorption mechanism iii involves π π conjugation which is associated with π π electron donor acceptor interactions with graphene surfaces since mb contains cc bonds and π electrons the π electrons may readily interact with the π electrons of benzene rings on the go surface by π π electron coupling mechanism iv involves photodegradation and mn fe redox synergetic effect this comprises the synergetic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis which leads to the efficient decomposition of mb moreover mn fe redox synergetic mechanism is vital in mfo catalysts for mb degradation fig 1 chen et al 111 synthesized an mn fe composite nanostructure at room temperature rt using a system containing kmno4 fe3o4 and oleic acid this composite had a high mb guang dong xilong chemical company china adsorption capacity due to a high specific surface area 96 m2 g large pore volume 0 335 cm3 g 1 and mesoporous structure it strongly bound mb due to a combination of h bonding and electrostatic attraction zhu et al 37 synthesized discrete mno2 and three mno2 coated montmorillonite composites with varying amounts of mno2 4 8 34 9 and studied the adsorption of mb beijing yili company china onto these substrates they noted that mb removal improved with an increasing amount of composite and the initial rate of mb removal increased linearly with increasing mno2 loadings the presence of h2o2 notably increased dye removal performance huang et al 112 assembled a core shell hausmannite birnessite composite which was characterized by x ray diffractometry xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and uv vis they then investigated its ability to remove mb from the solution where they found mb uptake followed pseudo second order kinetics the composite displayed a higher mb uptake capacity than pure hausmannite due to the high specific surface area ssa and nano sheet shell structure of the composite they suggested that this composite shows promise as a substrate for wastewater treatment ullah et al 109 prepared hausmannite mn3o4 using kmno4 and glycol at 80 c after characterization of the substrate they used it for the oxidative degradation of mb merck germany in water they observed it could remove nearly 80 of the dye within 1 h of contact time with dye degradation higher at lower ph dye degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics they proposed that mb degradation involved the formation of surface precursor complex between the dye and the surface functional groups and identified degradation products using hplc to be thionines resulting from n demethylation of mb debnath et al 40 used four manganese oxides such as mno bixbyite α mn2o3 hausmannite mn3o4 birnessite δ mno2 to treat water polluted with mb they observed that hausmannite was the most effective and was able to degrade 99 3 dye with an initial mb concentration of 100 mg l mb in the presence of h2o2 at 80 c contact time 1 h the greater capacity of hausmannite has been attributed to its small particle size 20 nm compared to the other minerals which had a diameter range of 26 35 nm for hausmannite mb degradation efficiency was strongly dependent on temperature increasing from 26 8 to 99 3 in 1 h as temperature increased from 30 to 80 c dye degradation was observed to a follow pseudo first order kinetics they further studied the mechanism of mb degradation with hausmannite by means of electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy esi ms analysis the degradation processes were found to be n methylation and decarboxylation of mb they proposed that oh 1o2 and o2 radicals are generated during degradation forming oh and 1o2 after 30 min and it was these reactive species that were mainly responsible for dye degradation they proposed the following reactions for the formation of these reactive species mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh mn iii h2o2 mn ii o2 2h o2 h2o oh h2o2 mn ii o2 mn iii h2o2 mn iii o2 mn ii 1o2 multiple oxidation states of mn in hausmannite mno mn2o3 accelerated the interfacial electron transfer thereby enhancing mb degradation in the presence of h2o2 various mnos reported as sorbents for the removal of mb are given in table 2 together with experimental parameters and modeling results from a large number of manganese oxides have been used as sorbents for the removal of mb composite materials have been the most effective dye removal performance has been commonly expressed in percent dye removal in most cases pseudo second order degradation kinetics was observed with a reasonable fit of the isotherm data to the langmuir equation 4 2 malachite green malachite green mg is an important cationic dye used to dye materials such as leather silk paper jute wool and cotton it is also used as a food additive and coloring agent biocide medical disinfectant etc 137 139 unfortunately the release of mg into lakes and rivers colors the water decreasing sunlight penetration it is also toxic to aquatic life due to its carcinogenic mutagenic genotoxic and teratogenic properties 139 140 despite a large amount of available toxicity data the dye is still used widely in aquaculture and other allied industries therefore the removal of mg from wastewater before releasing is necessary and very important 141 due to its emergent harmful effects research scientists have attempted to treat mg polluted water using mnos and composites 137 138 porous manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve oms 2 cryptomelane phase nanorods were prepared by hajnajafi et al 137 with a specific surface area of 93 m2 g and a pore diameter of 3 9 nm the effectiveness of this substrate was tested in catalytic degradation of 5 mg l malachite green mg in naio4 media and the results showed that the substrate could degrade 99 of the dye during 1 h at room temperature via pseudo first order kinetics furthermore they performed reusability of the spent catalyst after mg degradation in the presence of a common oxidant 30 h2o2 they noticed that after five consecutive recycle tests only a 4 decrease in degradation efficiency was observed santhi et al 93 prepared a nanocomposite of activated carbon loaded mno2 and used this composite to treat malachite green mg s d fine chem ltd india polluted water under their experimental conditions it was found that as ph of solution increased the percentage of dye removal also increased at ph 7 35 about 74 86 dye with an initial concentration of 40 mg l was removed in 30 min mg adsorption kinetic data followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data could be well described by both the langmuir and freundlich equations in another investigation hashemian et al 142 used a manganese ferrite spined composite mnfe2o4 to remove malachite green mg merck chemical company germany from water they observed that a maximum amount of dye 80 was sorbed at ph 2 0 in 30 min with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and a solid dose of 0 4 g l at 25 c the effect of the solid dose was also studied and they found that dye removal increased from 33 to 94 when the amount of composite increased from 10 mg to 40 mg this has been ascribed to the greater number of active sites available for the dye to sorb onto the substrate dye adsorption data reasonably followed a pseudo second order kinetic model work on the use of mnos and composites to treat mg polluted water together with experimental conditions and maximum removal capacity is summarised in table 3 from the table it is evident that most works had focussed on the use of composites to remove mg from water 4 3 methyl orange methyl orange mo is one of the most important classes of synthetic anionic azo dyes 147 it is widely used in the textile printing photographic and allied industries resulting in large volumes of waste mo entering the environment 148 there has also been much work on the use of manganese oxides and composites in removing mo from wastewater 94 149 150 liu et al 94 prepared two protons containing and two k containing birnessite nano structured birnessite by hydrothermal precipitation method they found that these substrates were excellent sorbents for the removal of methyl orange mo from aqueous solution the uptake of mo indicated that physical adsorption including electrostatic interactions played a dominant role in the adsorption mechanism the order of mo removal capacity over the ph range studied were h birnessite δ mno2 nanoparticles h birnessite nano sheets k birnessite nanoparticles k birnessite nano sheets superior mo removal performance of h birnessite δ mno2 indicated that k cation in the layered δ mno2 have an unfavorable effect on the mo adsorption process and the proton exchange process could be useful to improve mo adsorption affinity on δ mno2 fig 2 pandit et al 150 investigated the degradation of methyl red mr and methyl orange mo sigma aldrich usa using colloidal mno2 and found that a decolorization maximum 100 was observed below ph 5 0 with a 60 to 75 min contact time enough to completely decolorize both of the azo dyes the efficiency of decolorization also increased with increasing temperature it was found that the amount of mr removed increased from 91 72 to 100 when the temperature was increased from 26 to 50 c compared to 98 9 to 100 for removal of mo dang et al 133 investigated the removal of mb and mo using manganese oxide coated diatomite they proposed that dye degradation was responsible for a combined effect of physicochemical processes zhang et al 151 prepared two composites using birnessite δ mno2 hausmannite mn3o4 and magnesium m wire such as mno2 m and mno2 mn3o4 m and successfully used these composites as oxidants or catalysts to treat mo from wastewater in presence hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fig 3 with a contact time of 2 h 25 c and ph 2 5 the removal capacity of mo was in the order of 76 for mno2 m and 54 for mno2 mn3o4 m the promising performance of mno2 m has been ascribed to its surface morphology where birnessite provided more active sites for mn iv to be reduced to mn ii also there was no notable difference in mo removal observed with increasing solution temperature from 25 to 45 c contact time of 2 h they proposed a fenton like mechanism for mo degradation reactions involving free radical species over mno2 nanosheets the degradation proceeds by an adsorption oxidation desorption process fig 3 application of mnos and composites that have been used as sorbents for mo removal together with experimental parameters and modeling are listed in table 4 in most cases pseudo second order degradation kinetics is observed with langmuir models fitting the data well for mo removal although several research groups have dealt with mo adsorption only a few papers explain the mechanism of mo adsorption onto mnos this could be a potential future research area 4 4 rhodamine b rhodamine b rhb is a cationic xanthene dye and has been extensively used as a dye in textile and printing laser gain media flow cytometry photography tracer dye fluorescence microscopy and as a biological stain 154 156 it is severely toxic towards human and animals causing allergic dermatitis mutations skin irritations and cancer posing a significant health risk due to its large scale release from industry 154 157 158 therefore it is necessary to remove rhb from industrial effluents before they discharge into the aquatic environment in the few years several research groups have focused on the use of mnos and composites to remove degrade rhb from wastewater via oxidation 154 155 158 161 hao et al 161 investigated the adsorption of rhodamine b rhb onto hausmannite λ mno2 composite and the results unveiled that both decolorization and degradation rate could reach up to 97 and 90 respectively in 1 h reaction time at ph 3 0 the effectiveness of raw mno2 acid activated mno2 nio and zno as catalysts for oxidation of rhb merck india in aqueous medium under ambient conditions was reported by das et al 158 they noted that acid activated mno2 was able to oxidize nearly 100 of the dye with an initial dye concentration of 1 mg l and a sorbent dose of 2 5 g l with dye oxidation following pseudo first order kinetics with a view to decolorize rhb cui et al 155 prepared three different manganese oxides cryptomelane α mno2 pyrolusite β mno2 and birnessite δ mno2 to decolorize rhb solutions their specific surface areas were 84 28 and 40 m2 g respectively whereas their phpzc were 4 7 3 8 and 3 4 respectively they noticed that in all cases the dye decolorization efficiency improved with decreasing solution ph under the same conditions different minerals showed the different percentage of dye removal indicating that decolorization of rhb by minerals depend on the phpzc crystal type solution ph cryptomelane showed the maximum decolorization ability in the ph range 2 0 6 0 they proposed the dye degradation proceeded by following three steps i cleavage of ethyl groups ch3ch2 from the dye to form rh ii additional destruction of carboxylic cooh and carbonamide cnh2 groups from rhb to yield smaller species and iii mineralization of these molecular species into h2o co2 no3 and nh4 sun et al 162 tested the ability of mno2 aerogels to oxidize rhb tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china in aqueous solution the aerogel was able to remove 97 6 within 10 min at ph 2 5 the high removal efficiency is thought to be due to the high surface area ssa of the three dimensional aerogel the aerogel also degraded 86 7 of mb in 70 min they speculated that rhb adsorption onto the substrate involves the formation of nitrogen centered radicals which undergoes a two step reaction of n deethylation and consequent destruction of the backbone and mno2 aerogel was reduced from mn iv to mn ii by rhb and its derivatives to demonstrate the catalytic activity of the mn2o3 graphene composite chandra et al 120 used rhb mb and eosin merck india under uv irradiation together with 30 hydrogen peroxide initial concentrations of 12 4 and 25 μmol l respectively they noted that the composite exhibited excellent dye removal performance compared to pure manganese oxide and graphene the composite was able to degrade nearly 84 80 and 60 of mb eosin and rhb respectively under irradiation times of 2 4 h 2 2 h and 1 h respectively qin et al 163 studied the removal of rhb shanghai chemical reagent company china using the three dimensional micro flower birnessite ssa 19 7 m2 g they found for an initial concentration of 10 mg l and a sorbent dose of 0 4 g l at ph 1 0 the substrate was able to degrade nearly 100 of the dye li et al 134 prepared a flower like three dimensional composite fe3o4 kxmno2 from k birnessite nanosheets and fe3o4 microspheres with a surface area of 73 8 m2 g it was used to remove mb and rhb dye polluted water at ph 7 0 with a contact time of 2 h at 25 c the initial dye concentration was 0 5 to 5 mg l with a sorbent dose of 0 2 g l the results showed that the composite could remove over 98 rhb and 94 mb under these experimental conditions the dye removal data fits both langmuir and freundlich equations reasonably well from the literature the mechanism for rhb degradation with manganese oxides involves either the molecular approach or the electrochemical approach 154 in the molecular approach mineral hydroxyl groups or lattice oxygen can form excited oxygen species due to electron transfer in the tunnel pyrolusite structure 107 and these species cause the oxidation reaction of the rhb in the electrochemical approach mn iv is reduced to mn ii by rhb acting as a reductant reaction kinetics is dominated by the redox potential of mnox mn ii which is related to the concentration of h 164 165 a reduced ph in a suspension containing mnox increases the reduction of mnox mn ii thereby increasing dye oxidation at lower ph a summary of reported work using various manganese oxides and composites to degrade rhb is given in table 5 it is evident from this table that while much work has reported on rhb removal from wastewater using mnos and composites there has been little reported work on adsorption modeling for these systems 4 5 congo red congo red cr is a typical benzamide based anionic diazo dye 171 this type of dye is not easily biodegradable and yields a carcinogenic amine on degradation 172 many studies have investigated the effectiveness of mnos in removing cr from wastewater 45 95 173 zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr shanghai chemical reagent company china onto synthetic α mno2 micronests they found that the amount of cr sorbed significantly increased from 114 mg to 282 mg g with an increase in initial cr concentration from 50 mg l to 200 mg l with temperature having little effect on the amount sorbed dye adsorption data followed pseudo second order kinetics whereas isotherm data satisfactorily described the langmuir equation with a maximum surface coverage of 625 mg g at 22 c and ph 7 5 it was also shown that dye adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic in nature chakrabarti et al 172 investigated the adsorption of cr loba chemie india onto activated manganese oxide mnox ssa 7 55 m2 g and found it followed pseudo second order kinetics isotherm data fitted the langmuir equation well with a maximum surface loading of 38 6 mg g at an initial dye concentration of 50 500 mg l sorbent dose of 12 g l at 3 h and 25 c recently khan et al 174 studied uv and visible light photocatalytic degradation of cr sigma aldrich usa using mno2 ac composite the result showed that the composite degraded the dye more efficiently than mno2 the superior degradation capacity of the composite was due to the synergistic effect between dye adsorption on ac followed by rapid photodegradation by supported mno2 at 5 min irradiation time the composite could degrade 98 5 cr while mno2 could degrade 66 6 of the dye they proposed the probable dye degradation mechanism which could be easily understood from fig 4 during dye degradation a positively charged hole h is generated in the valence band due to excitation of mno2 molecule from the valence band to the conduction band when light falls on the surface pure mno2 mostly exist in agglomerated form and a larger portion of created electron hole pairs recombine leading to less photocatalytic activity the hole reacts with a water molecule to produce hydroxyl radical while electron present in conduction band reacts with an oxygen molecule to produce superoxide anion radical these radicals are highly reactive and degraded dye molecule into simpler species fig 4 table 6 summarises the use of various mnos for removing of congo red cr from wastewater from table 6 it is noticeable that there are only a limited number of reports on congo red cr removal using mnos and with most of them not providing any kinetic or isotherm modeling 4 6 crystal violet crystal violet cv is a typical triphenylmethane synthetic cationic dye commonly used to color paper leather wool silk leather nylon fertilizer detergent and ink for pens 177 as with many other basic dyes it is carcinogenic and a skin irritant and therefore poses a risk to the environment 177 178 so far manganese oxide and composites employed to treat cv polluted water include mno2 loaded activated carbon 91 layered nano mno2 and nanocomposite mno2 mnfe2o4 177 binary iron manganese oxide coated kaolinite 179 and nanostructure mn2o3 180 all of these investigations have suggested that a fenton type oxidation mechanism is likely to occur via the generation of hydroxyl radicals by photocatalysis or hydrogen peroxide h2o2 177 asfaram et al 91 investigated the adsorption of mb crystal violet cv and brilliant green bg merck germany using mno2 loaded activated carbon ssa 612 03 m2 g dye adsorption increased with increasing solution ph in all cases adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data fitted well to the langmuir equation maximum surface loading capacities for the composite at ph 7 0 contact time 4 h were 263 mg g for cv 234 mg g for mb and 206 mg g for br karan et al 177 investigated the degradation of cv sigma aldrich usa from water using layered nano mno2 and core shell nanocomposite mno2 mnfe2o4 in presence of h2o2 fig 5 they showed that cv degradation was faster with layered nano mno2 and reached nearly 100 in 20 min at room temperature with an initial dye concentration of 200 mg l and surface dose of 0 1 g l using electrospray ionization quadruple time of flight mass spectrometry esi q tof ms they proposed that the main degradation products identified were 4 isocyanobenzaldehyde and bis 4 dimethylamino phenyl methanone michler s ketone these products could be potentially biodegraded to harmless mineralization products table 7 summarises reported work on the use of mnos and its composites to treat cv polluted water together with experimental parameters and maximum removal capacity only two reports have dealt with kinetic and isotherm modeling in all cases the data followed pseudo second order the isotherm data described by the langmuir equation 4 7 miscellaneous dyes apart from the previously described dyes other dyes such as ethylene blue eb procion red pr basic yellow 28 basic fuchsin basic green brilliant green etc are also used extensively in the paper and textile industries 92 182 183 these dyes are usually non biodegradable and pose serious problems when released into the environment 184 they have been known to cause eye burns fast breathing and cancer several research scientists have explored the use of mnos in removing these dyes from wastewater 98 100 185 using a molten salt route sui et al 167 prepared two manganese dioxides with one dimensional crystalline structures cryptomelane α mno2 ssa 89 3 m2 g and pyrolusite β mno2 ssa 41 1 m2 g the effectiveness of these minerals as catalysts to break down dyes were tested on rhb congo red cr and ethylene blue eb using an initial concentration of 10 mg l and a sorbent dose of 30 mg at ph 7 they found that for both oxides rhb decomposition increased from 60 to 90 when contact time increased from 20 min to 60 min while α mno2 was also able to decompose nearly 90 of cr and eb within 1 h the dye degradation mechanism involved fenton like reactions procion red pr is a common highly water soluble monoazo dye it is commonly used for dyeing nylon cellulose wool and silk 178 chowdhury et al 98 investigated the oxidative decolorization of mb and procion red pr merck germany using mn3o4 in acidic media and found that at ph 3 0 the mineral was able to decolorize more than 75 of mb within 1 min with nearly 100 of the dye decolorized within 24 h observation period similar results were found for pr removal basic yellow 28 by28 is a toxic cationic dye widely used in textile industries that has long term toxic effects on aquatic life the effectiveness of zno znmn2o4 composite ssa 25 m2 g and phpzc 9 7 as a sorbent to remove basic yellow 28 by 28 from aqueous solutions was investigated by konicki et al 186 the dye adsorption data at ph 7 0 and 30 c followed pseudo second order kinetics while isotherm data were described by the langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption capacity of 48 8 mg g the effectiveness of binary iron manganese oxide coated kaolinite in removing basic fuchsin bf and crystal violet cv from aqueous solution was investigated by khan et al 179 they found that dye degradation data followed pseudo second order kinetics whereas isotherm data satisfactorily described by both the langmuir and toth models producing the maximum dye adsorption capacities for bf and cv was 10 36 mg g and 20 64 mg g respectively calculated thermodynamic parameters showed dye adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous in order to understand the catalytic degradation processes of six different organic dyes such basic green bg methyl violet mv orange ii oii methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb yao et al 170 investigated evaluated experiment of their degradation towards comn2o4 in the presence of peroxymonosulphate pms oxidant at 6 29 and 25 c the study showed that the decolorization efficiency of the various dyes was in the order bg mv oii rhb mb fb these differences are thought to be due to the difference in their molecular structures in addition the authors examined the effect of different oxidants such as peroxymonosulphate pms pds and h2o2 on rhb degradation with comn2o4 under the same experimental conditions the results show that the order of activity for dye removal was pms 100 pds 4 h2o2 1 wu et al 49 prepared four low cost mno fe2o3 composites with varying mn fe mole ratios which they then used to remove acid red b arb dye from wastewater individual surfaces and their composites removed significant amounts of arb with a ph 5 favorable for the partitioning of arb the maximum uptake capacity was 105 3 mg g however the presence of sulphate 0 05 m dramatically decreased the removal of arb from 98 to 10 7 table 8 lists work that reports on the removal of various dyes using mnos and composites under various experimental conditions it is apparent that various organic dyes are effectively removed using mnos and composites from effluents in most cases dye removal follows pseudo second order kinetics with isotherm data described satisfactorily using the langmuir equation 5 competitive dye removal studies multiple contaminants commonly exist together in the aquatic environment adsorption behavior of one contaminant in the presence of other pollutants can notably change their adsorption behavior it is therefore crucial to carry out competitive adsorption behavior experiments in order to better understand how they behave in the natural environment unfortunately only a limited number of research groups have investigated the competitive adsorption of dyes 37 144 170 196 the presence of other metal ions dyes or organic ligands such as humic substances can either enhance or inhibit the rate of degradation of organic contaminants depending upon the nature and concentration of dye as well as other reaction conditions 170 therefore the presence of other substance has a profound impact on the efficiency of dye adsorption processes wang et al 196 investigated the competitive adsorption of mb and rhb onto fe3o4 c mno2 nanocomposites the presence of rhb increased the amount of mb sorbed notably because of a synergetic effect whereas the presence of mb reduced the amount of rhb sorbed due to a competitive effect they found both single and binary solute systems kinetic data followed a pseudo second order model reasonably well for single solute systems data for both dyes were well fitted with the langmuir model isotherm data in binary solute systems followed the extended langmuir equation and sheindorf rehbun sheintuch srs models zhu et al 37 investigated the effect ha cosolute on decolorization of mb by δ mno2 montmorillonite composite mn mt 2 under two conditions i at ph 4 0 but varying the initial concentration of ha from 12 to 30 mg l and ii at a fixed ha concentration 12 mg l but varying ph from 4 0 to 5 5 they observed under these conditions that an increase of humic acid ha concentration increased the removal of mb markedly whereas the enhancement of degradation was significantly suppressed at lower ph it was suggested this is due to the promotive effect of mn ii ha complexation and competitive adsorption of mn ii and ha yao et al 170 investigated the effect of fulvic acid fa on rhb degradation by cobalt manganese oxides coxmn3 x o4 in water with an initial rhb concentration of 30 mg l sorbent dose of 20 mg l ph 6 29 with the solution at 25 c it was noted that the presence of fa reduced rhb degradation as initial the fa concentration increased from 0 0 to 80 mg l degradation reduced from 100 to 48 1 3 h reaction time suggesting that fa competed with rhb for reactive chemical groups on the substrate similarly the effect of ha on mg and rhb adsorption onto mno2 coated multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts has been investigated by ji et al 144 they found the presence of ha reduced the amount of both dyes sorbed onto the composite they suggested that there were repulsive electrostatic interactions between negatively charged ha and the surface and they also speculated the involvement of van der waals forces π π electron coupling and h bonding ha exhibited high adsorption capacity onto the surface thereby causing a competitive effect on adsorption both of dyes 6 comparative dye removal studies in order to develop more effective mno materials for dye removal it is important to investigate and compare the dye removal performance of various mnos and their related composites dye removal is also strongly dependent on experimental conditions such as ph initial dye concentration amount of solid and temperature in general composite materials have been found to have better dye removal performance than their original components working alone there have been several research groups focussing on comparative dye removal studies using mnos and composites with other substrates 128 recently amer et al 128 investigated the photodegradation of mb using four samples of mnos e g mn3o4 mn3o4 and graphene oxide composites g1m1 g3m1 and g1m3 where numbers indicate the weight ratio between components with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l sorbent dose of 1 g l 1 h of contact time at room temperature they noticed that mb followed a pseudo first order kinetic model the order of the degradation of mb dye was g3m1 100 g1m1 92 g1m3 70 mn3o4 30 zhu et al 37 reported mb removal using four manganese based minerals such as pure birnessite and three birnessite coated with montmorillonite composites with varying the amounts of birnessite mn mt 1 mn mt 2 and mn mt 3 the ssa of these substrates were 234 31 and 91 m2 g respectively they observed that dye degradation increased with a higher loading of mn oxides coatings the removal capacity under an initial mb concentration of 80 mg l and sorbent dose of 0 5 g l at 27 0 5 c was in the order of mn mt 1 90 mn mt 2 50 mn mt 3 48 birnessite 40 the different adsorption affinity and redox activity are likely due to the different crystallinity of the substrates where a decrease in crystallinity leads to an increase of ssa and redox reactivity li et al 197 investigated congo red cr removal using manganese dioxides with three different morphologies such as commercial mno2 γ mno2 microplates ssa 52 1 m2 g and γ mno2 microspheres ssa 50 2 m2 g under the same experimental conditions with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l ph 7 2 and sorbent dose of 0 1 g l they found that cr adsorption capacity was in the order γ mno2 microspheres 80 γ mno2 microplates 55 commercial mno2 25 the cr adsorption mechanism was suggested to be due to the electrostatic attraction between the porous substrate and the dye in solution at ph 7 2 as an example of the potential application of mnos in wastewater treatment fei et al 95 carried out a comparative investigation of the removal of congo red cr using synthetic mno2 hollow microspheres commercial mno2 and γ fe2o3 nanoparticles they found that synthetic mno2 exhibited a better dye removal capacity 90 compared to commercial mno2 and γ fe2o3 under an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l and a sorbent dose of 1 g l at ph 7 6 and room temperature the superior dye removal capacity of the synthetic mno2 was thought to be due to its hierarchical hollow microstructure in another comparative study zhai et al 175 investigated a number of magnetic core mno shell nanostructures for removing congo red cr from wastewater these were manganese ferrite nanoparticles substrate 1 manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 for 1 h at room temperature substrate 2 manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 at 95 c for 3 h substrate 3 layered birnessite ssa 576 4 m2 g and manganese ferrite mixed with kmno4 at 95 c for 20 h substrate 4 ssa 794 2 m2 g it was found that substrate 3 was able to remove more than 85 cr with an initial concentration of 80 mg l and a sorbent dose of 1 8 g l in 1 h at room temperature while s1 was only able to remove 43 cr furthermore the nanoparticles could be recovered by combustion at 300 c they also noted that the recovered materials were still able to remove the almost similar amount of cr even after the 3rd cycle in a previous report he et al 132 investigated the effect of birnessite mno2 nanosheets mno2 nanosheets mmt mno2 nanowires mmt montmorillonite and pure montmorillonite mmt on mb degradation at an initial concentration of 50 mg l with a contact time of 2 h at ph 2 0 and at 30 c they found that the relative degradation capacities of the minerals were in the order of mno2 nanosheets mmt 98 mno2 nanosheets 90 mno2 nanowires mmt 60 mmt 27 the high removal efficiency of the first two substrates is thought to be due to the special lamellar structure of birnessite mno2 combined with the larger ssa of the mmt 132 86 m2 g peng et al 117 synthesized four manganese oxides mno2 nanofibers mn2o3 nanostructures mn3o4 nanofibers and mnooh nanofibers whose bet surface areas were 50 20 71 and 104 m2 g respectively they then studied the catalytic degradation of mb using these substrates and tio2 in the presence of h2o2 with an initial dye concentration of 25 mg l and sorbent dose of 0 2 g l at room temperature at a contact time of 2 h dye degradation efficiency was in the order mn3o4 93 tio2 86 mnooh 85 mno2 80 mn2o3 75 the differences in dye degradation performance were thought to be due to the differences in the specific surface areas and valence states of the mn ions cao et al 121 investigated substrates consisting of mn2o3 coated onto the walls of ordered mesoporous silica sba 15 the effectiveness of these substrates to remove mb and ethanol from wastewater was then determined the substrates used were sba 15 20 mn2o3 sba 15 40 mn2o3 sba 15 and 60 mn2o3 sba 15 whose ssa were 626 402 361 and 334 m2 g respectively the results show that 40 mn2o3 sba 15 was able to sorb more mb effectively than other substrates this was thought to be due to good distribution of mn2o3 in the sba 15 mesopores while it maintained a mesoporous structure which enhanced the mb degradation at ph 7 0 and at 30 c 7 factors affecting dye removal there are several factors that play a significant role in dye removal contact time solution ph initial dye concentration amount of sorbent and temperature 173 therefore the optimization of these parameters is essential for maximum dye removal performance on a large scale in the following section some of the important factors are discussed briefly 7 1 contact time contact time is the most frequently used parameter for dye adsorption study 173 the effect of contact time is performed during dye removal by preparing a system containing known concentrations of dye and sorbent which is continually stirred and samples taken at regular time intervals 91 typically the amount of dye removal increases with increasing contact time until it reaches equilibrium 186 after this point a further increase in contact time does not change the extent of adsorption due to unavailability of surface sites in the past several research groups have investigated the effect of the contact time on dye removal using mnos 91 136 149 173 186 for instance salam et al 136 explored the effect of contact on the removal of mb by manganese oxide nanocorals moncs from an initial concentration of 5 mg l of mb using 20 mg of the sorbent at ph 8 0 and 24 c they noticed that mb adsorption reached equilibrium within 20 min with 97 of dye sorbed with no obvious difference in adsorption observed after 2 h contact time in another work kumar et al 138 examined the effect of contact time on malachite green mg adsorption onto mno2 nanoparticles they pointed out that mg adsorption initially increased very rapidly with more than 96 dye sorbed onto the substrate by 30 min after this point adsorption was very slow as saturation of the active surface sites did not permit further adsorption to take place similarly kim et al 153 investigated the degradation of mb onto mno2 carbon hybrids at three different dye concentrations 25 50 and 100 mg l to study the effect of contact time on adsorption fig 6 it was observed that rapid adsorption occurred within 10 min after which equilibrium was attained gradually the initial rapid adsorption phase was attributed to the presence of a large number of active sites the subsequent slowdown in adsorption was due to the decrease in the availability of surface sites it was also found that adsorption capacity improved with increasing initial dye concentration 7 2 solution ph ph is one of the most important factors affecting dye adsorption 121 132 186 the ph of the solution changes the surface properties sorbent as well as the speciation of the sorbate the influence of ph is usually studied by making a suspension in an electrolyte solution and then adding sorbate to the equilibrated suspension the ph of the solution is then maintained by adding standard hno3 and naoh solution until the required ph is reached typically the amount of cationic dye sorbed increases with increasing solution ph while the amount of anionic dye decreases with increasing ph 41 132 138 149 151 179 186 generally solution ph is optimized during dye removal to achieve a maximum dye removal capacity table 2 7 however the value of optimum ph is found to depend on the nature of the dye the type of mnos used and or composites investigated the effect of solution ph from 3 4 to 11 0 was studied by konicki et al 186 for basic yellow 28 by 28 adsorption onto zno znmn2o4 composite at 30 c with an initial dye concentration of 30 mg l they found that the amount of dye sorbed increased with increasing solution ph with an increase in ph from 3 4 to 11 resulting in an increase in dye adsorption from 36 4 to 55 4 mg g this is due to the sorbent having a point of zero charge phpzc of 9 7 below the phpzc there was an electrostatic interaction between positively charged surface sites and the cationic dye molecules qin et al 41 studied the effect solution ph 3 0 9 0 on mb adsorption onto freshly prepared mno2 and found that the amount of mb sorbed decreased with increasing ph up to ph 6 0 and then slightly increased across the ph range of 6 0 9 0 the amount of mb sorbed at ph 3 0 96 1 was greater than at ph 6 0 56 3 recently bhomik et al 149 studied the effect of ph on the adsorption of mo onto fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite fig 7 they found that the maximum removal of mo occurred at ph 2 0 and varied between 70 35 to 98 78 for various sorbent doses of 0 25 g l to 1 0 g l for an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l the phpzc of the composite was 7 1 so the surface was positively charged in acidic ph range therefore it is likely that electrostatic attraction between anionic mo and the nanocomposite surface is the main adsorption mechanism 7 3 initial dye concentration initial dye concentration is another important factor in which dye removal highly depends 151 173 the effect of initial dye concentration is determined by preparing a sorbate surface suspension with a fixed amount of sorbent and various initial dye concentrations with regular samples taken until equilibrium is reached 149 151 several papers have also investigated the effect of initial dye concentration on dye degradation using mnos 41 132 173 186 zhang et al 151 explored the effect of methyl orange mo concentration during its removal onto mno2 m magnesium and found that mo removal increased from 43 to 77 when dye concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l at ph 2 5 and 25 c note that a further increase in dye concentration after this point did not increase the amount of dye removal qin et al 41 investigated the effect of initial mb concentration onto mno2 and noticed that as the concentration of dye increased the amount of dye sorbed increased very rapidly and then reached equilibrium for further increase of concentration due to limited available surface sites fig 8 the shape of the curve can be considered as high affinity type adsorption at low initial dye concentration sufficient adsorption sites are available where 92 6 dye is removed at an initial concentration of 5 mg l konicki et al 186 investigated the influence of initial basic yellow 28 by 28 concentration during it adsorption onto zno znmn2o4 composite and showed that an increase of initial dye concentration from 10 to 50 mg l leads to an increase of adsorption from 25 9 to 44 mg g at ph 7 0 and 30 c this indicates that initial dye concentration plays an important role in dye adsorption onto the composite 7 4 amount of adsorbent the influence of sorbent amount on the adsorption process can be determined by first preparing a sorbate surface solution with various amounts of the sorbent then an aliquot of known initial concentration dye is added shaken and the resulting solution allowed to reach equilibrium the effect of sorbent dose was investigated by a number of researchers for dye removal using mnos 41 132 138 172 chakrabarti et al 172 demonstrated the effect of sorbent dose for congo red cr removal onto activated manganese oxide mnox and found that for an initial concentration of 500 mg l the removal capacity of cr increased from 32 to 46 when sorbent doses increased from 0 4 to 0 6 w v at 25 c and ph 7 5 this was due to the fact that increasing the amount of sorbent increases the number of active surface sites available for adsorption recently qin et al 41 investigated mb adsorption onto mno2 as a function of sorbent dose fig 9 and noted that there was a notable increase in percentage removal of mb with increasing sorbent dose with maximum adsorption capacity was achieved at a dose of 50 mg l this may be attributed to the specific surface area and available surface sites on the mno2 at a low dose the surface is likely saturated with mb so the residual mb concentration in the solution will large however at higher doses there would be excess adsorption sites leading to relatively less adsorption amount at higher sorbent dose salam et al 136 perceived the effect of sorbent dose on the adsorption of mb using manganese oxide nanocorals moncs in a dye concentration of 5 mg l ph 8 0 2 h at 24 c the results showed that increasing the sorbent dose resulted in a slight increase in the amount of mb sorbed increasing the mass of sorbent from 20 mg to 40 mg to 60 mg yielded 94 6 97 9 and 98 of the dye sorbed respectively obviously no notable increase in the dye sorbed was found by increasing the sorbent concentration 7 5 temperature textile effluents are released into the environment at a moderately high temperature it is found that solution temperature is one of the important factors they greatly affect the feasibility of environmental remediation of adsorption treatment 121 136 temperature increases the energy of activation and thereby increases the rate of dye degradation 121 136 the impact of temperature on the adsorption process can be determined by preparing a sorbate surface solutions with different initial dye concentrations mixtures are then thermostated at different temperature and allowed to come to equilibrium before determining the of adsorption is determined from these experiments enthalpy gibbs free energy and entropy in their standard state can be determined and the nature of adsorption processes can be predicted e g is it spontaneous endothermic and exothermic 72 much work has been reported on the effect of temperature during dye removal using mnos 121 136 172 173 179 186 salam et al 136 evaluated the effect of solution temperature 10 20 35 and 50 c on the removal of mb by manganese oxide nanocorals moncs adsorption was high at 10 c 90 with increase temperature only slightly increasing the amount of mb adsorbed the thermodynamic data showed that mb adsorption was both spontaneous and endothermic in nature konicki et al 186 investigated the change in solution temperature as a function of adsorption of basic yellow 28 by 28 onto zno znmn2o4 composite from 20 to 60 c at ph 7 0 and an initial concentration of 30 mg l they noted that increasing temperature caused the increase of dye adsorption from 37 8 to 45 mg g results of thermodynamic calculation confirm the dye adsorption process was driven by endothermic and physisorption process in another report chakrabarti et al 172 conducted experiments to check out the effect of temperature onto activated manganese oxide in isotherm experiments at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c where initial dye concentration was in the range of 50 500 mg l they observed that the maximum amount of dye sorbed increased from 38 61 mg g to 58 1 mg g when the temperature of the system was increased from 25 to 45 c fig 10 the adsorption process was endothermic in nature 8 adsorption mechanism a mechanistic approach is important when studying dye adsorption onto mnos as it assists in optimizing adsorption desorption and regeneration processes however no single technique can provide a complete description of sorbate mineral surface phenomena to date in order to understand the adsorption phenomena and its wide implications a combined approach of empirical surface complexation model scm and spectroscopic methods have been used 198 200 interaction of dye with mnos is usually driven by physisorption and chemisorption processes physical adsorption involves the interaction of the dye with the surface by means of van der waals forces h bonding hydrophobic polarity and steric attraction dipole dipole interaction π π interaction or combination of them 144 201 on the other hand chemisorption involves electrostatic attraction sharing of electrons transfer of electrons and formation surface precursor complexes or inner and outer sphere complexes 144 201 in addition when the diffusion mechanism is important film diffusion and particle diffusion models are considered 201 in order to understand dye degradation or adsorption processes as well as to develop an effective design model for dye removal from aqueous solution adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics equilibrium isotherm and thermodynamic data are necessary several propositions for the probable adsorption reactions taking place with these systems is discussed in the following sections 8 1 dye adsorption data modeling empirical models based on the mathematical relationship have been developed for describing both equilibrium isotherm and kinetic systems 179 202 205 up to date several kinetic and isotherm modeling has been used by researchers is summarized in table 9 8 1 1 dye adsorption kinetic modeling adsorption kinetic experiments provide information on how much time is necessary for a system to reach equilibrium for a specific sorbate mineral system 125 172 202 these studies are essential for the prediction of optimum experimental conditions in large scale adsorption processes ideally for removal of dyes from wastewater we require fast reaction rates as well as a high adsorption performance in investigating the rate controlling step and to obtain useful information regarding the adsorption process different kinetic models have been used table 9 from reported work usually it is either pseudo first order pfo and second order pso kinetic models used for describing the adsorption process onto mnos and composites 21 91 132 172 173 202 nevertheless the pseudo second order model was found to fit well for most mnos adsorption systems 21 91 149 172 however several researchers have also been used intraparticle diffusion ipd and elovich e models to describe adsorption kinetics 206 recently bhowmik et al 149 utilized the pseudo first second and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models to fit the experimental data obtained for methyl orange mo adsorption onto mixed phase fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite results indicated that the adsorption process followed a pseudo second order kinetic model chen et al 21 investigated the adsorption of mb onto porous mno2 microspheres the result exhibited good fit with a second order kinetic model that may support the surface uptake as a rate controlling mechanism in another study zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr onto synthetic α mno2 micronests and fitted the adsorption kinetic data with pseudo first and second models the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 999 gave a good description of cr assimilation onto α mno2 micronests further confirming the predominant mechanism of specific adsorption li et al 134 reported on the removal of mb and rhb onto crystalline fe3o4 kxmno2 composite and employed pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models to the data a pseudo second order model best described r2 0 999 the adsorption of the dye composite system in another study he et al 132 showed the kinetic data followed a pseudo second order model for the uptake of mb onto mno2 nanosheets mmt recently an adsorption study of mb onto manganese oxide nanocorals moncs by salam et al 136 found the data to fit well with a pseudo second order model r2 0 99 a pseudo second order approach was also found to provide a better fit than a pseudo first order kinetic model for the adsorption of methyl orange mo onto α mno2 152 8 1 2 dye adsorption isotherm modeling the equilibrium adsorption isotherm provides important information in explaining how a dye molecule will interact with the substrate 132 186 203 the adsorption isotherm is a useful tool in the adsorption process proving information about how sorbate interacts with the surface the adsorption isotherm is highly relevant to study on how sorbate mineral interact and elucidate the maximum adsorption capacity 132 186 isotherms are also necessary for the proper analysis optimization of the sorbate mineral system surface properties and successful design of the adsorption experiment because they explain how pollutants interact with the mineral surface 207 isotherm models can describe the adsorption data and relate the quantity of a sorbate in solution to the amount sorbed at a constant temperature however these models cannot provide information on the influence of the variable chemical and experimental conditions such as solution ph on uptake reactions as well as the mechanism of adsorption 179 208 moreover can be overcome by applying the thermodynamic based surface complexation model scm several empirical approaches are also briefly discussed in subsequent sections in recent years several isotherm models have been used to describe dye adsorption data in order to determine adsorption equilibrium 132 152 209 212 these models have involved either a two parameters langmuir l the linear isotherm freundlich f dubinin radushkevin d r redlich peterson r p and temkin t or b three parameters freundlich langmuir or sips isotherm s toth and multilayer isotherm such as brunauer emmet teller bet 21 among them single site langmuir and freundlich models have been widely used because of the convenience in estimating model parameters table 9 41 152 186 202 209 however a multisite site langmuir equation sometimes provides a better fit than a single site equation 207 however a lot more data is required for the adequate fitting of the multi site equation a langmuir model considers that the uptake takes place on the homogeneous surface forming a monolayer without chemical interaction or bond formation 213 on the other hand a freundlich model assumes adsorption onto a heterogeneous surface with unequal sites forming a multilayer 213 however the freundlich model does not predict the adsorption maxima while the langmuir does predict the adsorption maxima both models are useful for comparing the maximum adsorption capacities of a sorbate species as can be seen in tables 2 8 both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are widely used to explain the adsorption equilibria of pollutants onto mnos for example bhowmik et al 149 used langmuir freundlich and temkin models for the adsorption of mo onto mixed phase fe2o3 mn3o4 nanocomposite a reasonably good fit was observed using the langmuir equation with a maximum adsorption capacity of 322 58 mg g 1 zhang et al 173 investigated the adsorption of congo red cr onto synthetic α mno2 micronests and fitted the cr adsorption isotherm data to langmuir and freundlich equations they observed that the data followed the langmuir model better than the freundlich model indicating cr accumulation onto a homogeneous substrate forming a monolayer chen et al 21 investigated the adsorption of mb onto porous mno2 microspheres and fitted isotherm data was fitted to both the langmuir and freundlich models there was a better fit r2 0 999 with the freundlich model indicating heterogeneous adsorption behavior qin et al 41 applied langmuir and freundlich models to describe the adsorption isotherm data of mb onto freshly prepared mno2 and found that experimental data fitted better the langmuir model r2 0 997 when compared to the freundlich model r2 0 860 the maximum mb loading capacity onto the mno2 surface at ph 6 0 was 627 1 mg g which was higher than most of the average minerals more recently he et al 132 applied the langmuir and freundlich models to determine the adsorption mechanism of mb onto mno2 nanosheets mmt they found there was a much better fit of the data to the langmuir model in another example liu et al 152 used langmuir and freundlich models to explain the adsorption of mo onto α mno2 along with some other mnos such as birnessite pyrolusite hausmannite mn2o3 and γ mno2 results demonstrated a better fit to the langmuir model r2 0 99 at 20 c when compared to the freundlich model r2 0 79 9 regeneration desorption of spent mnos ease of reusability is an important aspect for any promising sorbent in order to minimize processing costs regeneration of mnos is necessary for wastewater treatment chemical desorption is the most frequently used regeneration process used and includes the use of reagents such as naoh hcl h2so4 methanol ethanol acetone acetic acid even water or combination of both acid and alkali 201 several papers have dealt with the regeneration of spent sorbents after dye adsorption 2 48 186 recently gong et al 2 investigated rhodamine b rhb degradation using pure mno2 and its composite mno2 m sio2 the results show good dye degradation using the composite mno2 m sio2 84 9 compared to 61 2 when using mno2 at 1 5 h of contact time an initial dye concentration of 5 mg ml ph 2 5 and sorbent dose of 0 5 g l they also conducted desorption studies under the same experimental conditions it was found that after six consecutive cycles the percentage of dye degradation for the composite and mno2 were 98 2 and 71 1 respectively indicating good reusability of the composite to assess the regeneration capacity of zno znmn2o4 composite konicki et al 186 performed desorption studies after the adsorption of basic yellow 28 by 28 onto the substrate using ethanol they point out that after three consecutive cycles the dye adsorption reduced from 42 1 to 37 2 mg g indicating good reusability of the composite salam et al 136 studied the regeneration recycling and reuse of spent manganese oxide nanocorals moncs ssa 169 m2 g used for the removal of mb using acetone as the desorption solution the spent mineral was soaked in acetone for 2 h afterward it was filtered washed in water dried and reused they found that almost the same amount of mb 98 3 sorbed after four cycles thus the spent sorbent showed an excellent recyclability capacity towards dye removal in another study by lan et al 48 explored the reusability of ultra long α mno2 nanowires for the removal of methyl violet mv from water after adsorption the spent mineral was washed repeatedly in water recovered by filtration and then regenerated under calcination at 400 c it was found that after five cycles the removal capacity of the regenerated mineral was still 99 for mv removal indicating excellent recyclability of the substrate in a report investigating rhb degradation using a comn2o4 catalyst yao et al 170 determined catalyst efficiency after five consecutive rounds at ph 6 29 rhb removal efficiency reduced slightly from 100 to 87 after 5 cycles with no obvious reduction in catalytic activity recorded furthermore the chemical stability of the catalyst was tested using x ray diffractometry xrd little change was observed in the spectra after 5 cycles indicating there was little structural change in the catalyst the stability of novel pyrolusite β mno2 nanopincers in mb degradation was tested by recycling in presence of 30 h2o2 an initial mb concentration of 10 mg l catalyst dose of 0 06 g l and 2 h contact time 221 results showed that nearly 95 of the mb could still be decomposed after three repeated cycles suggesting high stability of the catalyst in dye degradation 10 conclusions and future potential work in this review the use of a wide range of mnos as potential sorbents for removing dyes has been reported mnos have been shown to be promising substrates for dye removal on a commercial scale moreover they can be used to treat a wide range of dyes e g mb mo rhb etc in wastewater manganese based coatings or composites have exhibited superior dye removal capacity and faster initial kinetic rate for the oxidation of dye as compared to the pure substrate this is attributed to an increase in specific surface area ssa and a decrease in surface charge however there is only limited information on the reactivity of mnos coatings or composites although their importance in the natural environment has long been recognized in the case of cationic dye little or no adsorption was observed at low ph while notably higher adsorption was achieved at higher ph depending on the surface charge of adsorbents the opposite behavior was remarked for anionic dyes in most cases adsorption edges and isotherm models have been applied extensively to elucidate dye removal mechanism pseudo second order pso kinetic and langmuir models fitted dye removal data nicely in most studies most of the previous studies proposed that dye degradation involved a fenton like oxidation mechanism proceeding through hydroxyl radicals produced by photocatalysis or from peroxide generally dye adsorption was found to decrease in presence of another dye metal ion and humic acid ha due to the competition of both species for a finite number of surface sites or formation of dye metal complexes in solution it is thought that formation of surface precursor complexes through adsorption onto mnos is the prerequisite to oxidation of dyes and either electron transfer or surface complexation is the rate limiting step most workers have described the dye adsorption process rather than providing a detailed mechanism of adsorption of late although some workers have investigated the interaction between dye and sorbent there is limited work on using a surface complexation model scm and spectroscopic measurements for these systems this is crucial to understand the dye removal mechanism at the molecular level due to the presence of multiple contaminants in effluents there is more focus on competitive adsorption studies however such studies are not common for dye removal using mnos so there is a definite need for more work in this area dye degradation mechanism depends on the chemical nature of the dye the type of manganese oxide and experimental conditions such as removal time ph initial dye concentration dosage and temperature therefore these factors need to be optimized for maximum dye removal our investigation shows that there is a need for more research on the dye removal process recommendations for future work can be summarised as follows there are a large number of dyes in use with removal efficiency based on various factors including size structure of mno particles the influence of functional groups of both sorbate and the surface reaction conditions etc therefore there needs to be further research on its effects on removal efficiency as multiple pollutants are found in the dye effluents there needs to be more work focussing on the competitive adsorption of dyes from mixtures most previous studies have focused on laboratory batch or column adsorption so more work needs to focus on large scale environmental removal systems using real effluent samples more work into the recyclability of spent mnos and composites needs to be performed more spectroscopic investigations using dynamic light scattering dls for zeta potential estimation attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs and x ray absorption near edge structure xas are necessary to understand actual dye adsorption mechanism occurs at the mineral water interface although thermodynamic calculation study is an important aspect of dye adsorption only several papers have dealt with thermodynamic studies using mnos nowadays the application of density functional theory dft has been popular in the estimation of dye adsorption geometry electronic structure and energy 222 223 however such type of study is not yet applied for dye manganese oxide systems recently statistical analysis has been also applied in dye adsorption study however there are only a few studies involving statistical analysis for dye adsorption onto mnos 91 224 this could be an important research area this study should assist researchers to choose and develop more effective and robust mno systems for dye removal from wastewater declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the first author m a islam is the recipient of both
