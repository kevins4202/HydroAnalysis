oceanic missions in comparison with those having human involved in which the potential risk and operational cost could be prohibitively high shen et al 2017 these missions include environmental monitoring underwater inspection of estuaries and harbors pipeline inspection oceanographic and biological surveys marine habitat mapping offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation and obviating torpedoes etc moreira and soares 2008 zhou et al 2011 santhakumar and asokan 2013 shojaei and arefi 2015 xiang et al 2015 yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li and yan 2017 qiao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b qiao et al 2017 for an underwater vehicle to be truly autonomous it is necessary that it can be adaptive to the changing operating conditions has the ability to reject the external disturbances and can effectively complete its preprogrammed tasks without any kind of manual intervention to meet the aforementioned requirements the main task is to design a robust and efficient controller which can compensate for the hydrodynamic parametric uncertainties that affect the vehicle dynamic behaviour copes with the external disturbances guarantees the stability of the auv system under all operating conditions as well as provides good control performance the six degrees of freedom differential equations of motion of the auv are commonly used to analyze the motion behaviour of the vehicle this model is highly nonlinear and strongly coupled for the convenience of use to design the controller in practice it can be divided into three noninteracting or lightly interacting subsystems for speed control steering and diving jalving 1994 this decomposition leads to a set of separate designs for speed steering and diving control systems in jalving 1994 separate pid controllers are designed for the decoupling speed steering and diving subsystems in prestero 2001 a simple inner and outer pitch and depth loop pd depth controller is developed for the diving subsystem this paper devotes to the control strategy design for the diving subsystem as in prestero 2001 the use of optimal control theory to give a systematic procedure for the design of feedback control systems is one of the key ideas in the field of modern control petersen et al 2000 two typical optimization criterions are the 2 and infinity norms of the system the h optimal control problem aims at minimizing the infinity norm of the system that is it reduces the maximum disturbance affecting the system h controllers design for auvs can refer to campa et al 1998 feng and allen 2004 silvestre and pascoal 2007 moreira and soares 2008 cutipa luque and donha 2011 nag et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 2017 the h2 optimal control problem is the linear quadratic gaussian lqg problem formulated as a system 2 norm optimization problem formulating lqg as h2 optimization is useful since it can be generalized to include frequency domain performance specifications the h2 optimal control problem is to find out the linear time invariant controller for the plant that stabilizes the closed loop system and minimizes the system 2 norm it provides a useful technique for the design of multivariable output feedback controllers and allows the designer to deal with robustness issues in a systematic manner the h2 optimal control methodology has been applied to underwater vehicles in milliken 1984 moreira and soares 2008 fossen 2011 and wadoo et al 2012 and to surface vehicles in majohr and buch 2006 and wang et al 2014 however the aforementioned h and h2 control methods for auvs are not designed specifically for the problem of the input delay in practical applications the input delay often appears in the auv control system such kind of time delay may affect the stability and performance of the control system thus the design of the control method which can effectively deal with the input delay in the auv control system is of practical importance based on zhang 2011 a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed to deal with the problem of the depth plane motion control of an auv with output disturbances and time delay the kinematics and dynamics of the auv are firstly introduced through six degrees of freedom differential equations of motion using inertial and body fixed reference frames because of the hydrodynamic force effects the equations of motion of the vehicle are highly nonlinear and strongly coupled from the practical point of view it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model for efficient controller design therefore the depth plane dynamics of the auv are then linearized and a linear and reduced order model is obtained by utilizing this linearized and reduced order model a robust h2 optimal control method is developed which takes into account both the output disturbances and time delay considering that the model of the auv is uncertain due to the varying environmental conditions thereby the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method are investigated simulation results show that the proposed robust h2 optimal control strategy has good performance and holds many advantages comparing to the pitch and depth loop pd depth controller prestero 2001 including higher tracking accuracy better output disturbances rejection ability stronger robustness against model uncertainties and smaller fin angle input the structure of this paper is as follows the auv modeling including the six degrees of freedom nonlinear kinematic and dynamic models and the linearized depth plane model is described in section 2 in section 3 a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed for the depth plane motion of the auv in the presence of output disturbances and time delay and the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method under model uncertainties are also discussed in section 4 the simulation results and comparisons with the existing pitch and depth loop pd depth controller are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 auv modeling the vehicle considered in this study is the remus auv fig 1 developed by von alt and associates at the woods hole oceanographic institute s oceanographic system laboratory whoi osl von alt and grassle 1992 the remus is a small low cost auv used for autonomous docking long range oceanographic survey and shallow water mine reconnaissance von alt et al 1994 it is equipped with four identical control fins mounted in a cruciform pattern near the aft end of the hull the equations of motion of the remus auv are given as follows 2 1 nonlinear model of the remus auv the notations used in this paper are in accordance with sname sname 1950 to determine the six degrees of freedom nonlinear equations of motion of the auv two reference frames are generally considered one is the inertial or the earth fixed frame which is considered to be stationary and the other is the body fixed frame which is assumed to be fixed to the body of the vehicle and moves along with it the diagram of the vehicle coordinate systems is shown in fig 1 the inertial and the body fixed frames are represented by two vectors η

roll pitch and yaw υ u v w p q r t is the linear and angular velocities vector of the vehicle with respect to the body fixed frame u v w r are the surge sway and heave velocities p q r r are the corresponding angular velocities through the coordinate frame transition the kinematics of the remus auv are described as prestero 2001 1 x y z c ψ c θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ s θ c ϕ s ψ c θ

1 note that j 2 η is not defined for pitch angle θ 90 however as reported in do and pan 2009 auvs are not likely to enter the neighbourhood of θ 90 because of the metacentric restoring forces thus the singularity of j 2 η is not ordinarily approached given that the body fixed frame is centered at the vehicle center of buoyancy the six degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic equations of motion of the

cross products of inertia i x y i x z and i y z are assumed to be small and are neglected in the above dynamic equations of motion similarly the equations do not include zero valued coefficients prestero 2001 2 2 linearized depth plane model of the remus auv the above vehicle model is highly nonlinear and strongly coupled from the practical point of view it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model for efficient controller design therefore the decomposition of the whole auv system into speed steering and diving subsystems as presented in jalving 1994 is chosen in this paper we only consider the diving motion of the auv assuming that z g is small the simplified vehicle depth plane dynamics are given by prestero 2001 4a m z w w m x g z q q z w w m u z q q z δ s δ s 4b m x g m w w i y y m q q m w w m x g u m q q m θ θ m δ s δ s where u is the steady state forward velocity of the vehicle z w z q m w m q are the combined terms m θ is the hydrostatic term and z δ s and m δ s are the fin lift and moment coefficients respectively the reduced kinematic equations of motion are described as prestero 2001 5a z w u θ 5b θ q combining 4 and 5 allow us to obtain 6 m x u

the above model can be further simplified to 7 i y y m q 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 q z θ m q 0 m θ 0 0 u 1 0 0 q z θ m δ s 0 0 δ s writing the above equation in state space form yields 8 q z θ m q i y y m q 0 m θ i y y m q 0 0 u 1 0 0 q z θ m δ s i y y m q 0 0 δ s the model 8 is well suited for controller design now we will derive the vehicle transfer functions for the subsequent control strategy design we first derive the transfer function for the inner pitch loop relating input stern plane angle δ s to the output pitch angle θ by taking the laplace transform of the state space equation 8 we can obtain the pitch open loop transfer function θ s δ s s as 9 θ s δ s s m δ s i y y m q s 2 m q i y y m q s m θ i y y m q k s 2 2 ξ ϖ s ϖ 2 where the gain constant k is k m δ s i y y m q and the natural frequency ϖ and the relative damping ratio ξ are 10 ϖ m θ i y y m q ξ m q 2 m θ i y y m q next we will derive the transfer function for the outer depth loop which relates the input pitch angle θ d to the output depth z in practice the inner pitch loop responses are sufficiently fast enough in contrast to the outer depth loop therefore we can consider the desired pitch angle θ d to be the same as the actual pitch angle θ in the same way taking the laplace transform of 8 we get the depth open loop transfer functions as 11 z s θ s u s supposing that there exists input delay then the open loop transfer function of the pitch loop becomes 12 g s θ s δ s s e τ s k e τ s s 2 2 ξ ϖ s ϖ 2 where τ is a positive real number denoting the time delay and the open loop transfer function of the depth loop is 13 g 1 s z s θ s u s 3 robust h2 optimal depth control strategy design the vehicle depth plane control system can be summarized as the following block diagram in fig 2 θ d is the desired vehicle pitch angle z d is the desired vehicle depth e θ and e z are the corresponding pitch angle and depth errors respectively d and d 1 are the output disturbances of the pitch and depth loops respectively c is the pitch loop controller and c 1 is the depth loop controller the aim of this paper is to design the controllers c and c 1 for the inner pitch and outer depth loops respectively with the consideration of the output disturbances and time delay the h2 optimal control design methods proposed in zhang 2011 will be used in the two controllers design the design of the robust h2 optimal controllers c and c 1 are based on the internal model control imc structure morari and zafiriou 1989 the imc structure of the vehicle depth plane control system is shown in fig 3 where g is the pitch loop plant g is the pitch loop model q is the design pitch loop transfer function g 2 g 1 g 0 is the depth loop plant g 0 is the real closed loop transfer function of the pitch loop g 1 is the real open loop transfer function of the depth loop g 2 g 1 g 0 is the depth loop model g 0 is the nominal closed loop transfer function of the pitch loop g 1 is the nominal open loop transfer function of the depth loop and q 1 is the design depth loop transfer function assuming that the depth plane model is exact the sensitivity transfer function and the complementary transfer function for the pitch loop are given by 14a s s 1 1 g s c s 14b t s g s c s 1 g s c s and the sensitivity transfer function and the complementary transfer function for the depth loop are given by 15a s 1 s 1 1 g 2 s c 1 s 15b t 1 s g 2 s c 1 s 1 g 2 s c 1 s defining the transfer functions q and q 1 as 16 q s c s 1 g s c s 17 q 1 s c 1 s 1 g 2 s c 1 s it follows that 18a s s 1 g s q s 18b t s g s q s and 19a s 1 s 1 g 2 s q 1 s 19b t 1 s g 2 s q 1 s from 16 and 17 the imc based controllers c and c 1 are given by 20 c s q s 1 g s q s 21 c 1 s q 1 s 1 g 2 s q 1 s the following lemma is essential to derive the proposed robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers c and c 1 lemma 1 zhou 1998 introduce the symbol l 2 for the family of all strictly proper functions with no poles on the imaginary axis let h 2 denote the subset of l 2 and analytic in res 0 h 2 analytic in res 0 and h 2 h 2 the set of all sums every function f s in l 2 can be uniquely expressed as f f 1 f 2 f 1 h 2 f 2 h 2 then 22 f 1 f 2 2 2 f 1 2 2 f 2 2 2 3 1 robust h2 optimal pitch loop controller design g s given in equation 12 can be rewritten in the following form 23 g s k e τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 where k k ϖ 2 τ 1 ξ ϖ 1 ϖ ξ 2 1 and τ 2 ξ ϖ 1 ϖ ξ 2 1 remark 3 according to the hydrodynamic coefficients of the remus auv given in prestero 2001 we obtain that res τ 1 0 and res τ 2 0 thus g s is stable the details can be seen in section 4 by using the first order taylor expansion of e τ s we obtain 24 g s k 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 the h2 optimal index is chosen as 25 min w s s s 2 where w s is the weighting function although the following design procedure is sufficiently general for ramp or more complex inputs we consider only step input for clarity hence w s 1 s remark 4 normally there are abundant sinusoidal signals whose amplitudes decrease with frequencies in a step signal therefore the step signal is a reasonable and sufficiently strict choice for system analysis according to zhang 2011 to guarantee internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system q s should be stable and the following constraint condition should be met 26 lim s 0 s s lim s 0 1 g s q s 0 26 gives 27 q 0 1 g 0 1 k the set of all the stable transfer functions q s satisfying the above constraint condition can be written as 28 q s 1 k s q s where q s is stable therefore the function to be minimized can be written as w s s s 2 2 1 s 1 g s 1 k s q s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 29 1 τ s 1 τ s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 1 τ s k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 since 1 τ s 1 τ s is an all pass transfer function by the definition of 2 norm it is easy to verify that the 2 norm of a transfer function keeps its value after an all pass transfer function is introduced to it thus we have w s s s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 1 τ s k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 30 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 according to lemma 1 we have 31 w s s s 2 2 2 τ 1 τ s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 temporarily relax the requirement on the properness of q s to minimize the right hand side of 31 the only choice is 32 q o p t s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ k 1 τ s substituting 32 into 28 yields the optimal q s as q o p t s 1 k s q o p t s 33 τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s note that q o p t s is improper due to that the order of its numerator is greater than the order of its denominator to make it proper a filter for which numerator order is less than the denominator order should be introduced meanwhile the filter should ensure the internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system i e q o p t s j s is stable and 34 lim s 0 1 g s q o p t s j s 0 with this in mind we choose the following filter 35 j s 1 λ s 1 where λ is the performance degree and it is a positive real number thus the suboptimal q s after introducing the filter is q s q o p t s j s 36 τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s λ s 1 from 20 the controller that makes the unity feedback pitch loop control system internally stable and has a zero steady state error for a step reference can be obtained as c s q s 1 g s q s 37 1 k τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 λ τ s 2 λ 2 τ s 3 2 robust h2 optimal depth loop controller design g 2 s in fig 3 can be written in the following form g 2 s g 1 s g 0 s g 1 s g s q s u s 1 τ s λ s 1 τ s 1 38 k 1 τ s s λ s 1 τ s 1 where k u and λ and τ are all positive real numbers that defined above the h2 optimal index is chosen as 39 min w 1 s s 1 s 2 where w 1 s is the weighting function like in section 3 1 here we also consider the step input for clarity thus w 1 s 1 s according to zhang 2011 to guarantee the internal stability of the closed loop system q 1 s should be stable and the following constraint condition should be met 40 lim s 0 1 g 2 s q 1 s 0 the set of all the stable transfer functions q 1 s satisfying the above constraint condition can be expressed as 41 q 1 s s 1 s q 1 s k where q 1 s is stable this leads to w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 1 s 1 1 τ s 1 s q 1 s λ s 1 τ s 1 2 2 λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 τ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 τ s 1 2 2 42 1 τ s 1 τ s λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 since 1 τ s 1 τ s is an all pass transfer function we can obtain that w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 43 2 τ 1 τ s λ λ s 1 q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 from lemma 1 we have 44 w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 2 τ 1 τ s 2 2 λ λ s 1 q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 evidently q 1 o p t s λ gives the optimal solution which implies 45 q 1 o p t s s 1 s q 1 o p t s k s 1 λ s k a filter should be introduced to make q 1 o p t s proper meanwhile the filter should satisfy the constraints of the internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system however since g 2 s contains an integrator the constraints of the asymptotic property will be different from those in the pitch closed loop system according to zhang 2011 here the constraints of the internal stability and the asymptotic property that the filter should meet are that q 1 o p t s j 1 s is stable and 46a lim s 0 1 g 2 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 0 46b lim s 0 d d s 1 g 2 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 0 taking these into account the following filter is introduced 47 j 1 s 3 λ 2 τ s 1 λ s 1 3 where λ is the performance degree and it is a positive real number therefore the suboptimal q 1 s is q 1 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 48 1 k s λ s 1 3 λ 2 τ s 1 λ s 1 3 from 21 the unity feedback depth loop controller is obtained as c 1 s q 1 s 1 g 2 s q 1 s 49 1 k λ s 1 τ s 1 3 λ 2 τ s 1 λ 3 τ s 3 3 λ 2 τ λ 3 s 2 6 λ τ 3 λ 2 2 τ 2 s remark 5 in this paper we only investigate the controllers design for the diving subsystem however the controllers design for the speed and steering subsystems can also use the same design methods 3 3 robust stability and robust performance discussion in practical applications uncertainties always exist in the auv model assuming that the uncertainties in the pitch and depth loops are described by the multiplicative unstructured uncertainty m s and 1 m s respectively that is g j ω g j ω g j ω δ m j ω and g 2 j ω g 2 j ω g 2 j ω δ 1 m j ω then according to zhou 1998 for every frequency the pitch closed loop system is robust stable if and only if 50 t s δ m s 1 and the depth closed loop system is robust stable if and only if 51 t 1 s δ 1 m s 1 although the robustness of the pitch and depth closed loop systems can be rigorously calculated according to the aforementioned criterions they are seldom adopted in practice because of their complexity there are usually strong constraints for the simplicity of tuning rules in practices the robust performance implies both robust stability and nominal performance it is desirable to make w s s s and w 1 s s 1 s small for good nominal performance and at the same time make t s m s and t 1 s 1 m s small for good robust stability unfortunately the interdependence of s s t s 1 and s 1 s t 1 s 1 makes the objective a challenge improving the nominal performance worsens the robust stability and pushes the system close to instability conversely good robust stability may be obtained by sacrificing the nominal performance therefore how to reach a good tradeoff between nominal performance and robust stability is the main problem in control system design for classical methods it may be difficult to make a clear and reasonable tradeoff between nominal performance and robustness some new methods may be capable of making the tradeoff if the uncertainty profile is known however when the performance specification is changed or the uncertainty offsets one must redesign the controller the operator usually has no ability to redesign the controller the designed robust h2 optimal controllers are effective to tune the nominal performance and robustness quantitatively it can be verified that the larger the performance degrees λ and λ the better the robustness but too large λ and λ will worsen the nominal performance based on the analysis a simple and quantitative engineering tuning procedure developed by zhang et al 2006 is recommended here increase λ and λ monotonically until the required pitch and depth loop responses are obtained normally the step is 0 01 τ since λ and λ are directly related to the closed loop responses of the pitch and depth loops the operating personnel can use these two parameters as a knob when the knowledge about the auv model is rich or the uncertainties reduce a good nominal performance can be demanded by decreasing λ and λ when the knowledge about the auv model is poor or the uncertainties increase a good robustness must be demanded by increasing λ and λ 4 simulation results here some computer simulations are performed on the remus auv to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy the linearized maneuvering nominal coefficient values of the remus auv in depth plane are taken from prestero 2001 and are listed in table 1 substituting the coefficient values in table 1 into 9 and 10 we calculate that k 4 15 ϖ 0 83 and ξ 0 5 then k τ 1 and τ 2 can be calculated from 23 as k 6 02 τ 1 0 602 1 04 j and τ 2 0 602 1 04 j assuming that the input delay is τ 0 4 s and substituting the above calculated parameter values into 23 and 37 we obtain the open loop transfer function g s of the pitch loop and the unity feedback pitch loop controller c s as 52 g s 4 15 e 0 4 s s 2 0 83 s 0 69 53 c s 1 0 602 1 45 s 2 1 2 s 1 0 4 λ s 2 λ 0 8 s usually the velocity of the underwater vehicles varies between 1 m s and 4 m s in this study the velocity of the vehicle is considered to be u 1 m s as in nag et al 2013 thus k u 1 substituting the values of u k and τ into 13 and 49 results in the open loop transfer function g 1 s of the depth loop and unity feedback depth loop controller c 1 s as 54 g 1 s 1 s 55 c 1 s λ s 1 0 4 s 1 3 λ 0 8 s 1 0 4 λ 3 s 3 1 2 λ 2 λ 3 s 2 2 4 λ 3 λ 2 0 32 s the initial conditions of the vehicle are chosen as z 0 0 m and θ 0 0 deg applying the aforementioned setting we measure the unit step input responses of the proposed control strategy to demonstrate the output disturbances rejection capability of the designed control strategy unit step output disturbances d and d 1 are added to the pitch and depth loops at 500 s and 900 s respectively here comparisons of control performances are made between the robust h2 optimal control strategy proposed in this study and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the controller proposed in prestero 2001 is consisted of an inner pd pitch loop and an outer proportional depth loop we present simulation results for two cases the first case is with the assumption that the vehicle dynamic model is accurate and it is equal to its nominal dynamic model the second case is with the assumption that the vehicle dynamic model is uncertain and the uncertain vehicle dynamic model is created by introducing parametric uncertainties we proceed as follows 4 1 simulations in the absence of the model uncertainties in this case it is assumed that there are no uncertainties in the vehicle dynamic model and thus the actual vehicle dynamic model is equal to its nominal dynamic model the robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers 53 and 55 proposed in this study and the pitch and depth loop pd depth controller presented in prestero 2001 are simulated simultaneously to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for the robust h2 optimal control strategy proposed in this study the filter parameter values of λ and λ are founded as λ 10 2 and λ 15 8 for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the proportional and derivative gains for the pitch loop pd controller are chosen as k p 0 21 and τ d 2 and the proportional gain for the depth loop proportional controller is chosen as γ 1 3 the above control gains are selected by trial and error the obtained results are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrates the step responses of the nominal vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 figs 4 a c and e present the response results with the robust h2 optimal control strategy figs 4 b d and f present the response results with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 from figs 4 a d it can be seen that both control methods provide precise tracking for the nominal system before adding the output disturbances but after adding the output disturbances at the instants 500 s and 900 s it is observed in figs 4 a d that the robust h2 optimal control strategy effectively rejects the output disturbances in both pitch and depth loops and still guarantees precise tracking while the controller proposed in prestero 2001 can not effectively reject the output disturbance in pitch loop which leads to non zero steady state depth error about 0 6 m in addition it is also seen in figs 4 a d that although the settling time is shorter for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 than for the robust h2 optimal control strategy there is serious oscillatory behaviour for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 before system settling figs 4 e and f plot the fin angles of the vehicle with respect to the nominal vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 fig 4 e shows the response curve of the fin angle with the robust h2 optimal control strategy fig 4 f shows the response curve of the fin angle with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 as observed in the two figures too large fin angle is produced by the controller proposed in prestero 2001 at the initial instant and the instants when the output disturbances are added i e the instants 500 s and 900 s compared with the robust h2 optimal control strategy such overlarge fin angle can not be achieved in practical applications due to the limit of the saturation 4 2 simulations in the presence of the model uncertainties to reflect the robustness of the proposed control strategy against model uncertainties an uncertain model of the depth plane dynamics of the auv is considered in this case the uncertain vehicle dynamic model is created by introducing parametric uncertainties here as in nag et al 2013 it is assumed that the estimation uncertainty of the fin lift moment m δ s is 20 of its nominal value the uncertainties in the values of added mass term m q and hydrostatic moment m θ are 25 of their respective nominal values meanwhile the uncertainty in the value of velocity u is assumed to be 10 of its nominal value the robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers 53 and 55 generated based on the nominal dynamic model are utilized to deal with the uncertainties the control gains for the robust h2 optimal control strategy of this study and the controller of prestero 2001 are taken the same values as in the first case the obtained results are shown in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 displays the step responses of the uncertain vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the response results with the robust h2 optimal control strategy are plotted in figs 5 a c and e the response results with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 are plotted in figs 5 b d and f comparing fig 5 with fig 4 it is clearly seen that the controller proposed in prestero 2001 gives more oscillation and worse tracking accuracy under the model uncertainties while the proposed robust h2 optimal control strategy is rarely affected by the model uncertainties and thus shows better robustness than the controller proposed in prestero 2001 also as in the first case it is observed in figs 5 e and f that the fin angle for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 is too large at the initial instant and the instants 500 s and 900 s which is not suitable for practical engineering the verification of the robust stability of pitch and depth loops with the robust h2 optimal control strategy is shown in fig 6 it is clearly seen from figs 6 a and b that t s 1 m s and t 1 s 1 1 m s thus the pitch and depth closed loop systems are robust stable 5 conclusions for the depth plane motion control problem of an auv with output disturbances and time delay a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed in this paper the kinematic and dynamic models of the auv are firstly described using the inertial and body fixed reference frames for efficient controller design in practical applications it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model thus a linearized and reduced order model of the auv is then derived using the depth plane dynamics of the auv based on this linearized and reduced order model a robust h2 optimal control method is developed the developed control method can effectively deal with the time delay as well as the output disturbances and guarantees desired tracking considering that the uncertainties exist in the auv dynamic model due to the changing operating conditions the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method are discussed simulations are performed on the remus auv the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control approach on dealing with the output disturbances time delay as well as model uncertainties and verify the improved performances of the proposed control approach namely higher tracking accuracy better output disturbances rejection ability stronger robustness against model

oceanic missions in comparison with those having human involved in which the potential risk and operational cost could be prohibitively high shen et al 2017 these missions include environmental monitoring underwater inspection of estuaries and harbors pipeline inspection oceanographic and biological surveys marine habitat mapping offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation and obviating torpedoes etc moreira and soares 2008 zhou et al 2011 santhakumar and asokan 2013 shojaei and arefi 2015 xiang et al 2015 yan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 li and yan 2017 qiao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b qiao et al 2017 for an underwater vehicle to be truly autonomous it is necessary that it can be adaptive to the changing operating conditions has the ability to reject the external disturbances and can effectively complete its preprogrammed tasks without any kind of manual intervention to meet the aforementioned requirements the main task is to design a robust and efficient controller which can compensate for the hydrodynamic parametric uncertainties that affect the vehicle dynamic behaviour copes with the external disturbances guarantees the stability of the auv system under all operating conditions as well as provides good control performance the six degrees of freedom differential equations of motion of the auv are commonly used to analyze the motion behaviour of the vehicle this model is highly nonlinear and strongly coupled for the convenience of use to design the controller in practice it can be divided into three noninteracting or lightly interacting subsystems for speed control steering and diving jalving 1994 this decomposition leads to a set of separate designs for speed steering and diving control systems in jalving 1994 separate pid controllers are designed for the decoupling speed steering and diving subsystems in prestero 2001 a simple inner and outer pitch and depth loop pd depth controller is developed for the diving subsystem this paper devotes to the control strategy design for the diving subsystem as in prestero 2001 the use of optimal control theory to give a systematic procedure for the design of feedback control systems is one of the key ideas in the field of modern control petersen et al 2000 two typical optimization criterions are the 2 and infinity norms of the system the h optimal control problem aims at minimizing the infinity norm of the system that is it reduces the maximum disturbance affecting the system h controllers design for auvs can refer to campa et al 1998 feng and allen 2004 silvestre and pascoal 2007 moreira and soares 2008 cutipa luque and donha 2011 nag et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 2017 the h2 optimal control problem is the linear quadratic gaussian lqg problem formulated as a system 2 norm optimization problem formulating lqg as h2 optimization is useful since it can be generalized to include frequency domain performance specifications the h2 optimal control problem is to find out the linear time invariant controller for the plant that stabilizes the closed loop system and minimizes the system 2 norm it provides a useful technique for the design of multivariable output feedback controllers and allows the designer to deal with robustness issues in a systematic manner the h2 optimal control methodology has been applied to underwater vehicles in milliken 1984 moreira and soares 2008 fossen 2011 and wadoo et al 2012 and to surface vehicles in majohr and buch 2006 and wang et al 2014 however the aforementioned h and h2 control methods for auvs are not designed specifically for the problem of the input delay in practical applications the input delay often appears in the auv control system such kind of time delay may affect the stability and performance of the control system thus the design of the control method which can effectively deal with the input delay in the auv control system is of practical importance based on zhang 2011 a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed to deal with the problem of the depth plane motion control of an auv with output disturbances and time delay the kinematics and dynamics of the auv are firstly introduced through six degrees of freedom differential equations of motion using inertial and body fixed reference frames because of the hydrodynamic force effects the equations of motion of the vehicle are highly nonlinear and strongly coupled from the practical point of view it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model for efficient controller design therefore the depth plane dynamics of the auv are then linearized and a linear and reduced order model is obtained by utilizing this linearized and reduced order model a robust h2 optimal control method is developed which takes into account both the output disturbances and time delay considering that the model of the auv is uncertain due to the varying environmental conditions thereby the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method are investigated simulation results show that the proposed robust h2 optimal control strategy has good performance and holds many advantages comparing to the pitch and depth loop pd depth controller prestero 2001 including higher tracking accuracy better output disturbances rejection ability stronger robustness against model uncertainties and smaller fin angle input the structure of this paper is as follows the auv modeling including the six degrees of freedom nonlinear kinematic and dynamic models and the linearized depth plane model is described in section 2 in section 3 a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed for the depth plane motion of the auv in the presence of output disturbances and time delay and the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method under model uncertainties are also discussed in section 4 the simulation results and comparisons with the existing pitch and depth loop pd depth controller are presented finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 auv modeling the vehicle considered in this study is the remus auv fig 1 developed by von alt and associates at the woods hole oceanographic institute s oceanographic system laboratory whoi osl von alt and grassle 1992 the remus is a small low cost auv used for autonomous docking long range oceanographic survey and shallow water mine reconnaissance von alt et al 1994 it is equipped with four identical control fins mounted in a cruciform pattern near the aft end of the hull the equations of motion of the remus auv are given as follows 2 1 nonlinear model of the remus auv the notations used in this paper are in accordance with sname sname 1950 to determine the six degrees of freedom nonlinear equations of motion of the auv two reference frames are generally considered one is the inertial or the earth fixed frame which is considered to be stationary and the other is the body fixed frame which is assumed to be fixed to the body of the vehicle and moves along with it the diagram of the vehicle coordinate systems is shown in fig 1 the inertial and the body fixed frames are represented by two vectors η

roll pitch and yaw υ u v w p q r t is the linear and angular velocities vector of the vehicle with respect to the body fixed frame u v w r are the surge sway and heave velocities p q r r are the

1 note that j 2 η is not defined for pitch angle θ 90 however as reported in do and pan 2009 auvs are not likely to enter the neighbourhood of θ 90 because of the metacentric restoring forces thus the singularity of j 2 η is not ordinarily approached given that the body fixed frame is centered at the vehicle center of buoyancy the six degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic equations of motion of the

cross products of inertia i x y i x z and i y z are assumed to be small and are neglected in the above dynamic equations of motion similarly the equations do not include zero valued coefficients prestero 2001 2 2 linearized depth plane model of the remus auv the above vehicle model is highly nonlinear and strongly coupled from the practical point of view it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model for efficient controller design therefore the decomposition of the whole auv system into speed steering and diving subsystems as presented in jalving 1994 is chosen in this paper we only consider the diving motion of the auv assuming that z g is small the simplified vehicle depth plane dynamics are given by prestero 2001 4a m z w w m x g z q q z w w m u z q q z δ s δ s 4b m x g m w w i y y m q q m w w m x g u m q q m θ θ m δ s δ s where u is the steady state forward velocity of the vehicle z w z q m w m q are the combined terms m θ is the hydrostatic term and z δ s and m δ s are the fin lift and moment coefficients respectively the reduced kinematic equations of motion are described as prestero 2001 5a z w u θ 5b θ q combining 4 and 5 allow us to obtain 6 m x u

first derive the transfer function for the inner pitch loop relating input stern plane angle δ s to the output pitch angle θ by taking the laplace transform of the state space equation 8 we can obtain the pitch open loop transfer function θ s δ s s as 9 θ s δ s s m δ s i y y m q s 2 m q i y y m q s m θ i y y m q k s 2 2 ξ ϖ s ϖ 2 where the gain constant k is k m δ s i y y m q and the natural frequency ϖ and the relative damping ratio ξ are 10 ϖ m θ i y y m q ξ m q 2 m θ i y y m q next we will derive the transfer function for the outer depth loop which relates the input pitch angle θ d to the output depth z in practice the inner pitch loop responses are sufficiently fast enough in contrast to the outer depth loop therefore we can consider the desired pitch angle θ d to be the same as the actual pitch angle θ in the same way taking the laplace transform of 8 we get the depth open loop transfer functions as 11 z s θ s u s supposing that there exists input delay then the open loop transfer function of the pitch loop becomes 12 g s θ s δ s s e τ s k e τ s s 2 2 ξ ϖ s ϖ 2 where τ is a positive real number denoting the time delay and the open loop transfer function of the depth loop is 13 g 1 s z s θ s u s 3 robust h2 optimal depth control strategy design the vehicle depth plane control system can be summarized as the following block diagram in fig 2 θ d is the desired vehicle pitch angle z d is the desired vehicle depth e θ and e z are the corresponding pitch angle and depth errors respectively d and d 1 are the output disturbances of the pitch and depth loops respectively c is the pitch loop controller and c 1 is the depth loop controller the aim of this paper is to design the controllers c and c 1 for the inner pitch and outer depth loops respectively with the consideration of the output disturbances and time delay the h2 optimal control design methods proposed in zhang 2011 will be used in the two controllers design the design of the robust h2 optimal controllers c and c 1 are based on the internal model control imc structure morari and zafiriou 1989 the imc structure of the vehicle depth plane control system is shown in fig 3 where g is the pitch loop plant g is the pitch loop model q is the design pitch loop transfer function g 2 g 1 g 0 is the depth loop plant g 0 is the real closed loop transfer function of the pitch loop g 1 is the real open loop transfer function of the depth loop g 2 g 1 g 0 is the depth loop model g 0 is the nominal closed loop transfer function of the pitch loop g 1 is the nominal open loop transfer function of the depth loop and q 1 is the design depth loop transfer function assuming that the depth plane model is exact the sensitivity transfer function and the complementary transfer function for the pitch loop are given by 14a s s 1 1 g s c s 14b t s g s c s 1 g s c s and the sensitivity transfer function and the complementary transfer function for the depth loop are given by 15a s 1 s 1 1 g 2 s c 1 s 15b t 1 s g 2 s c 1 s 1 g 2 s c 1 s defining the transfer functions q and q 1 as 16 q s c s 1 g s c s 17 q 1 s c 1 s 1 g 2 s c 1 s it follows that 18a s s 1 g s q s 18b t s g s q s and 19a s 1 s 1 g 2 s q 1 s 19b t 1 s g 2 s q 1 s from 16 and 17 the imc based controllers c and c 1 are given by 20 c s q s 1 g s q s 21 c 1 s q 1 s 1 g 2 s q 1 s the following lemma is essential to derive the proposed robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers c and c 1 lemma 1 zhou 1998 introduce the symbol l 2 for the family of all strictly proper functions with no poles on the imaginary axis let h 2 denote the subset of l 2 and analytic in res 0 h 2 analytic in res 0 and h 2 h 2 the set of all sums every function f s in l 2 can be uniquely expressed as f f 1 f 2 f 1 h 2 f 2 h 2 then 22 f 1 f 2 2 2 f 1 2 2 f 2 2 2 3 1 robust h2 optimal pitch loop controller design g s given in equation 12 can be rewritten in the following form 23 g s k e τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 where k k ϖ 2 τ 1 ξ ϖ 1 ϖ ξ 2 1 and τ 2 ξ ϖ 1 ϖ ξ 2 1 remark 3 according to the hydrodynamic coefficients of the remus auv given in prestero 2001 we obtain that res τ 1 0 and res τ 2 0 thus g s is stable the details can be seen in section 4 by using the first order taylor expansion of e τ s we obtain 24 g s k 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 the h2 optimal index is chosen as 25 min w s s s 2 where w s is the weighting function although the following design procedure is sufficiently general for ramp or more complex inputs we consider only step input for clarity hence w s 1 s remark 4 normally there are abundant sinusoidal signals whose amplitudes decrease with frequencies in a step signal therefore the step signal is a reasonable and sufficiently strict choice for system analysis according to zhang 2011 to guarantee internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system q s should be stable and the following constraint condition should be met 26 lim s 0 s s lim s 0 1 g s q s 0 26 gives 27 q 0 1 g 0 1 k the set of all the stable transfer functions q s satisfying the above constraint condition can be written as 28 q s 1 k s q s where q s is stable therefore the function to be minimized can be written as w s s s 2 2 1 s 1 g s 1 k s q s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 29 1 τ s 1 τ s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 1 τ s k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 since 1 τ s 1 τ s is an all pass transfer function by the definition of 2 norm it is easy to verify that the 2 norm of a transfer function keeps its value after an all pass transfer function is introduced to it thus we have w s s s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 1 τ s k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 30 2 τ 1 τ s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 according to lemma 1 we have 31 w s s s 2 2 2 τ 1 τ s 2 2 τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s q s τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 2 2 temporarily relax the requirement on the properness of q s to minimize the right hand side of 31 the only choice is 32 q o p t s τ 1 τ 2 s τ 1 τ 2 τ k 1 τ s substituting 32 into 28 yields the optimal q s as q o p t s 1 k s q o p t s 33 τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s note that q o p t s is improper due to that the order of its numerator is greater than the order of its denominator to make it proper a filter for which numerator order is less than the denominator order should be introduced meanwhile the filter should ensure the internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system i e q o p t s j s is stable and 34 lim s 0 1 g s q o p t s j s 0 with this in mind we choose the following filter 35 j s 1 λ s 1 where λ is the performance degree and it is a positive real number thus the suboptimal q s after introducing the filter is q s q o p t s j s 36 τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 k 1 τ s λ s 1 from 20 the controller that makes the unity feedback pitch loop control system internally stable and has a zero steady state error for a step reference can be obtained as c s q s 1 g s q s 37 1 k τ 1 s 1 τ 2 s 1 λ τ s 2 λ 2 τ s 3 2 robust h2 optimal depth loop controller design g 2 s in fig 3 can be written in the following form g 2 s g 1 s g 0 s g 1 s g s q s u s 1 τ s λ s 1 τ s 1 38 k 1 τ s s λ s 1 τ s 1 where k u and λ and τ are all positive real numbers that defined above the h2 optimal index is chosen as 39 min w 1 s s 1 s 2 where w 1 s is the weighting function like in section 3 1 here we also consider the step input for clarity thus w 1 s 1 s according to zhang 2011 to guarantee the internal stability of the closed loop system q 1 s should be stable and the following constraint condition should be met 40 lim s 0 1 g 2 s q 1 s 0 the set of all the stable transfer functions q 1 s satisfying the above constraint condition can be expressed as 41 q 1 s s 1 s q 1 s k where q 1 s is stable this leads to w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 1 s 1 1 τ s 1 s q 1 s λ s 1 τ s 1 2 2 λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 τ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 τ s 1 2 2 42 1 τ s 1 τ s λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 since 1 τ s 1 τ s is an all pass transfer function we can obtain that w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 λ τ s λ 2 τ λ s 1 1 τ s q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 43 2 τ 1 τ s λ λ s 1 q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 from lemma 1 we have 44 w 1 s s 1 s 2 2 2 τ 1 τ s 2 2 λ λ s 1 q 1 s λ s 1 2 2 evidently q 1 o p t s λ gives the optimal solution which implies 45 q 1 o p t s s 1 s q 1 o p t s k s 1 λ s k a filter should be introduced to make q 1 o p t s proper meanwhile the filter should satisfy the constraints of the internal stability and the asymptotic property of the closed loop system however since g 2 s contains an integrator the constraints of the asymptotic property will be different from those in the pitch closed loop system according to zhang 2011 here the constraints of the internal stability and the asymptotic property that the filter should meet are that q 1 o p t s j 1 s is stable and 46a lim s 0 1 g 2 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 0 46b lim s 0 d d s 1 g 2 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 0 taking these into account the following filter is introduced 47 j 1 s 3 λ 2 τ s 1 λ s 1 3 where λ is the performance degree and it is a positive real number therefore the suboptimal q 1 s is q 1 s q 1 o p t s j 1 s 48 1 k s λ s 1 3 λ 2 τ s

we only investigate the controllers design for the diving subsystem however the controllers design for the speed and steering subsystems can also use the same design methods 3 3 robust stability and robust performance discussion in practical applications uncertainties always exist in the auv model assuming that the uncertainties in the pitch and depth loops are described by the multiplicative unstructured uncertainty m s and 1 m s respectively that is g j ω g j ω g j ω δ m j ω and g 2 j ω g 2 j ω g 2 j ω δ 1 m j ω then according to zhou 1998 for every frequency the pitch closed loop system is robust stable if and only if 50 t s δ m s 1 and the depth closed loop system is robust stable if and only if 51 t 1 s δ 1 m s 1 although the robustness of the pitch and depth closed loop systems can be rigorously calculated according to the aforementioned criterions they are seldom adopted in practice because of their complexity there are usually strong constraints for the simplicity of tuning rules in practices the robust performance implies both robust stability and nominal performance it is desirable to make w s s s and w 1 s s 1 s small for good nominal performance and at the same time make t s m s and t 1 s 1 m s small for good robust stability unfortunately the interdependence of s s t s 1 and s 1 s t 1 s 1 makes the objective a challenge improving the nominal performance worsens the robust stability and pushes the system close to instability conversely good robust stability may be obtained by sacrificing the nominal performance therefore how to reach a good tradeoff between nominal performance and robust stability is the main problem in control system design for classical methods it may be difficult to make a clear and reasonable tradeoff between nominal performance and robustness some new methods may be capable of making the tradeoff if the uncertainty profile is known however when the performance specification is changed or the uncertainty offsets one must redesign the controller the operator usually has no ability to redesign the controller the designed robust h2 optimal controllers are effective to tune the nominal performance and robustness quantitatively it can be verified that the larger the performance degrees λ and λ the better the robustness but too large λ and λ will worsen the nominal performance based on the analysis a simple and quantitative engineering tuning procedure developed by zhang et al 2006 is recommended here increase λ and λ monotonically until the required pitch and depth loop responses are obtained normally the step is 0 01 τ since λ and λ are directly related to the closed loop responses of the pitch and depth loops the operating personnel can use these two parameters as a knob when the knowledge about the auv model is rich or the uncertainties reduce a good nominal performance can be demanded by decreasing λ and λ when the knowledge about the auv model is poor or the uncertainties increase a good robustness must be demanded by increasing λ and λ 4 simulation results here some computer simulations are performed on the remus auv to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control strategy the linearized maneuvering nominal coefficient values of the remus auv in depth plane are taken from prestero 2001 and are listed in table 1 substituting the coefficient values in table 1 into 9 and 10 we calculate that k 4 15 ϖ 0 83 and ξ 0 5 then k τ 1 and τ 2 can be calculated from 23 as k 6 02 τ 1 0 602 1 04 j and τ 2 0 602 1 04 j assuming that the input delay is τ 0 4 s and substituting the above calculated parameter values into 23 and 37 we obtain the open loop transfer function g s of the pitch loop and the unity feedback pitch loop controller c s as 52 g s 4 15 e 0 4 s s 2 0 83 s 0 69 53 c s 1 0 602 1 45 s 2 1 2 s 1 0 4 λ s 2 λ 0 8 s usually the velocity of the underwater vehicles varies between 1 m s and 4 m s in this study the velocity of the vehicle is considered to be u 1 m s as in nag et al 2013 thus k u 1 substituting the values of u k and τ into 13 and 49 results in the open loop transfer function g 1 s of the depth loop and unity feedback depth loop controller c 1 s as 54 g 1 s 1 s 55 c 1 s λ s 1 0 4 s 1 3 λ 0 8 s 1 0 4 λ 3 s 3 1 2 λ 2 λ 3 s 2 2 4 λ 3 λ 2 0 32 s the initial conditions of the vehicle are chosen as z 0 0 m and θ 0 0 deg applying the aforementioned setting we measure the unit step input responses of the proposed control strategy to demonstrate the output disturbances rejection capability of the designed control strategy unit step output disturbances d and d 1 are added to the pitch and depth loops at 500 s and 900 s respectively here comparisons of control performances are made between the robust h2 optimal control strategy proposed in this study and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the controller proposed in prestero 2001 is consisted of an inner pd pitch loop and an outer proportional depth loop we present simulation results for two cases the first case is with the assumption that the vehicle dynamic model is accurate and it is equal to its nominal dynamic model the second case is with the assumption that the vehicle dynamic model is uncertain and the uncertain vehicle dynamic model is created by introducing parametric uncertainties we proceed as follows 4 1 simulations in the absence of the model uncertainties in this case it is assumed that there are no uncertainties in the vehicle dynamic model and thus the actual vehicle dynamic model is equal to its nominal dynamic model the robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers 53 and 55 proposed in this study and the pitch and depth loop pd depth controller presented in prestero 2001 are simulated simultaneously to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for the robust h2 optimal control strategy proposed in this study the filter parameter values of λ and λ are founded as λ 10 2 and λ 15 8 for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the proportional and derivative gains for the pitch loop pd controller are chosen as k p 0 21 and τ d 2 and the proportional gain for the depth loop proportional controller is chosen as γ 1 3 the above control gains are selected by trial and error the obtained results are shown in fig 4 fig 4 illustrates the step responses of the nominal vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 figs 4 a c and e present the response results with the robust h2 optimal control strategy figs 4 b d and f present the response results with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 from figs 4 a d it can be seen that both control methods provide precise tracking for the nominal system before adding the output disturbances but after adding the output disturbances at the instants 500 s and 900 s it is observed in figs 4 a d that the robust h2 optimal control strategy effectively rejects the output disturbances in both pitch and depth loops and still guarantees precise tracking while the controller proposed in prestero 2001 can not effectively reject the output disturbance in pitch loop which leads to non zero steady state depth error about 0 6 m in addition it is also seen in figs 4 a d that although the settling time is shorter for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 than for the robust h2 optimal control strategy there is serious oscillatory behaviour for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 before system settling figs 4 e and f plot the fin angles of the vehicle with respect to the nominal vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 fig 4 e shows the response curve of the fin angle with the robust h2 optimal control strategy fig 4 f shows the response curve of the fin angle with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 as observed in the two figures too large fin angle is produced by the controller proposed in prestero 2001 at the initial instant and the instants when the output disturbances are added i e the instants 500 s and 900 s compared with the robust h2 optimal control strategy such overlarge fin angle can not be achieved in practical applications due to the limit of the saturation 4 2 simulations in the presence of the model uncertainties to reflect the robustness of the proposed control strategy against model uncertainties an uncertain model of the depth plane dynamics of the auv is considered in this case the uncertain vehicle dynamic model is created by introducing parametric uncertainties here as in nag et al 2013 it is assumed that the estimation uncertainty of the fin lift moment m δ s is 20 of its nominal value the uncertainties in the values of added mass term m q and hydrostatic moment m θ are 25 of their respective nominal values meanwhile the uncertainty in the value of velocity u is assumed to be 10 of its nominal value the robust h2 optimal pitch and depth loop controllers 53 and 55 generated based on the nominal dynamic model are utilized to deal with the uncertainties the control gains for the robust h2 optimal control strategy of this study and the controller of prestero 2001 are taken the same values as in the first case the obtained results are shown in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 displays the step responses of the uncertain vehicle dynamic system under the action of the robust h2 optimal control strategy and the controller proposed in prestero 2001 the response results with the robust h2 optimal control strategy are plotted in figs 5 a c and e the response results with the controller proposed in prestero 2001 are plotted in figs 5 b d and f comparing fig 5 with fig 4 it is clearly seen that the controller proposed in prestero 2001 gives more oscillation and worse tracking accuracy under the model uncertainties while the proposed robust h2 optimal control strategy is rarely affected by the model uncertainties and thus shows better robustness than the controller proposed in prestero 2001 also as in the first case it is observed in figs 5 e and f that the fin angle for the controller proposed in prestero 2001 is too large at the initial instant and the instants 500 s and 900 s which is not suitable for practical engineering the verification of the robust stability of pitch and depth loops with the robust h2 optimal control strategy is shown in fig 6 it is clearly seen from figs 6 a and b that t s 1 m s and t 1 s 1 1 m s thus the pitch and depth closed loop systems are robust stable 5 conclusions for the depth plane motion control problem of an auv with output disturbances and time delay a robust h2 optimal control strategy is proposed in this paper the kinematic and dynamic models of the auv are firstly described using the inertial and body fixed reference frames for efficient controller design in practical applications it is essential to consider a linear and reduced order model thus a linearized and reduced order model of the auv is then derived using the depth plane dynamics of the auv based on this linearized and reduced order model a robust h2 optimal control method is developed the developed control method can effectively deal with the time delay as well as the output disturbances and guarantees desired tracking considering that the uncertainties exist in the auv dynamic model due to the changing operating conditions the robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method are discussed simulations are performed on the remus auv the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control approach on dealing with the output disturbances time delay as well as model uncertainties and verify the improved performances of the proposed control approach namely higher tracking accuracy better output disturbances rejection ability stronger robustness against model uncertainties and smaller fin angle input over the pitch and depth loop pd depth controller presented in prestero 2001 acknowledgments this work is partly supported by the national natural science

23166,the present paper shows that a clear distinction between hydrodynamic and inertial contributions to mean wave forces and moments acting on a ship is especially important when using experimental data to validate numerical computations time averaged inertial contributions can have a significant influence on these forces and moments thus it is important to either add inertial contributions to the numerical computations when comparing to experiments or to precisely determine the motions during the model tests and subtract these effects from the measurements this procedure is applied to a twin screw passenger ship which has been extensively investigated in a recent research project at the technische universität berlin by comparison with experimental data it is shown that the used rans code neptuno is capable of predicting well the mean wave forces and moments for a ship in oblique incoming regular waves of arbitrary length and that the inertial contributions cannot be neglected for an accurate comparison keywords rans mean wave forces inertial contributions 1 introduction a ship usually travels in waves of arbitrary length and direction although this fact is often disregarded during ship design thus the research projects persee 1 1 performance von schiffen im seegang performance of ship in seaway and shopera 2 2 energy efficient safe ship operation addressed this issue by including the effect of the encountering waves in the manoeuvring prediction as well as the effect of the added resistance in the hull optimization process although measurements of mean wave forces have been performed for more than 40 years fujii and takahashi 1975 there are still some open questions especially when comparing measurements to each other or with numerically obtained results a central topic of the present paper is the precise determination of the pure hydrodynamic components without any unwanted secondary contributions in addition this paper shows that the viscous flow solver rans 3 3 reynolds averaged navier stokes code neptuno is able to predict mean wave forces and moments very accurately the other part of this paper lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 presents a new measurement device developed in the same research projects which is used to validate the nuermical computations as well as to experimentally investigate the influence of mean inertial contributions on measured forces 1 1 state of the art the first measurement device for the prediction of mean wave forces was developed by fujii and takahashi 1975 one difficulty when measuring mean wave forces is that mounting force gauges for this purpose will inevitably add external forces to the system which will influence the motions of the system to a certain extent in order to minimize the influence of this additional force usually a weak coupling is employed using soft springs to allow the motion of the ship while being able to measure the mean wave force similar measurement devices have been built afterwards for example by yasukawa and faizul 2006 xu et al 2007 valanto and hong 2015 and lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 for the numerical prediction of motions and loads on a ship in waves it is quite common to use potential theory based flow solvers the simplifications of the potential flow theory especially the assumption of an ideal fluid without viscosity allow for a very fast and rather accurate prediction boese 1970 was one of the first to develop a method to determine the added resistance of a ship based on the linear potential theory based on this other methods followed for example faltinsen et al 1980 or gerritsma and beukelman 1972 due to the complexity of the problem these techniques are still state of the art successful application of such prediction methods have been shown by yasukawa et al 2010 for some application cases as for example steep or very short waves as well as the precise prediction of mean wave forces on a ship with high forward speed the simplifications of the potential flow theory seem to affect the results field methods as opposed to boundary element methods represent a more sophisticated approach and can include viscous effects as well as the non linearities of the flow among others cura hochbaum and pierzynski 2005 el moctar et al 2006 2010 simonsen et al 2013 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 have shown the successful application of these methods for various application cases related to seakeeping although many measurements of wave forces and rans simulation results exist to the authors knowledge no publication addressed the issue of non hydrodynamic mean inertial forces so far results of computations for the same ship used in this paper are presented in sigmund and el moctar 2018 showing a satisfactory agreement with the measurements in cases of waves being as long as the ship or larger leading to pronounced heave and pitch motions the computed added resistance is higher than the experimentally obtained this difference can be explained by the non hydrodynamic mean inertial forces 2 method 2 1 motion equations of the ship to describe the motions of the ship an earth fixed inertial and a ship fixed frame of reference is defined the euler angles ϕ roll θ pitch and ψ yaw as defined in cura hochbaum and vogt 2002 are used for describing the three rotations of the ship the motion equations namely the momentum and angular momentum equations of a rigid body in 6 degrees of freedom dof written in the ship fixed non inertial coordinate system 1 m u ω 2 w ω 3 v x g ω 2 2 ω 3 2 y g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 f x m v ω 1 w ω 3 u x g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 y g ω 1 2 ω 3 2 z g ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 f y m w ω 1 v ω 2 u x g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 y g ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 z g ω 1 2 ω 2 2 f z i x x ω 1 i y y i z z ω 2 ω 3 i x y ω 2 ω

z z i x y i y z i x z the components of its inertia tensor in the chosen origin o u v w are the ship fixed components of the velocity vector of the origin and u v w the corresponding time derivatives ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the ship fixed components of the angular velocity vector and ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 the corresponding derivatives x g y g and z g are the ship fixed coordinates of the centre of gravity the terms on the right hand side of the equations are the external forces and moments acting on the body in the considered case these external forces can be split into a hydrodynamic f h and gravitational f g contribution since the motions in longitudinal surge and transversal sway direction as well as the yaw motion don t have any hydrodynamic restoring forces or moments it is necessary to include external restoring forces in order to enforce a desired average position in this case a linear restoring force or retention force if applicable f r has been added to the corresponding motion equations thus for example the external force for the longitudinal motion yields 2 f x f h x f g x f r x it should be noted that in any physical experiment it is only possible to measure the restoring forces f r and thus the hydrodynamic forces f h cannot be measured directly the consequences will be discussed in the next section the corresponding linear restoring coefficient directly affects the stiffness of the whole system and should be chosen low enough to ensure that the influence of this artificial restraint does not lead to unrealistic ship motions in the case of oblique waves the weak prescription of the restoring yaw moment leads to an undesired mean yaw angle this results in a change of the wave encounter angle α see fig 1 which can easily be taken into account and more importantly in an average drift angle β leading to an oblique flow acting on the hull since only the hydrodynamic forces and moments due to the wave are of interest the side force and yaw moment due to this drift angle should be subtracted for this reason forces and moments measured in oblique incoming waves excepting those measured in fixed condition should be corrected for this effect even small drift angles can have a significant influence on the measured forces as will be shown below the correction of this force due to an oblique towing or drift angle is in the present paper accomplished by using a set of hydrodynamic derivatives for prediction of manoeuvring in calm water obtained from captive model tests at hamburg ship model basin hsva 2 2 average inertial contributions it is often assumed that the averaged value of the restoring forces i e the measured forces are equal to the average of the hydrodynamic forces thus implying that the average of all inertial contributions is equal to zero a short look at equation 1 shows that the left hand side of the motion equation consists of many non linear terms for example ω 2 w to determine the influence of these non linear terms a series of numerical computations as well as dedicated experiments are performed 2 3 numerical viscous flow computations all numerical simulations are performed using the inhouse rans code neptuno which has been described in detail in many previous publications see for example cura hochbaum and pierzynski 2005 cura hochbaum and vogt 2002 cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 due to this fact only a very short description of the most important aspects of the code has been included here neptuno employs the finite volume method to compute a discrete solution of the incompressible navier stokes equation on a ship fixed block structured collocated grid with non matching interfaces the mass conservation is ensured by using the simple pressure correction method using the rhie chow momentum interpolation method see rhie chow 1983 the turbulence model used is the standard k ω model from wilcox see wilcox 1993 and the free surface is captured using a two phase level set approach waves are generated at the boundaries by prescribing the orbital velocities of the wave according to the airy theory as well as in the computational domain by adding source terms to the right hand side of the momentum equation the code allows the computation of motions in 6 dof in a time marching process by solving equation 1 in every time step including the hydrodynamic forces computed by integration of stresses on the hull and appendages as well as gravitational forces and restoring forces if present on the right hand side as well as computing forces resulting from prescribed motions 2 4 experimental validation in order to validate the computations an extensive model test campaign has been performed at the seakeeping basin of the technische universität berlin tub as well as in the large towing tank of the hsva for details on the model tests please refer to the papers lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 and valanto and hong 2015 respectively 2 5 application case the considered ship is a twin screw passenger ship from meyer werft with a bulbous bow and a skeg the main particulars of the ship are shown in table 1 appendages considered only in the experiments and not in the numerical computations are bilge keels propeller shaft and brackets the rudders have been considered in the experiments and computations the ship model built for the test campaign at tub was in the scale 1 72 whereas the model used at hsva was in the scale of 1 36 the precise determination of the complete mass tensor of the tub model was done by the company resonic which has developed a new measurement technique for determining the complete inertia tensor in a very short time further details can be found in kloepper 2009 the selected spring stiffness in the tub model tests was c x 185 5 n m in longitudinal c y 373 4 n m in transversal and c ψ 2 54 nm in the yaw direction the hsva model tests have been performed with a larger model and different spring stiffnesses c x 920 n m c y 460 n m and c ψ 19 12 nm at tub the model was tested at zero forward speed in waves of different length and direction and for 21 knots full scale in head and following waves of different length all tests have been performed in a fixed condition where all motions were inhibited and a free condition where the motions were weakly prescribed using a system of springs and slides see lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 at hsva the tests were performed for 21 knots full scale in waves of different length coming from various directions for the freely moving ship only 2 6 numerical setup a block structured grid for the computations has been created using the commercial software gridpro and has approximately 4 million cells the grid covers both sides of the ship port and starboard and has a refinement region near the free surface which has been spread towards the fore and aft of the computational domain to account for the relative movement of the free surface in the ship fixed reference frame due to the pitching motion of the ship to achieve a sufficient resolution of the free surface region while maintaining an adequate computational time the bilge keels as well as propeller shafts and brackets are not included in the computational grid see fig 2 the grid has been expanded behind the ship as well as on the starboard side of the computational domain to damp out the waves before they reach the boundary of the computational domain see fig 3 wall functions are used to bypass the near wall region of the boundary layer the chosen non dimensional distance to the wall of the region of the first cell centre layer being y 80 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid dependence in order to analyse the dependence of the forces on the spacial discretisation three different resolution levels of the grid have been considered namely 10 4 million cells for the fine grid 4 million cells for the medium grid and 1 2 million cells for the coarse grid please note that the grid refinement was not fully systematic the refinement factor being not constant but roughly 2 85 and thus the verification study as proposed by ittc 2002 is to be taken as a reference only table 2 shows the computed results for the frictional and pressure contributions to the total longitudinal force in calm water and in waves on the coarse s 3 medium s 2 and fine grid s 1 from these values the convergence ratio r g can be computed 3 r g ε 21 ε 32 where ε i k s i s k the calm water case shows a monotonic convergence of the frictional force and an oscillatory convergence of the pressure force for the ship in incoming waves the convergence of the frictional force is less pronounced whereas the convergence of the pressure force improves compared to calm water in case of monotonic convergence the order of accuracy p re can be computed using the refinement ratio r 4 p re ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r this allows to calculate an error estimate δ r e using a richardson extrapolation 5 δ re ε 21 r p re 1 the estimation of the generalized richardson extrapolated solution s re is 6 s re s 1 δ re following ittc 2002 a factor of safety f s 1 25 is used to compute the uncertainty of the solution 7 u g f s δ re the results are also shown in fig 4 for the calm water case the largest difference between the coarse and fine grid can be found in the frictional force and it is less than 7 in waves the difference in the total longitudinal force between coarse and fine grid is 0 53 n which is equal to 9 9 and the difference between fine and medium grid being just 1 2 it should be noted that the added resistance total shows no convergence due to the missing convergence of its frictional contribution this contribution however being just 0 1 n on the finest grid represents only 1 5 of the total longitudinal force see fig 4c and is extremely small in our case such magnitudes are beyond the accuracy of the used method for instance due to the averaging process over a limited number of periods since a satisfactory convergence of the total longitudinal force in waves was observed the chosen grid resolution is considered appropriate 3 2 computations for fixed ship condition this section presents the results of the computed forces and moments in waves of different lengths coming from diverse directions on a ship at constant forward speed for 21 knots full scale without considering any other motion the wave encounter angle was varied in steps of 22 5 in the range of 0 to 180 with the wavelength of λ λ l p p 0 5 to 1 25 the steepness of the wave was kept constant at h λ 0 02 fig 5 shows a snapshot of the free surface elevation seen from below for four head waves of different length the contour levels are identical in all four plots please note that since the grid is not exactly symmetric and due to the different boundary conditions on port and starboard side a slightly asymmetric behaviour results fig 6 shows the quality of the generated wave by extracting a longitudinal slice at y 0 8 and comparing the elevation with the linear wave theory the achieved wave quality is very satisfactory for all considered encounter angles even for the smallest wave amplitude of ζ 0 005 the wave frequency and amplitude are predicted well in the range of interest where the ship is located in the grid between 0 5 x l p p 0 5 in the case of the fixed ship all forces acting on the hull are just wave exciting forces and thus easier to predict than the total forces for the freely moving ship the comparison with experimental data shows a very good agreement in time series as well as time averaged values a comparison of the computed longitudinal force and the measurements performed at the tub is shown in fig 7 for the case λ 1 0 ζ 0 01 and α 0 the thin greytrace shows the unfiltered measurement signal the black line corresponds to the band pass filtered measurement and the blueline is the pure hydrodynamic force obtained by the integration of pressure and shear stresses on the ship hull the dashed lines represent the respective averaged values and are identical for the computational and experimental results for the computations in oblique to following waves sample snapshots of the free surface elevation are shown in fig 8 for a wave length of λ 0 5 unfortunately no validation data is available for the case of oblique waves fig 9 shows the computed longitudinal force in a following wave with λ 1 0 and ζ 0 01 compared to experiments performed at tub the computations for oblique waves are more complicated than the head wave computations this is due to the fact that the waves are no longer travelling along the main convection direction of the underlying flow as well as the fact that the reflections of the wave on the ship increase although it is possible to generate the waves by just prescribing the corresponding boundary conditions at the inlet of the computational domain a faster wave generation is achieved by adding a source term to each momentum equation allowing to generate the wave inside the computational domain as well see cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 these terms consist of an artificial damping factor chosen by the user and a position dependent factor multiplied by the difference of the target and current velocities despite the complexity mentioned above all waves have been accurately generated in all considered cases for instance fig 10 the decay of the wave amplitude towards the lower edge of the figure is due to the damping zone arranged at the starboard side of the ship seen from below due to the smaller encounter frequency in following waves the computational time for these computations is slightly higher than for the head wave case 3 3 influence of ship motion and spring stiffness fig 11 shows the mean forces and the yaw moment for a ship sailing at 21 knots full scale in waves with λ 1 0 for a case with weakly prescribed motions using a virtual spring system and a case where motions are completely suppressed a clear difference not only quantitative but also qualitative can be seen while the side force with suppressed motions reaches its maximum in beam seas the same situation yields almost zero side force for the freely moving ship it is obvious that the correct prediction of the ship motion and thus the exact knowledge of the mass centre of gravity and tensor of inertia is crucial for a precise prediction of mean wave forces to examine the influence of the chosen spring stiffness on the longitudinal mean wave force in head waves additional simulations have been performed with different restoring coefficients c x the variation was carried out in a wide range starting from the restoring coefficient used in all other simulations c x 0 despite the strong dependence of the time traces of the computed restoring force which is equal to the measured force the mean value is nearly constant fig 12 shows the averaged values of the longitudinal force f x over the ratio of the restoring coefficient c x c x 0 the chosen spring stiffness and thus the surge motion of the ship has no significant influence on the mean longitudinal force provided the restoring coefficient does not lead to motions at the resonance frequency of the system note that the heave and pitch motion are not influenced by the choice of the restoring coefficient c x this observation could also be validated in experiments see lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 3 4 computations for free ship condition the following analysis is performed for a ship in head waves which is free to move in 5 degrees of freedom with the roll angle being fixed at φ 0 as explained in 2 1 restoring forces have been added on the right hand sides of the motion equations as opposed to the previous case in 3 2 the left hand side of the motion equation is not equal to zero fig 13 shows the contributions of the left hand side lhs and right hand side rhs of the motion equation in longitudinal direction first equation in 1 at zero speed the blacktraces represent the sum of the lhs and rhs of the motion equation respectively and are both identical the external forces are shown on the right side of the figure the pure hydrodynamic force bluecurve is obtained as before by a direct integration of pressure and shear stresses on the hull since this force is expressed in the ship fixed coordinate system its longitudinal component contains a contribution of the buoyant force due to the pitching motion of the ship in case of a non zero mean pitch angle trim the average value of this contribution can be significant it is usually balanced by the weight force greencurve which also has a longitudinal contribution in the ship fixed coordinate system the third external force is the restoring force redcurve on the lhs of the motion equation there are three significant contributions for the longitudinal force in head waves the contribution m u is quite large but the time averaged value in harmonic waves is zero the contribution m z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 is also significant and has an average unequal to zero although the contribution m ω 2 w seems to be zero in fig 13 the time averaged value has a significant influence on the mean wave force see table 3 since the force gauges during measurements are measuring the restoring forces applied by the spring system including friction and mass of the slides the measured traces contain not only the hydrodynamic forces but also all inertial contributions as well as the weight force contributions as shown before the common assumption that when comparing time averaged values the inertial forces can be neglected is wrong fig 14 shows the time traces of the surge sway heave and pitch motion the time traces of the longitudinal and side force and yaw moment as well as the sum of hydrodynamic and weight force green and the restoring force red in comparison with the experimental values from tub measurements black due to a certain time lag present in the measured forces obtained to synchronize the times of the measurement and simulation all time traces have been shifted in a way that the maximum pitch amplitudes coincide the same shift has been applied to all measured traces the comparison with experimental data also shows a good agreement for all predicted motions thus it can be concluded that the implemented numerical spring system is able to accurately predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull as well as all additional contributions due to non hydrodynamic inertial terms and restoring forces when comparing the time traces of forces and moments a deviation in amplitude and phase between the computed and measured signals can be observed the discrepancy in the amplitudes could stem from additional inertial forces caused by the motion of the carriages to support this hypothesis the inertial force due to the motion of the surge carriage with a mass of 7 3 kg has been added in the post processing the difference in the phase of the measured signals is most likely caused by different time lags in the force and motion measurement chain respectively this is a common problem among dynamic measurements and should be avoided in future to allow a precise comparison not only of mean forces but also of the time histories since the surge motion is almost directly proportional to the restoring force of the linear springs the good agreement between measured and computed surge motion in phase and amplitude leads to the conclusion that without a time lag in the measurement chain the measured and computed restoring force should be in phase too thus an additional time shift has been applied to the longitudinal force with both mentioned corrections the computed time trace shows a good agreement with experiments see fig 15 it should be noted that all these corrections have no influence on the time averaged values fig 16 shows the comparison of the computed restoring force red measured restoring force black and the sum of weight and hydrodynamic forces green for a head wave with λ 1 5 and a forward speed of 21 knots full scale the agreement for the cases of the freely moving ship with forward speed has also shown to be very promising although for longer waves a slight deviation of the wave frequency can be observed this is due to an inevitably shallow water effect which was present in the experiments performed at a water depth of d 1 m and a wave length of λ 5 25 m the error in the mean surge motion can be explained by an offset in the measured traces with the used spring stiffness of c x 185 5 n m a time averaged surge motion of ξ o 7 5 cm as measured should lead to a mean longitudinal force of approximately 13 91 n instead of the measured value 10 27 n no explanation could be found yet for the differences in the amplitude and mean value of the heave motion since the test facility of the tub does not allow to generate oblique incoming waves in combination with a forward speed of the ship the results of the test campaign performed at hsva have been used for these cases fig 17 shows the time averaged values of the longitudinal force side force and yaw moment with and without the mean inertial and drift contributions for an oblique incoming wave the black traces show the measured forces and moments of the hsva without any corrections regarding inertial effects it should be noted though that the hsva results have been corrected already since the softer springs used in the experiments yielded a different drift angle and thus the drift correction for simulation and experiment were very different thus all hydrodynamic force contributions resulting from this oblique flow condition were already subtracted from the experiments the greentrace is the sum of the computed hydrodynamic force and the weight force the redtrace shows the mean wave force including all non hydrodynamic inertial contributions and the orange trace shows the side force and yaw moment with the hydrodynamic force arising from the undesired inevitably resulting mean drift angle due to the resulting oblique flow subtracted it can be seen that both corrections are substantial and need to be included in the evaluation process after considering all additional force contributions the side force and yaw moment show in general a very good agreement as well the results for all computed wave encounter angles and wave lengths with all corrections applied are shown in figs 18 and 19 4 conclusion the precise consideration of relevant non hydrodynamic effects is necessary when determining the mean wave forces and moments on a ship in waves by model tests or numerical simulations it was shown that inertial contributions have a significant influence on the mean wave forces and cannot be neglected especially when comparing numerical and experimental results in head waves the average value of the longitudinal force is independent of the chosen spring stiffness and thus of the surge motion when fixing the model and suppressing all motions on the other hand a large quantitative and qualitative influence on the traces of the forces and moments was confirmed as a consequence the motions need to be accurately predicted as well and a very accurate determination of the mass centre of gravity and tensor of inertia of the ship considered is necessary to obtain results of high quality for computations and measurements in waves it was shown that the hydrodynamic forces caused by the undesired inevitably arising mean drift angle of the ship should be subtracted especially if the numerical set up deviates from the experimental one when considering all this relevant effects the used rans code is able to predict mean wave forces for waves from all directions and of different arbitrary length acknowledgement the authors would like to express their gratitude towards the german ministry of economic affairs and energy 03sx339e as well as

23166,the present paper shows that a clear distinction between hydrodynamic and inertial contributions to mean wave forces and moments acting on a ship is especially important when using experimental data to validate numerical computations time averaged inertial contributions can have a significant influence on these forces and moments thus it is important to either add inertial contributions to the numerical computations when comparing to experiments or to precisely determine the motions during the model tests and subtract these effects from the measurements this procedure is applied to a twin screw passenger ship which has been extensively investigated in a recent research project at the technische universität berlin by comparison with experimental data it is shown that the used rans code neptuno is capable of predicting well the mean wave forces and moments for a ship in oblique incoming regular waves of arbitrary length and that the inertial contributions cannot be neglected for an accurate comparison keywords rans mean wave forces inertial contributions 1 introduction a ship usually travels in waves of arbitrary length and direction although this fact is often disregarded during ship design thus the research projects persee 1 1 performance von schiffen im seegang performance of ship in seaway and shopera 2 2 energy efficient safe ship operation addressed this issue by including the effect of the encountering waves in the manoeuvring prediction as well as the effect of the added resistance in the hull optimization process although measurements of mean wave forces have been performed for more than 40 years fujii and takahashi 1975 there are still some open questions especially when comparing measurements to each other or with numerically obtained results a central topic of the present paper is the precise determination of the pure hydrodynamic components without any unwanted secondary contributions in addition this paper shows that the viscous flow solver rans 3 3 reynolds averaged navier stokes code neptuno is able to predict mean wave forces and moments very accurately the other part of this paper lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 presents a new measurement device developed in the same research projects which is used to validate the nuermical computations as well as to experimentally investigate the influence of mean inertial contributions on measured forces 1 1 state of the art the first measurement device for the prediction of mean wave forces was developed by fujii and takahashi 1975 one difficulty when measuring mean wave forces is that mounting force gauges for this purpose will inevitably add external forces to the system which will influence the motions of the system to a certain extent in order to minimize the influence of this additional force usually a weak coupling is employed using soft springs to allow the motion of the ship while being able to measure the mean wave force similar measurement devices have been built afterwards for example by yasukawa and faizul 2006 xu et al 2007 valanto and hong 2015 and lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 for the numerical prediction of motions and loads on a ship in waves it is quite common to use potential theory based flow solvers the simplifications of the potential flow theory especially the assumption of an ideal fluid without viscosity allow for a very fast and rather accurate prediction boese 1970 was one of the first to develop a method to determine the added resistance of a ship based on the linear potential theory based on this other methods followed for example faltinsen et al 1980 or gerritsma and beukelman 1972 due to the complexity of the problem these techniques are still state of the art successful application of such prediction methods have been shown by yasukawa et al 2010 for some application cases as for example steep or very short waves as well as the precise prediction of mean wave forces on a ship with high forward speed the simplifications of the potential flow theory seem to affect the results field methods as opposed to boundary element methods represent a more sophisticated approach and can include viscous effects as well as the non linearities of the flow among others cura hochbaum and pierzynski 2005 el moctar et al 2006 2010 simonsen et al 2013 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 have shown the successful application of these methods for various application cases related to seakeeping although many measurements of wave forces and rans simulation results exist to the authors knowledge no publication addressed the issue of non hydrodynamic mean inertial forces so far results of computations for the same ship used in this paper are presented in sigmund and el moctar 2018 showing a satisfactory agreement with the measurements in cases of waves being as long as the ship or larger leading to pronounced heave and pitch motions the computed added resistance is higher than the experimentally obtained this difference can be explained by the non hydrodynamic mean inertial forces 2 method 2 1 motion equations of the ship to describe the motions of the ship an earth fixed inertial and a ship fixed frame of reference is defined the euler angles ϕ roll θ pitch and ψ yaw as defined in cura hochbaum and vogt 2002 are used for describing the three rotations of the ship the motion equations namely the momentum and angular momentum equations of a rigid body in 6 degrees of freedom dof written in the ship fixed non inertial coordinate system 1 m u ω 2 w ω 3 v x g ω 2 2 ω 3 2 y g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 f x m v ω 1 w ω 3 u x g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 y g ω 1 2 ω 3 2 z g ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 f y m w ω 1 v ω 2 u x g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 y g ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 z g ω 1 2 ω 2 2 f z i x x ω 1 i y y i z z ω 2 ω 3 i x y ω 2 ω

z z i x y i y z i x z the components of its inertia tensor in the chosen origin o u v w are the ship fixed components of the velocity vector of the origin and u v w the corresponding time derivatives ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 are the ship fixed components of the angular velocity vector and ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 the corresponding derivatives x g y g and z g are the ship fixed coordinates of the centre of gravity the terms on the right hand side of the equations are the external forces and moments acting on the body in the considered case these external forces can be split into a hydrodynamic f h and gravitational f g contribution since the motions in longitudinal surge and transversal sway direction as well as the yaw motion don t have any hydrodynamic restoring forces or moments it is necessary to include external restoring forces in order to enforce a desired average position in this case a linear restoring force or retention force if applicable f r has been added to the corresponding motion equations thus for example the external force for the longitudinal motion yields 2 f x f h x f g x f r x it should be noted that in any physical experiment it is only possible to measure the restoring forces f r and thus the hydrodynamic forces f h cannot be measured directly the consequences will be discussed in the next section the corresponding linear restoring coefficient directly affects the stiffness of the whole system and should be chosen low enough to ensure that the influence of this artificial restraint does not lead to unrealistic ship motions in the case of oblique waves the weak prescription of the restoring yaw moment leads to an undesired mean yaw angle this results in a change of the wave encounter angle α see fig 1 which can easily be taken into account and more importantly in an average drift angle β leading to an oblique flow acting on the hull since only the hydrodynamic forces and moments due to the wave are of interest the side force and yaw moment due to this drift angle should be subtracted for this reason forces and moments measured in oblique incoming waves excepting those measured in fixed condition should be corrected for this effect even small drift angles can have a significant influence on the measured forces as will be shown below the correction of this force due to an oblique towing or drift angle is in the present paper accomplished by using a set of hydrodynamic derivatives for prediction of manoeuvring in calm water obtained from captive model tests at hamburg ship model basin hsva 2 2 average inertial contributions it is often assumed that the averaged value of the restoring forces i e the measured forces are equal to the average of the hydrodynamic forces thus implying that the average of all inertial contributions is equal to zero a short look at equation 1 shows that the left hand side of the motion equation consists of many non linear terms for example ω 2 w to determine the influence of these non linear terms a series of numerical computations as well as dedicated experiments are performed 2 3 numerical viscous flow computations all numerical simulations are performed using the inhouse rans code neptuno which has been described in detail in many previous publications see for example cura hochbaum and pierzynski 2005 cura hochbaum and vogt 2002 cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 due to this fact only a very short description of the most important aspects of the code has been included here neptuno employs the finite volume method to compute a discrete solution of the incompressible navier stokes equation on a ship fixed block structured collocated grid with non matching interfaces the mass conservation is ensured by using the simple pressure correction method using the rhie chow momentum interpolation method see rhie chow 1983 the turbulence model used is the standard k ω model from wilcox see wilcox 1993 and the free surface is captured using a two phase level set approach waves are generated at the boundaries by prescribing the orbital velocities of the wave according to the airy theory as well as in the computational domain by adding source terms to the right hand side of the momentum equation the code allows the computation of motions in 6 dof in a time marching process by solving equation 1 in every time step including the hydrodynamic forces computed by integration of stresses on the hull and appendages as well as gravitational forces and restoring forces if present on the right hand side as well as computing forces resulting from prescribed motions 2 4 experimental validation in order to validate the computations an extensive model test campaign has been performed at the seakeeping basin of the technische universität berlin tub as well as in the large towing tank of the hsva for details on the model tests please refer to the papers lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 and valanto and hong 2015 respectively 2 5 application case the considered ship is a twin screw passenger ship from meyer werft with a bulbous bow and a skeg the main particulars of the ship are shown in table 1 appendages considered only in the experiments and not in the numerical computations are bilge keels propeller shaft and brackets the rudders have been considered in the experiments and computations the ship model built for the test campaign at tub was in the scale 1 72 whereas the model used at hsva was in the scale of 1 36 the precise determination of the complete mass tensor of the tub model was done by the company resonic which has developed a new measurement technique for determining the complete inertia tensor in a very short time further details can be found in kloepper 2009 the selected spring stiffness in the tub model tests was c x 185 5 n m in longitudinal c y 373 4 n m in transversal and c ψ 2 54 nm in the yaw direction the hsva model tests have been performed with a larger model and different spring stiffnesses c x 920 n m c y 460 n m and c ψ 19 12 nm at tub the model was tested at zero forward speed in waves of different length and direction and for 21 knots full scale in head and following waves of different length all tests have been performed in a fixed condition where all motions were inhibited and a free condition where the motions were weakly prescribed using a system of springs and slides see lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 at hsva the tests were performed for 21 knots full scale in waves of different length coming from various directions for the freely moving ship only 2 6 numerical setup a block structured grid for the computations has been created using the commercial software gridpro and has approximately 4 million cells the grid covers both sides of the ship port and starboard and has a refinement region near the free surface which has been spread towards the fore and aft of the computational domain to account for the relative movement of the free surface in the ship fixed reference frame due to the pitching motion of the ship to achieve a sufficient resolution of the free surface region while maintaining an adequate computational time the bilge keels as well as propeller shafts and brackets are not included in the computational grid see fig 2 the grid has been expanded behind the ship as well as on the starboard side of the computational domain to damp out the waves before they reach the boundary of the computational domain see fig 3 wall functions are used to bypass the near wall region of the boundary layer the chosen non dimensional distance to the wall of the region of the first cell centre layer being y 80 3 results and discussion 3 1 grid dependence in order to analyse the dependence of the forces on the spacial discretisation three different resolution levels of the grid have been considered namely 10 4 million cells for the fine grid 4 million cells for the medium grid and 1 2 million cells for the coarse grid please note that the grid refinement was not fully systematic the refinement factor being not constant but roughly 2 85 and thus the verification study as proposed by ittc 2002 is to be taken as a reference only table 2 shows the computed results for the frictional and pressure contributions to the total longitudinal force in calm water and in waves on the coarse s 3 medium s 2 and fine grid s 1 from these values the convergence ratio r g can be computed 3 r g ε 21 ε 32 where ε i k s i s k the calm water case shows a monotonic convergence of the frictional force and an oscillatory convergence of the pressure force for the ship in incoming waves the convergence of the frictional force is less pronounced whereas the convergence of the pressure force improves compared to calm water in case of monotonic convergence the order of accuracy p re can be computed using the refinement ratio r 4 p re ln ε 32 ε 21 ln r this allows to calculate an error estimate δ r e using a richardson extrapolation 5 δ re ε 21 r p re 1 the estimation of the generalized richardson extrapolated solution s re is 6 s re s 1 δ re following ittc 2002 a factor of safety f s 1 25 is used to compute the uncertainty of the solution 7 u g f s δ re the results are also shown in fig 4 for the calm water case the largest difference between the coarse and fine grid can be found in the frictional force and it is less than 7 in waves the difference in the total longitudinal force between coarse and fine grid is 0 53 n which is equal to 9 9 and the difference between fine and medium grid being just 1 2 it should be noted that the added resistance total shows no convergence due to the missing convergence of its frictional contribution this contribution however being just 0 1 n on the finest grid represents only 1 5 of the total longitudinal force see fig 4c and is extremely small in our case such magnitudes are beyond the accuracy of the used method for instance due to the averaging process over a limited number of periods since a satisfactory convergence of the total longitudinal force in waves was observed the chosen grid resolution is considered appropriate 3 2 computations for fixed ship condition this section presents the results of the computed forces and moments in waves of different lengths coming from diverse directions on a ship at constant forward speed for 21 knots full scale without considering any other motion the wave encounter angle was varied in steps of 22 5 in the range of 0 to 180 with the wavelength of λ λ l p p 0 5 to 1 25 the steepness of the wave was kept constant at h λ 0 02 fig 5 shows a snapshot of the free surface elevation seen from below for four head waves of different length the contour levels are identical in all four plots please note that since the grid is not exactly symmetric and due to the different boundary conditions on port and starboard side a slightly asymmetric behaviour results fig 6 shows the quality of the generated wave by extracting a longitudinal slice at y 0 8 and comparing the elevation with the linear wave theory the achieved wave quality is very satisfactory for all considered encounter angles even for the smallest wave amplitude of ζ 0 005 the wave frequency and amplitude are predicted well in the range of interest where the ship is located in the grid between 0 5 x l p p 0 5 in the case of the fixed ship all forces acting on the hull are just wave exciting forces and thus easier to predict than the total forces for the freely moving ship the comparison with experimental data shows a very good agreement in time series as well as time averaged values a comparison of the computed longitudinal force and the measurements performed at the tub is shown in fig 7 for the case λ 1 0 ζ 0 01 and α 0 the thin greytrace shows the unfiltered measurement signal the black line corresponds to the band pass filtered measurement and the blueline is the pure hydrodynamic force obtained by the integration of pressure and shear stresses on the ship hull the dashed lines represent the respective averaged values and are identical for the computational and experimental results for the computations in oblique to following waves sample snapshots of the free surface elevation are shown in fig 8 for a wave length of λ 0 5 unfortunately no validation data is available for the case of oblique waves fig 9 shows the computed longitudinal force in a following wave with λ 1 0 and ζ 0 01 compared to experiments performed at tub the computations for oblique waves are more complicated than the head wave computations this is due to the fact that the waves are no longer travelling along the main convection direction of the underlying flow as well as the fact that the reflections of the wave on the ship increase although it is possible to generate the waves by just prescribing the corresponding boundary conditions at the inlet of the computational domain a faster wave generation is achieved by adding a source term to each momentum equation allowing to generate the wave inside the computational domain as well see cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 these terms consist of an artificial damping factor chosen by the user and a position dependent factor multiplied by the difference of the target and current velocities despite the complexity mentioned above all waves have been accurately generated in all considered cases for instance fig 10 the decay of the wave amplitude towards the lower edge of the figure is due to the damping zone arranged at the starboard side of the ship seen from below due to the smaller encounter frequency in following waves the computational time for these computations is slightly higher than for the head wave case 3 3 influence of ship motion and spring stiffness fig 11 shows the mean forces and the yaw moment for a ship sailing at 21 knots full scale in waves with λ 1 0 for a case with weakly prescribed motions using a virtual spring system and a case where motions are completely suppressed a clear difference not only quantitative but also qualitative can be seen while the side force with suppressed motions reaches its maximum in beam seas the same situation yields almost zero side force for the freely moving ship it is obvious that the correct prediction of the ship motion and thus the exact knowledge of the mass centre of gravity and tensor of inertia is crucial for a precise prediction of mean wave forces to examine the influence of the chosen spring stiffness on the longitudinal mean wave force in head waves additional simulations have been performed with different restoring coefficients c x the variation was carried out in a wide range starting from the restoring coefficient used in all other simulations c x 0 despite the strong dependence of the time traces of the computed restoring force which is equal to the measured force the mean value is nearly constant fig 12 shows the averaged values of the longitudinal force f x over the ratio of the restoring coefficient c x c x 0 the chosen spring stiffness and thus the surge motion of the ship has no significant influence on the mean longitudinal force provided the restoring coefficient does not lead to motions at the resonance frequency of the system note that the heave and pitch motion are not influenced by the choice of the restoring coefficient c x this observation could also be validated in experiments see lengwinat and cura hochbaum 2018 3 4 computations for free ship condition the following analysis is performed for a ship in head waves which is free to move in 5 degrees of freedom with the roll angle being fixed at φ 0 as explained in 2 1 restoring forces have been added on the right hand sides of the motion equations as opposed to the previous case in 3 2 the left hand side of the motion equation is not equal to zero fig 13 shows the contributions of the left hand side lhs and right hand side rhs of the motion equation in longitudinal direction first equation in 1 at zero speed the blacktraces represent the sum of the lhs and rhs of the motion equation respectively and are both identical the external forces are shown on the right side of the figure the pure hydrodynamic force bluecurve is obtained as before by a direct integration of pressure and shear stresses on the hull since this force is expressed in the ship fixed coordinate system its longitudinal component contains a contribution of the buoyant force due to the pitching motion of the ship in case of a non zero mean pitch angle trim the average value of this contribution can be significant it is usually balanced by the weight force greencurve which also has a longitudinal contribution in the ship fixed coordinate system the third external force is the restoring force redcurve on the lhs of the motion equation there are three significant contributions for the longitudinal force in head waves the contribution m u is quite large but the time averaged value in harmonic waves is zero the contribution m z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 is also significant and has an average unequal to zero although the contribution m ω 2 w seems to be zero in fig 13 the time averaged value has a significant influence on the mean wave force see table 3 since the force gauges during measurements are measuring the restoring forces applied by the spring system including friction and mass of the slides the measured traces contain not only the hydrodynamic forces but also all inertial contributions as well as the weight force contributions as shown before the common assumption that when comparing time averaged values the inertial forces can be neglected is wrong fig 14 shows the time traces of the surge sway heave and pitch motion the time traces of the longitudinal and side force and yaw moment as well as the sum of hydrodynamic and weight force green and the restoring force red in comparison with the experimental values from tub measurements black due to a certain time lag present in the measured forces obtained to synchronize the times of the measurement and simulation all time traces have been shifted in a way that the maximum pitch amplitudes coincide the same shift has been applied to all measured traces the comparison with experimental data also shows a good agreement for all predicted motions thus it can be concluded that the implemented numerical spring system is able to accurately predict the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull as well as all additional contributions due to non hydrodynamic inertial terms and restoring forces when comparing the time traces of forces and moments a deviation in amplitude and phase between the computed and measured signals can be observed the discrepancy in the amplitudes could stem from additional inertial forces caused by the motion of the carriages to support this hypothesis the inertial force due to the motion of the surge carriage with a mass of 7 3 kg has been added in the post processing the difference in the phase of the measured signals is most likely caused by different time lags in the force and motion measurement chain respectively this is a common problem among dynamic measurements and should be avoided in future to allow a precise comparison not only of mean forces but also of the time histories since the surge motion is almost directly proportional to the restoring force of the linear springs the good agreement between measured and computed surge motion in phase and amplitude leads to the conclusion that without a time lag in the measurement chain the measured and computed restoring force should be in phase too thus an additional time shift has been applied to the longitudinal force with both mentioned corrections the computed time trace shows a good agreement with experiments see fig 15 it should be noted that all these corrections have no influence on the time averaged values fig 16 shows the comparison of the computed restoring force red measured restoring force black and the sum of weight and hydrodynamic forces green for a head wave with λ 1 5 and a forward speed of 21 knots full scale the agreement for the cases of the freely moving ship with forward speed has also shown to be very promising although for longer waves a slight deviation of the wave frequency can be observed this is due to an inevitably shallow water effect which was present in the experiments performed at a water depth of d 1 m and a wave length of λ 5 25 m the error in the mean surge motion can be explained by an offset in the measured traces with the used spring stiffness of c x 185 5 n m a time averaged surge motion of ξ o 7 5 cm as measured should lead to a mean longitudinal force of approximately 13 91 n instead of the measured value 10 27 n no explanation could be found yet for the differences in the amplitude and mean value of the heave motion since the test facility of the tub does not allow to generate oblique incoming waves in combination with a forward speed of the ship the results of the test campaign performed at hsva have been used for these cases fig 17 shows the time averaged values of the longitudinal force side force and yaw moment with and without the mean inertial and drift contributions for an oblique incoming wave the black traces show the measured forces and moments of the hsva without any corrections

corrections are substantial and need to be included in the evaluation process after considering all additional force contributions the side force and yaw moment show in general a very good agreement as well the results for all computed wave encounter angles and wave lengths with all corrections applied are shown in figs 18 and 19 4 conclusion the precise consideration of relevant non hydrodynamic

several stabilizing fabric tubes are circularly arranged to form a tubular structure supported by buoyant bodies to achieve a certain stiffness the air inside is compressed to a certain level consequently the inner water pressure of the tubes is higher compared to the pressure of the surrounding water due to this circumstances the tubes can act as beams which provide a certain resistance

operation mode the water from the tube is drained and the buoyant body moves up by this the flexible fabric tube walls wrinkle or fold in vertical direction due to the expandable nature of the walls the pressure head maintains a constant water level difference this means that the tube s water surface level will be the same regardless of the reservoir s fill level in pump operation mode water is

associated technologies in general inflatable structures offer advantages such as being lightweight and simple to deploy additionally the high packaging efficiency is an important material property for transport purposes these advantages are incorporated in many applications like air supported or air inflated structures dual wall structures or inflatable beams however floating stabilizing

are attached to each other and to a fabric membrane at the inner side this will add considerably to the stability of the structure but in this preliminary design study it s not taken into account as mentioned the stabilizing elements form a ring like tubular structure as a consequence the movement of the buoyant body of the light be storage system inside is free in vertical but locked in lateral direction table 2 shows the parameters and results for an exemplary stabilizing structure consisting of k 12 stabilizing fabric tubes the new light be storage system with expandable fabric walls and a cross section diameter d 32 m described in section 2 2 and table 1 perfectly fits into it one tube can resist a shear load of f 1500 kn at a depth of h b 90 m however the total resistance will be higher than f k 18 mn due to the architecture of the entire stabilizing structure further investigations have to clarify if the overall resistance is good enough to prevent the buoyant body of the light be storage system from laterally moving or from twisting inside the tubular stabilizing structure 2 4 suitable flexible material a suitable material needs to be strong in order to cope with the design stresses and loads it also needs to be durable and should not degrade in its characteristics even after years of seawater and sun exposure pimm et al 2014 specified some requirements to be considered for their energy bag technology in essence these requirements can be applied as well for buoyant energy architectures a fabric structure must be as follows structurally determinate and performance predictable resilient enough to retain its mechanical properties throughout fabrication packaging shipment deployment servicing and the intended long term charging discharging cycling

arrangement in the brim of the fluid reservoir when the reservoir is in discharged state fig 5 left side pimm et al 2014 used for the prototype design of their energy bag 420d polyurethane coated nylon for the bladder and vectran for the tendons for buoyant energy systems future research has to clarify what kind of structural loads are to be expected and which material is best suited in contrast to energy bags which are deployed deep under water the proposed system is located on the surface and exposed to dynamic wave loading and fluid structure interaction table 3 lists some suitable materials regarding the ultimate static tensile strength which is above the needed limits of tables 1 and 2 with enough margins of safety a visionary suitable multi layer fabric could be composed of webbing layers in principal stress direction made from vectran fibers separated by polyester open celled foam as a spacer material such high tech fabrics could benefit from emerging technologies such as flexible structural health monitoring systems self healing and fouling protected materials 3 design approach to increase the energy storage capacity the design approach is an expansion of the basic light be system section 1 2 to a hydro pneumatic storage device compared to the be approach additional energy is stored by compressing air in pump mode in chamber a and b fig 8 therefore the air volumes in chambers a and b have to be airproof and are designed with an umbilical connection as shown in fig 8 energy is released by air expansion acting on the liquid piston in chamber a the whole process is modeled isothermal hence the air in the system is kept at a constant temperature throughout this necessarily requires heat exchange between the water inside chamber a and the surrounding sea the aim of this section is a first estimation of the consequences under ideal circumstances for the pump turbine head h p t and power p which are no longer time invariant furthermore the possible increase in storage capacity is shown all system parameters and mathematical symbols used within the following equations are described in table 4 the following equations 23

design approach in comparison to a basic light be system the increase of energy storage capacity goes hand in hand with a large difference in power and head values along the charging process the left diagram of fig 9 presents the non linear increase of head h p t t with charging time t the right diagram of fig 9 shows the effect of a varying pre charge pressure p p r e on the head h p t t m a x and the storage capacity with compressed air w t m a x c a for a first structural analysis the system of fig 8 is considered cylindrically shaped with a base radius r 17 8 m each chamber surrounded by

bottom of chamber a 30 p a t m a x h 2 ρ w g p t m a x table 4 shows that all materials table 3 with a wall thickness of t 50 mm would resist the stress in circumferential and longitudinal direction according to barlow s formula nevertheless this is a very simplified consideration under static conditions for real stresses under dynamic loads more detailed calculation methods are required with the proposed structural measurements fig 8 and pre charge pressure p p r e the technical possibilities are certainly pushed to the limits 4 floating stability aspects of basic light be devices the most important design characteristic of a floating be storage device is to guarantee the floating stability for all fill levels k from 0 to 100 in order to assess the static floating stability fig 10 the resulting forces f the righting moment m y and righting arm r a y can be expressed by equations 30 33 the application points of the vertical forces depend on the selected tilt angle α 31 f b u o y a n

m y f b u o y a n c y hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from dynamic sloshing effects of the free water surface inside the fluid reservoir are disregarded in this simplified first analysis for positive tilt angles α 0 the righting moment m y and arm r a y should be negative to provide floating stability if this is not the case the tilt angle would increase until a new stable position is reached exemplary two box shaped basic light be storage device according to fig 1 with rigid walls are analysed to obtain extreme floating conditions the structure mass is set to a very low value one single chamber defines the fluid reservoir of the first exemplary design whereas the second exemplary design consists of two fluid reservoirs separated by a thin vertical wall fig 11 lower

pressure heads h for the first left side and second right side exemplary design obviously one fluid reservoir leads to an unstable floating behavior whereas two separated fluid chambers represents a significant improvement the second exemplary design is stable below fill levels k 70 especially for the basic light be concept the floating design requires strong efforts and additional measures to ensure floating stability 5 concluding remarks and outlook although the development of be structures composed of fabric is at a very early stage the presented theoretical results are promising the intention of the design approaches of section 2 and 3 is to show the principal feasibility and to get indications for possible dimensions and the associated energy storage capacities the energy storage capacity of the original light and heavy be concepts could be increased significantly with the additional integration of forms of compressed air energy storage however the investigations all presuppose ideal conditions and isothermal processes the increase of energy storage capacity goes hand in hand with large differences in power and head values along the charging and discharging process these time invariant parameters require customized multi stage pump turbine solutions furthermore the introduced design approaches show generally an increasing complexity compared to the original be concepts especially for long term applications more simple solution with lower energy densities but with multi use space on the platform roof heavy be system klar et al 2017 may be more successful on the other hand the outer shell of floating energy storage systems based on fabric can be coated with thin film photovoltaic in this way they become marine energy producers and storage systems which is especially significant for the future energy self sufficient floating seasteads permanent settlements of floating structures blue frontiers 2018 the main motivation to think about storage solutions based on fabric is an expected decrease of construction costs compared with rigid structures and advantages for fabrication packaging shipment and deployment a challenge for future research is to find a suitable fabric material which fulfills the requirements summarized in section 2 4 and is cost effective at the same time due to the relatively high elevation of the centre of gravity compared to the center of buoyancy and the low structure weight the floating stability for light be systems has to be considered carefully therefore additional measures beside the floating body design may be required hydrodynamic forces and moments due to water sloshing arising from water oscillations in the fluid reservoir under wave or wind load may reduce the stability limit the assessment of such effects and the development of anti slosh measures are part of further studies to conclude fig 14 shows finally a schematic visionary sketch which aims to combine the design approaches presented in section 2 and 3 this proposed be system consists exclusively of fabric the stabilizing fabric tubes are attached to each other for structural reinforcement openings or pipes between the air and water volumes of the stabilizing system allow fluid exchange in addition the stabilizing systems air volumes connect to the buoyant body in the center umbilical connection fig 14 two hydraulic pump turbine motor generator systems provide the energy conversion one connected to the fluid reservoir in the center and the second to the stabilizing tubes acknowledgements the authors

inside the structure for e g wind farm operation transport industry leisure accommodation or aquaculture 1 2 basic light be concept one of the be concepts is characterized by a lower water level of the surrounding water compared to the inner water level of the floating energy storage device for this purpose a fluid reservoir is equipped with buoyant bodies as shown in fig 1 in turbine operation mode water flows from the fluid reservoir to the surrounding water driving a turbine the floating energy storage platform rises and the stored gravitational is converted into electric energy in pump operation mode the floating structure moves down thereby converting electric into potential energy and storing it a lightweight construction is advantageous compared to the use of heavy materials for

higher than f k 18 mn due to the architecture of the entire stabilizing structure further investigations have to clarify if the overall resistance is good enough to prevent the buoyant body of the light be storage system from laterally moving or from twisting inside the tubular stabilizing structure 2 4 suitable flexible material a suitable material needs to be strong in order to cope with the design stresses and loads it also needs to be durable and should not degrade in its characteristics even after years of seawater and sun exposure pimm et al 2014 specified some requirements to be considered for their energy bag technology in essence these requirements can be applied as well for buoyant energy architectures a fabric structure must be as follows structurally determinate and performance predictable resilient enough to retain its mechanical properties throughout fabrication packaging shipment deployment servicing and the intended long term charging discharging cycling regime have sufficiently high specific strength to resist all stresses with enough margins of safety biologically inert over its anticipated service life remain highly impermeable to pressurised water and air throughout the anticipated service life expandable fabric wall material in fully charged and unfolded state fig 5 right side have to be foldable or collapsible into a suitable compact arrangement in the brim of the fluid reservoir when the reservoir is in discharged state fig 5 left side pimm et al 2014 used for the prototype design of their energy bag 420d polyurethane coated nylon for the bladder and vectran for the tendons for buoyant energy systems future research has to clarify what kind of structural loads are to be expected and which material is best suited in contrast to energy bags which are deployed deep under water the proposed system is located on the surface and exposed to dynamic wave loading and fluid structure interaction table 3 lists some suitable materials regarding the ultimate static tensile strength which is above the needed limits of tables 1 and 2 with enough margins of safety a visionary suitable multi layer fabric could be composed of webbing layers in principal stress direction made from vectran fibers separated by polyester open celled foam as a spacer material such high tech fabrics could benefit from emerging technologies such as flexible structural health monitoring systems self healing and fouling protected materials 3 design approach to increase the energy storage capacity the design approach is an expansion of the basic light be system section 1 2 to a hydro pneumatic storage device compared to the be approach additional energy is stored by compressing air in pump mode in chamber a and b fig 8 therefore the air volumes in chambers a and b have to be airproof and are designed with an umbilical connection as shown in fig 8 energy is released by air expansion acting on the liquid piston in chamber a the whole process is modeled isothermal hence the air in the system is kept at a constant temperature throughout this necessarily requires heat exchange between the water inside chamber a and the surrounding sea the aim of this section is a first estimation of the consequences under ideal circumstances for the pump turbine head h p t and power p which are no longer time invariant furthermore the possible increase in storage capacity is shown all system parameters and mathematical symbols used within the following equations are described in table 4 the following equations 23

design approach in comparison to a basic light be system the increase of energy storage capacity goes hand in hand with a large difference in power and head values along the charging process the left

and the storage capacity with compressed air w t m a x c a for a first structural analysis the system of fig 8 is considered cylindrically shaped with a base radius r 17 8 m each chamber surrounded by

bottom of chamber a 30 p a t m a x h 2 ρ w g p t m a x table 4 shows that all materials table 3 with a wall thickness of t 50 mm would resist the stress in circumferential and longitudinal direction according to barlow s formula nevertheless this is a very simplified consideration under static conditions for real stresses under dynamic loads more detailed calculation methods are required with the proposed structural measurements fig 8 and pre charge pressure p p r e the technical possibilities are certainly pushed to the limits 4 floating stability aspects of basic light be devices the most important design characteristic of a floating be storage device is to guarantee the floating stability for all fill levels k from 0 to 100 in order to assess the static floating stability fig 10 the resulting forces f the righting moment m y and righting arm r a y can be expressed by equations 30 33 the application points of the vertical forces depend on the selected tilt angle α 31 f b u o y a n c y f s t r u c t u r e i f w a t e r i 32 f w a t e r i ρ w v w a t e r i k g 33 m y f s t r u c t u r e x s t r u c t u r e x b u o y a n c y i f w a t e r i x w a t e r i x b u o y a n c y 34 r a y m y f b u o y a n c y hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from dynamic sloshing effects of the free water surface inside the fluid reservoir are disregarded in this simplified first analysis for positive tilt angles α 0 the righting moment m y and arm r a y should be negative to provide floating stability if this is not the case the tilt angle would increase until a new stable position is reached exemplary two box shaped basic light be storage device according to fig 1 with rigid walls are analysed to obtain extreme floating conditions the structure mass is set to a very low value one single chamber defines the fluid reservoir of the first exemplary design whereas the second exemplary design consists of two fluid reservoirs separated by a thin vertical wall fig 11 lower illustrations both designs share the following dimensions and characteristics squared base are a 50 50 2500 m2 structure height h 30 m total volume of fluid reservoir v w a t e r h 2 a 37000 m3 energy

pressure heads h for the first left side and second right side exemplary design obviously one fluid reservoir leads to an unstable floating behavior whereas two separated fluid chambers represents a significant improvement the second exemplary design is stable below fill levels k 70 especially for the basic light be concept the floating design requires strong efforts and additional measures to ensure floating stability 5 concluding remarks and outlook although the development of be structures composed of fabric is at a very early stage the presented theoretical results are promising the intention of the design approaches of section 2 and 3 is to show the principal feasibility and to get indications for possible dimensions and the associated energy storage capacities the energy storage capacity of the original light and heavy be concepts could be increased significantly with the additional integration of forms of compressed air energy storage however the investigations all presuppose ideal conditions and isothermal processes the increase of energy storage capacity goes hand in hand with large differences in power and head values along the charging and discharging process these time invariant parameters require customized multi stage pump turbine solutions furthermore the introduced design approaches show generally an increasing complexity compared to the original be concepts especially for long term applications more simple solution with lower energy densities but with multi use space on the platform roof heavy be system klar et al 2017 may be more successful on the other hand the outer shell of floating energy storage systems based on fabric can be coated with thin film photovoltaic in this way they become marine energy producers and storage systems which is especially significant for the future energy self sufficient floating seasteads permanent settlements of floating structures blue frontiers 2018 the main motivation to think about storage solutions based on fabric is an expected decrease of construction costs compared with rigid structures and advantages for fabrication packaging shipment and deployment a challenge for future research is to find a suitable fabric material which fulfills the requirements summarized in section 2 4 and is cost effective at the same time due to the relatively high elevation of the centre of gravity compared to the center of buoyancy and the low structure weight the floating stability for light be systems has to be considered carefully therefore additional measures beside the floating body design may be required hydrodynamic forces and moments due to water sloshing arising from water oscillations in the fluid reservoir under wave or wind load may reduce the stability limit the assessment of such effects and the development of anti slosh measures are part of further studies to conclude fig 14 shows finally a schematic visionary sketch which aims to combine the design approaches presented in section 2 and 3 this proposed be system consists exclusively of fabric the stabilizing fabric tubes are attached to each other for structural reinforcement openings or pipes between the air and water volumes of the stabilizing system allow fluid exchange in addition the stabilizing systems air volumes connect to the buoyant body in the center umbilical connection fig 14 two hydraulic pump turbine motor generator systems provide the energy conversion one connected to the fluid reservoir in the center and the second to the stabilizing tubes acknowledgements the authors

23168,in this study the improvement of maneuverability of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc with small engine output under a condition involving 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 was performed by attaching a high lift rudder a high lift rudder hl rudder with a fishtail section and end plates was newly designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that minimizes the increase in rudder resistance tank tests were performed by using a scaled ship model with a hl rudder to capture propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of the ship with a hl rudder the results indicated

400 gt must reduce energy efficiency design index eedi by a maximum of 30 after 2025 imo 2011 the employment of a small main engine output is an extremely effective way to lower fuel consumption and to reduce co 2 emissions however small engine output may lead to a low propeller load and thereby reduces the rudder force therefore an excessive reduction in the engine output results in a potentially unexpected unsafe situation in which a helms man is unable to adequately maneuver a ship in adverse weather conditions yasukawa et al 2017 studied the effect of small main engine output on maneuverability of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc in still water and adverse weather conditions in the study the initial design of a vlcc involved 30 eedi reduced step3 as opposed to a conventional vlcc step0 by employing energy saving devices a large diameter propeller and a low output engine with an electronic control the results confirmed that the maneuverability of step3 was worse than that in step0 with respect to time domain maneuvering simulations in the simulations problems that did not comply with imo maneuvering criteria imo 2002a imo 2002b did not occur although the engine output was reduced in step3 this was because a conventional ship step0 initially possessed good maneuverability and a sufficient margin existed for the imo criteria accordingly a reduction in the main engine output due to advances in energy saving technology based on a situation in which a ship faces limitation in terms of the imo criteria could lead to a possibility in which maneuverability worsens until an unacceptable level is reached in terms of navigational safety through a reduction in the rudder force in this case measures are required to ensure that maneuverability does not worsen through given further advances in energy savings as one of the counter measure a rudder with special sectional shape special rudder is applied for achieving the high lift rudder force in this paper the high lift rudder improves the ship maneuverability certainly several studies examined the impact of a special rudder on maneuvering and propulsive performances of ships bingham and mackey 1987 reviewed the maneuvering performance of ships with a high lift rudder such as the schilling rudder and a flap rudder and indicated that the schilling rudder exhibited better turning ability was simpler in construction and cheaper when compared with the flap rudder brix 1993 indicated that the rudder with various fishtails section produces a larger lift force as compared to the naca mariner rudder although the drag increases at all rudder angles the lift force of this rudder evidently improved about 8 12 when attached on a series of container ship hasegawa et al 2006 investigated the course keeping ability of a pure car carrier in windy conditions for two rudders schilling rudder and mariner rudder and concluded that the schilling rudder produces a larger lift force when compared with the mariner rudder nagarajan et al 2008 confirmed that maneuverability and fuel efficiency of a vlcc with a schilling rudder were superior when compared with a ship with a conventional mariner rudder nguyen and ikeda 2013 numerically confirmed that a rudder with a fishtail section exhibited a higher lift when compared with a naca mariner rudder liu et al 2016 investigated the impact of the rudder section on maneuvering performance and the results indicated that the wedge tail section produces a larger rudder force and smaller turning indexes albeit with least efficiency i e higher rudder resistance in summary extant studies indicated that a rudder with a fishtail or a wedge tail section similar to a shilling rudder can potentially be used as a measure to improve maneuverability although there is a possibility that the propulsive performance is worsened due to increase of the rudder resistance to minimize the rudder resistance increase in this paper a high lift rudder with small rudder area is newly designed this study involved performing an improvement in the maneuverability of a vlcc with small engine output under a condition with 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 by attaching a high lift rudder as an extension of a previous study yasukawa et al 2017 extant studies did not investigate the effect of a high lift rudder on the maneuverability of a ship in adverse weather conditions with respect to small engine output first a high lift rudder with a fishtail section and end plates was designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that minimized the rudder resistance increase the new rudder is termed as a hl rudder in this study conversely the original mariner rudder is termed as a mn rudder this is followed by performing tank tests by using a scaled ship model model length 2 909 m to capture the propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of a ship with mn and hl rudders the incorporation of the test results into the mmg simulation model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a led to the performance of maneuvering simulations in calm water and adverse weather conditions for a vlcc with a hl rudder step3hl and mn rudder step3mn for the purposes of comparison maneuvering simulations were also performed for step0 with a mn rudder it should be noted that the prediction accuracy of the simulation method was confirmed by performing a comparison with free running test results yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a and yasukawa et al 2015b for reference comparisons of turning trajectories between experiment and calculation in calm water and irregular waves are shown in figs 1 and 2 the agreement between experiment and calculation is acceptable in view of practical purposes the study discussed the effect of a high lift rudder on maneuverability based on simulation results from a navigation safety viewpoint 2 ship used in the study in this study the target ship corresponded to a vlcc titled kvlcc2 simman 2008 in which hull form data was previously published yasukawa et al 2017 table 1 lists the principal particulars of the ship in the table l denotes length between perpendiculars l w l denotes length of the waterline b denotes breadth d denotes depth d denotes draft denotes displacement volume s denotes wetted surface area without a rudder and a horn x g denotes longitudinal position of the center of gravity fore position from the midship is positive and c b denotes the block coefficient the load condition involved a full load even keel fig 3 illustrates the body plan fig 4 shows side and front views including the super structure of the ship used in the study the configuration and arrangement of the super structure were estimated based on an existing vlcc tanker with a similar size since an actual full scale ship corresponding to kvlcc2 was not available the front wind pressure area a x corresponds to 1 161 m2 and the side wind pressure area corresponds to a y 4 258 m2 table 2 shows a summary of eedi the main engine output the revolution and propeller specifics for step0 and step3 yasukawa et al 2017 in the study step0 is with respect to a conventional vlcc that corresponds to the base ship and step3 corresponds to a vlcc with 30 reduced eedi in the table p e denotes engine power at maximum continuous rating mcr n e denotes engine revolution at mcr d p denotes propeller diameter p denotes propeller pitch ratio a e a 0 denotes expanded area ratio and z denotes the number of blades the propeller was designed such that it achieved a ship speed of 15 5 knots in the normal output nor with a 15 sea margin based on the existing propeller diagram 3 design of a high lift rudder a rudder design necessitates the consideration of certain aspects such as working conditions parameters area thickness span and aspect ratio sectional shape structural arrangement and hydrodynamic interactions among hull propeller and rudder significantly the selection of the parameters and sectional shape impact ship maneuverability bertram 2012 existing studies liu et al 2016 nguyen and ikeda 2013 nagarajan et al 2008 indicate that a special rudder with a fishtail section produced a larger rudder force and smaller turning indexes when compared to those of a mariner rudder a rounded leading edge and a fishtail trailing edge were employed as the sectional shape of the present hl rudder additionally slipstream guide plates fitted to top and bottom of the rudder were used the plates will increase the lift gradient and it was experimentally investigated by tachi and endo 1996 fig 5 shows the profiles of mn and hl rudders in a full scale table 3 shows the principal particulars of mn and hl rudders in the table h r denotes span of the rudder b r denotes averaged chord of the rudder λ denotes the aspect ratio a r denotes rudder area including the horn and a r l d denotes rudder area ratio the rudder area of the hl rudder is approximately 30 less than that of mn rudder its aim involves reducing the rudder resistance of the hl rudder with a reduction in the rudder area of hl rudder it is expected to minimize the rudder torque although the rudder torque in hl rudder may be increased due to fishtail section and end plates effect additionally thinner thickness with a taper was employed in the hl rudder to reduce the rudder resistance since a thinner profile generally exhibits a better propulsive performance when compared to a thicker profile fig 6 shows photographs of two rudders for the ship model used in the tank tests the mn rudder incorporates a rudder horn that provides housing for a pintle to support the rudder and otherwise the hl rudder does not possess a horn 4 tank tests in order to capture the propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of the ship with mn and hl rudders tank tests were performed in the hiroshima university towing tank length 100 m width 8 m depth 3 5 m by using a scaled ship model model length 2 901 m scale ratio 1 110 4 1 propulsive performance self propulsion tests were conducted for a ship model with mn and hl rudders after completing propeller open test using a stock propeller model with 90 mm in the diameter and resistance tests by using the same ship model without a rudder therefore the effect of rudder difference was captured by the difference in the self propulsion factors such as thrust deduction factors t p wake fraction w and relative rotative efficiency η r subsequently the hull efficiency η h was predicted by 1 t p 1 w s of the full scale ship where w s denotes the wake fraction in full scale fig 7 shows the self propulsion factors and the hull efficiency the horizontal axis corresponds to the froude number f n w l based on the length waterline l w l table 4 shows a comparison of the self propulsion factors between mn and hl rudders at a service speed v s of 15 5 knots equivalent to f n w l 0 141 the ratio of wake fraction in full scale w s to the model w is assumed as 0 85 a high lift rudder hl rudder was attached and 1 t p increases to approximately 5 when compared to that of the mn rudder 1 w s increases by approximately 4 η r decreases by approximately 1 and η h increases by approximately 1 the difference is small the designed hl rudder is significantly reasonable to minimize the increase in rudder resistance 4 2 characteristics of rudder forces additionally the rudder force test in straight moving was performed to capture rudder force characteristics in the test the lateral force y and yawing moment around the midship n m acting on a ship hull and rudder normal force f n were measured when a ship moved in a straight manner while maintaining a certain rudder angle δ in the test the rudder angle δ was changed from 35 to 35 with an interval corresponding to 5 the detail of the measurements is skipped here because measurement equipment the arrangement the procedure and the data analysis have been described in ref yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a fig 8 shows the rudder force test results for both mn and hl rudders under a propeller loading condition with n p 17 2 rps and ship model speed u 0 76 m s equivalent to 15 5 knots in full scale this condition is termed as the model point the forces y and f n and moment n m are non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ l d u 2 and 1 2 ρ l 2 d u 2 respectively where ρ denotes water density the absolute values of y n m and f n increase linearly with increases in δ in the range of 20 to 20 inclinations of y n m and f n relative to the δ for the hl rudder increase when compared to those for the mn rudder thus y and n m are expressed as follows 1 y y δ δ n m n δ δ where y δ denotes rudder force derivative n δ denotes turning moment derivative and δ denotes rudder angle in radians table 5 shows the derivatives determined based on the measured data in the range of 20 to 20 when compared to the absolute value of the mn rudder the absolute value of y δ increases by 10 in hl rudder and the absolute value of n δ increases by approximately 8 thus a rudder force increase of 8 10 was confirmed with respect to the hl rudder as expected in contrast f n at the same δ increase by approximately 30 with respect to the hl rudder and the increase ratio is significantly different from the results of y and n m in order to clarify the reason the measured data was analyzed based on the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a according to the mmg model y and n m are expressed as follows 2 y 1 a h f n cos δ n m x r a h x h f n cos δ where a h denotes the rudder force increase factor x r denotes the non dimensionalized longitudinal coordinate of rudder position normally x r 0 5 and x h denotes the non dimensionalized longitudinal coordinate of the acting point of the additional lateral force component induced by steering 1 a h is determined as an inclination of y relative to f n cos δ and x r a h x h is also determined as an inclination of n relative to f n cos δ as shown in fig 9 table 6 shows 1 a h and x r a h x h of the mn and hl rudders furthermore 1 a h decreases by approximately 16 in hl rudder and the absolute value of x r a h x h decreases by approximately 17 when compared to those of the mn rudder the effective rudder force in hl rudder is reduced by approximately 16 17 due to the hull rudder interaction effect although the absolute value of f n increases by approximately 30 hence the increase ratio of the effective rudder force with respect to the hl rudder actually approximately corresponds to 1 09 1 30 1 0 16 the order of magnitude approximately coincides with the increase ratio of y δ or n δ as previously mentioned this is potentially because the hl rudder is incorporated with the horn although mn rudder is not as shown in fig 5 therefore the lift force acting on the horn part is not considered for f n of mn rudder conversely 1 a h or x r a h x h increases with the additional lift force 4 3 course stability to observe a difference of course stability of the ship with mn and hl rudders the course stability criterion c in calm water was compared the criterion c is expressed as follows 3 c y v g n r g y r g m m x n v g the ship becomes stable when c 0 and unstable when c 0 here y v g y r g n v g and n r g denote the non dimensionalized linear hydrodynamic derivatives on maneuvering and m and m x are the non dimensionalized mass and added mass respectively the derivatives correspond to the center of gravity as converted from midship point and include the effect of propeller and rudder and are expressed as follows 4 y v g y v k y u r γ r y r g y r y v x g k y u r γ r ℓ r n v g n v y v x g k n u r γ r n r g n r y r x g n v y v x g x g k n u r γ r ℓ r 5 k y y δ u r 2 k n n δ u r 2 where u r is non dimensionalized longitudinal inflow velocity component to the rudder and assumed to be 1 0 γ r is the flow straightening coefficient and ℓ r is non dimensional effective longitudinal coordinate of rudder position in formula of the effective inflow angle to rudder in maneuvering motions the last term of eq 4 represents the rudder effect the difference between mn and hl rudders in the linear derivatives appears as a change of k y and k n as shown in eq 5 k y and k n are equivalent to the rudder force and moment coefficients y δ n δ table 7 shows the calculation results of k y and k n the linear derivatives and c for ship with mn and hl rudders the hydrodynamic derivatives and parameters required for the calculation of c except y δ and n δ have been shown in ref yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a y δ and n δ were indicated in table 5 the c in mn rudder step3mn is 0 002 and hl rudder step3hl is 0 001 thus it confirmed that the ship with hl rudder is slightly more stable for course keeping however the difference is small 5 maneuvering simulations 5 1 motion equations fig 10 shows the coordinate systems used in the study specifically the space fixed coordinate system is denoted as o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in which the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points vertically downward the moving ship fixed coordinate system is denoted as o x y z in which o is considered on the midship of the ship and x y and z axes point toward the ship s bow i e toward the starboard and vertically downward directions respectively the heading angle ψ is defined as the angle between the x 0 and x axes furthermore δ denotes the rudder angle and r denotes the yaw rate additionally u and v m denotes the velocity components in x and y directions respectively the drift angle at the midship position is defined as β tan 1 v m u the total velocity corresponds to u u 2 v m 2 the main wave propagation direction is denoted as χ as shown in fig 10 subsequently relative wave direction χ 0 is defined as χ 0 χ ψ the head wave the beam wave and the following wave of the ship are defined as χ 0 0 χ 0 90 and χ 0 180 respectively the wind direction θ w is assumed as same as the wave direction χ the motion equations with respect to surge sway and yaw are expressed as follows yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a 6 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y i z g x g 2 m j z r x g m v m x g m u r n where m denotes mass of the ship i z g denotes moment of inertia around center of gravity m x and m y denote added masses of x axis direction and y axis direction respectively and j z denotes the added moment of inertia eq 6 denotes the equations of motion to be solved the unknown variables corresponded to u v m and r additionally x y and n in the right hand side of eq 6 denote the surge force lateral force and yaw moment respectively around the midship with the exception of the added mass components and are expressed as follows 7 x x h x r x p x w x a y y h y r y w y a n n h n r n w n a specifically subscripts h r and p denote the hull rudder and propeller respectively the forces with subscripts h r and p are predicted by using the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a the subscript w denotes the wave induced steady forces in irregular waves and a denotes the wind forces and this is predicted with the same conditions as those used in a previous study yasukawa et al 2017 note that the hydrodynamic interaction components between hull and rudder represented by the parameters a h and x h as shown in section 4 2 are included in y r and n r referring to the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a the motion equation i e eq 6 is solved and thus it is numerically possible to determine the maneuvering motions of the ship 5 2 simulation outline in the maneuvering simulations of full scale ship with the hl rudder the initial approach speed u 0 corresponds to 15 5 knots navigation full condition the rudder steering rate corresponds to 2 34 s and the radius of yaw gyration corresponds to 0 25 l the engine and propeller used are the same as those in the ship with mn rudder together with the torque limit model yasukawa et al 2017 propeller revolution n p is assumed to be constant except a case over the restrictions placed by the torque limit the hydrodynamic treatments in the simulations are summarized as follows a 30 increase in the rudder normal force f n is used for the simulations based on the test result indicated in section 4 given the a h and x h the measured values as shown in table 6 are used and with the exception of f n a h and x h the hydrodynamic parameters used are the same as those in the ship with the mn rudder yasukawa et al 2017 the environmental parameters are set based on the beaufort scale table 8 shows the wind power class of the beaufort scale bf used in the simulations in adverse conditions the table shows the absolute wind speed denoted as u w significant wave height denoted as h 1 3 average wave period denoted as t v the wind and waves are assumed as constant with respect to time and the wind direction θ w is same as the wave direction χ 5 3 turning in calm water fig 11 shows a comparison of turning trajectories between step0 step 3 mn and step 3 hl given a rudder angle of 35 step0 denotes a conventional vlcc and step3mn and step3hl denote a vlcc with a mn rudder and a hl rudder respectively under a condition with 30 reduced eedi table 9 shows a comparison of turning indexes such as advances a d and tactical diameters d t when compared to step0 the turning radius in step3mn increases and a d and d t increase by 14 and 12 respectively and correspond to the averaged value of port and starboard turning the reduction in the rudder normal force f n causes the deterioration in the turning performance yasukawa et al 2017 this is due to the low propeller load that results from the small engine output when compared to step3mn the turning radius in step3hl decreases and a d and d t decrease by approximately 7 as the average values of port and starboard turning respectively thus a significant improvement of the turning performance is confirmed by attaching the high lift rudder the turning indexes a d d t in step3hl satisfy the imo maneuvering criteria imo 2002a imo 2002b with a sufficient margin although they slightly exceed those in step0 the turning performance of step3hl is not at a potentially problematic level 5 4 zig zag maneuvers in calm water fig 12 shows the time histories of heading angle ψ and rudder angle δ in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers in calm water additionally fig 13 shows the time histories of ψ and δ during 20 20 and 20 20 zig zag maneuvers to confirm the effect of hl rudder during zig zag maneuvers a comparison of rudder normal force f n between mn and hl rudders is also shown in figs 12 and 13 step3hl has the larger absolute values of f n than step3mn at the time of rudder angle changes from port side to starboard side and vice versa and is close to the step0 in all cases this indicates that hl rudder produces a larger lift force than mn rudder as expected tables 10 and 11 depict a comparison of overshoot angle osa during the zig zag maneuvers the osas of step3mn exceed those of step0 and the course stability evidently worsens the average value of the 1st osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers increases by 23 in step3mn and the average value of 2nd osa also increases by 43 the reduction in the rudder normal force f n led to an increase in the osas as mentioned in 5 3 conversely the osa in step3hl is smaller than that of step3mn the average value of the 1st osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers decreases by 22 in step3hl and the average value of 2nd osa also decreases by 33 the high lift rudder is useful in significantly reducing the osas in zig zag maneuvers it should be noted that the imo maneuvering criterion imo 2002a imo 2002b is fulfilled in all the cases 5 5 steady state sailing conditions in adverse weather conditions a ship traveling with a propeller revolution in the design speed is considered under wind and waves using the auto pilot in the auto pilot the pd control is applied with a proportional gain corresponding to 5 0 and a differential gain corresponding to 20 0 s the adverse conditions in the simulation correspond to the environmental parameters wind and waves which were based on beaufort scale as mentioned in table 8 fig 14 shows the longitudinal component of the ship speed denoted as u hull drift angle denoted as β and check helm denoted as δ in the steady state sailing condition under wind and waves for step3mn and step3hl in the figure additional lines are inserted to connect the calculation results for purposes of distinction a significant decrease in speed occurs with an increase in the bf scale the speed decreases in step3hl are almost the same as those in step3mn in χ 0 0 of bf9 u is less than 8 knots for both and the propeller revolution decreases due to the restrictions placed by the torque limit the β and absolute value of δ increase with increases in the bf scale the largest β occurs approximately at χ 0 75 and the smallest δ occurs approximately at χ 0 90 this tendency is the same for both step3mn and step3hl in bf9 the maximum β approximately corresponds to 3 2 and is almost identical in both step3mn and step3hl the minimum δ approximately corresponds to 8 1 in step3hl and 10 6 in step3mn thus the check helm of step3hl is smaller than that of step3mn the hl rudder is effective in reducing the check helm in adverse weather conditions 5 6 course changing ability in adverse weather conditions course changing simulations are performed by steering the rudder angle δ 20 in wind and waves fig 15 shows a comparison of ship trajectories in bf7 and bf9 the direction of the wind and waves changes to χ 0 30 and 60 the steady state speed shown in fig 14 is used as an approach speed in the simulation a course change with a significant speed decrease is observed in bf9 since the situations involved bow wind and waves fig 16 shows a comparison of the non dimensional values of advance a d and transfer t r in the course change with respect to the bf scale for the three different wave wind directions it should be noted that sw shown in the horizontal axis of the figure denotes still water additionally a d and t r in step3hl are smaller than those in step3mn thus step3hl indicates better maneuverability when compared to step3mn this is because step3hl indicates a better turning performance in calm water when compared to step3mn as discussed in section 5 3 6 concluding remarks in this study an improvement of maneuverability of a vlcc with small engine output under a condition with 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 was performed by attaching a high lift rudder first a high lift rudder hl rudder with fishtail section and end plates was newly designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that involved minimizing the rudder resistance increase the rudder area including horn was reduced by approximately 30 when compared to the original mariner rudder mn rudder the tank tests confirmed that the designed hl rudder increased the effective rudder force to approximately 10 with a few delivered power increases when compared to those of mn rudder subsequently time domain simulations based on the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a were conducted for a full scale ship with hl and mn rudders to investigate the effect of the high lift rudder on the maneuvering motions in calm water as well as the steady state sailing condition and course changing ability in adverse weather conditions the attachment of the hl rudder when compared to mn rudder leads to the following 1 advance a d and tactical diameter d t decreased to approximately 7 as the averaged value of port and starboard turning with a rudder angle of 35 in calm water 2 the averaged 1st overshoot angle osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers decreased by 22 and the averaged 2nd osa also decreased by 33 3 the check helm reduced by approximately 25 in adverse weather conditions and a better course changing ability was confirmed in all the wind and wave directions thus the results indicated that a high lift rudder is useful in improving the maneuverability of the vlcc with a 30 reduction in eedi further investigation is suggested to check the rudder torque of the high lift rudder acknowledgement this study was supported by jsps kakenhi grant number jp26249135 and the fundamental

23168,in this study the improvement of maneuverability of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc with small engine output under a condition involving 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 was performed by attaching a high lift rudder a high lift rudder hl rudder with a fishtail section and end plates was newly designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that minimizes the increase in rudder resistance tank tests were performed by using a scaled ship model with a hl rudder to capture propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of the ship with a hl rudder the results indicated that the designed hl rudder increased the effective rudder force by approximately 10 when compared to a conventional mariner rudder mn rudder the incorporation of the test results into the mmg simulation model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a allowed the performance of maneuvering simulations in calm water and adverse weather conditions for a ship with hl and mn rudders the results indicated that the hl rudder presented in this study is useful in improving maneuverability while maintaining almost the same level as the propulsive performance of a ship with a mariner rudder keywords ship

400 gt must reduce energy efficiency design index eedi by a maximum of 30 after 2025 imo 2011 the employment of a small main engine output is an extremely effective way to lower fuel consumption and to reduce co 2 emissions however small engine output may lead to a low propeller load and thereby reduces the rudder force therefore an excessive reduction in the engine output results in a potentially unexpected unsafe situation in which a helms man is unable to adequately maneuver a ship in adverse weather conditions yasukawa et al 2017 studied the effect of small main engine output on maneuverability of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc in still water and adverse weather conditions in the study the initial design of a vlcc involved 30 eedi reduced step3 as opposed to a conventional vlcc step0 by employing energy saving devices a large diameter propeller and a low output engine with an electronic control the results confirmed that the maneuverability of step3 was worse than that in step0 with respect to time domain maneuvering simulations in the simulations problems that did not comply with imo maneuvering criteria imo 2002a imo 2002b did not occur although the engine output was reduced in step3 this was because a conventional ship step0 initially possessed good maneuverability and a sufficient margin existed for the imo criteria accordingly a reduction in the main engine output due to advances in energy saving technology based on a situation in which a ship faces limitation in terms of the imo criteria could lead to a possibility in which maneuverability worsens until an unacceptable level is reached in terms of navigational safety through a reduction in the rudder force in this case measures are required to ensure that maneuverability does not worsen through given further advances in energy savings as one of the counter measure a rudder with special sectional shape special rudder is applied for achieving the high lift rudder force in this paper the high lift rudder improves the ship maneuverability certainly several studies examined the impact of a special rudder on maneuvering and propulsive performances of ships bingham and mackey 1987 reviewed the maneuvering performance of ships with a high lift rudder such as the schilling rudder and a flap rudder and indicated that the schilling rudder exhibited better turning ability was simpler in construction and cheaper when compared with the flap rudder brix 1993 indicated that the rudder with various fishtails section produces a larger lift force as compared to the naca mariner rudder although the drag increases at all rudder angles the lift force of this rudder evidently improved about 8 12 when attached on a series of container ship hasegawa et al 2006 investigated the course keeping ability of a pure car carrier in windy conditions for two rudders schilling rudder and mariner rudder and concluded that the schilling rudder produces a larger lift force when compared with the mariner rudder nagarajan et al 2008 confirmed that maneuverability and fuel efficiency of a vlcc with a schilling rudder were superior when compared with a ship with a conventional mariner rudder nguyen and ikeda 2013 numerically confirmed that a rudder with a fishtail section exhibited a higher lift when compared with a naca mariner rudder liu et al 2016 investigated the impact of the rudder section on maneuvering performance and the results indicated that the wedge tail section produces a larger rudder force and smaller turning indexes albeit with least efficiency i e higher rudder resistance in summary extant studies indicated that a rudder with a fishtail or a wedge tail section similar to a shilling rudder can potentially be used as a measure to improve maneuverability although there is a possibility that the propulsive performance is worsened due to increase of the rudder resistance to minimize the rudder resistance increase in this paper a high lift rudder with small rudder area is newly designed this study involved performing an improvement in the maneuverability of a vlcc with small engine output under a condition with 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 by attaching a high lift rudder as an extension of a previous study yasukawa et al 2017 extant studies did not investigate the effect of a high lift rudder on the maneuverability of a ship in adverse weather conditions with respect to small engine output first a high lift rudder with a fishtail section and end plates was designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that minimized the rudder resistance increase the new rudder is termed as a hl rudder in this study conversely the original mariner rudder is termed as a mn rudder this is followed by performing tank tests by using a scaled ship model model length 2 909 m to capture the propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of a ship with mn and hl rudders the incorporation of the test results into the mmg simulation model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a led to the performance of maneuvering simulations in calm water and adverse weather conditions for a vlcc with a hl rudder step3hl and mn rudder step3mn for the purposes of comparison maneuvering simulations were also performed for step0 with a mn rudder it should be noted that the prediction accuracy of the simulation method was confirmed by performing a comparison with free running test results yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a and yasukawa et al 2015b for reference comparisons of turning trajectories between experiment and calculation in calm water and irregular waves are shown in figs 1 and 2 the agreement between experiment and calculation is acceptable in view of practical purposes the study discussed the effect of a high lift rudder on maneuverability based on simulation results from a navigation safety viewpoint 2 ship used in the study in this study the target ship corresponded to a vlcc titled kvlcc2 simman 2008 in which hull form data was previously published yasukawa et al 2017 table 1 lists the principal particulars of the ship in the table l denotes length between perpendiculars l w l denotes length of the waterline b denotes breadth d denotes depth d denotes draft denotes displacement volume s denotes wetted surface area without a rudder and a horn x g denotes longitudinal position of the center of gravity fore position from the midship is positive and c b denotes the block coefficient the load condition involved a full load even keel fig 3 illustrates the body plan fig 4 shows side and front views including the super structure of the ship used in the study the configuration and arrangement of the super structure were estimated based on an existing vlcc tanker with a similar size since an actual full scale ship corresponding to kvlcc2 was not available the front wind pressure area a x corresponds to 1 161 m2 and the side wind pressure area corresponds to a y 4 258 m2 table 2 shows a summary of eedi the main engine output the revolution and propeller specifics for step0 and step3 yasukawa et al 2017 in the study step0 is with respect to a conventional vlcc that corresponds to the base ship and step3 corresponds to a vlcc with 30 reduced eedi in the table p e denotes engine power at maximum continuous rating mcr n e denotes engine revolution at mcr d p denotes propeller diameter p denotes propeller pitch ratio a e a 0 denotes expanded area ratio and z denotes the number of blades the propeller was designed such that it achieved a ship speed of 15 5 knots in the normal output nor with a 15 sea margin based on the existing propeller diagram 3 design of a high lift rudder a rudder design necessitates the consideration of certain aspects such as working conditions parameters area thickness span and aspect ratio sectional shape structural arrangement and hydrodynamic interactions among hull propeller and rudder significantly the selection of the parameters and sectional shape impact ship maneuverability bertram 2012 existing studies liu et al 2016 nguyen and ikeda 2013 nagarajan et al 2008 indicate that a special rudder with a fishtail section produced a larger rudder force and smaller turning indexes when compared to those of a mariner rudder a rounded leading edge and a fishtail trailing edge were employed as the sectional shape of the present hl rudder additionally slipstream guide plates fitted to top and bottom of the rudder were used the plates will increase the lift gradient and it was experimentally investigated by tachi and endo 1996 fig 5 shows the profiles of mn and hl rudders in a full scale table 3 shows the principal particulars of mn and hl rudders in the table h r denotes span of the rudder b r denotes averaged chord of the rudder λ denotes the aspect ratio a r denotes rudder area including the horn and a r l d denotes rudder area ratio the rudder area of the hl rudder is approximately 30 less than that of mn rudder its aim involves reducing the rudder resistance of the hl rudder with a reduction in the rudder area of hl rudder it is expected to minimize the rudder torque although the rudder torque in hl rudder may be increased due to fishtail section and end plates effect additionally thinner thickness with a taper was employed in the hl rudder to reduce the rudder resistance since a thinner profile generally exhibits a better propulsive performance when compared to a thicker profile fig 6 shows photographs of two rudders for the ship model used in the tank tests the mn rudder incorporates a rudder horn that provides housing for a pintle to support the rudder and otherwise the hl rudder does not possess a horn 4 tank tests in order to capture the propulsive performance and rudder force characteristics of the ship with mn and hl rudders tank tests were performed in the hiroshima university towing tank length 100 m width 8 m depth 3 5 m by using a scaled ship model model length 2 901 m scale ratio 1 110 4 1 propulsive performance self propulsion tests were conducted for a ship model with mn and hl rudders after completing propeller open test using a stock propeller model with 90 mm in the diameter and resistance tests by using the same ship model without a rudder therefore the effect of rudder difference was captured by the difference in the self propulsion factors such as thrust deduction factors t p wake fraction w and relative rotative efficiency η r subsequently the hull efficiency η h was predicted by 1 t p 1 w s of the full scale ship where w s denotes the wake fraction in full scale fig 7 shows the self propulsion factors and the hull efficiency the horizontal axis corresponds to the froude number f n w l based on the length waterline l w l table 4 shows a comparison of the self propulsion factors between mn and hl rudders at a service speed v s of 15 5 knots equivalent to f n w l 0 141 the ratio of wake fraction in full scale w s to the model w is assumed as 0 85 a high lift rudder hl rudder was attached and 1 t p increases to approximately 5 when compared to that of the mn rudder 1 w s increases by approximately 4 η r decreases by approximately 1 and η h increases by approximately 1 the difference is small the designed hl rudder is significantly reasonable to minimize the increase in rudder resistance 4 2 characteristics of rudder forces additionally the rudder force test in straight moving was performed to capture rudder force characteristics in the test the lateral force y and yawing moment around the midship n m acting on a ship hull and rudder normal force f n were measured when a ship moved in a straight manner while maintaining a certain rudder angle δ in the test the rudder angle δ was changed from 35 to 35 with an interval corresponding to 5 the detail of the measurements is skipped here because measurement equipment the arrangement the procedure and the data analysis have been described in ref yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a fig 8 shows the rudder force test results for both mn and hl rudders under a propeller loading condition with n p 17 2 rps and ship model speed u 0 76 m s equivalent to 15 5 knots in full scale this condition is termed as the model point the forces y and f n and moment n m are non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ l d u 2 and 1 2 ρ l 2 d u 2 respectively where ρ denotes water density the absolute values of y n m and f n increase linearly with increases in δ in the range of 20 to 20 inclinations of y n m and f n relative to the δ for the hl rudder increase when compared to those for the mn rudder thus y and n m are expressed as follows 1 y y δ δ n m n δ δ where y δ denotes rudder force derivative n δ denotes turning moment derivative and δ denotes rudder angle in radians table 5 shows the derivatives determined based on the measured data in the range of 20 to 20 when compared to the absolute value of the mn rudder the absolute value of y δ increases by 10 in hl rudder and the absolute value of n δ increases by approximately 8 thus a rudder force increase of 8 10 was confirmed with respect to the hl rudder as expected in contrast f n at the same δ increase by approximately 30 with respect to the hl rudder and the increase ratio is significantly different from the results of y and n m in order to clarify the reason the measured data was analyzed based on the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a according to the mmg model y and n m are expressed as follows 2 y 1 a h f n cos δ n m x r a h x h f n cos δ where a h denotes the rudder force increase factor x r denotes the non dimensionalized longitudinal coordinate of rudder position normally x r 0 5 and x h denotes the non dimensionalized longitudinal coordinate of the acting point of the additional lateral force component induced by steering 1 a h is determined as an inclination of y relative to f n cos δ and x r a h x h is also determined as an inclination of n relative to f n cos δ as shown in fig 9 table 6 shows 1 a h and x r a h x h of the mn and hl rudders furthermore 1 a h decreases by approximately 16 in hl rudder and the absolute value of x r a h x h decreases by approximately 17 when compared to those of the mn rudder the effective rudder force in hl rudder is reduced by approximately 16 17 due to the hull rudder interaction effect although the absolute value of f n increases by approximately 30 hence the increase ratio of the effective rudder force with respect to the hl rudder actually approximately corresponds to 1 09 1 30 1 0 16 the order of magnitude approximately coincides with the increase ratio of y δ or n δ as previously mentioned this is potentially because the hl rudder is incorporated with the horn although mn rudder is not as shown in fig 5 therefore the lift force acting on the horn part is not considered for f n of mn rudder conversely 1 a h or x r a h x h increases with the additional lift force 4 3 course stability to observe a difference of course stability of the ship with mn and hl rudders the course stability criterion c in calm water was compared the criterion c is expressed as follows 3 c y v g n r g y r g m m x n v g the ship becomes stable when c 0 and unstable when c 0 here y v g y r g n v g and n r g denote the non dimensionalized linear hydrodynamic derivatives on maneuvering and m and m x are the non dimensionalized mass and added mass respectively the derivatives correspond to the center of gravity as converted from midship point and include the effect of propeller and rudder and are expressed as follows 4 y v g y v k y u r γ r y r g y r y v x g k y u r γ r ℓ r n v g n v y v x g k n u r γ r n r g n r y r x g n v y v x g x g k n u r γ r ℓ r 5 k y y δ u r 2 k n n δ u r 2 where u r is non dimensionalized longitudinal inflow velocity component to the rudder and assumed to be 1 0 γ r is the flow straightening coefficient and ℓ r is non dimensional effective longitudinal coordinate of rudder position in formula of the effective inflow angle to rudder in maneuvering motions the last term of eq 4 represents the rudder effect the difference between mn and hl rudders in the linear derivatives appears as a change of k y and k n as shown in eq 5 k y and k n are equivalent to the rudder force and moment coefficients y δ n δ table 7 shows the calculation results of k y and k n the linear derivatives and c for ship with mn and hl rudders the hydrodynamic derivatives and parameters required for the calculation of c except y δ and n δ have been shown in ref yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a y δ and n δ were indicated in table 5 the c in mn rudder step3mn is 0 002 and hl rudder step3hl is 0 001 thus it confirmed that the ship with hl rudder is slightly more stable for course keeping however the difference is small 5 maneuvering simulations 5 1 motion equations fig 10 shows the coordinate systems used in the study specifically the space fixed coordinate system is denoted as o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 in which the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points vertically downward the moving ship fixed coordinate system is denoted as o x y z in which o is considered on the midship of the ship and x y and z axes point toward the ship s bow i e toward the starboard and vertically downward directions respectively the heading angle ψ is defined as the angle between the x 0 and x axes furthermore δ denotes the rudder angle and r denotes the yaw rate additionally u and v m denotes the velocity components in x and y directions respectively the drift angle at the midship position is defined as β tan 1 v m u the total velocity corresponds to u u 2 v m 2 the main wave propagation direction is denoted as χ as shown in fig 10 subsequently relative wave direction χ 0 is defined as χ 0 χ ψ the head wave the beam wave and the following wave of the ship are defined as χ 0 0 χ 0 90 and χ 0 180 respectively the wind direction θ w is assumed as same as the wave direction χ the motion equations with respect to surge sway and yaw are expressed as follows yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a 6 m m x u m m y v m r x g m r 2 x m m y v m m m x u r x g m r y i z g x g 2 m j z r x g m v m x g m u r n where m denotes mass of the ship i z g denotes moment of inertia around center of gravity m x and m y denote added masses of x axis direction and y axis direction respectively and j z denotes the added moment of inertia eq 6 denotes the equations of motion to be solved the unknown variables corresponded to u v m and r additionally x y and n in the right hand side of eq 6 denote the surge force lateral force and yaw moment respectively around the midship with the exception of the added mass components and are expressed as follows 7 x x h x r x p x w x a y y h y r y w y a n n h n r n w n a specifically subscripts h r and p denote the hull rudder and propeller respectively the forces with subscripts h r and p are predicted by using the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a the subscript w denotes the wave induced steady forces in irregular waves and a denotes the wind forces and this is predicted with the same conditions as those used in a previous study yasukawa et al 2017 note that the hydrodynamic interaction components between hull and rudder represented by the parameters a h and x h as shown in section 4 2 are included in y r and n r referring to the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a the motion equation i e eq 6 is solved and thus it is numerically possible to determine the maneuvering motions of the ship 5 2 simulation outline in the maneuvering simulations of full scale ship with the hl rudder the initial approach speed u 0 corresponds to 15 5 knots navigation full condition the rudder steering rate corresponds to 2 34 s and the radius of yaw gyration corresponds to 0 25 l the engine and propeller used are the same as those in the ship with mn rudder together with the torque limit model yasukawa et al 2017 propeller revolution n p is assumed to be constant except a case over the restrictions placed by the torque limit the hydrodynamic treatments in the simulations are summarized as follows a 30 increase in the rudder normal force f n is used for the simulations based on the test result indicated in section 4 given the a h and x h the measured values as shown in table 6 are used and with the exception of f n a h and x h the hydrodynamic parameters used are the same as those in the ship with the mn rudder yasukawa et al 2017 the environmental parameters are set based on the beaufort scale table 8 shows the wind power class of the beaufort scale bf used in the simulations in adverse conditions the table shows the absolute wind speed denoted as u w significant wave height denoted as h 1 3 average wave period denoted as t v the wind and waves are assumed as constant with respect to time and the wind direction θ w is same as the wave direction χ 5 3 turning in calm water fig 11 shows a comparison of turning trajectories between step0 step 3 mn and step 3 hl given a rudder angle of 35 step0 denotes a conventional vlcc and step3mn and step3hl denote a vlcc with a mn rudder and a hl rudder respectively under a condition with 30 reduced eedi table 9 shows a comparison of turning indexes such as advances a d and tactical diameters d t when compared to step0 the turning radius in step3mn increases and a d and d t increase by 14 and 12 respectively and correspond to the averaged value of port and starboard turning the reduction in the rudder normal force f n causes the deterioration in the turning performance yasukawa et al 2017 this is due to the low propeller load that results from the small engine output when compared to step3mn the turning radius in step3hl decreases and a d and d t decrease by approximately 7 as the average values of port and starboard turning respectively thus a significant improvement of the turning performance is confirmed by attaching the high lift rudder the turning indexes a d d t in step3hl satisfy the imo maneuvering criteria imo 2002a imo 2002b with a sufficient margin although they slightly exceed those in step0 the turning performance of step3hl is not at a potentially problematic level 5 4 zig zag maneuvers in calm water fig 12 shows the time histories of heading angle ψ and rudder angle δ in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers in calm water additionally fig 13 shows the time histories of ψ and δ during 20 20 and 20 20 zig zag maneuvers to confirm the effect of hl rudder during zig zag maneuvers a comparison of rudder normal force f n between mn and hl rudders is also shown in figs 12 and 13 step3hl has the larger absolute values of f n than step3mn at the time of rudder angle changes from port side to starboard side and vice versa and is close to the step0 in all cases this indicates that hl rudder produces a larger lift force than mn rudder as expected tables 10 and 11 depict a comparison of overshoot angle osa during the zig zag maneuvers the osas of step3mn exceed those of step0 and the course stability evidently worsens the average value of the 1st osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers increases by 23 in step3mn and the average value of 2nd osa also increases by 43 the reduction in the rudder normal force f n led to an increase in the osas as mentioned in 5 3 conversely the osa in step3hl is smaller than that of step3mn the average value of the 1st osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers decreases by 22 in step3hl and the average value of 2nd osa also decreases by 33 the high lift rudder is useful in significantly reducing the osas in zig zag maneuvers it should be noted that the imo maneuvering criterion imo 2002a imo 2002b is fulfilled in all the cases 5 5 steady state sailing conditions in adverse weather conditions a ship traveling with a propeller revolution in the design speed is considered under wind and waves using the auto pilot in the auto pilot the pd control is applied with a proportional gain corresponding to 5 0 and a differential gain corresponding to 20 0 s the adverse conditions in the simulation correspond to the environmental parameters wind and waves which were based on beaufort scale as mentioned in table 8 fig 14 shows the longitudinal component of the ship speed denoted as u hull drift angle denoted as β and check helm denoted as δ in the steady state sailing condition under wind and waves for step3mn and step3hl in the figure additional lines are inserted to connect the calculation results for purposes of distinction a significant decrease in speed occurs with an increase in the bf scale the speed decreases in step3hl are almost the same as those in step3mn in χ 0 0 of bf9 u is less than 8 knots for both and the propeller revolution decreases due to the restrictions placed by the torque limit the β and absolute value of δ increase with increases in the bf scale the largest β occurs approximately at χ 0 75 and the smallest δ occurs approximately at χ 0 90 this tendency is the same for both step3mn and step3hl in bf9 the maximum β approximately corresponds to 3 2 and is almost identical in both step3mn and step3hl the minimum δ approximately corresponds to 8 1 in step3hl and 10 6 in step3mn thus the check helm of step3hl is smaller than that of step3mn the hl rudder is effective in reducing the check helm in adverse weather conditions 5 6 course changing ability in adverse weather conditions course changing simulations are performed by steering the rudder angle δ 20 in wind and waves fig 15 shows a comparison of ship trajectories in bf7 and bf9 the direction of the wind and waves changes to χ 0 30 and 60 the steady state speed shown in fig 14 is used as an approach speed in the simulation a course change with a significant speed decrease is observed in bf9 since the situations involved bow wind and waves fig 16 shows a comparison of the non dimensional values of advance a d and transfer t r in the course change with respect to the bf scale for the three different wave wind directions it should be noted that sw shown in the horizontal axis of the figure denotes still water additionally a d and t r in step3hl are smaller than those in step3mn thus step3hl indicates better maneuverability when compared to step3mn this is because step3hl indicates a better turning performance in calm water when compared to step3mn as discussed in section 5 3 6 concluding remarks in this study an improvement of maneuverability of a vlcc with small engine output under a condition with 30 reduced eedi imo 2012 was performed by attaching a high lift rudder first a high lift rudder hl rudder with fishtail section and end plates was newly designed to increase the rudder force under a restriction that involved minimizing the rudder resistance increase the rudder area including horn was reduced by approximately 30 when compared to the original mariner rudder mn rudder the tank tests confirmed that the designed hl rudder increased the effective rudder force to approximately 10 with a few delivered power increases when compared to those of mn rudder subsequently time domain simulations based on the mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015a were conducted for a full scale ship with hl and mn rudders to investigate the effect of the high lift rudder on the maneuvering motions in calm water as well as the steady state sailing condition and course changing ability in adverse weather conditions the attachment of the hl rudder when compared to mn rudder leads to the following 1 advance a d and tactical diameter d t decreased to approximately 7 as the averaged value of port and starboard turning with a rudder angle of 35 in calm water 2 the averaged 1st overshoot angle osa in 10 10 and 10 10 zig zag maneuvers decreased by 22 and the averaged 2nd osa also decreased by 33 3 the check helm reduced by approximately 25 in adverse weather conditions and a better course changing ability was confirmed in all the wind and wave directions thus the results indicated that a high lift rudder is useful in improving the maneuverability of the vlcc with a 30 reduction in eedi further investigation is suggested to check the rudder torque of the high lift rudder acknowledgement this study was supported by jsps kakenhi grant number jp26249135 and the fundamental

23169,growing interest in marine autonomous systems such as underwater gliders and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs has led to the increase of research on hydrofoil performance at low reynolds numbers bringing forward the issue of simulating laminar to turbulent transition using computational fluid dynamics cfd most conventional turbulence closures in practical reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations are incapable of predicting transition with excessive turbulence generation near the leading edge deriving from their eddy viscosity assumption having the potential of inherently predicting transition by solving the near wall flow accurately three low re rans closures with anisotropy consideration are selected and evaluated for their ability to capture both separation induced transition and natural transition the empirical γ re θ transition model is also assessed in this work comparison with published experiments shows the capability of the four turbulence closures to capture separation induced transition accurately predicting natural transition remains more challenging two low re closures exhibit the potential to capture natural transition only at medium grid finesse levels whereas the γ re θ model evidences challenges in reproducing the correct flow physics the lag elliptic blending model provides the most accurate solution owing to its consistent grid convergence high accuracy for predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients and ability to reproduce the correct transition physics keywords flow around hydrofoils separation induced transition natural transition turbulence model separation bubble 1 introduction research on hydrofoil performance at low reynolds numbers has seen renewed attention due to the growing interest in marine autonomous systems including underwater gliders lemaire et al 2016 autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and micro unmanned surface vessels usvs for monitoring the marine environment and supporting maritime security mainly working in the low reynolds number range their propelling hydrofoils can suffer from laminar to turbulent transition which poses a great challenge for accurate cfd simulation other applications with transition issues include marine current turbines offshore wind turbines ship rudders stabilizers and propellers transition depending on its occurring mechanism is commonly divided into three different modes mayle 1991 natural transition is caused by inherent instabilities in the laminar boundary layer which becomes unstable beyond a critical reynolds number while the freestream turbulence is very low 1 bypass transition is caused by the convection and diffusion from high level free stream turbulence into the boundary layer and other external disturbances such as wakes vortices and surface defects separation induced transition happens when a laminar boundary layer separates due to a strong adverse pressure gradient and the separated flow undergoes transition as a result of inviscid instability mechanism the separated layer may reattach and form a separation bubble on the surface for hydrofoil flows typically natural transition or separation induced transition may occur depending on the foil shape reynolds number and angle of attack while bypass transition is mostly encountered in turbomachinery applications the process of boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulence is a basic scientific problem of fluid dynamics and one that has been extensively examined both theoretically and experimentally theoretical methods based on stability theory trace back to 1950s when the e n method was proposed for predicting transition onset by smith 1956 and ingen and van 1956 stability of a laminar boundary layer has been analyzed through the linearized orr sommerfeld equations and disturbance growth is integrated from the boundary layer neutral point to the transition location the main obstacle for the stability theory based methods is the requirement of streamline information which demands the coupling to a cfd solution on the other hand new experimental data for transitional boundary layers have enabled the development of several correlation based transition models abu ghannam and shaw 1980 mayle 1991 kohama and davis 1993 etc for predicting transition onset and dey 1990 cho and chung s 1992 steelant and dick 1994 for predicting transition length typically the correlation models again require a combination to a cfd solution in order to capture the interaction between laminar and turbulent regimes pasquale et al 2009 in recent years with the advancement of supercomputers high fidelity dns and les computations have also become possible for uncovering transition physics and mechanisms for example les of a plane channel flow by schlatter 2005 clearly showed various stages of natural transition ranging from tollmien schlichting streamwise instability waves spanwise vorticity 3d breakdown turbulent spots to fully turbulent flow fig 1 dns study by jacobs and durbina 2001 visualized the formation of streaks spots and transition to turbulence phenomenon in bypass transition however presently the computational cost for dns and les studies is still too high for routine use in industrial applications which propels the need for practical rans based cfd simulations with proper transition models the applicability of conventional rans closures to the transition process is certainly questionable especially for natural transition where the linear disturbance growth effect is not directly reproducible with rans averaging rodi 2007 bypass and separation induced transition are expected and have shown to be reproducible with some versions of low reynolds number rans closures since their triggering mechanisms diffusion from freestream turbulence and laminar separation respectively are amenable to rans modeling while the averaged nature of the rans equations cannot describe the disturbance growth and the evolution of the natural transition process hence the transition length we suggest that low re rans closures have the ability to distinguish the laminar and turbulent regions if the correct level of eddy viscosity is generated therefore accurate rans models could have the potential of capturing the transition onset with a point transition to turbulence for a hydrofoil natural transition progresses rapidly with a relatively short transition length as shown in fig 2 making the point transition assumption reasonable for engineering applications based on these observations we postulate that accurate low re rans closures may retain the ability to predict both natural and separation induced transition on hydrofoils rather than attempting to predict transition inherently using a low re rans closure a more popular approach has been to make use of empirical information to develop specialized transition models this approach also presents a number of challenges the e n method is not compatible with general purpose cfd codes since it requires prior knowledge of geometry and grid topology on the other hand most empirical correlations involve non local operations precluding their implementation into general purpose cfd codes to deal with this limitation langtry 2006 and menter et al 2006 proposed the γ re θ transition model with fully local formulations which currently is one of the most widely adopted transition models in industrial cfd applications the model leverages empirically optimized correlations to try to predict all three transition modes and has been applied to several applications having been calibrated against a specific set of experimental data this model does not guarantee broad applicability and still requires extensive validation studies for assessing its application limits and suitability the aim of the present work is to assess the applicability of several rans turbulence closures for predicting both natural and separation induced transition on hydrofoil eppler 387 for which experimental data are available in the literature in addition to the empirical γ re θ transition model three low re closures are selected for their ability to include near wall anisotropy effects the elliptic blending k ε model of billard and laurence s 2012 and the lag elliptic blending model of lardeau and billard 2016 leverage the elliptic blending approach to account for the near wall stress anisotropy while lien s low re model lien et al 1996 combined with the nlevm of baglietto and ninokata 2006 2007 adopts a cubic stress strain correlation therefore including also the effects of curvature and rotation results for the k ω s s t model of menter 1994 are also presented as they provide a reference solution of a broadly adopted eddy viscosity model 2 rans turbulence closures assuming incompressible newtonian fluid the reynolds averaged equations for mass and momentum conservation are commonly expressed as 1 u j x j 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j where ρ is the fluid density ν the kinematic viscosity and the reynolds stress term u i u j requires closure according to the boussinesq hypothesis the reynolds stress can be linked to the mean rate of strain s i j through the eddy viscosity ν t 3 u i u j 2 3 k δ i j 2 ν t s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and δ i j is kronecker symbol different eddy viscosity models provide different methods for deriving the turbulent viscosity ν t mostly by solving transport equations for scalar quantities such as k and ε in the popular standard k ε turbulence model of jones and launder 1972 or k and ω in the k ω s s t model of menter 1994 in all cases the oversimplified assumption of a scalar relationship between stress and strain explains most of the limitations of the models in dealing with complex flow simulation that include strong anisotropy curvature and rotation effects the eddy viscosity approach leads to over prediction of the turbulent viscosity in all complex strain conditions including curvature and stagnation regions which explains their limited applicability to hydrofoil simulations the turbulence closures selected in this work attempt to either directly correct the turbulent viscosity prediction accounting for anisotropy and curvature effects through an elliptic relaxation function the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model or introduce a complete non linear stress strain correlation as an explicit reduction of a full reynolds stress closure the cubic low re k ε model while the low re closures with anisotropy consideration have not been explicitly designed to predict transitional flows their improved accuracy in quantifying the local turbulent viscosity has the potential to provide such capability this work aims at assessing and quantifying their performance on transitional flow in view of the lack of previous evaluation 2 1 k ω s s t model as the most commonly adopted turbulence model in the ocean engineering industry k ω s s t model of menter 1994 blends k ε model in the free stream and wilcox s k ω model 1998 near the wall claiming use of the k ω model s better performance and natural treatment for near wall boundary layers while overcoming its drawback of strong sensitivity to inlet turbulence conditions wilcox 1993 however both its hybrid approach and the application experience of the ω equation would indicate that the k ω s s t model is not expected to capture complex transitional flow in this work the results from the k ω s s t model are provided for completeness this model is only briefly described here as numerous applications have adopted it in the past the modeled turbulent viscosity ν t is calculated as the product of turbulent kinetic energy and a time scale t 4 ν t k t t min 1 ω 0 31 s f 2 f 2 tanh m a x 2 k β ω y 500 ν y 2 ω 2 where s is the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor and y is the distance to the nearest wall transport equations for k and ω are expressed as 5 d k d t x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k β ω k 6 d ω d t x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j p ω β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where the expression for the production terms p k and p ω the value of the blending function f1 and constant values can be found in menter 1994 and menter 1993 2 2 transition γ re θ model the γ re θ transition model proposed by langtry 2006 and applied by menter et al 2006 solves two additional transport equations for the intermittency γ and the transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t coupled with the sst k ω model this model does not attempt to model the physics of the transition process instead it relies on calibration from experimental data and transitional methods and incorporates it into the formulation both the transition onset and length are therefore assembled as experimental correlations while sharing the same ν t expression and ω equation as the k ω s s t model the γ re θ model incorporates an additional source term p k lim and intermittency γ in the original production term of the k equation 7 d k d t x j ν σ k ν t k x j γ p k p k lim γ β ω k 8 γ min max γ 0 1 1 9 p k lim 5 max γ 0 2 0 1 γ f o n lim max 3 v v t 0 s w 10 f o n lim min max re v 2 2 1100 1 0 3 where s and w are the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor and rotation rate tensor respectively the corresponding modification is also included in the blending function f1 in the k ω s s t model the intermittency γ is defined as the fraction of time when the flow is turbulent in the transition region its value grows from 0 to 1 mimicking the transition onset evolution and up to the fully turbulent state its transport equation is 11 d γ d t p γ e γ x j ν ν t σ f γ x j p γ and e γ are the production and destruction terms given by 12 p γ f l e n g t h c a 1 s γ f o n s e t 1 c e 1 γ 13 e γ c a 2 w γ f t u r b c e 2 γ 1 f t u r b e k 4 ν ω 4 where c a 1 c a 2 c e 1 and c e 2 are constants the f o n s e t function controls the transition onset by comparing the vorticity reynolds number re v and a threshold value r e θ c the f l e n g t h function determines transition length from onset to fully turbulent region the correlations for r e θ c and f l e n g t h are suggested by suluksna et al 2009 and are functions of transition momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t the transport equation for transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t expresses the propagation of free stream re θ t into the boundary layer and is given by 14 d re θ t d t p θ t x j σ θ t ν ν t re θ t x j where p θ t is the source term containing the empirical correlation for the local value of re θ t formulated as a function of freestream turbulence intensity and the pressure gradient langtry 2006 15 p θ t c θ t 1 t re θ t re θ t 1 f θ t where t is a timescale from dimensional considerations c θ t is a constant and f θ t is a blending function to suppress p θ t inside the boundary layer further details can be referred to langtry 2006 and menter et al 2006 2 3 elliptic blending k ε model the concept of elliptic relaxation was proposed by durbin 1993 for reynolds stress models the elliptic blending k ε model represents an evolution focused toward robust applicability of the v 2 f model and was proposed by billard and laurence 2012 the model leverages the elliptic relaxation concept of durbin 1993 which aims at adapting the full reynolds stress transport model to the near wall behavior without using empirical damping functions simplifying the approach into the eddy viscosity framework and retaining the variance of velocity fluctuation normal to the wall v 2 and its source a non local wall pressure blocking term f results in the k ε v 2 f model of durbin 1991 this model retains a linear eddy viscosity assumption while incorporating the anisotropy and non local pressure strain effects near the wall in addition it does not require wall distance or empirical damping functions making it a universal fit for different kinds of complex near wall flows however most of the v 2 f variants have evidenced numerical issues often resulting in degraded solutions the elliptic blending k ε model replaces v 2 and f by dimensionless variables ν 2 k and α to represent near wall turbulence damping for better control of the boundary condition and improvement of robustness a slight adjustment was also made to the standard k and ε equations according to launder and spalding 1974 and yang et al 1994 velocity fluctuations perpendicular to the wall play an important role in the transition process which motivates the idea of using v 2 f model or the improved elliptic blending k ε model for transitional flow prediction some work has been done on testing the v 2 f model on transitional flow mainly in the turbomachinery industry for example ibrahim et al 2008 implemented v 2 f in predicting transition on a turbine airfoil and pecnik and heitmeir 2007 tested the performance of the v 2 f model on a rotor blade with the conclusion that v 2 f performs well for bypass transition but evidences problems in capturing separation induced transition until present little work has been done on testing the performance of the newly proposed elliptic blending k ε model on transitional flow therefore it is valuable to assess how the improved formulation can advance from the original v 2 f model the transport equations for k ε φ ν 2 k and α in the elliptic blending k ε model are 16 ν t c μ φ k min t t lim 17 d k d t p k p b ε x j ν 2 ν t σ

model the lag elliptic blending model was recently proposed by lardeau and billard in 2016 it combines the elliptic blending concept with the stress strain lag concept originally proposed by revell et al 2006 in flow regions where non equilibrium effects result in a misalignment of the principal components of the stress and strain rate tensors linear eddy viscosity models tend to over predict the production of k to overcome this effect the lag elliptic blending model incorporates the angle between these components additional terms model the effects of anisotropy curvature and rotation the correction provides an improvement in the prediction of separated and unsteady flows the model is derived based on the elliptic blending rsm of manceau and hanjalić 2002 which is a simplification of durbin rsm model 1993 the final formulation of the lag elliptic blending model is found to closely resemble that of the elliptic blending k ε model of billard and laurence 2012 the expressions for the transport equations are the same as 16 20 with φ representing the additional lag effect on the eddy viscosity the main differences lie in the expressions of f w and f h for the φ equation with additional higher order terms a reformulated c ε 2 term and model constants of σ ε and c ε 2 24 f w c w φ ε k f h c 1 c ε 2 2 c 1 p k p b ε φ t c p 2 φ s c p 3 1 t 1 η s m i j s i j 25 c ε 2 c ε 2 1 α

viscosity model combination cubic low re k ε model a typical low re turbulence model modifies the original turbulence transport equations k and ε equations for example to extend their applicability to the resolution of the viscous and buffer layer near the wall the modification introduces damping functions derived from modeling arguments or calibrated on dns and experimental data for simulating transition the high wall y approach based on a fully turbulent profile is inapplicable and a low re model are clearly necessary in this work lien et al s low re k ε model lien et al 1996 is selected in order to improve its performance for capturing the transitional effects the nlevm of baglietto and ninokata 2006 2007 with cubic formulation is also selected in combination as it includes the representation of flow anisotropy curvature and rotation that may appear in the transitional process the non linear formulation is also fundamental to accurately represent the stagnation region at the leading edge the foundation of all nlevms is the non linear constitutive equation linking the reynolds stress tensor to all quadratic and cubic combinations of the strain and rotation tensors as shown

attack at reynolds number of 30 000 the two cases correspond to separation induced transition and natural transition respectively according to the wind tunnel experiments performed in the nasa langley low turbulence pressure tunnel ltpt mcghee et al 1988 and in the university of illinois at urbana champaign uiuc low turbulence subsonic wind tunnel selig and mcgranahan 2004 the 2d computational domain is shown in fig 4 with a c type grid around the hydrofoil of unit chord length c in order to eliminate the far field effects from the boundaries the large domain adopted includes 100 chord lengths upstream the hydrofoil and towards the sides and 150 chords downstream the front and sides of the domain are set as a constant velocity of 0 405 m s corresponding to a reynolds number of 30 000 with sea water properties and unit chord length the pressure is extrapolated from inside the domain the downstream boundary is set as a pressure outlet with pressure specified and velocity extrapolated a no slip wall boundary is prescribed on the hydrofoil surface the inlet turbulence intensity is chosen as 0 001 corresponding to the average turbulence level in the series of ltpt experiments all simulations in this study are steady rans simulations performed using the commercial finite volume code star ccm version 11 04 all the turbulence models are available in the standard version of the solver except for the cubic low re k ε model whose model coefficients in equations 27 and 28 are manually modified after activation of cubic constitutive relation in the standard k ε model a segregated simple solver is adopted for a collocated variable arrangement with rhie chow interpolation advective terms for the momentum equation and turbulence equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme with venkatakrishnan limiting further details of the numerical schemes can be referred to the user guide 4 separation induced transition 4 1 grid convergence analysis separation induced transition predictions are evaluated against the eppler 387 at 2deg aoa a systematic grid convergence analysis is conducted on a series of structured c topology grids with all mesh controlling parameters consistently refined for example grid 3 is shown in fig 5 the foil surface is discretized by 400 nodes and the whole 2d computational domain contains 387 600 cells wall y values of all the grids are kept less than 1 for capturing the transition phenomenon the inlet turbulence intensity is set as 0 1 to be consistent with ltpt and uiuc experiments comparison of the drag coefficient cd among all grids and for different turbulence models is summarized in table 1 and shown in fig 6 the k ω s s t model shows consistent convergence except for the coarsest grid the γ re θ transition model shows quick convergence with no cd change when normalized grid spacing is less than 4 deriving from its correlation based approach all other turbulence models manifest a lack of asymptotic convergence overall as the grid spacing decreases cd first decreases and then increases as normalized grid spacing reaches 2 the lack of asymptotic convergence can be explained looking into the details of the representation of the physics at the transition location grid sensitivity for the skin friction coefficient distribution cf on the back of the hydrofoil using the elliptic blending k ε model is shown in fig 7 cf values in grids 6 7 8 are all positive representing no separation bubble while the finer grids capture the separation bubble the physical understanding of the cf distribution is further analyzed in the next section in table 1 the cases capturing the separation bubble are marked by underlined cd values and the convergence trends are consistent with simulated physics as the separation bubble is rather small in comparison to the dimensions of the hydrofoil only very fine resolutions of the mesh are capable of capturing this feature 4 2 results analysis the predictions of the different turbulence models are compared on the finest computational mesh grid 1 in this section the pressure coefficient distribution cp over the hydrofoil surface is plotted in fig 8 all turbulence closures chosen with the exception of the k ω s s t model successfully capture a pressure bump on the back surface of the hydrofoil confirming the existence of a separation bubble the starting location and the magnitude of the pressure bump are in good agreement with the experiment for all models while some difference exists in the location of the turbulent reattachment among the turbulence closures outside the separation region all turbulence closures perform equally well with no evident difference when compared to the experimental values the skin friction coefficient distribution cf on the back surface of the hydrofoil better illustrates the details of the separation induced transition as shown in fig 9 the separation bubble corresponds to the negative cf region with a reverse flow on the foil surface the laminar separation and reattachment locations at cf 0 predicted by different turbulence models are summarized in table 2 together with ltpt and uiuc experimental results according to the uiuc experiment documentation selig and mcgranahan 2004 the most visible plume of an oil accumulation line representing the front edge of the negative cf spike had been mislabeled as reattachment by the ltpt experiment the uiuc data are therefore taken as a reference here for the reattachment both laminar separation and reattachment locations are well predicted by the four turbulence closures among which the cubic low re k ε model shows the best agreement with uiuc data downstream of the laminar separation point cf magnitude is quite small due to low flow speed ahead of reattachment there exists a negative cf spike indicating large reverse flow also shown clearly in fig 10 although the four turbulence closures excluding the k ω s s t mode capture the main flow features of separation induced transition their cf values differ especially after reattachment resulting in their cd discrepancy the k ω s s t model shows no separation at all and the flow remains attached and most turbulent on the back of the foil this is due to overly turbulence generation far ahead of the separation bubble around 0 15 chord length as shown in fig 11 which is a common problem for many classical turbulence models as mentioned earlier in part 2 also noticeable in fig 11 is the consistently higher turbulent viscosity predictions downstream of the hydrofoil for the lag elliptic blending and the cubic low re k ε models which include sensitivity to both flow curvature and swirling while no measurement exists for this region the higher levels are an expected consequence of the unsteady structures generated downstream of the separation velocity vectors along the foil back surface are shown in fig 10 clearly visualizing the flow features the k ω s s t model displays no separation bubble while all other turbulence closures show the development from laminar velocity profile separation onset with a slight reverse flow a large recirculation zone reattachment and finally transition to fully turbulent velocity profile overall the γ re θ transition model the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model and the cubic low re k ε model all successfully capture the separation bubble phenomenon with similar bubble location while the k ω s s t model is unable to predict separation induced transition which is in alignment with our expectation 4 3 force predictions for cd cl and cm table 3 shows the comparison of the hydrodynamic quantities including drag coefficient cd lift coefficient cl and the pitching moment coefficient about quarter chord point cm using different turbulence closures in addition to the ltpt experimental results the extrapolated values and numerical uncertainties are obtained through gci analysis of grids 1 2 3 celik et al 2008 for cl and cm all turbulence closures agree well with the experiment while a large variation exists for the cd prediction as expected the k ω s s t model gives the largest comparison error with 32 cd over prediction the other turbulence closures show reasonable values within 10 error among which the lag elliptic blending model shows the best accordance with ltpt experiment 5 natural transition 5 1 grid convergence analysis a systematic grid convergence analysis for predicting natural transition is conducted on a series of grids the results are plotted in fig 13 and summarized in table 4 with the extrapolated value and numerical uncertainty coming from gci analysis of grids 1 2 3 grid 1 and grid 5 are shown in fig 12 with 566 and 142 nodes on the foil surface respectively the k ω s s t model the γ re θ model and the lag elliptic blending model show consistent convergence while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model take on the trend of first decreasing and then increasing cd with grid refinement to better understand this trend fig 14 shows the extremely refined grid results where a spurious separation bubble appears resulting in the cd increasing trend correspondingly in table 4 the cases including the spurious separation bubble are marked by underlined cd values it should be noted that even though the γ re θ transition model has consistent convergence it generates a spurious separation bubble on the foil back at all grid resolution 5 2 results analysis local comparison of the cp distribution over the hydrofoil surface among different turbulence closures is shown in fig 15 results are presented for both the finest grid 1 and further for the medium grid 5 where the spurious bubble separation is not yet evidenced allowing to evaluate the models trends separately from their near wall damping limitations for natural transition since the flow remains attached on the foil surface the cp distribution is relatively smooth with no bubble generated bump typical of separation induced transition however the simulations with the γ re θ transition model still predict a small bump on the foil back on the medium grid refinement levels the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model provide a good prediction of the cp distribution with a very close agreement with the experiment however at the extreme refinement levels with very low y values near the wall the models exhibit a spurious bump on the foil back the spurious separation appears only for extremely low y values and point at limitations in the damping approaches typical low re model guidelines suggest the use of y values between 0 1 and 0 5 and the spurious separation appears below values of 0 1 in the current work some initial efforts have been made to recalibrate the wall damping functions but have been unsuccessful further efforts should be devoted to more consistent damping in order to extend the models applicability noticeably the lag elliptic blending model and the k ω s s t model perform well for predicting cp at different grid refinement levels fig 16 presents the skin friction coefficient distributions cf over the hydrofoil back surface the small cp bump is confirmed to be a small separation bubble showing characteristics of a negative cf region and a negative cf spike while the k ω s s t model generates very early turbulence at the foil leading edge the lag elliptic blending model is able to predict the natural transition at all grid levels while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model can correctly predict such transition up to the medium grid 5 resolution the grid converged transition location for the lag elliptic blending model is shown at around 0 4 chord length consistently with the 0 4c in both ltpt and uiuc experiments velocity vector plots are shown in fig 17 to confirm the discussed trends in the simulation with the k ω s s t model the flow has become fully turbulent the γ re θ model results show the transition from a laminar velocity profile to a slight reverse flow to a fully turbulent velocity profile only the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model at medium grid refinement levels and the lag elliptic blending model at all grid levels predict the correct physics with the development from a laminar velocity profile to a fully turbulent profile 5 3 force predictions of cd cl and cm a comparison of the force coefficients calculated using grid 1 and grid 5 with different turbulence closures for simulating natural transition is listed in tables 5 and 6 lift and angular momentum coefficients cl cm are well predicted by all models with a maximum error of 7 from the ltpt experiment the k ω s s t model displays a very large cd error of 42 resulting from the very early generation of turbulence and thus incorrect cf distribution the γ re θ model and the lag elliptic blending model have the smaller cd error of 2 on the fully resolved grid 1 while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model have the smaller cd error of 9 when using grid 5 in summary the lag elliptic blending model allows demonstrating the postulated ability of anisotropic low re rans closure to predict natural transition the model demonstrates excellent performance reproducing the correct physical behavior with robust grid convergence and close comparison with experimental data the γ re θ model has consistent grid convergence good force coefficient agreement with experiment but always predicts a spurious bubble on the foil back at all grid levels the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model have similar behavior they demonstrate the potential to reproduce the correct natural transition phenomenon up to medium grid refinements but suffer from grid induced separation at the finest grid levels the problem may be addressed in the future by re evaluating a more consistent wall treatment applicable at extremely low y values the k ω s s t model owing to the simple eddy viscosity assumption evidences large deviation from the experiment on both the force coefficient values and local physics 6 conclusions the present study was aimed at assessing the applicability of several promising rans closures for simulating both separation induced transition and natural transition occurring on the back of a typical hydrofoil eppler 387 central attention was devoted to the ability of the models to capture the correct transitional flow physics in addition to the quantitative results systematic grid convergence studies were carried out and evidenced challenges at extremely fine grid resolutions for predicting natural transition the calculated force coefficients have been compared to published experimental measurements and the main conclusions are summarized as follows the γ re θ transition model the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model and the low re k ε model with cubic anisotropy consideration are all able to predict separation induced transition when applied with sufficient grid resolution all the four models have the ability to capture the position of laminar separation and turbulent reattachment with good agreement with published experimental data where the computed force coefficients also deliver satisfactory accuracy the k ω s s t model fails to capture both separation induced transition and natural transition looking at the performance for both tested conditions the key shortcoming of the model appears to be the early turbulence generation at the leading edge where the model does not correctly cope with stagnation effects the findings are not completely unexpected as the model bases its adaptation of turbulence generation in complex strains on the use of limiters rather than a representation of the correct stress strain behavior due to the evidenced shortcomings the model does not appear suitable for simulating transitional flow not surprisingly predicting natural transition is considerably more challenging than predicting separation induced transition the elliptic blending k ε model and the low re k ε model with cubic anisotropy consideration suffer from inconsistent grid convergence originating from deviation from the correct physics with extreme grid refinement while they have shown the potential of predicting both the correct natural transition phenomenon and an adequate accuracy of force coefficients at medium grid refinement levels when reaching extremely fine grid resolutions a spurious bubble is generated on the foil back side careful consideration of the meshing strategy could allow the engineering adoption of the models to simulate natural transition adopting average wall y larger than 0 2 however further research is required to improve the wall damping formulations and generalize their applicability the lag elliptic blending model has demonstrated robust applicability to predict both separation induced and natural transition with consistent grid convergence accurate prediction of force coefficients and consistent reproduction of the transition physics the model results demonstrate the postulated feasibility of using low re closures with anisotropy consideration for simulating natural transition without the use of empirical information as a correlation based and most widely used model for simulating transition the γ re θ transition model shows its advantage of robustness with quick and consistent convergence to a limited level of accuracy in force predictions however the approach cannot capture the natural transition physical phenomenon a small bubble always appears on the back of the foil which does not severely affect the predictions of force values in natural transition acknowledgments this work has been partially funded by the office of naval research grant n00014 17 1 2334 
23169,growing interest in marine autonomous systems such as underwater gliders and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs has led to the increase of research on hydrofoil performance at low reynolds numbers bringing forward the issue of simulating laminar to turbulent transition using computational fluid dynamics cfd most conventional turbulence closures in practical reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations are incapable of predicting transition with excessive turbulence generation near the leading edge deriving from their eddy viscosity assumption having the potential of inherently predicting transition by solving the near wall flow accurately three low re rans closures with anisotropy consideration are selected and evaluated for their ability to capture both separation induced transition and natural transition the empirical γ re θ transition model is also assessed in this work comparison with published experiments shows the capability of the four turbulence closures to capture separation induced transition accurately predicting natural transition remains more challenging two low re closures exhibit the potential to capture natural transition only at medium grid finesse levels whereas the γ re θ model evidences challenges in reproducing the correct flow physics the lag elliptic blending model provides the most accurate solution owing to its consistent grid convergence high accuracy for predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients and ability to reproduce the correct transition physics keywords flow around hydrofoils separation induced transition natural transition turbulence model separation bubble 1 introduction research on hydrofoil performance at low reynolds numbers has seen renewed attention due to the growing interest in marine autonomous systems including underwater gliders lemaire et al 2016 autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and micro unmanned surface vessels usvs for monitoring the marine environment and supporting maritime security mainly working in the low reynolds number range their propelling hydrofoils can suffer from laminar to turbulent transition which poses a great challenge for accurate cfd simulation other applications with transition issues include marine current turbines offshore wind turbines ship rudders stabilizers and propellers transition depending on its occurring mechanism is commonly divided into three different modes mayle 1991 natural transition is caused by inherent instabilities in the laminar boundary layer which becomes unstable beyond a critical reynolds number while the freestream turbulence is very low 1 bypass transition is caused by the convection and diffusion from high level free stream turbulence into the boundary layer and other external disturbances such as wakes vortices and surface defects separation induced transition happens when a laminar boundary layer separates due to a strong adverse pressure gradient and the separated flow undergoes transition as a result of inviscid instability mechanism the separated layer may reattach and form a separation bubble on the surface for hydrofoil flows typically natural transition or separation induced transition may occur depending on the foil shape reynolds number and angle of attack while bypass transition is mostly encountered in turbomachinery applications the process of boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulence is a basic scientific problem of fluid dynamics and one that has been extensively examined both theoretically and experimentally theoretical methods based on stability theory trace back to 1950s when the e n method was proposed for predicting transition onset by smith 1956 and ingen and van 1956 stability of a laminar boundary layer has been analyzed through the linearized orr sommerfeld equations and disturbance growth is integrated from the boundary layer neutral point to the transition location the main obstacle for the stability theory based methods is the requirement of streamline information which demands the coupling to a cfd solution on the other hand new experimental data for transitional boundary layers have enabled the development of several correlation based transition models abu ghannam and shaw 1980 mayle 1991 kohama and davis 1993 etc for predicting transition onset and dey 1990 cho and chung s 1992 steelant and dick 1994 for predicting transition length typically the correlation models again require a combination to a cfd solution in order to capture the interaction between laminar and turbulent regimes pasquale et al 2009 in recent years with the advancement of supercomputers high fidelity dns and les computations have also become possible for uncovering transition physics and mechanisms for example les of a plane channel flow by schlatter 2005 clearly showed various stages of natural transition ranging from tollmien schlichting streamwise instability waves spanwise vorticity 3d breakdown turbulent spots to fully turbulent flow fig 1 dns study by jacobs and durbina 2001 visualized the formation of streaks spots and transition to turbulence phenomenon in bypass transition however presently the computational cost for dns and les studies is still too high for routine use in industrial applications which propels the need for practical rans based cfd simulations with proper transition models the applicability of conventional rans closures to the transition process is certainly questionable especially for natural transition where the linear disturbance growth effect is not directly reproducible with rans averaging rodi 2007 bypass and separation induced transition are expected and have shown to be reproducible with some versions of low reynolds number rans closures since their triggering mechanisms diffusion from freestream turbulence and laminar separation respectively are amenable to rans modeling while the averaged nature of the rans equations cannot describe the disturbance growth and the evolution of the natural transition process hence the transition length we suggest that low re rans closures have the ability to distinguish the laminar and turbulent regions if the correct level of eddy viscosity is generated therefore accurate rans models could have the potential of capturing the transition onset with a point transition to turbulence for a hydrofoil natural transition progresses rapidly with a relatively short transition length as shown in fig 2 making the point transition assumption reasonable for engineering applications based on these observations we postulate that accurate low re rans closures may retain the ability to predict both natural and separation induced transition on hydrofoils rather than attempting to predict transition inherently using a low re rans closure a more popular approach has been to make use of empirical information to develop specialized transition models this approach also presents a number of challenges the e n method is not compatible with general purpose cfd codes since it requires prior knowledge of geometry and grid topology on the other hand most empirical correlations involve non local operations precluding their implementation into general purpose cfd codes to deal with this limitation langtry 2006 and menter et al 2006 proposed the γ re θ transition model with fully local formulations which currently is one of the most widely adopted transition models in industrial cfd applications the model leverages empirically optimized correlations to try to predict all three transition modes and has been applied to several applications having been calibrated against a specific set of experimental data this model does not guarantee broad applicability and still requires extensive validation studies for assessing its application limits and suitability the aim of the present work is to assess the applicability of several rans turbulence closures for predicting both natural and separation induced transition on hydrofoil eppler 387 for which experimental data are available in the literature in addition to the empirical γ re θ transition model three low re closures are selected for their ability to include near wall anisotropy effects the elliptic blending k ε model of billard and laurence s 2012 and the lag elliptic blending model of lardeau and billard 2016 leverage the elliptic blending approach to account for the near wall stress anisotropy while lien s low re model lien et al 1996 combined with the nlevm of baglietto and ninokata 2006 2007 adopts a cubic stress strain correlation therefore including also the effects of curvature and rotation results for the k ω s s t model of menter 1994 are also presented as they provide a reference solution of a broadly adopted eddy viscosity model 2 rans turbulence closures assuming incompressible newtonian fluid the reynolds averaged equations for mass and momentum conservation are commonly expressed as 1 u j x j 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j u i u j x j where ρ is the fluid density ν the kinematic viscosity and the reynolds stress term u i u j requires closure according to the boussinesq hypothesis the reynolds stress can be linked to the mean rate of strain s i j through the eddy viscosity ν t 3 u i u j 2 3 k δ i j 2 ν t s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and δ i j is kronecker symbol different eddy viscosity models provide different methods for deriving the turbulent viscosity ν t mostly by solving transport equations for scalar quantities such as k and ε in the popular standard k ε turbulence model of jones and launder 1972 or k and ω in the k ω s s t model of menter 1994 in all cases the oversimplified assumption of a scalar relationship between stress and strain explains most of the limitations of the models in dealing with complex flow simulation that include strong anisotropy curvature and rotation effects the eddy viscosity approach leads to over prediction of the turbulent viscosity in all complex strain conditions including curvature and stagnation regions which explains their limited applicability to hydrofoil simulations the turbulence closures selected in this work attempt to either directly correct the turbulent viscosity prediction accounting for anisotropy and curvature effects through an elliptic relaxation function the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model or introduce a complete non linear stress strain correlation as an explicit reduction of a full reynolds stress closure the cubic low re k ε model while the low re closures with anisotropy consideration have not been explicitly designed to predict transitional flows their improved accuracy in quantifying the local turbulent viscosity has the potential to provide such capability this work aims at assessing and quantifying their performance on transitional flow in view of the lack of previous evaluation 2 1 k ω s s t model as the most commonly adopted turbulence model in the ocean engineering industry k ω s s t model of menter 1994 blends k ε model in the free stream and wilcox s k ω model 1998 near the wall claiming use of the k ω model s better performance and natural treatment for near wall boundary layers while overcoming its drawback of strong sensitivity to inlet turbulence conditions wilcox 1993 however both its hybrid approach and the application experience of the ω equation would indicate that the k ω s s t model is not expected to capture complex transitional flow in this work the results from the k ω s s t model are provided for completeness this model is only briefly described here as numerous applications have adopted it in the past the modeled turbulent viscosity ν t is calculated as the product of turbulent kinetic energy and a time scale t 4 ν t k t t min 1 ω 0 31 s f 2 f 2 tanh m a x 2 k β ω y 500 ν y 2 ω 2 where s is the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor and y is the distance to the nearest wall transport equations for k and ω are expressed as 5 d k d t x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k β ω k 6 d ω d t x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j p ω β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j where the expression for the production terms p k and p ω the value of the blending function f1 and constant values can be found in menter 1994 and menter 1993 2 2 transition γ re θ model the γ re θ transition model proposed by langtry 2006 and applied by menter et al 2006 solves two additional transport equations for the intermittency γ and the transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t coupled with the sst k ω model this model does not attempt to model the physics of the transition process instead it relies on calibration from experimental data and transitional methods and incorporates it into the formulation both the transition onset and length are therefore assembled as experimental correlations while sharing the same ν t expression and ω equation as the k ω s s t model the γ re θ model incorporates an additional source term p k lim and intermittency γ in the original production term of the k equation 7 d k d t x j ν σ k ν t k x j γ p k p k lim γ β ω k 8 γ min max γ 0 1 1 9 p k lim 5 max γ 0 2 0 1 γ f o n lim max 3 v v t 0 s w 10 f o n lim min max re v 2 2 1100 1 0 3 where s and w are the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor and rotation rate tensor respectively the corresponding modification is also included in the blending function f1 in the k ω s s t model the intermittency γ is defined as the fraction of time when the flow is turbulent in the transition region its value grows from 0 to 1 mimicking the transition onset evolution and up to the fully turbulent state its transport equation is 11 d γ d t p γ e γ x j ν ν t σ f γ x j p γ and e γ are the production and destruction terms given by 12 p γ f l e n g t h c a 1 s γ f o n s e t 1 c e 1 γ 13 e γ c a 2 w γ f t u r b c e 2 γ 1 f t u r b e k 4 ν ω 4 where c a 1 c a 2 c e 1 and c e 2 are constants the f o n s e t function controls the transition onset by comparing the vorticity reynolds number re v and a threshold value r e θ c the f l e n g t h function determines transition length from onset to fully turbulent region the correlations for r e θ c and f l e n g t h are suggested by suluksna et al 2009 and are functions of transition momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t the transport equation for transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number re θ t expresses the propagation of free stream re θ t into the boundary layer and is given by 14 d re θ t d t p θ t x j σ θ t ν ν t re θ t x j where p θ t is the source term containing the empirical correlation for the local value of re θ t formulated as a function of freestream turbulence intensity and the pressure gradient langtry 2006 15 p θ t c θ t 1 t re θ t re θ t 1 f θ t where t is a timescale from dimensional considerations c θ t is a constant and f θ t is a blending function to suppress p θ t inside the boundary layer further details can be referred to langtry 2006 and menter et al 2006 2 3 elliptic blending k ε model the concept of elliptic relaxation was proposed by durbin 1993 for reynolds stress models the elliptic blending k ε model represents an evolution focused toward robust applicability of the v 2 f model and was proposed by billard and laurence 2012 the model leverages the elliptic relaxation concept of durbin 1993 which aims at adapting the full reynolds stress transport model to the near wall behavior without using empirical damping functions simplifying the approach into the eddy viscosity framework and retaining the variance of velocity fluctuation normal to the wall v 2 and its source a non local wall pressure blocking term f results in the k ε v 2 f model of durbin 1991 this model retains a linear eddy viscosity assumption while incorporating the anisotropy and non local pressure strain effects near the wall in addition it does not require wall distance or empirical damping functions making it a universal fit for different kinds of complex near wall flows however most of the v 2 f variants have evidenced numerical issues often resulting in degraded solutions the elliptic blending k ε model replaces v 2 and f by dimensionless variables ν 2 k and α to represent near wall turbulence damping for better control of the boundary condition and improvement of robustness a slight adjustment was also made to the standard k and ε equations according to launder and spalding 1974 and yang et al 1994 velocity fluctuations perpendicular to the wall play an important role in the transition process which motivates the idea of using v 2 f model or the improved elliptic blending k ε model for transitional flow prediction some work has been done on testing the v 2 f model on transitional flow mainly in the turbomachinery industry for example ibrahim et al 2008 implemented v 2 f in predicting transition on a turbine airfoil and pecnik and heitmeir 2007 tested the performance of the v 2 f model on a rotor blade with the conclusion that v 2 f performs well for bypass transition but evidences problems in capturing separation induced transition until present little work has been done on testing the performance of the newly proposed elliptic blending k ε model on transitional flow therefore it is valuable to assess how the improved formulation can advance from the original v 2 f model the transport equations for k ε φ ν 2 k and α in the elliptic blending k ε model are 16 ν t c μ φ k min t t lim 17 d k d t p k p b ε x j ν 2 ν t σ

model the lag elliptic blending model was recently proposed by lardeau and billard in 2016 it combines the elliptic blending concept with the stress strain lag concept originally proposed by revell et al 2006 in flow regions where non equilibrium effects result in a misalignment of the principal components of the stress and strain rate tensors linear eddy viscosity models tend to over predict the production of k to overcome this effect the lag elliptic blending model incorporates the angle between these components additional terms model the effects of anisotropy curvature and rotation the correction provides an improvement in the prediction of separated and unsteady flows the model is derived based on the elliptic blending rsm of manceau and hanjalić 2002 which is a simplification of durbin rsm model 1993 the final formulation of the lag elliptic blending model is found to closely resemble that of the elliptic blending k ε model of billard and laurence 2012 the expressions for the transport equations are the same as 16 20 with φ representing the additional lag effect on the eddy viscosity the main differences lie in the expressions of f w and f h for the φ equation with additional higher order terms a reformulated c ε 2 term and model constants of σ ε and c ε 2 24 f w c w φ ε k f h c 1 c ε 2 2 c 1 p k p b ε φ t c p 2 φ s c p 3 1 t 1 η s m i j s i j 25 c ε 2 c ε 2 1 α

viscosity model combination cubic low re k ε model a typical low re turbulence model modifies the original turbulence transport equations k and ε equations for example to extend their applicability to the resolution of the viscous and buffer layer near the wall the modification introduces damping functions derived from modeling arguments or calibrated on dns and experimental data for simulating transition the high wall y approach based on a fully turbulent profile is inapplicable and a low re model are clearly necessary in this work lien et al s low re k ε model lien et al 1996 is selected in order to improve its performance for capturing the transitional effects the nlevm of baglietto and ninokata 2006 2007 with cubic formulation is also selected in combination as it includes the representation of flow anisotropy curvature and rotation that may appear in the transitional process the non linear formulation is also fundamental to accurately represent the stagnation region at the leading edge the foundation of all nlevms is the non linear constitutive equation linking the reynolds stress tensor to all quadratic and cubic combinations of the strain and rotation tensors as shown

attack at reynolds number of 30 000 the two cases correspond to separation induced transition and natural transition respectively according to the wind tunnel experiments performed in the nasa langley low turbulence pressure tunnel ltpt mcghee et al 1988 and in the university of illinois at urbana champaign uiuc low turbulence subsonic wind tunnel selig and mcgranahan 2004 the 2d computational domain is shown in fig 4 with a c type grid around the hydrofoil of unit chord length c in order to eliminate the far field effects from the boundaries the large domain adopted includes 100 chord lengths upstream the hydrofoil and towards the sides and 150 chords downstream the front and sides of the domain are set as a constant velocity of 0 405 m s corresponding to a reynolds number of 30 000 with sea water properties and unit chord length the pressure is extrapolated from inside the domain the downstream boundary is set as a pressure outlet with pressure specified and velocity extrapolated a no slip wall boundary is prescribed on the hydrofoil surface the inlet turbulence intensity is chosen as 0 001 corresponding to the average turbulence level in the series of ltpt experiments all simulations in this study are steady rans simulations performed using the commercial finite volume code star ccm version 11 04 all the turbulence models are available in the standard version of the solver except for the cubic low re k ε model whose model coefficients in equations 27 and 28 are manually modified after activation of cubic constitutive relation in the standard k ε model a segregated simple solver is adopted for a collocated variable arrangement with rhie chow interpolation advective terms for the momentum equation and turbulence equations are discretized by a second order upwind scheme with venkatakrishnan limiting further details of the numerical schemes can be referred to the user guide 4 separation induced transition 4 1 grid convergence analysis separation induced transition predictions are evaluated against the eppler 387 at 2deg aoa a systematic grid convergence analysis is conducted on a series of structured c topology grids with all mesh controlling parameters consistently refined for example grid 3 is shown in fig 5 the foil surface is discretized by 400 nodes and the whole 2d computational domain contains 387 600 cells wall y values of all the grids are kept less than 1 for capturing the transition phenomenon the inlet turbulence intensity is set as 0 1 to be consistent with ltpt and uiuc experiments comparison of the drag coefficient cd among all grids and for different turbulence models is summarized in table 1 and shown in fig 6 the k ω s s t model shows consistent convergence except for the coarsest grid the γ re θ transition model shows quick convergence with no cd change when normalized grid spacing is less than 4 deriving from its correlation based approach all other turbulence models manifest a lack of asymptotic convergence overall as the grid spacing decreases cd first decreases and then increases as normalized grid spacing reaches 2 the lack of asymptotic convergence can be explained looking into the details of the representation of the physics at the transition location grid sensitivity for the skin friction coefficient distribution cf on the back of the hydrofoil using the elliptic blending k ε model is shown in fig 7 cf values in grids 6 7 8 are all positive representing no separation bubble while the finer grids capture the separation bubble the physical understanding of the cf distribution is further analyzed in the next section in table 1 the cases capturing the separation bubble are marked by underlined cd values and the convergence trends are consistent with simulated physics as the separation bubble is rather small in comparison to the dimensions of the hydrofoil only very fine resolutions of the mesh are capable of capturing this feature 4 2 results analysis the predictions of the different turbulence models are compared on the finest computational mesh grid 1 in this section the pressure coefficient distribution cp over the hydrofoil surface is plotted in fig 8 all turbulence closures chosen with the exception of the k ω s s t model successfully capture a pressure bump on the back surface of the hydrofoil confirming the existence of a separation bubble the starting location and the magnitude of the pressure bump are in good agreement with the experiment for all models while some difference exists in the location of the turbulent reattachment among the turbulence closures outside the separation region all turbulence closures perform equally well with no evident difference when compared to the experimental values the skin friction coefficient distribution cf on the back surface of the hydrofoil better illustrates the details of the separation induced transition as shown in fig 9 the separation bubble corresponds to the negative cf region with a reverse flow on the foil surface the laminar separation and reattachment locations at cf 0 predicted by different turbulence models are summarized in table 2 together with ltpt and uiuc experimental results according to the uiuc experiment documentation selig and mcgranahan 2004 the most visible plume of an oil accumulation line representing the front edge of the negative cf spike had been mislabeled as reattachment by the ltpt experiment the uiuc data are therefore taken as a reference here for the reattachment both laminar separation and reattachment locations are well predicted by the four turbulence closures among which the cubic low re k ε model shows the best agreement with uiuc data downstream of the laminar separation point cf magnitude is quite small due to low flow speed ahead of reattachment there exists a negative cf spike indicating large reverse flow also shown clearly in fig 10 although the four turbulence closures excluding the k ω s s t mode capture the main flow features of separation induced transition their cf values differ especially after reattachment resulting in their cd discrepancy the k ω s s t model shows no separation at all and the flow remains attached and most turbulent on the back of the foil this is due to overly turbulence generation far ahead of the separation bubble around 0 15 chord length as shown in fig 11 which is a common problem for many classical turbulence models as mentioned earlier in part 2 also noticeable in fig 11 is the consistently higher turbulent viscosity predictions downstream of the hydrofoil for the lag elliptic blending and the cubic low re k ε models which include sensitivity to both flow curvature and swirling while no measurement exists for this region the higher levels are an expected consequence of the unsteady structures generated downstream of the separation velocity vectors along the foil back surface are shown in fig 10 clearly visualizing the flow features the k ω s s t model displays no separation bubble while all other turbulence closures show the development from laminar velocity profile separation onset with a slight reverse flow a large recirculation zone reattachment and finally transition to fully turbulent velocity profile overall the γ re θ transition model the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model and the cubic low re k ε model all successfully capture the separation bubble phenomenon with similar bubble location while the k ω s s t model is unable to predict separation induced transition which is in alignment with our expectation 4 3 force predictions for cd cl and cm table 3 shows the comparison of the hydrodynamic quantities including drag coefficient cd lift coefficient cl and the pitching moment coefficient about quarter chord point cm using different turbulence closures in addition to the ltpt experimental results the extrapolated values and numerical uncertainties are obtained through gci analysis of grids 1 2 3 celik et al 2008 for cl and cm all turbulence closures agree well with the experiment while a large variation exists for the cd prediction as expected the k ω s s t model gives the largest comparison error with 32 cd over prediction the other turbulence closures show reasonable values within 10 error among which the lag elliptic blending model shows the best accordance with ltpt experiment 5 natural transition 5 1 grid convergence analysis a systematic grid convergence analysis for predicting natural transition is conducted on a series of grids the results are plotted in fig 13 and summarized in table 4 with the extrapolated value and numerical uncertainty coming from gci analysis of grids 1 2 3 grid 1 and grid 5 are shown in fig 12 with 566 and 142 nodes on the foil surface respectively the k ω s s t model the γ re θ model and the lag elliptic blending model show consistent convergence while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model take on the trend of first decreasing and then increasing cd with grid refinement to better understand this trend fig 14 shows the extremely refined grid results where a spurious separation bubble appears resulting in the cd increasing trend correspondingly in table 4 the cases including the spurious separation bubble are marked by underlined cd values it should be noted that even though the γ re θ transition model has consistent convergence it generates a spurious separation bubble on the foil back at all grid resolution 5 2 results analysis local comparison of the cp distribution over the hydrofoil surface among different turbulence closures is shown in fig 15 results are presented for both the finest grid 1 and further for the medium grid 5 where the spurious bubble separation is not yet evidenced allowing to evaluate the models trends separately from their near wall damping limitations for natural transition since the flow remains attached on the foil surface the cp distribution is relatively smooth with no bubble generated bump typical of separation induced transition however the simulations with the γ re θ transition model still predict a small bump on the foil back on the medium grid refinement levels the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model provide a good prediction of the cp distribution with a very close agreement with the experiment however at the extreme refinement levels with very low y values near the wall the models exhibit a spurious bump on the foil back the spurious separation appears only for extremely low y values and point at limitations in the damping approaches typical low re model guidelines suggest the use of y values between 0 1 and 0 5 and the spurious separation appears below values of 0 1 in the current work some initial efforts have been made to recalibrate the wall damping functions but have been unsuccessful further efforts should be devoted to more consistent damping in order to extend the models applicability noticeably the lag elliptic blending model and the k ω s s t model perform well for predicting cp at different grid refinement levels fig 16 presents the skin friction coefficient distributions cf over the hydrofoil back surface the small cp bump is confirmed to be a small separation bubble showing characteristics of a negative cf region and a negative cf spike while the k ω s s t model generates very early turbulence at the foil leading edge the lag elliptic blending model is able to predict the natural transition at all grid levels while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model can correctly predict such transition up to the medium grid 5 resolution the grid converged transition location for the lag elliptic blending model is shown at around 0 4 chord length consistently with the 0 4c in both ltpt and uiuc experiments velocity vector plots are shown in fig 17 to confirm the discussed trends in the simulation with the k ω s s t model the flow has become fully turbulent the γ re θ model results show the transition from a laminar velocity profile to a slight reverse flow to a fully turbulent velocity profile only the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model at medium grid refinement levels and the lag elliptic blending model at all grid levels predict the correct physics with the development from a laminar velocity profile to a fully turbulent profile 5 3 force predictions of cd cl and cm a comparison of the force coefficients calculated using grid 1 and grid 5 with different turbulence closures for simulating natural transition is listed in tables 5 and 6 lift and angular momentum coefficients cl cm are well predicted by all models with a maximum error of 7 from the ltpt experiment the k ω s s t model displays a very large cd error of 42 resulting from the very early generation of turbulence and thus incorrect cf distribution the γ re θ model and the lag elliptic blending model have the smaller cd error of 2 on the fully resolved grid 1 while the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model have the smaller cd error of 9 when using grid 5 in summary the lag elliptic blending model allows demonstrating the postulated ability of anisotropic low re rans closure to predict natural transition the model demonstrates excellent performance reproducing the correct physical behavior with robust grid convergence and close comparison with experimental data the γ re θ model has consistent grid convergence good force coefficient agreement with experiment but always predicts a spurious bubble on the foil back at all grid levels the elliptic blending k ε model and the cubic low re k ε model have similar behavior they demonstrate the potential to reproduce the correct natural transition phenomenon up to medium grid refinements but suffer from grid induced separation at the finest grid levels the problem may be addressed in the future by re evaluating a more consistent wall treatment applicable at extremely low y values the k ω s s t model owing to the simple eddy viscosity assumption evidences large deviation from the experiment on both the force coefficient values and local physics 6 conclusions the present study was aimed at assessing the applicability of several promising rans closures for simulating both separation induced transition and natural transition occurring on the back of a typical hydrofoil eppler 387 central attention was devoted to the ability of the models to capture the correct transitional flow physics in addition to the quantitative results systematic grid convergence studies were carried out and evidenced challenges at extremely fine grid resolutions for predicting natural transition the calculated force coefficients have been compared to published experimental measurements and the main conclusions are summarized as follows the γ re θ transition model the elliptic blending k ε model the lag elliptic blending model and the low re k ε model with cubic anisotropy consideration are all able to predict separation induced transition when applied with sufficient grid resolution all the four models have the ability to capture the position of laminar separation and turbulent reattachment with good agreement with published experimental data where the computed force coefficients also deliver satisfactory accuracy the k ω s s t model fails to capture both separation induced transition and natural transition looking at the performance for both tested conditions the key shortcoming of the model appears to be the early turbulence generation at the leading edge where the model does not correctly cope with stagnation effects the findings are not completely unexpected as the model bases its adaptation of turbulence generation in complex strains on the use of limiters rather than a representation of the correct stress strain behavior due to the evidenced shortcomings the model does not appear suitable for simulating transitional flow not surprisingly predicting natural transition is considerably more challenging than predicting separation induced transition the elliptic blending k ε model and the low re k ε model with cubic anisotropy consideration suffer from inconsistent grid convergence originating from deviation from the correct physics with extreme grid refinement while they have shown the potential of predicting both the correct natural transition phenomenon and an adequate accuracy of force coefficients at medium grid refinement levels when reaching extremely fine grid resolutions a spurious bubble is generated on the foil back side careful consideration of the meshing strategy could allow the engineering adoption of the models to simulate natural transition adopting average wall y larger than 0 2 however further research is required to improve the wall damping formulations and generalize their applicability the lag elliptic blending model has demonstrated robust applicability to predict both separation induced and natural transition with consistent grid convergence accurate prediction of force coefficients and consistent reproduction of the transition physics the model results demonstrate the postulated feasibility of using low re closures with anisotropy consideration for simulating natural transition without the use of empirical information as a correlation based and most widely used model for simulating transition the γ re θ transition model shows its advantage of robustness with quick and consistent convergence to a limited level of accuracy in force predictions however the approach cannot capture the natural transition physical phenomenon a small bubble always appears on the back of the foil which does not severely affect the predictions of force values in natural transition acknowledgments this work has been partially funded by the office of naval research grant n00014 17 1 2334
