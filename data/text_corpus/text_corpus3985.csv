19925,in aerobic granular sludge ags reactors granules of different sizes coexist in a single reactor their differences in settling behaviour cause stratification in the settled granule bed in combination with substrate concentration gradients over the reactor height during the anaerobic plug flow feeding regime this can result in functional differences between granule sizes in this study we compared the hydrolytic activity in granules of 4 size ranges between 0 5 and 4 8 mm diameter collected from a full scale ags installation protease and amylase activities were quantified through fluorescent activity assays to visualise where the hydrolytic active zones were located within the granules the hydrolysis sites were visualized microscopically after incubating intact and sliced granules with fluorescent casein and starch the microbial community was studied using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and sequencing the results of these assays indicated that hydrolytic capacity was present throughout the granules but the hydrolysis of bulk substrates was restricted to the outer 100 µm approximately many of the microorganisms studied by fish such as polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao were abundant in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active sites the biomass specific hydrolysis rate depended mainly on the available granule surface area suggesting that different sized granules are not differentiated in terms of hydrolytic capacity thus the substrate concentration gradients that are present during the anaerobic feeding in ags reactors do not seem to affect hydrolytic activity at the granule surfaces in this paper we discuss the possible reasons for this and reflect about the implications for ags technology graphical abstract image

from the wastewater besides removing cod ags can perform enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and biological nitrogen removal bengtsson et al 2018 de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015b in most full scale applications the treatment involves anaerobic uptake of cod followed by aerobic anoxic biomass growth this is achieved by applying a sequencing batch reactor sbr cycle that consists of three phases anaerobic feeding reaction and settling bengtsson et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015b at the end of the settling phase slow settling sludge is selectively discharged referred to as selection spill the treated water is discharged during the next feeding phase displaced by the influent volume fed from the reactor bottom plug flow feeding is important to avoid mixing of the untreated influent and treated effluent and to provide high local substrate concentrations de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015a the employed sbr cycle besides ensuring adequate wastewater treatment influences biomass differentiation ags reactors are usually composed of granules of different sizes and flocs in ags literature a range of granule diameters has been reported varying from 0 2 mm to more than 6 mm coma et al 2012 lanham et al 2012 layer et al 2019 stes et al 2021 toja ortega et al 2021a the selection spill wastes mainly flocs and small granules which creates biomass fractions with different srts in the same reactor ali et al 2019 guo et al 2020 large granules can have an srt of months while on the opposite end flocculent sludge is retained for only a few days ali et al 2019 in addition plug flow feeding results in higher substrate concentrations at the bottom of the sludge bed larger granules with a higher settling velocity are more likely to end up in the bottom of the settled bed during feeding experiencing higher substrate concentrations than small granules van dijk et al 2022 these conditions could result in functional differences between the granules of different sizes coupled to their differences in mass transfer resistance for instance in the full scale ags plant of garmerwolde the netherlands polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao were more concentrated in the larger granules ali et al 2019 such selection was attributed to the long retention of large granules and their preferential uptake of volatile fatty acids vfa during feeding moreover larger granule sizes are more suitable for simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd because of their larger anoxic volume during the reaction phase layer et al 2020 in smaller granules on the other hand nitrifying organisms are enriched due to a larger relative aerobic volume nguyen quoc et al 2021 similarly granule size could be important for the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates however biomass differentiation regarding hydrolysis has not been studied in detail yet hydrolysis is a key process to consider when studying the fate of polymeric substrates during wastewater treatment these substrates make up the largest cod fraction in municipal wastewater and must be extracellularly hydrolysed to compounds of smaller molecular weight 1 kda to be assimilated by microorganisms ferenci 1980 hollibaugh and azam 1983 previous experimental work found hydrolysis to be mainly biomass bound rather than occurring in the reactor bulk liquid confer and logan 1998 goel et al 1998 janning et al 1998 1997 mosquera corral et al 2003 in full scale ags aerobic granules showed significant hydrolytic activity suggesting that wastewater polymers can be utilized by granules toja ortega et al 2021a however the limited diffusion of polymers into the granules affects their hydrolysis resulting in lower biomass specific hydrolysis rates in granules compared to flocculent sludge moreover several studies suggest that most of the particulates are captured by flocculent sludge and the granules are only accessible for polymeric substrates of smaller size i e colloidal and soluble layer et al 2020 ranzinger et al 2020 those polymeric molecules can be present in the wastewater or originate from the conversion of the particulate cod thus it is still uncertain how relevant granules are for hydrolysing influent polymers and which granule volume is hydrolytically active those points should be addressed to clarify the contribution of polymeric cod to nutrient removal processes and stable granule growth in addition it is not known whether all granules within an ags reactor have a similar hydrolysis capacity smaller granules would presumably hydrolyse influent substrates at a higher rate due to their higher available surface area toh et al 2003 nevertheless the hydrolytic activity of granules of different sizes might be influenced by factors other than mass transfer of the substrate for instance the abovementioned srt differences and substrate concentration gradients in the sludge bed during feeding could support the enrichment of hydrolysing organisms and enzymes in some specific granule sizes exploring differences in hydrolytic activity along the ags bed would add to the current knowledge of biomass differentiation in ags reactors furthermore the distribution of hydrolytic activity may reflect the removal mechanism of particulate substrates in ags understanding the differences in microbial activity on different granule size ranges can ultimately aid process control in this study we explored the location of hydrolysis in ags on granule level first we studied whether granules of different sizes within an ags bed are differentiated in terms of their hydrolytic potential we compared the biomass specific hydrolysis rate of granules of different sizes focussing on protease and amylase activities these enzyme groups were targeted based on previous studies that showed significant protease and α glucosidase activities on ags toja ortega et al 2021a 2021b in addition we investigated the location of hydrolysis within granules to gain insight into substrate penetration depth and the distribution of enzymes throughout the granules microbial groups of interest were identified via fluorescence in situ hybridization fish to study their localization relative to the hydrolysis sites the hydrolytic activity results from each granule size fraction were finally evaluated in relation to other granule characteristics such as granule density and settling velocity substrate uptake rate and microbial community composition based on these observations we reflect on the implications of our findings for particulate hydrolysis in ags and full scale operation 2 materials methods 2 1 sludge sampling and processing aerobic granules were harvested in wastewater treatment plant wwtp utrecht the netherlands the plant treats domestic wastewater in 6 nereda reactors of 12 000 m3 designed by royal haskoningdhv and operated by the dutch district water authority hoogheemraadschap de stichtse rijnlanden the average flow during the sampling period was 74 700 m 3 d 1 and the reactors are operated with a sludge loading of 0 05 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 the full scale reactors were sampled after at least 20 min of aeration to ensure a homogeneous mixed liquor sample the granules were separated into four size fractions by sieving the reactor mixed liquor through different mesh sizes the resulting granule size fractions consisted of the following diameter ranges 0 5 1 mm 1 6 2 mm 2 5 3 15 mm and 4 4 8 mm non overlapping fractions were used in the study to facilitate the comparison between granules of different size the granule fractions derived from sieving were cleaned based on settling to remove non granule material like husk and fibers to do so granules were transferred to a beaker and tap water was added the content of the beaker was mixed by stirring after a few seconds of settling time granules were at the bottom of the beaker and the liquid only contained the non granular fraction that was subsequently discarded the process was repeated for 5 10 times until the discarded liquid was clean the resulting granule size fractions were stored at 4 c until use for a maximum of 2 days before the assays the granules were acclimatized for half an hour in 10 mm tris hcl buffer ph 7 8 at room temperature 20 c 2 2 protease and amylase assays protease and amylase activities of the granules were quantified using fluorogenic substrates these substrates enable studying the activity on a single granule scale in a 96 well plate reader furthermore studying the hydrolysis of real wastewater polymeric substrates is extremely challenging due to their complexity and variability therefore surrogates were used to provide a reproducible experimental setup and study the hydrolytic capacity of granules in detail the hydrolytic activity assays were based on the protein hydrolysis assay described by van gaelen et al 2020 protease activity was measured using the bodipy fl casein substrate enzchek protease assay kit e6638 thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa amylase activity was measured using the bodipy fl dq starch substrate enzchek ultra amylase assay kit e33651 thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa the substrates were prepared following kit instructions rendering a protease solution of 10 mg bodipy casein l and an amylase substrate of 200 mg bodipy starch l there was a modification amylase substrate was prepared using the digestion buffer provided in the protease assay 10 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm sodium azide in order to keep the same assay conditions the digestion buffer used in the assay was also the 10 mm tris hcl provided in the protease assay two types of sample were studied per granule size fraction intact granules and crushed granules the latter were used to determine the hydrolytic capacity of the sludge minimizing mass transfer limitation each granule size fraction was studied on a separate run using a 96 well plate in each run hydrolysis rates were monitored in 4 wells containing crushed sludge as well as in 20 wells containing one intact granule per well for the intact granule samples 100 µl of digestion buffer and one granule were added to the assay wells the crushed granules were prepared by using a potter elvehjem tissue grinder and diluted to an approximate concentration of 1 g tss l using digestion buffer then 100 µl of crushed sludge sample were added to the assay wells to start the assay 50 µl of substrate was added to all the samples besides the samples controls were added in each assay blanks were prepared for each type of sludge by adding digestion buffer instead of substrate standard samples were also included for each type of sludge by adding a known concentration of hydrolysed substrate standard instead of fresh substrate the standards were prepared by hydrolysing an aliquot of the substrate solution with commercial enzyme p5985 and 10065 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa hydrolytic activity was monitored in a 96 well plate reader fluostar galaxy multi functional microplate reader bmg labtech ortenberg germany the reader measures the fluorescence intensity in each of the 96 wells in defined time intervals each experiment ran for approximately 1 5 h with fluorescence readings every 5 min for both substrates the ex em wavelengths 485 538 nm were used the experiments were performed with acclimatised granules at room temperature with linear mixing per hydrolytic activity assay all the granules were fractionated from the same mixed liquor sample batch and their activities were measured on the same day 2 3 calculation of hydrolysis rates the fluorescence intensities from the individual wells were analysed through linear regression the fluorescence intensities of each well were normalized with the fluorescence intensity of the standards the linear range of the time resolved fluorescence curve was visually selected to calculate the hydrolysis rate expressed as fluorescence arbitrary units per hour the activity per g vss was calculated by estimating the amount of biomass in each well in the crushed sludge samples the vss concentration of the samples was directly measured following standard methods apha 2005 for the granule samples the amount of biomass per well was variable and therefore the vss per well was estimated instead of measured directly the estimation was done as follows first granule volume was estimated through light microscopy the plate was placed under a digital microscope vhx 700f keyence mechelen belgium and an image of each granule was captured the images were analysed using the microscope software to extract the circle equivalent diameter of the granules the granule volume was then calculated from this diameter assuming spherical granules finally the granule volume was translated to vss using granule biomass density determined separately see materials methods granule density measurements hydrolytic activity was also expressed relative to granule surface area the surface area too was calculated based on the circle equivalent diameter determined via image analysis of each granule separately the obtained biomass relative and surface relative rates were normalized against the highest measured rate to simplify visualizations given that the fluorescence units were by definition arbitrary 2 4 enzyme staining and microscopic examination 2 4 1 identification of hydrolytically active sites bodipy fl casein and bodipy fl dq starch were also used for localizing hydrolytically active sites in the granules the objective of these experiments was to assess the location within the granule at which polymers from the bulk can be hydrolysed the procedure was based on the enzyme staining method described for activated sludge xia et al 2008b 2008a 2007 we modified the protocol to stain the biofilm instead of flocculent sludge substrate solutions of 100 mg l were prepared diluting the substrates in tris hcl buffer 10 mm ph 7 8 the substrate concentration and incubation time were chosen based on preliminary assays supplementary information table s1 granules were incubated with fluorescent substrates in 2 ml sample tubes eppendorf hamburg germany approximately 120 mg of fresh granules 5 mg tss were added to 500 µl of digestion buffer and 250 µl of substrate solution that rendered a substrate to sludge ratio of 5 µg substrate per g tss samples were incubated for two hours in the dark and with orbital shaking at 120 rpm fisherbrand seastar thermo fisher scientific waltham usa after incubation with fluorescent substrates the granules were transferred to freeze drying medium neg 50tm thermo fisher scientific waltham usa and stored at 4 c overnight protected from light then the granules were sectioned in a leica cm1900 cryostat leica microsystems nussloch germany the temperature of the blade and the sample holder was 22 c and the granules were sectioned in 20 µm thick coupes granule sections were spread on poly lysine coated slides and air dried in the dark finally the sections were examined using a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope zeiss oberkochen germany the fluorescent signals from the hydrolysed bodipy fl casein and bodipy fl dq starch were visualized and captured using a fluos filter excitation 485 nm emission 515 565 nm 2 4 2 distribution of hydrolytic enzymes throughout the granule a variation of the above described method was used to explore the distribution of enzymes throughout the granule fresh granules were sliced using a scalpel mounted in a microscope slide and incubated with the fluorogenic substrates the granule sections were covered with 10 µl of a 2 1 buffer substrate solution and incubated in the dark for 2 h then the substrate solution was replaced by digestion buffer and the slides were observed on the fluorescence microscope 2 5 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish after inspecting the activity staining the granule sections were fixed in ethanol 50 for 2 h ethanol fixing was used independently of the microbial group targeted by fish gram negative or gram positive as described in xia et al 2007 the following probes were used eubmix staining most bacteria a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 paomix targeting ca accumulibacter related

phylum chloroflexi and bac111 targeting activated sludge clones of the family saprospiraceae kong et al 2007 detailed information of all these probes is given in probebase loy et al 2003 all the probes were cy3 or cy5 labelled fish staining was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 samples were incubated for 2 h with the fish probes the stained slides were mounted with vectashield antifade mounting medium vector laboratories burlingame ca usa and inspected on the epifluorescence microscope the hybridised cells were visualized using the filters cy3 excitation 546 nm emission 575 640 nm and cy5 excitation 575 625 nm emission 660 710 nm 2 6 microbial diversity analysis three sludge samples were collected at different points of each of the studied reactors r1 r3 and r4 each of the triplicate samples was sieved separately using the same procedure as described in section 2 1 15 ml of the sieved granules roughly 300 mg tss of each size fraction were homogenized using a tissue grinder the homogenized samples were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min and approximately 2 mg tss of the resulting pellet were added to the extraction tubes dna was then extracted as described in toja ortega et al 2021b the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified and paired end sequenced in an llumina novaseq 6000 platform by novogene beijing china the primer set 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 was used the raw reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra on bioproject prjna837281 the trimmed and merged sequences provided by novogene were processed using qiime2 version 2020 2 bolyen et al 2019 the sequences were quality filtered using deblur amir et al 2017 trimming the sequences the 3 end at position 237 parameter p trim length with the remaining sequences alpha and beta diversity metrics were generated and differences in diversity between granule sizes were assessed using permanova anderson 2001 a p value of 0 05 was used as cut off for significance finally taxonomic affiliation of the sequences was determined by aligning the sequences to the midas 3 6 database nierychlo et al 2020 sample subsetting visualization and further statistical analysis was performed in r using the phyloseq and ampvis2 packages andersen et al 2018 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 differences in the relative abundance of the 20 most abundant genera were studied performing a wald test the relative abundances in the smallest and largest granules were compared differences were considered significant with a p value below the bonferroni corrected p value of 0 05 p 0 05 number of comparisons 2 7 additional characterization of the granule fractions 2 7 1 pao activity the activity of pao was assessed in the four granule size fractions through batch tests the assay was performed in triplicate the granules which had been stored anaerobically overnight were acclimated by aerating for 35 min then they were crushed using a potter elvehjem tissue grinder and buffered with 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 the assays were conducted in 500 ml bottles with a final sludge concentration of approximately 3 g vss l sodium acetate was added to a final concentration of 170 mg cod l the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and flushed with n2 for two minutes to provide anaerobic conditions the samples were incubated for two hours in a fisherbrand seastar orbital shaker at 120 rpm taking samples regularly every 6 10 min samples were filtered using 0 45 µm pes syringe filters the acetate concentration of the samples was measured in a gas chromatographer equipped with an fid detector 7890a gc agilent technologies santa clara ca usa phosphate concentration was determined colorimetrically using the usepa method 365 1 in an aq400 discrete analyser seal analytical mequon wi usa the tss and vss concentration of the sludge solutions used in the assay were determined following standard methods apha 2005 2 7 2 settling tests the terminal settling velocity of granules was studied in a measuring cylinder with an internal diameter of 7 94 cm and a height of 42 1 cm filled with tap water granules were placed individually at the top of the cylinder and their settling was recorded using a camera gopro hero session 4 san mateo ca usa around 50 granules were examined per size fraction 2 7 3 granule biomass density measurements granule biomass density was measured using the modified dextran blue method as described in van den berg et al 2022 the density measurements were performed in 200 ml samples and each granule size fraction was measured in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule size effect on hydrolysis rate the hydrolysis capacity of different sized aerobic granules was studied using fluorescent protease and amylase assays biomass specific hydrolytic activity fluorescence δf g vss h was inversely proportional to granule diameter fig 1 this relationship can be explained by the changes in surface volume ratio with respect to granule diameter sa v d 1 for a perfect sphere the areal hydrolysis rate δf m2 h somewhat decreased with increasing granule size too fig 1 hence the smaller granules had a higher biomass specific hydrolytic activity supported mainly by their proportionally higher available surface area and enhanced by a higher activity per surface area according to these results the hydrolytic capacity that potentially could degrade influent particulates can be doubled by halving the average granule diameter in an ags reactor the different biomass specific rates indicated that hydrolysis was as described previously conditioned by mass transfer in wwtp garmerwolde crushed granules and flocs showed roughly twice as high hydrolytic activity as intact granules e g protease rates were 0 016 and 0 017 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 on crushed granules and flocs and 0 007 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 on intact granules toja ortega et al 2021a activated sludge studies using similar methods also generally reported higher hydrolysis rates than those measured in granules although hydrolysis rates differed between studies and plants up to two orders of magnitude e g protease activities reported in as range from 0 015 to 2 1 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 frølund et al 1995 nybroe et al 1992 in this study too the available surface area determined the activity of the sludge and the hydrolysis rates increased upon granule crushing data not shown the starch and proteins used in the assays were soluble substrates the molecular weight of the labelled starch was lower than 1 kda and casein has a molecular weight of around 24 kda considering that the hydrolysis rate of even the small starch molecules was determined by the available granule surface area the same could be expected for larger substrates 3 2 hydrolysis sites and hydrolytic capacity distribution within granules 3 2 1 mass transfer limited hydrolysis of polymeric substrates occurs at the granule surface the sites of hydrolysis were microscopically visualized in granules incubated with fluorescent substrates intact granules were incubated for 2 h and cryosectioned afterwards fig 2 shows the micrographs of granules of 4 different sizes incubated with bodipy casein amylase assays rendered similar results which can be found in the supplementary information as well as additional protease images figs s3 s5 all the granule sizes revealed a hydrolytically active layer in the outer part of the granules the thickness of this layer varied depending on the zone of the granule and rarely reached further than the outer 100 µm of granule granule size did not appear to impact the thickness of the hydrolytically active layer protease active sites were generally arranged in a thin layer close to the surface of the granules within the outer 100 µm in some spots along the granule surface larger fluorescent patches could be observed which exceeded the 100 µm of depth those areas were generally more fluffy supplementary information fig s4 2 with protease staining it was seldom possible to distinguish individual stained cells but rather a cloudy background was observed as if hydrolysis products were distributed throughout the extracellular space for amylase on the contrary distinct cells were discernible even though a fluorescent background was observed too supplementary information fig s5 nevertheless the granule depth at which hydrolysis occurred was similar for both substrates 3 2 2 hydrolytic potential is also present deeper inside the granule the distribution of hydrolytic potential in granules was further inspected by eliminating mass transfer limitation that is slicing granules before incubating them with fluorescent substrates in order to expose the full sectional plane to the fluorescent substrate the result of these experiments differed for both substrates while proteases seemed to be distributed throughout the whole granule amylase activity was still restricted to the outer parts of the granules although in a thicker layer than when incubating intact granules fig 3 the activity distribution observed under the microscope related to the hydrolysis rates measured in crushed granules fig 3 when the granule structure was disrupted by crushing all the granule sizes had the same protease activity suggesting that the inner parts of the granules had similar hydrolytic capacities across granule sizes on the contrary the amylase activity of crushed granules decreased with granule size based on the microscopic observations this could be due to low or no amylase activity in the inner volume of granules and the larger proportion of such volume in larger granules the difference in protease and amylase enzyme distribution might be related to the distribution of different macromolecules in the granule matrix previous studies investigating the distribution of extracellular polymeric substances eps in lab grown ags reported that α polysaccharides were mainly present close to the granule surface adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 proteins on the other hand were distributed throughout the granule and the granule core was mainly composed of protein the distribution of proteins and polysaccharides in full scale granules was not studied yet but might be similar to the reported observations in lab grown granules the different distribution of proteases and amylases throughout the granules might reflect the distribution of their potential substrates proteins and alpha polysaccharides on the granule matrix in spite of these differences in granule wide distribution of protease and amylase activity the hydrolysis of both casein and starch in intact granules was restricted to the granule surface indicating that hydrolysis is mass transfer limited 3 2 3 microorganisms in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active layer microorganisms surrounding the hydrolytically active layer were identified by fish pao gao and putative starch and protein hydrolysers were targeted via fish probes gao and ca accumulibacter related pao were abundant in all granule sizes pao were most concentrated in the outer granule layers while gao were abundant in the core too these microorganisms were often intercalated with hydrolytically active cells fig 4 a the amylase staining was still visible after the fish hybridization procedure making it possible to identify some of the starch hydrolysing organisms some of the starch hydrolysers hybridized with the probe actino 221 targeting tetrasphaera specifically some of the filamentous starch hydrolysers fig 5 b arrows i some of the tetrasphaera members can hydrolyse starch and they are overall regarded as dominant glucose fermenters in ebpr plants nielsen et al 2012 xia et al 2008a despite some of the amylase stained cells were identified as tetrasphaera most of the starch hydrolysing organisms remained unidentified in general the abundance of tetrasphaera was high as in previous as and ags studies ali et al 2019 nguyen et al 2011 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 toja ortega et al 2021b since individual cells were seldom stained with protease substrates protein hydrolysing organisms could not be identified nevertheless it was possible to observe the microorganisms in the vicinity of the active protease sites phylum chloroflexi and family saprospiraceae were targeted as putative hydrolysers xia et al 2007 the probes targeting these taxa hybridized with a significant amount of organisms in the sludge some of the chloroflexi or saprospiraceae hybridized cells were located close to the hydrolysis sites however their distribution was not restricted to those sites and they were most abundant further from the granule surface therefore their relevance for protein hydrolysis could not be determined saprospiraceae were rod shaped often arranged in colonies and located mostly in the outer part of the granules chloroflexi were filamentous and widely distributed throughout the granules chloroflexi hybridized cells were specially abundant in the granule core where they might be subsisting on cell decay products and other recalcitrant compounds fig 4f kragelund et al 2007 interestingly the chloroflexi genus kouleothrix was identified by 16s as one of the abundant genera fig 5b this genus is considered a major indicator of bulking in as nittami et al 2017 however it did not seem to have detrimental effects on aerobic granules chloroflexi filaments did not result in filamentous outgrowths or irregular granule surfaces supplementary information fig s6 they rather constituted a filamentous network inside the granules fig 4e f a similar observation was made by de graaf et al 2020 who cultivated aerobic granules with a high abundance of the filamentous thiothrix the high proportion of filamentous organisms in the granules did not deteriorate granule morphology or cause operation issues showing that operating conditions rather than bacterial morphology determine granule stability de graaff et al 2020 this interpretation is supported by our observation of filamentous organisms thoroughly distributed in stable full scale granules 3 3 additional comparison of the different granule size fractions the microbial composition of granules of different sizes was compared based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results fig 5b shows the average abundance of the main 20 genera the abundances of the main microorganisms showed some variation between reactors for the composition per reactor check supplementary information fig s7 nevertheless the main genera were shared between all samples the microbial community composition differed significantly between the different granule size fractions when studying the bray curtis dissimilarity between samples one can appreciate that samples cluster according to granule size fig 5a the distance between samples grows with increasing granule size difference in all granule sizes the microorganisms targeted by fish were found in high relative abundance in ngs results however the differences in relative abundance between granule sizes were small an increase in ca competibacter and ca accumulibacter can be noticed with increasing granule size but the relative abundance differences are not significant p 0 05 number of comparisons the relative abundance of the family saprospiraceae did significantly increase from the largest to smallest granule sizes other genera that were at significantly higher concentrations in the smaller granules were the nitrifying nitrosomonas and nitrospira as described previously nguyen quoc et al 2021 to check other significant abundance differences on the most abundant microorganisms see supplementary information tables s8 1 and s8 2 activity batch tests revealed an increasing specific anaerobic acetate uptake and p release with increasing granule size table 1 the terminal settling velocity was also higher in the largest granules as expected due to their larger size liu et al 2008 van dijk et al 2020 table 1 these results are in agreement with the observations at garmerwolde wwtp and the hypothesis that the higher settling velocity of larger granules favours pao enrichment ali et al 2019 van dijk et al 2022 granule density decreased with increasing granule size which could be explained by a reduced substrate availability at the granule core due to diffusion limitation leading to biomass decay the large granules 4 mm older and with a larger core volume were the least dense in line with results reported by toh et al 2003 3 4 general discussion our results showed a similar distribution of hydrolytic activity in all the granules ranging from 0 5 to 4 8 mm from a full scale ags reactor all the granules had an active hydrolytic layer at their outer part and its thickness did not seem to depend on granule size the hydrolysis rates measured in the different sized granules also indicated that hydrolysis is largely surface area related this makes small granules more suitable to degrade polymeric substrates not because of a specific microbial community composition or higher enzyme concentration but mainly due to their high available surface area their activity was enhanced by a somewhat higher surface related activity although a significant trend could not be identified there was nonetheless microbial differentiation between granules of different sizes the microbial community of the granules shifted with the changes in granule size since most hydrolysers remained unidentified it was not possible to assess their abundance changes in the different size fractions the abundances of the pao ca accumulibacter and the gao ca competibacter did not differ significantly between granule size fractions nonetheless activity tests did show differences in acetate uptake and p release rates the largest granules exhibited higher acetate uptake and p release activities reflecting a higher ebpr activity this higher activity can be explained by the differences in substrate availability during full scale operation due to stratification during settling larger granules will be located closer to the influent inlet at the bottom of the reactor than the small granules van dijk et al 2020 2022 large granules thus spend most of the anaerobic period in contact with the influent while smaller granules are only in contact with the influent during the final stages of the feeding phase when the influent level reaches the upper part of the settled bed van dijk et al 2022 vfas are taken up at high rates and hence the position of granules in the sludge bed during feeding impacts their access to vfa significantly de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015a in this way anaerobic cod storage is promoted in granules at the bottom of the settled granule bed that is in the largest granules van dijk et al 2022 this may lead to pao and gao enrichment as previously reported by ali et al 2019 in the full scale ags from wwtp garmerwolde in contrast hydrolysis potential was similar yet surface bound across granule sizes one reason could be that the position of the granules in the settled bed has little effect on their interaction with polymeric substrates granule substrate interaction is greatly influenced by the size of the substrate and by mixing the majority of polymeric substrates in domestic wastewater are in the particulate form polymeric substrates can also be soluble and colloidal but these forms are generally less abundant in domestic wastewater likely due to biodegradation during transport in the sewer reported soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations in domestic wastewater range between 3 and 100 mg cod l and between 5 and 110 mg cod l respectively their particulate counterparts range between 3 and 161 mg cod l for proteins and between 5 and 200 mg cod l for carbohydrates narkis et al 1980 raunkjær et al 1994 ravndal et al 2018 toja ortega et al 2021a 2021b during plug flow feeding while soluble and colloidal substrates penetrate the granules easily particulates are trapped within the voids of the granule bed but their attachment to the biomass appears to be low layer et al 2020 ranzinger et al 2020 most of the particulate cod is thus likely resuspended in the aerobic phase where the reactor volume is fully mixed aeration creates a turbulent flow which promotes collision between granules and particulate substrates boltz and la motta 2006 layer et al 2020 layer et al 2020 reported a retention of 60 85 of the particulate cod in ags after 3 h of aeration hence the aerobic phase probably determines the biomass fraction particulates can attach to including both the granular and flocculent fractions that usually constitute the ags bed in this context the development of hydrolytic capacity would be driven by the interactions taking place during the aerobic phase where there is no sludge stratification and a large surface area is advantageous to enhance collision chances furthermore the synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes within the granule matrix might be triggered by compounds in the eps rather than by substrates in the bulk liquid studies on the eps composition of ags found proteins widespread through the granules and α polysaccharides only in the outer layers adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 the granule wide distribution of hydrolytic activity determined in our study also showed protease activity all through the granule while amylase was restricted to the surface high protease activities have been measured previously in the granule core and related to eps turnover and biomass decay adav et al 2009 therefore the hydrolytic enzymes could be mainly degrading eps and cell decay components although they also allow granules to hydrolyse polymeric substrates from the influent at the surface of the ags or within the granules in case of diffusible polymers the combined fish and activity staining results showed that pao and gao localized close to the hydrolysis sites and they could potentially take up the hydrolysates generated during the anaerobic phase furthermore some of the actinobacterial pao tetrasphaera in this study could hydrolyse starch also suggesting that polysaccharides can be used for ebpr however the contribution of polymeric cod to ebpr remains a topic for further research evident from our study is that granule surface area will determine the potential of aerobic granules to degrade polymeric cod both aerobically and anaerobically if boosting the anaerobic uptake of polymeric cod is desired due to a wastewater with low vfa for example a smaller average granule size might be beneficial the length of the anaerobic phase could be regulated too to promote hydrolysis smaller granules will also increase nitrification rates and overall improve mass transfer nguyen quoc et al 2021 if on a different scenario there are enough vfa in the influent for effective ebpr larger granules might be preferred for an improved simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and a decreased degradation of polymeric substrates lower aerobic cod degradation would then decrease aeration costs and enhance the recovery of energy from the sludge spill guo et al 2020 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are 1 the stratification of the ags granule bed during feeding drives microbial differentiation in granules of different sizes based on their proximity to the influent inlet during feeding as a result large granules have higher acetate uptake rates reflecting their preferential access to influent vfa nevertheless this differentiation is not evident from the distribution of hydrolysis capacity all granule sizes exhibited a similar hydrolytic activity per surface area and thus the development of hydrolytic activity does not appear to be conditioned by the position of granules in the settled bed during feeding 2 hydrolysis of polymers occurred in the outer 50 100 µm of the granules paos and gaos were observed in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active granule sites but their anaerobic uptake of hydrolysates was not demonstrated and deserves further research 3 small granules returned higher specific hydrolysis rates due to their larger specific surface area thus small granules are preferred when anaerobic cod storage from polymeric substrates needs to be maximized however the hydrolysis kinetics of polymeric substrates should be studied further to evaluate how significantly these substrates can contribute to anaerobic cod storage in ags declaration of competing interest the authors declare

19925,in aerobic granular sludge ags reactors granules of different sizes coexist in a single reactor their differences in settling behaviour cause stratification in the settled granule bed in combination with substrate concentration gradients over the reactor height during the anaerobic plug flow feeding regime this can result in functional differences between granule sizes in this study we compared the hydrolytic activity in granules of 4 size ranges between 0 5 and 4 8 mm diameter collected from a full scale ags installation protease and amylase activities were quantified through fluorescent activity assays to visualise where the hydrolytic active zones were located within the granules the hydrolysis sites were visualized microscopically after incubating intact and sliced granules with fluorescent casein and starch the microbial community was studied using fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and sequencing the results of these assays indicated that hydrolytic capacity was present throughout the granules but the hydrolysis of bulk substrates was restricted to the outer 100 µm approximately many of the microorganisms studied by fish such as polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms pao and gao were abundant in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active sites the biomass specific hydrolysis rate depended mainly on the available granule surface area suggesting that different sized granules are not differentiated in terms of hydrolytic capacity thus the substrate concentration gradients that are present during the anaerobic feeding in ags reactors do not seem to affect hydrolytic activity at the granule surfaces in this paper we discuss the possible reasons for this and reflect about the implications for ags technology graphical abstract image

from the wastewater besides removing cod ags can perform enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and biological nitrogen removal bengtsson et al 2018 de kreuk et al 2005 pronk et al 2015b in most full scale applications the treatment involves anaerobic uptake of cod followed by aerobic anoxic biomass growth this is achieved by applying a sequencing batch reactor sbr cycle that consists of three phases anaerobic feeding reaction and settling bengtsson et al 2018 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015b at the end of the settling phase slow settling sludge is selectively discharged referred to as selection spill the treated water is discharged during the next feeding phase displaced by the influent volume fed from the reactor bottom plug flow feeding is important to avoid mixing of the untreated influent and treated effluent and to provide high local substrate concentrations de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015a the employed sbr cycle besides ensuring adequate wastewater treatment influences biomass differentiation ags reactors are usually composed of granules of different sizes and flocs in ags literature a range of granule diameters has been reported varying from 0 2 mm to more than 6 mm coma et al 2012 lanham et al 2012 layer et al 2019 stes et al 2021 toja ortega et al 2021a the selection spill wastes mainly flocs and small granules which creates biomass fractions with different srts in the same reactor ali et al 2019 guo et al 2020 large granules can have an srt of months while on the opposite end flocculent sludge is retained for only a few days ali et al 2019 in addition plug flow feeding results in higher substrate concentrations at the bottom of the sludge bed larger granules with a higher settling velocity are more likely to end up in the bottom of the settled bed during feeding experiencing higher substrate concentrations than small granules van dijk et al 2022 these conditions could result in functional differences between the granules of different sizes coupled to their differences in mass transfer resistance for instance in the full scale ags plant of garmerwolde the netherlands polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao were more concentrated in the larger granules ali et al 2019 such selection was attributed to the long retention of large granules and their preferential uptake of volatile fatty acids vfa during feeding moreover larger granule sizes are more suitable for simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd because of their larger anoxic volume during the reaction phase layer et al 2020 in smaller granules on the other hand nitrifying organisms are enriched due to a larger relative aerobic volume nguyen quoc et al 2021 similarly granule size could be important for the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates however biomass differentiation regarding hydrolysis has not been studied in detail yet hydrolysis is a key process to consider when studying the fate of polymeric substrates during wastewater treatment these substrates make up the largest cod fraction in municipal wastewater and must be extracellularly hydrolysed to compounds of smaller molecular weight 1 kda to be assimilated by microorganisms ferenci 1980 hollibaugh and azam 1983 previous experimental work found hydrolysis to be mainly biomass bound rather than occurring in the reactor bulk liquid confer and logan 1998 goel et al 1998 janning et al 1998 1997 mosquera corral et al 2003 in full scale ags aerobic granules showed significant hydrolytic activity suggesting that wastewater polymers can be utilized by granules toja ortega et al 2021a however the limited diffusion of polymers into the granules affects their hydrolysis resulting in lower biomass specific hydrolysis rates in granules compared to flocculent sludge moreover several studies suggest that most of the particulates are captured by flocculent sludge and the granules are only accessible for polymeric substrates of smaller size i e colloidal and soluble layer et al 2020 ranzinger et al 2020 those polymeric molecules can be present in the wastewater or originate from the conversion of the particulate cod thus it is still uncertain how relevant granules are for hydrolysing influent polymers and which granule volume is hydrolytically active those points should be addressed to clarify the contribution of polymeric cod to nutrient removal processes and stable granule growth in addition it is not known whether all granules within an ags reactor have a similar hydrolysis capacity smaller granules would presumably hydrolyse influent substrates at a higher rate due to their higher available surface area toh et al 2003 nevertheless the hydrolytic activity of granules of different sizes might be influenced by factors other than mass transfer of the substrate for instance the abovementioned srt differences and substrate concentration gradients in the sludge bed during feeding could support the enrichment of hydrolysing organisms and enzymes in some specific granule sizes exploring differences in hydrolytic activity along the ags bed would add to the current knowledge of biomass differentiation in ags reactors furthermore the distribution of hydrolytic activity may reflect the removal mechanism of particulate substrates in ags understanding the differences in microbial activity on different granule size ranges can ultimately aid process control in this study we explored the location of hydrolysis in ags on granule level first we studied whether granules of different sizes within an ags bed are differentiated in terms of their hydrolytic potential we compared the biomass specific hydrolysis rate of granules of different sizes focussing on protease and amylase activities these enzyme groups were targeted based on previous studies that showed significant protease and α glucosidase activities on ags toja ortega et al 2021a 2021b in addition we investigated the location of hydrolysis within granules to gain insight into substrate penetration depth and the distribution of enzymes throughout the granules microbial groups of interest were identified via fluorescence in situ hybridization fish to study their localization relative to the hydrolysis sites the hydrolytic activity results from each granule size fraction were finally evaluated in relation to other granule characteristics such as granule density and settling velocity substrate uptake rate and microbial community composition based on these observations we reflect on the implications of our findings for particulate hydrolysis in ags and full scale operation 2 materials methods 2 1 sludge sampling and processing aerobic granules were harvested in wastewater treatment plant wwtp utrecht the netherlands the plant treats domestic wastewater in 6 nereda reactors of 12 000 m3 designed by royal haskoningdhv and operated by the dutch district water authority hoogheemraadschap de stichtse rijnlanden the average flow during the sampling period was 74 700 m 3 d 1 and the reactors are operated with a sludge loading of 0 05 kg cod kg vss 1 d 1 the full scale reactors were sampled after at least 20 min of aeration to ensure a homogeneous mixed liquor sample the granules were separated into four size fractions by sieving the reactor mixed liquor through different mesh sizes the resulting granule size fractions consisted of the following diameter ranges 0 5 1 mm 1 6 2 mm 2 5 3 15 mm and 4 4 8 mm non overlapping fractions were used in the study to facilitate the comparison between granules of different size the granule fractions derived from sieving were cleaned based on settling to remove non granule material like husk and fibers to do so granules were transferred to a beaker and tap water was added the content of the beaker was mixed by stirring after a few seconds of settling time granules were at the bottom of the beaker and the liquid only contained the non granular fraction that was subsequently discarded the process was repeated for 5 10 times until the discarded liquid was clean the resulting granule size fractions were stored at 4 c until use for a maximum of 2 days before the assays the granules were acclimatized for half an hour in 10 mm tris hcl buffer ph 7 8 at room temperature 20 c 2 2 protease and amylase assays protease and amylase activities of the granules were quantified using fluorogenic substrates these substrates enable studying the activity on a single granule scale in a 96 well plate reader furthermore studying the hydrolysis of real wastewater polymeric substrates is extremely challenging due to their complexity and variability therefore surrogates were used to provide a reproducible experimental setup and study the hydrolytic capacity of granules in detail the hydrolytic activity assays were based on the protein hydrolysis assay described by van gaelen et al 2020 protease activity was measured using the bodipy fl casein substrate enzchek protease assay kit e6638 thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa amylase activity was measured using the bodipy fl dq starch substrate enzchek ultra amylase assay kit e33651 thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa the substrates were prepared following kit instructions rendering a protease solution of 10 mg bodipy casein l and an amylase substrate of 200 mg bodipy starch l there was a modification amylase substrate was prepared using the digestion buffer provided in the protease assay 10 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm sodium azide in order to keep the same assay conditions the digestion buffer used in the assay was also the 10 mm tris hcl provided in the protease assay two types of sample were studied per granule size fraction intact granules and crushed granules the latter were used to determine the hydrolytic capacity of the sludge minimizing mass transfer limitation each granule size fraction was studied on a separate run using a 96 well plate in each run hydrolysis rates were monitored in 4 wells containing crushed sludge as well as in 20 wells containing one intact granule per well for the intact granule samples 100 µl of digestion buffer and one granule were added to the assay wells the crushed granules were prepared by using a potter elvehjem tissue grinder and diluted to an approximate concentration of 1 g tss l using digestion buffer then 100 µl of crushed sludge sample were added to the assay wells to start the assay 50 µl of substrate was added to all the samples besides the samples controls were added in each assay blanks were prepared for each type of sludge by adding digestion buffer instead of substrate standard samples were also included for each type of sludge by adding a known concentration of hydrolysed substrate standard instead of fresh substrate the standards were prepared by hydrolysing an aliquot of the substrate solution with commercial enzyme p5985 and 10065 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa hydrolytic activity was monitored in a 96 well plate reader fluostar galaxy multi functional microplate reader bmg labtech ortenberg germany the reader measures the fluorescence intensity in each of the 96 wells in defined time intervals each experiment ran for approximately 1 5 h with fluorescence readings every 5 min for both substrates the ex em wavelengths 485 538 nm were used the experiments were performed with acclimatised granules at room temperature with linear mixing per hydrolytic activity assay all the granules were fractionated from the same mixed liquor sample batch and their activities were measured on the same day 2 3 calculation of hydrolysis rates the fluorescence intensities from the individual wells were analysed through linear regression the fluorescence intensities of each well were normalized with the fluorescence intensity of the standards the linear range of the time resolved fluorescence curve was visually selected to calculate the hydrolysis rate expressed as fluorescence arbitrary units per hour the activity per g vss was calculated by estimating the amount of biomass in each well in the crushed sludge samples the vss concentration of the samples was directly measured following standard methods apha 2005 for the granule samples the amount of biomass per well was variable and therefore the vss per well was estimated instead of measured directly the estimation was done as follows first granule volume was estimated through light microscopy the plate was placed under a digital microscope vhx 700f keyence mechelen belgium and an image of each granule was captured the images were analysed using the microscope software to extract the circle equivalent diameter of the granules the granule volume was then calculated from this diameter assuming spherical granules finally the granule volume was translated to vss using granule biomass density determined separately see materials methods granule density measurements hydrolytic activity was also expressed relative to granule surface area the surface area too was calculated based on the circle equivalent diameter determined via image analysis of each granule separately the obtained biomass relative and surface relative rates were normalized against the highest measured rate to simplify visualizations given that the fluorescence units were by definition arbitrary 2 4 enzyme staining and microscopic examination 2 4 1 identification of hydrolytically active sites bodipy fl casein and bodipy fl dq starch were also used for localizing hydrolytically active sites in the granules the objective of these experiments was to assess the location within the granule at which polymers from the bulk can be hydrolysed the procedure was based on the enzyme staining method described for activated sludge xia et al 2008b 2008a 2007 we modified the protocol to stain the biofilm instead of flocculent sludge substrate solutions of 100 mg l were prepared diluting the substrates in tris hcl buffer 10 mm ph 7 8 the substrate concentration and incubation time were chosen based on preliminary assays supplementary information table s1 granules were incubated with fluorescent substrates in 2 ml sample tubes eppendorf hamburg germany approximately 120 mg of fresh granules 5 mg tss were added to 500 µl of digestion buffer and 250 µl of substrate solution that rendered a substrate to sludge ratio of 5 µg substrate per g tss samples were incubated for two hours in the dark and with orbital shaking at 120 rpm fisherbrand seastar thermo fisher scientific waltham usa after incubation with fluorescent substrates the granules were transferred to freeze drying medium neg 50tm thermo fisher scientific waltham usa and stored at 4 c overnight protected from light then the granules were sectioned in a leica cm1900 cryostat leica microsystems nussloch germany the temperature of the blade and the sample holder was 22 c and the granules were sectioned in 20 µm thick coupes granule sections were spread on poly lysine coated slides and air dried in the dark finally the sections were examined using a zeiss axioplan 2 epifluorescence microscope zeiss oberkochen germany the fluorescent signals from the hydrolysed bodipy fl casein and bodipy fl dq starch were visualized and captured using a fluos filter excitation 485 nm emission 515 565 nm 2 4 2 distribution of hydrolytic enzymes throughout the granule a variation of the above described method was used to explore the distribution of enzymes throughout the granule fresh granules were sliced using a scalpel mounted in a microscope slide and incubated with the fluorogenic substrates the granule sections were covered with 10 µl of a 2 1 buffer substrate solution and incubated in the dark for 2 h then the substrate solution was replaced by digestion buffer and the slides were observed on the fluorescence microscope 2 5 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish after inspecting the activity staining the granule sections were fixed in ethanol 50 for 2 h ethanol fixing was used independently of the microbial group targeted by fish gram negative or gram positive as described in xia et al 2007 the following probes were used eubmix staining most bacteria a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 paomix targeting ca accumulibacter related

phylum chloroflexi and bac111 targeting activated sludge clones of the family saprospiraceae kong et al 2007 detailed information of all these probes is given in probebase loy et al 2003 all the probes were cy3 or cy5 labelled fish staining was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 samples were incubated for 2 h with the fish probes the stained slides were mounted with vectashield antifade mounting medium vector laboratories burlingame ca usa and inspected on the epifluorescence microscope the hybridised cells were visualized using the filters cy3 excitation 546 nm emission 575 640 nm and cy5 excitation 575 625 nm emission 660 710 nm 2 6 microbial diversity analysis three sludge samples were collected at different points of each of the studied reactors r1 r3 and r4 each of the triplicate samples was sieved separately using the same procedure as described in section 2 1 15 ml of the sieved granules roughly 300 mg tss of each size fraction were homogenized using a tissue grinder the homogenized samples were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min and approximately 2 mg tss of the resulting pellet were added to the extraction tubes dna was then extracted as described in toja ortega et al 2021b the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene were amplified and paired end sequenced in an llumina novaseq 6000 platform by novogene beijing china the primer set 341f 5 cctaygggrbgcascag 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 was used the raw reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra on bioproject prjna837281 the trimmed and merged sequences provided by novogene were processed using qiime2 version 2020 2 bolyen et al 2019 the sequences were quality filtered using deblur amir et al 2017 trimming the sequences the 3 end at position 237 parameter p trim length with the remaining sequences alpha and beta diversity metrics were generated and differences in diversity between granule sizes were assessed using permanova anderson 2001 a p value of 0 05 was used as cut off for significance finally taxonomic affiliation of the sequences was determined by aligning the sequences to the midas 3 6 database nierychlo et al 2020 sample subsetting visualization and further statistical analysis was performed in r using the phyloseq and ampvis2 packages andersen et al 2018 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 differences in the relative abundance of the 20 most abundant genera were studied performing a wald test the relative abundances in the smallest and largest granules were compared differences were considered significant with a p value below the bonferroni corrected p value of 0 05 p 0 05 number of comparisons 2 7 additional characterization of the granule fractions 2 7 1 pao activity the activity of pao was assessed in the four granule size fractions through batch tests the assay was performed in triplicate the granules which had been stored anaerobically overnight were acclimated by aerating for 35 min then they were crushed using a potter elvehjem tissue grinder and buffered with 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 5 the assays were conducted in 500 ml bottles with a final sludge concentration of approximately 3 g vss l sodium acetate was added to a final concentration of 170 mg cod l the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and flushed with n2 for two minutes to provide anaerobic conditions the samples were incubated for two hours in a fisherbrand seastar orbital shaker at 120 rpm taking samples regularly every 6 10 min samples were filtered using 0 45 µm pes syringe filters the acetate concentration of the samples was measured in a gas chromatographer equipped with an fid detector 7890a gc agilent technologies santa clara ca usa phosphate concentration was determined colorimetrically using the usepa method 365 1 in an aq400 discrete analyser seal analytical mequon wi usa the tss and vss concentration of the sludge solutions used in the assay were determined following standard methods apha 2005 2 7 2 settling tests the terminal settling velocity of granules was studied in a measuring cylinder with an internal diameter of 7 94 cm and a height of 42 1 cm filled with tap water granules were placed individually at the top of the cylinder and their settling was recorded using a camera gopro hero session 4 san mateo ca usa around 50 granules were examined per size fraction 2 7 3 granule biomass density measurements granule biomass density was measured using the modified dextran blue method as described in van den berg et al 2022 the density measurements were performed in 200 ml samples and each granule size fraction was measured in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule size effect on hydrolysis rate the hydrolysis capacity of different sized aerobic granules was studied using fluorescent protease and amylase assays biomass specific hydrolytic activity fluorescence δf g vss h was inversely proportional to granule diameter fig 1 this relationship can be explained by the changes in surface volume ratio with respect to granule diameter sa v d 1 for a perfect sphere the areal hydrolysis rate δf m2 h somewhat decreased with increasing granule size too fig 1 hence the smaller granules had a higher biomass specific hydrolytic activity supported mainly by their proportionally higher available surface area and enhanced by a higher activity per surface area according to these results the hydrolytic capacity that potentially could degrade influent particulates can be doubled by halving the average granule diameter in an ags reactor the different biomass specific rates indicated that hydrolysis was as described previously conditioned by mass transfer in wwtp garmerwolde crushed granules and flocs showed roughly twice as high hydrolytic activity as intact granules e g protease rates were 0 016 and 0 017 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 on crushed granules and flocs and 0 007 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 on intact granules toja ortega et al 2021a activated sludge studies using similar methods also generally reported higher hydrolysis rates than those measured in granules although hydrolysis rates differed between studies and plants up to two orders of magnitude e g protease activities reported in as range from 0 015 to 2 1 µmol product mg vss 1 h 1 frølund et al 1995 nybroe et al 1992 in this study too the available surface area determined the activity of the sludge and the hydrolysis rates increased upon granule crushing data not shown the starch and proteins used in the assays were soluble substrates the molecular weight of the labelled starch was lower than 1 kda and casein has a molecular weight of around 24 kda considering that the hydrolysis rate of even the small starch molecules was determined by the available granule surface area the same could be expected for larger substrates 3 2 hydrolysis sites and hydrolytic capacity distribution within granules 3 2 1 mass transfer limited hydrolysis of polymeric substrates occurs at the granule surface the sites of hydrolysis were microscopically visualized in granules incubated with fluorescent substrates intact granules were incubated for 2 h and cryosectioned afterwards fig 2 shows the micrographs of granules of 4 different sizes incubated with bodipy casein amylase assays rendered similar results which can be found in the supplementary information as well as additional protease images figs s3 s5 all the granule sizes revealed a hydrolytically active layer in the outer part of the granules the thickness of this layer varied depending on the zone of the granule and rarely reached further than the outer 100 µm of granule granule size did not appear to impact the thickness of the hydrolytically active layer protease active sites were generally arranged in a thin layer close to the surface of the granules within the outer 100 µm in some spots along the granule surface larger fluorescent patches could be observed which exceeded the 100 µm of depth those areas were generally more fluffy supplementary information fig s4 2 with protease staining it was seldom possible to distinguish individual stained cells but rather a cloudy background was observed as if hydrolysis products were distributed throughout the extracellular space for amylase on the contrary distinct cells were discernible even though a fluorescent background was observed too supplementary information fig s5 nevertheless the granule depth at which hydrolysis occurred was similar for both substrates 3 2 2 hydrolytic potential is also present deeper inside the granule the distribution of hydrolytic potential in granules was further inspected by eliminating mass transfer limitation that is slicing granules before incubating them with fluorescent substrates in order to expose the full sectional plane to the fluorescent substrate the result of these experiments differed for both substrates while proteases seemed to be distributed throughout the whole granule amylase activity was still restricted to the outer parts of the granules although in a thicker layer than when incubating intact granules fig 3 the activity distribution observed under the microscope related to the hydrolysis rates measured in crushed granules fig 3 when the granule structure was disrupted by crushing all the granule sizes had the same protease activity suggesting that the inner parts of the granules had similar hydrolytic capacities across granule sizes on the contrary the amylase activity of crushed granules decreased with granule size based on the microscopic observations this could be due to low or no amylase activity in the inner volume of granules and the larger proportion of such volume in larger granules the difference in protease and amylase enzyme distribution might be related to the distribution of different macromolecules in the granule matrix previous studies investigating the distribution of extracellular polymeric substances eps in lab grown ags reported that α polysaccharides were mainly present close to the granule surface adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 proteins on the other hand were distributed throughout the granule and the granule core was mainly composed of protein the distribution of proteins and polysaccharides in full scale granules was not studied yet but might be similar to the reported observations in lab grown granules the different distribution of proteases and amylases throughout the granules might reflect the distribution of their potential substrates proteins and alpha polysaccharides on the granule matrix in spite of these differences in granule wide distribution of protease and amylase activity the hydrolysis of both casein and starch in intact granules was restricted to the granule surface indicating that hydrolysis is mass transfer limited 3 2 3 microorganisms in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active layer microorganisms surrounding the hydrolytically active layer were identified by fish pao gao and putative starch and protein hydrolysers were targeted via fish probes gao and ca accumulibacter related pao were abundant in all granule sizes pao were most concentrated in the outer granule layers while gao were abundant in the core too these microorganisms were often intercalated with hydrolytically active cells fig 4 a the amylase staining was still visible after the fish hybridization procedure making it possible to identify some of the starch hydrolysing organisms some of the starch hydrolysers hybridized with the probe actino 221 targeting tetrasphaera specifically some of the filamentous starch hydrolysers fig 5 b arrows i some of the tetrasphaera members can hydrolyse starch and they are overall regarded as dominant glucose fermenters in ebpr plants nielsen et al 2012 xia et al 2008a despite some of the amylase stained cells were identified as tetrasphaera most of the starch hydrolysing organisms remained unidentified in general the abundance of tetrasphaera was high as in previous as and ags studies ali et al 2019 nguyen et al 2011 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 toja ortega et al 2021b since individual cells were seldom stained with protease substrates protein hydrolysing organisms could not be identified nevertheless it was possible to observe the microorganisms in the vicinity of the active protease sites phylum chloroflexi and family saprospiraceae were targeted as putative hydrolysers xia et al 2007 the probes targeting these taxa hybridized with a significant amount of organisms in the sludge some of the chloroflexi or saprospiraceae hybridized cells were located close to the hydrolysis sites however their distribution was not restricted to those sites and they were most abundant further from the granule surface therefore their relevance for protein hydrolysis could not be determined saprospiraceae were rod shaped often arranged in colonies and located mostly in the outer part of the granules chloroflexi were filamentous and widely distributed throughout the granules chloroflexi hybridized cells were specially abundant in the granule core where they might be subsisting on cell decay products and other recalcitrant compounds fig 4f kragelund et al 2007 interestingly the chloroflexi genus kouleothrix was identified by 16s as one of the abundant genera fig 5b this genus is considered a major indicator of bulking in as nittami et al 2017 however it did not seem to have detrimental effects on aerobic granules chloroflexi filaments did not result in filamentous outgrowths or irregular granule surfaces supplementary information fig s6 they rather constituted a filamentous network inside the granules fig 4e f a similar observation was made by de graaf et al 2020 who cultivated aerobic granules with a high abundance of the filamentous thiothrix the high proportion of filamentous organisms in the granules did not deteriorate granule morphology or cause operation issues showing that operating conditions rather than bacterial morphology determine granule stability de graaff et al 2020 this interpretation is supported by our observation of filamentous organisms thoroughly distributed in stable full scale granules 3 3 additional comparison of the different granule size fractions the microbial composition of granules of different sizes was compared based on 16s rrna amplicon sequencing results fig 5b shows the average abundance of the main 20 genera the abundances of the main microorganisms showed some variation between reactors for the composition per reactor check supplementary information fig s7 nevertheless the main genera were shared between all samples the microbial community composition differed significantly between the different granule size fractions when studying the bray curtis dissimilarity between samples one can appreciate that samples cluster according to granule size fig 5a the distance between samples grows with increasing granule size difference in all granule sizes the microorganisms targeted by fish were found in high relative abundance in ngs results however the differences in relative abundance between granule sizes were small an increase in ca competibacter and ca accumulibacter can be noticed with increasing granule size but the relative abundance differences are not significant p 0 05 number of comparisons the relative abundance of the family saprospiraceae did significantly increase from the largest to smallest granule sizes other genera that were at significantly higher concentrations in the smaller granules were the nitrifying nitrosomonas and nitrospira as described previously nguyen quoc et al 2021 to check other significant abundance differences on the most abundant microorganisms see supplementary information tables s8 1 and s8 2 activity batch tests revealed an increasing specific anaerobic acetate uptake and p release with increasing granule size table 1 the terminal settling velocity was also higher in the largest granules as expected due to their larger size liu et al 2008 van dijk et al 2020 table 1 these results are in agreement with the observations at garmerwolde wwtp and the hypothesis that the higher settling velocity of larger granules favours pao enrichment ali et al 2019 van dijk et al 2022 granule density decreased with increasing granule size which could be explained by a reduced substrate availability at the granule core due to diffusion limitation leading to biomass decay the large granules 4 mm older and with a larger core volume were the least dense in line with results reported by toh et al 2003 3 4 general discussion our results showed a similar distribution of hydrolytic activity in all the granules ranging from 0 5 to 4 8 mm from a full scale ags reactor all the granules had an active hydrolytic layer at their outer part and its thickness did not seem to depend on granule size the hydrolysis rates measured in the different sized granules also indicated that hydrolysis is largely surface area related this makes small granules more suitable to degrade polymeric substrates not because of a specific microbial community composition or higher enzyme concentration but mainly due to their high available surface area their activity was enhanced by a somewhat higher surface related activity although a significant trend could not be identified there was nonetheless microbial differentiation between granules of different sizes the microbial community of the granules shifted with the changes in granule size since most hydrolysers remained unidentified it was not possible to assess their abundance changes in the different size fractions the abundances of the pao ca accumulibacter and the gao ca competibacter did not differ significantly between granule size fractions nonetheless activity tests did show differences in acetate uptake and p release rates the largest granules exhibited higher acetate uptake and p release activities reflecting a higher ebpr activity this higher activity can be explained by the differences in substrate availability during full scale operation due to stratification during settling larger granules will be located closer to the influent inlet at the bottom of the reactor than the small granules van dijk et al 2020 2022 large granules thus spend most of the anaerobic period in contact with the influent while smaller granules are only in contact with the influent during the final stages of the feeding phase when the influent level reaches the upper part of the settled bed van dijk et al 2022 vfas are taken up at high rates and hence the position of granules in the sludge bed during feeding impacts their access to vfa significantly de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015a in this way anaerobic cod storage is promoted in granules at the bottom of the settled granule bed that is in the largest granules van dijk et al 2022 this may lead to pao and gao enrichment as previously reported by ali et al 2019 in the full scale ags from wwtp garmerwolde in contrast hydrolysis potential was similar yet surface bound across granule sizes one reason could be that the position of the granules in the settled bed has little effect on their interaction with polymeric substrates granule substrate interaction is greatly influenced by the size of the substrate and by mixing the majority of polymeric substrates in domestic wastewater are in the particulate form polymeric substrates can also be soluble and colloidal but these forms are generally less abundant in domestic wastewater likely due to biodegradation during transport in the sewer reported soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations in domestic wastewater range between 3 and 100 mg cod l and between 5 and 110 mg cod l respectively their particulate counterparts range between 3 and 161 mg cod l for proteins and between 5 and 200 mg cod l for carbohydrates narkis et al 1980 raunkjær et al 1994 ravndal et al 2018 toja ortega et al 2021a 2021b during plug flow feeding while soluble and colloidal substrates penetrate the granules easily particulates are trapped within the voids of the granule bed but their attachment to the biomass appears to be low layer et al 2020 ranzinger et al 2020 most of the particulate cod is thus likely resuspended in the aerobic phase where the reactor volume is fully mixed aeration creates a turbulent flow which promotes collision between granules and particulate substrates boltz and la motta 2006 layer et al 2020 layer et al 2020 reported a retention of 60 85 of the particulate cod in ags after 3 h of aeration hence the aerobic phase probably determines the biomass fraction particulates can attach to including both the granular and flocculent fractions that usually constitute the ags bed in this context the development of hydrolytic capacity would be driven by the interactions taking place during the aerobic phase where there is no sludge stratification and a large surface area is advantageous to enhance collision chances furthermore the synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes within the granule matrix might be triggered by compounds in the eps rather than by substrates in the bulk liquid studies on the eps composition of ags found proteins widespread through the granules and α polysaccharides only in the outer layers adav et al 2008 mcswain et al 2005 the granule wide distribution of hydrolytic activity determined in our study also showed protease activity all through the granule while amylase was restricted to the surface high protease activities have been measured previously in the granule core and related to eps turnover and biomass decay adav et al 2009 therefore the hydrolytic enzymes could be mainly degrading eps and cell decay components although they also allow granules to hydrolyse polymeric substrates from the influent at the surface of the ags or within the granules in case of diffusible polymers the combined fish and activity staining results showed that pao and gao localized close to the hydrolysis sites and they could potentially take up the hydrolysates generated during the anaerobic phase furthermore some of the actinobacterial pao tetrasphaera in this study could hydrolyse starch also suggesting that polysaccharides can be used for ebpr however the contribution of polymeric cod to ebpr remains a topic for further research evident from our study is that granule surface area will determine the potential of aerobic granules to degrade polymeric cod both aerobically and anaerobically if boosting the anaerobic uptake of polymeric cod is desired due to a wastewater with low vfa for example a smaller average granule size might be beneficial the length of the anaerobic phase could be regulated too to promote hydrolysis smaller granules will also increase nitrification rates and overall improve mass transfer nguyen quoc et al 2021 if on a different scenario there are enough vfa in the influent for effective ebpr larger granules might be preferred for an improved simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and a decreased degradation of polymeric substrates lower aerobic cod degradation would then decrease aeration costs and enhance the recovery of energy from the sludge spill guo et al 2020 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are 1 the stratification of the ags granule bed during feeding drives microbial differentiation in granules of different sizes based on their proximity to the influent inlet during feeding as a result large granules have higher acetate uptake rates reflecting their preferential access to influent vfa nevertheless this differentiation is not evident from the distribution of hydrolysis capacity all granule sizes exhibited a similar hydrolytic activity per surface area and thus the development of hydrolytic activity does not appear to be conditioned by the position of granules in the settled bed during feeding 2 hydrolysis of polymers occurred in the outer 50 100 µm of the granules paos and gaos were observed in the vicinity of the hydrolytically active granule sites but their anaerobic uptake of hydrolysates was not demonstrated and deserves further research 3 small granules returned higher specific hydrolysis rates due to their larger specific surface area thus small granules are preferred when anaerobic cod storage from polymeric substrates needs to be maximized however the hydrolysis kinetics of polymeric substrates should be studied further to evaluate how significantly these substrates can contribute to anaerobic cod storage in ags declaration of competing interest the authors declare

19926,enriching a biomass with a high fraction of polyhydroxyalkanoate storing organisms pha storers represents an essential step in the production of phas bioplastics from municipal wastewater using mixed microbial cultures a major challenge is however to create selective growth conditions that are favourable to pha storers our study thus investigates to what extent the influent cod to phosphorus cod p ratio can be used as a tool for the robust selection of pha storers in a single continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr therefore we operated five cstrs in parallel fed with synthetic wastewater 50 acetate 50 propionate with different cod p ratios 200 1000 gcod gp 1 and performed a detailed analysis of the microbial communities over long term 30 70 solid retention times our study demonstrates that efficient and robust selection of pha storers can be achieved in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios the selective advantage for pha storers increases with the influent cod p ratio but only if growth conditions remain limited by both c substrate and p in contrast selection performance deteriorates when cod p ratios are too high and growth conditions are limited by p only at an optimal cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers and dominated by pannonibacter sp was selected in the long term finally our results suggest that high cod p ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular p requirements explaining why different pha storers i e xanthobacter sp vs pannonibacter sp were selected depending on the influent cod p ratio i e 200 vs 800 gcod gp 1 overall our results provide relevant insights for the development of a new approach for selecting pha storers based on the use of a single cstr and control of the influent cod p ratio graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyhydroxyalkanoates phas dual carbon and phosphorus limitation growth conditions cellular phosphorus

of the manuscript 1 introduction the capture and side stream anaerobic treatment of organic carbon c combined with mainstream anammox for nitrogen n removal is a relevant treatment scheme for the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the future alloul et al 2018 in that context volatile fatty acids vfas produced via anaerobic fermentation of the organic c can be further upgraded into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas bioplastics an essential step in converting vfa rich feedstock into phas consists in enriching a biomass with pha storing organisms selection step while most wwtps are operated in continuous flow mode the selection of pha storing organisms pha storers has been primarily investigated in discontinuous systems i e in sequencing batch reactors sbr operated in an aerobic feast famine regime estevez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2011 valentino et al 2017 a key challenge is therefore to be able to successfully select pha storers in continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs as well in order to gain more scope in the production of bioplastic from municipal wastewater mww using mixed microbial cultures to date however the use of a simple cstr for the selection step has been hampered by our limited understanding of the environmental growth conditions that give a selective advantage to pha storers very few studies investigated the selection of pha storers in cstrs two cstrs connected in series allow to impose an aerobic feast famine regime on the biomass and ultimately to select pha storers albuquerque et al 2010a bengtsson et al 2008 such a system however creates a weaker selective pressure than an sbr since microbial competition is not only determined by the maximum rate of substrate uptake as in a sbr but also by substrate affinity marang et al 2015 paul et al 2020 another disadvantage of selecting pha storers by imposing feast famine conditions in a continuous system is the need for two reactors phosphorus p limitation however could be a promising tool for selecting pha storers in a single cstr p limiting conditions restrict the growth of heterotrophic bacteria while nutrient uptake capacity is maintained indeed while growth is highly dependent on the synthesis of p rich ribosomes and rnas the transmembrane proteins that control nutrient uptake in heterotrophic bacteria do not require p for their synthesis elser et al 2003 franklin et al 2011 p limiting conditions thus allow for excessive uptake of non limiting c the study of natural aquatic environments also suggests that accumulating excess c in form of intracellular storage compounds provides a competitive advantage to storing bacteria under p limiting conditions ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 further strains of lake bacteria isolated in laboratory on p poor media tended to accumulate c rich compounds as opposed to strains of lake bacteria isolated on p rich media godwin and cotner 2015 2018 if the ability to store c provides a selective advandage in p limited aquatic environments an important question is to what extent p limitation e g induced by high influent cod p ratios can be used in engineered systems to successfully select pha storers influent cod p ratios 270 gcod gp 1 i e 300 cmol pmol 1 hamper the selection of pha storers in aerobic feast famine sbrs korkakaki et al 2017 while dissolved cod p ratios in the effluent of fermenters treating primary sludge can be as high as 1000 gcod gp 1 derived from soares et al 2010 yet the use of high influent cod p ratios as a tool for selecting pha storers in a single cstr has not received much attention in the only previous study cavaille et al 2016 observed pha contents up to 80 weight percent wt while investigating how biomass responded to a stepwise increase of the influent cod p ratio 80 2850 cmol pmol 1 corresponding to 80 2950 gcod gp 1 as a function of solid retention time srt 0 1 2 days the authors noted that biomass pha content increased with the influent cod p ratio and that higher srts were needed to prevent washout at higher cod p ratios although the observations of cavaille et al 2016 suggest that high influent cod p ratios select slow growing pha storers in a single cstr additional evidence is required to better understand some key aspects of the selection process of particular interest are the relative abundance of pha storers in the biomass efficiency of selection and the stability of the pha storer community over the long term robustness of selection when using c substrates representative of mww derived feedstock cavaille et al 2016 studied a simplified selective environment as they worked with acetate as the only c substrate neglecting the fact that mww derived feedstock also contains large amounts of propionate bahreini et al 2020 brison et al 2022 ucisik and henze 2008 furthermore the above study did not examine to what extent the pha storer community increases and fluctuates in the long term when the influent cod p ratio is held constant yet this robustness aspect is crucial for pratical application aiming at steady bioplastics production to date the link between the influent cod p ratio and the selection of pha storers in a single cstr remains poorly understood primarily due to lack of detailed analysis of the microbial communities in such systems the present study therefore aims for the first time to understand the long term selection 30 70 srts of pha storers in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios through a detailed analysis of the selected microbial communities we therefore sought to answer the following questions i do high influent cod p ratios allow to select a biomass with a large and stable pha storer community in the long term and ii what is the link between influent cod p ratio resulting growth conditions and selection of pha storers to answer these questions synthetic wastewaters 50 acetate 50 propionate with different cod p ratios 200 1000 gcod gp 1 were fed to five cstrs running in parallel microbial communities biomass pha and p content as well as cod and po4 3 p removal were monitored over 30 to 70 srts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach and synthetic wastewater composition five reactors with a working volume of 11 l were operated in parallel as single stage cstrs and fed with synthetic wastewater cod p ratios of 200 400 600 800 and 1000 gcod gp 1 were applied to the five reactors respectively table 1 influent cod concentration was kept constant at 8 gcod l 1 the c substrate consisted of 50 acetate and 50 propionate cod basis acetate and propionate are often the most abundant vfas in feedstock derived from the fermentation of mww solids e g primary sludge sieved material and were therefore used as c substrates bahreini et al 2020 brison et al

in table 1 further the synthetic wastewater contained micro nutrients ca2 mg2 k so4 2 na cl and trace elements in excess as specified in si table a1 to prevent microbial growth in the influent the synthetic wastewater was prepared as two separate solutions one containing the c substrate and p species and micro nutrients and a second one containing the n species and trace elements 10 l stock solutions were prepared in 20 fold concentrations both stock solutions as well as distilled water for dilution were continuously fed to the reactors via three automated peristaltic pumps the stock solutions were renewed every two to three weeks while the reactor influent composition cod po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations was characterised 3 times a week to ensure a constant influent was maintained throughout the experiment also the reactors were cleaned once a week to prevent biofilm growth 2 2 operating conditions and detailed set up the different cstrs were operated at a srt of 1

definition of steady state this study focused on the long term effects of the influent cod p ratio on the selection of pha storers only the steady state period of each reactor was thus considered for the more detailed analysis of the microbial communities steady state was defined as the time period during which the microbial community composition was in a dynamic equilibrium i e where fluctuations were smallest and constant over time this time period was determined for each reactor using a robust mathematical approach at the order taxonomic level 1 a ruzicka dissimilarity matrix was computed expressing the dissimilarity between samples in terms of microbial community composition with a coefficient between 0 identical and 1 highest dissimilarity possible si tables a2 a6 2 an average dissimilarity coefficient was computed for each sample with respect to all subsequent samples the average dissimilarity coefficient of the different samples was then plotted over time figs si a1 a5 steady state was visually defined as the time period where the average dissimilarity coefficient was not trending over time indicating that the microbial communities were in a dynamic equilibrium the absence of a trend during the selected steady state period was confirmed with a mann kendall test 3 the steady state period selected based on the ruzicka dissimilarity matrix was further validated with a pca analysis by considering the sample clusters formed on the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 fig si a6 the definition of steady state was done at the order taxonomic level for the following reasons i more aggregated taxonomic levels phylum class did not allow to define a clear temporal evolution of the microbial community in each reactor ii at lower taxonomic levels the microbial community in certain reactors hardly stabilized at all the duration to reach steady state as defined by the above criteria ranged from 7 to 40 days depending on the cod p ratios si fig a6 2 3 5 identification of pha storers during steady state microbial community analysis was performed at the genus taxonomic level as at least such level of detail was required to verify whether individual bacterial taxa were potential pha storers to this end we conducted a detailed literature survey on 19 genera that were most abundant average relative abundance 2 in at least one of the reactors during steady state and covered on average 83 10 83 9 92 2 98 2 and 94 3 of the sequences in the cod p 200 1000 reactors respectively si table a7 information were obtained from bergey s manual of systematics of archea and bacteria https onlinelibrary wiley com doi book 10 1002 9781118960608 and or publications reporting a specific genus species with pha storage function a genus was considered a known pha storer when i literature clearly indicated that pha storage was a common trait to all species of that genus or when ii affiliation at the species taxonomic level polished with the midas blast tool allowed confirming that most sequences affiliated to that genus belonged to known pha storers in contrast a genus was considered a putative pha storer when at least two of its species were clearly identified as pha storers in the literature but taxonomic affiliation at the species level in our study did not allow to clearly confirm the ability of the corresponding taxa to store pha when estimating the relative abundance of pha storers in the selected microbial communities both the known and the putative pha storers were considered 2 4 calculations average values for biomass p content biomass pha content substrate to active biomass conversion yield and substrate to pha conversion yields were calculated for the steady state period only the p content of the pha free biomass allows to estimate the cellular p requirements of the selected active biomass under the assumption that no other solids than active cells and pha are formed cavaille et al 2016 korkakaki et al 2017 the p

were monitored in the different reactors throughout the experiment fig 1 the relative abundance of pha storers increased with the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 but then decreased when the cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 fig 2 a also the relative abundance of pha storers as well as the overall microbial community composition were much more stable over time in the cod p 600 and 800 reactors as compared to the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors fig 2a b the two most abundant genera across the different reactors pannonibacter and xanthobacter were confirmed to be known pha storers fig 3 concerning xanthobacter pha storage is a genus wide feature wiegel 2015 concerning the pannonibacter sp found in the different reactors 87 100 of the sequences were on average affiliated to pannonibacter phragmitetus which is a known pha storer si table a7 borsodi et al 2003 ray et al 2016 also pannonibacter sp are generally known to store pha xi et al 2018 aside from xanthobacter and pannonibacter being confirmed as known pha storers another 7 out of the 19 most abundant genera were identified as putative pha storers fig 3 the average relative abundance of pha storers was quantified and found to be highest in the cod p 800 reactor 94 including 1 putative storers followed by the cod p 600 reactor 81 including 5 putative storers fig 2a lower average relative abundancies of pha storers were observed at low cod p ratios of 200 54 including 9 putative storers and 400 gcod p 1 62 including 17 putative storers or at a very high cod p ratio of 1000 gcod p 1 57 including 36 putative storers further the relative abundance of pha storers was most stable in the cod p 600 and 800 reactors with coefficients of variation of 4 in contrast much larger variations of the relative abundance of pha storers were observed in the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors with coefficients of variation of 43 24 and 25 respectively the influent cod p ratio also influenced the composition of the pha storer community fig 3 xanthobacter sp were the most abundant pha storers at a low cod p ratio of 200 gcod gp 1 but pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus outcompeted xanthobacter sp as the influent cod p ratio increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 the relative abundance of xanthobacter sp decreased from 44 34 to 15 5 while the relative abundance of pannonibacter sp continuously increased from 1 1 up to 78 6 as the influent cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 the relative abundance of both pannonibacter sp and xanthobacter sp decreased down to 19 12 and 2 3 respectively while in turn the putative pha storer achromobacter sp proliferated 18 6 of the sequences 3 2 how does the influent cod p ratio affect the biomass ip the biomass ip was measured throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 4 a si a8 in general the higher the influent cod p ratio the lower the biomass ip fig 4a a reference ip value of 14 mgp gpcodpha free 1 can be assumed for bacterial cells when phosphorus is in excess tchobanoglous et al 2013 a cod p ratio of 200 gcod gp 1 resulted in a similar biomass ip with an average value of 13 8 1 1 mgp gpcodpha free 1 the biomass ip then gradually decreased to 7 9 1 6 5 4 0 5 and 4 0 0 3 mgp gpcodpha free 1 at cod p ratios of 400 600 and 800 gcod gp 1 respectively in the cod p 1000 reactor the biomass ip 3 9 0 9 mgp gpcodpha free 1 did not further diminish compared to the cod p 800 reactor in all reactors the reduction of the biomass ip relative to a baseline of 14 mgp gpcodpha free 1 occurred within the first day of the experiment si fig a8 3 3 how does the influent cod p ratio affect the pha storage response pha content pha composition and substrate conversion yields were measured throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 4b si a9 overall higher influent cod p ratios lead to a higher biomass pha content fig 4b the average pha content was highest in the cod p 800 reactor 0 36 0 05 gcodpha gpcod 1 followed by the cod p 1000 reactor 0 27 0 09 gcodpha gpcod 1 and lowest in the cod p 200 reactor 0 06 0 01 gcodpha gpcod 1 the cod p 400 and 600 reactors had intermediary pha contents of 0 16 0 09 and 0 18 0 04 gcodpha gpcod 1 respectively furthermore the more stable the pha storer community the more stable the pha storage response the biomass pha content was therefore most stable in the cod p 800 and 600 reactors with coefficients of variation of 15 and 22 respectively in contrast the greatest variations of pha content were observed in the cod p 400 and 1000 reactors coefficients of variation of 57 and 36 respectively in all reactors the biomass started to store pha within the first 5 days of the experiment well before the microbial community reached a dynamic equilibrium si fig a9 overall the monomeric composition of phas was similar in all reactors with primarily 3hb small amounts of 3hv and negligible amounts of 3h2mb and 3h2mv below limit of quantification high fractions of 3hv up to 50 of the pha content were observed only for the cod p 400 reactor and occurred in parallel with sudden peaks of pha content si fig a9 ultimately the influent cod p ratio also dictated to what extent c substrate was utilized for the production of active biomass or for pha storage active biomass yields were lowest in the cod p 800 and 600 reactors with 0 30 0 03 and 0 31 0 04 gpcodpha free gcodremoved 1 respectively higher active biomass yields were observed in the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors with 0 36 0 07 0 35 0 04 and 0 34 0 07 gpcodpha free gcodremoved 1 respectively similarily than for the pha content pha yield was highest in the cod p 800 reactor 0 18 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 followed by the cod p 1000 reactor 0 13 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 while it was lowest in the cod p 200 reactor 0 02 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 intermediary pha yields were found for the cod p 400 and 600 reactors 0 07 0 04 and 0 07 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 respectively 3 4 how does the influent cod p ratio affect cod and po4 3 p removal cod and po4 3 p removal performances were monitored throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 5 si a10 full and stable cod removal 95 was achieved in the cod p 200 800 reactors on the contrary cod removal in the cod p 1000 reactor was unstable and fluctuated between 60 and 90 during the entire experiment also the period to reach full cod removal gradually increased from 1 day in the cod p 200 reactor to 20 days in the cod p 800 reactor however full cod removal when occuring was always achieved before the microbial community reached a dynamic equilibrium in all reactors complete and stable po4 3 p removal occurred throughout the entire duration of the experiment si fig a10 3 5 what is the link between influent cod p ratio selection of pha storers biomass ip and pha content the results of the microbial community analysis were finally related to biomass ip and pha content to gain further insight into the underlying relationships fig 6 the selection of pha storers increased with the influent cod p ratio between 200 and 800 gcod gp 1 and coincided with increasing pha storage reduction of the biomass ip and full cod removal as the cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 selection and cod removal performances deteriorated while further reduction of the biomass ip was not observed the influent cod p ratio also governed the composition of the selected pha storer community in particular the competition between gen xanthobacter gen pannonibacter and gen achromobacter on a more global scale a loss in overall microbial diversity was observed in parallel to the reduction of the biomass ip for influent cod p ratios 600 gcod gp 1 si fig a11 4 discussion 4 1 high cod p ratios allow to successfully select pha storers in a single cstr an efficient and robust selection process is characterised by a biomass with high and stable pha storage capacity the pha storage capacity of a biomass in turn depends on both the relative abundance and the type of pha storers within the selected microbial community an important question is then to what extent a single cstr can be i efficient in terms of selecting a microbial community with a high relative abundance of pha storers while being ii robust in terms of maintaining a large and stable pha storer community in the long term our results demonstrate a stable microbial community consisting of more than 90 pha storers can be successfully selected at a cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 over a period of several weeks fig 2a b those results support the initial evidence by cavaille et al 2016 that pha storers can be selected in a cstr at high cod p ratios up to 2950 gcod gp 1 and at different srts 0 1 2 days at similar operating conditions than in our study cod p ratio of 700 gcod gp 1 srt 1 day cavaille et al 2016 also estimated the relative abundance of pha storers at 90 based on the analysis of a limited number of biomass samples the present study and the work of cavaille et al 2016 thus demonstrate that a single cstr is as efficient in selecting pha storers as the state of the art sbr aerobic feast famine approach where for similar c substrates the relative abundance of pha storers ranges typically between 70 and 95 albuquerque et al 2013 2010b lemos et al 2008 wang et al 2017 furthermore for the first time our study provides insights about the robustness of the selection process in a cstr using the example of the cod p 800 reactor first we show that a high relative abundance of pha storers 90 can be steadily maintained over at least 30 srts figs 1 2a second the microbial community that developed in the reactor was constantly dominated by the same pha storers pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus 78 6 and xanthobacter sp 15 5 borsodi et al 2003 ray et al 2016 wiegel 2015 indicating a stable pha storer community developed over time fig 1 si table a7 a stable pha storer community in turn translates into a stable pha storage capacity implying a robust selection process such robustness is essential for scaling up pha production using mww derived feedstock however the maximum pha storage capacity of the produced biomass ultimately depends on the type of pha storers selected an important question is therefore to what extent different pha storers are selected in the single stage cstr i depending on the c substrate and ii compared to the sbr approach pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus 78 6 followed by xanthobacter sp 15 5 were the dominant pha storers selected on a synthetic wastewater composed of 50 acetate propionate with a cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 fig 3 different pha storers were selected by cavaille et al 2016 despite rather similar operating conditions ph temperature cod p ratio and srt while working with acetate as the sole c source acidovorax sp brevundimonas sp and brachymonas sp both brevundimonas sp and brachymonas sp are known to poorly grow on propionate hiraishi 2015 vancanneyt et al 2015 which could explain why brevundimonas sp were washed out over time in our experiments e g in the cod p 800 reactor fig 1 the potential influence of the c substrate composition on the competition among pha storers highlights the importance of working with vfa mixtures that are relevant for practice since the type of pha storers selected ultimately defines the maximum pha storage capacity of the biomass the fermentation of mww derived solids primary or activated sludge typically yields a complex mixture of vfas where both acetate and propionate are major constituents together accounting for 70 90 of the vfas with the remainder consisting of iso butyrate and iso valerate brison et al 2022 da ros et al 2020 ucisik and henze 2008 working with a single c substrate e g acetate only thus creates an oversimplified selective environment poorly representative of real conditions in contrast the 50 acetate propionate mix used in our study is more representative of the vfa mixture obtained from the fermentation of real mww our results further suggest that for a similar c source the cstr approach selects different pha storers than the sbr approach in sbr systems fed with acetate propionate rich feeds the dominant pha storers typically belong to one of the following genera zooglea thauera azoarcus amaricoccus plasticicumulans and paracoccus albuquerque et al 2013 2010b janarthanan et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 lemos et al 2008 morgan sagastume 2016 wang et al 2017 none of these sbr typical pha storers dominated the microbial communities in our cstr system despite paracoccus sp and thauera sp being present in our inoculum this indicates that either the high influent cod p ratio or the associated lack of a substrate gradient or a combination of both provided a competitive advantage to other pha storers such as pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus and xanthobacter sp interestingly pannonibacter sp and xanthobacter sp were less abundant than paracoccus sp and thauera sp at the beginning of the experiments but successfully outcompeted them under the growth conditions in our cstr system si table a8 fig 3 korkakaki et al 2017 observed how xanthobacter sp outcompeted plasticicumulans sp in an sbr as they doubled the influent cod p ratio 150 to 300 molc molp 1 corresponding to 140 to 270 gcod gp 1 on the other side cavaille et al 2016 observed that the sbr typical zooglea sp dominated the microbial community in a cstr in absence of a substrate gradient but only at rather low cod p ratios 170 300 gcod gp 1 we thus hypothesize the high influent cod p ratio rather than the absence of a substrate gradient is responsible for the selection of different pha storers with the cstr approach compared to the sbr approach which is typically operated under nutrient excess i e very low cod n p ratios valentino et al 2017 since different pha storers are selected with both approaches future research should be directed towards investigating the maximum pha storage capacity of biomass selected with the cstr approach a key aspect not covered by our study 4 2 growth conditions and potential mechanisms behind the selection of pha storers our results also clearly demonstrate that both efficiency and robustness of the selection process increase with the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 but then deteriorate when the ratio is further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 fig 2a if too high influent cod p ratios mitigate selection performance it is important to discuss the specific growth conditions under which pha storers have a selective advantage in the present study influent cod p ratios between 200 and 800 gcod gp 1 resulted in completely different growth conditions in the cstrs than an influent cod p ratio of 1000 gcod gp 1 both po4 3 p and cod were fully consumed in the cod p 200 800 reactors whereas only partial cod removal was observed in the cod p 1000 reactor figs 5 si a10 consequently the growth environment in the cod p 1000 reactor was characterized by an excess of c substrate while p remained limiting on the contrary the environments in the cod p 200 800 reactors were constantly depleted of both c substrate and p growth conditions where two nutrients are fully consumed at the same time have been described previously and referred to as dual nutrient limited durner et al 2000 egli 1991 grazerlampart et al 1986 zinn et al 2004 a conceptual summary of our results reveals that the selection of pha storers improved together with an increasing influent cod p ratio only as long as dual nutrient limited conditions were maintained fig 7 an important question is then i what mechanisms are involved in the selection of pha storers and ii to what extent those mechanisms explain the existence of dual c substrate and p limited conditions over a certain range of influent cod p ratios an increase in pha storage and a reduction in biomass ip occurred simultaneously with the selection of pha storers under dual c substrate and p limited conditions figs 6 7 cavaille et al 2016 we hypothesize those two mechanisms pha storage and reduction of biomass ip were directly involved in the selection of pha storers when influent cod p ratios increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 under p limited conditions increasing cell size and surface via storage of non limiting c substrate might help microorganisms to maintain a high diffusive transport across the cell membrane and ultimately to maximize their affinity towards the limiting p ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 the growth conditions in the cod p 200 800 reactors were by definition dual c substrate and p limited however as the cod p ratios increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 less and less p was available for the formation of new cells such growth limitation typically results in more c substrate being directed towards pha synthesis in pha storers cavaille et al 2016 2013 explaining the higher pha yields and lower active biomass yields in the cod p 800 reactor 0 18 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 compared to the cod p 200 reactor 0 02 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 increased pha storage might in turn have allowed pha storers to increase their size and thus their affinity towards p which could have ultimately helped them outcompete non storing organisms this potential pha storage related mechanism would however not explain the decreasing biomass ip p content of pha free active biomass figs 6 7 cavaille et al 2016 hypothesized that reduction of biomass ip as a response to increasing cod p ratios is due to the ability of the same microorganisms to adjust their cellular c p ratio to ensure cell division plasticity towards p our results however suggest that reduction of the biomass ip actually resulted from the selection of different microorganisms with low cellular p requirements rather than plasticity towards p in the cod p 800 reactor the biomass ip was as low as 4 mgp gpcodpha free 1 while pannonibacter sp accounted for 80 of the microbial community indicating pannonibacter sp have low p requirements furthermore increasing the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 caused a three fold decrease of the biomass ip while microorganisms with low p requirements such as pannonibacter sp gradually outcompeted microorganisms that coincided with high biomass ip such as xanthobacter sp figs 3 6 this shift in microbial community composition associated with a decrease of the biomass ip is consistent with previous observations suggesting that low cellular p requirements provide a selective advantage when influent cod p ratios are high godwin and cotner 2015 overall we hypothesize that under dual c substrate and p limited conditions i the ability to store pha drives competition between pha storers and non storers while ii the difference in cellular p requirements between microorganisms governs competition among pha storers e g pannonibacter sp vs xanthobacter sp no further reduction of the biomass ip was observed when the cod p ratio was increased from 800 to 1000 gcod gp 1 although very different microbial communities were selected figs 2b 6 these results indicate that the potential of a mixed culture to reduce its biomass ip via selection of microorganisms with low cellular p requirements is limited the data also show that growth conditions change from dual c substrate and p limited to p limited once this potential is exhausted fig 7 thus the extent to which a mixed culture can reduce its biomass ip by selecting microorganisms with low cellular p requirements ultimately defines the range of influent cod p ratios that will result in full removal of c substrate and thus dual c substrate and p limited conditions a main contribution of our study lies in identifying that selection of pha storers requires dual c substrate and p limited conditions combined with high influent cod p ratios also a conceptual summary is proposed fig 7 based on which future research activities could be directed including i confirming that cell size increase via pha storage is a key mechanism in the competition between pha storers and non storers as well as ii understanding why the selective advantage of pha storers is lost under solely p limited conditions finally the highest influent cod p ratio at which dual c substrate and p limited conditions are maintained varies with operating conditions such as the srt the larger the srt the higher the cod p ratio under which dual nutrient limited conditions can be maintained cavaille et al 2016 therefore observed dual c substrate and p limited conditions for cod p ratios up to 2000 gcod gp 1 at an srt of 2 days while at an srt of 0 2 days cod p ratios as low as 300 gcod gp 1 were the limit for dual nutrient limited growth the same authors also observed that the pha storage capacity of the selected biomass increased with the cod p ratio 80 2850 cmol pmol 1 corresponding to 80 2950 gcod gp 1 and the srt 0 1 2 days an increasing srt is however associated with decreasing biomass production substrate to biomass conversion yields further research should be directed towards better understanding the growth of pannonibacter phragmitetus under dual c substrate and p limited conditions in order to identify which operating conditions cod p ratio srt etc allow to maximize both the selective advantage for that pha storer and biomass production 4 3 practical implications we demonstrate a microbial community dominated by pha storers can be successfully selected in a single cstr fed with high influent cod p ratios implementing such an approach in practice demands controlling the influent cod p ratio reliable control of the influent cod p ratio in turn requires online monitoring and chemical adjustment of the phosphorus concentration when needed since the cod p ratios of mww derived feedstock range between 30 and 1000 gcod gp 1 brison et al 2022 da ros et al 2020 soares et al 2010 precipitation of po4 3 p might be required upfront the selection reactor chemical precipitation of po4 3 p via metal salts iron alum calcite lime etc can be easily implemented and has been widely applied in wastewater treatment over the past decades de bashan and bashan 2004 the more challenging step in controlling the influent cod p ratio will be the online monitoring of dissolved cod and po4 3 p required to ensure the correct dosage of metal salts to the precipitation tank monitoring dissolved cod in the range of several 1000 mg l 1 typical for mww derived feedstock requires the use of uv vis spectrometry based sensors e g s can sensors langergraber et al 2004 while online monitoring of po4 3 p can be done with ion selective sensors e g based on molecular imprinted polymer or colorimetric analyzers cornelissen et al 2018 warwick et al 2014 overall implementing a functioning control of the influent cod p ratio should not represent a critical technical bottleneck to the cstr approach furthermore the use of high influent cod p ratios to valorize organic c in form of phas has the advantage of simultaneously encouraging plant operators to also remove p another key nutrient in mww that needs to be recovered and cycled back into society desmidt et al 2015 finally one must be careful when discussing the relevance of using a single cstr for the production of phas selection and accumulation as opposed to using the state of the art sbr aerobic feast famine a proper evaluation of the cstr would require a global comparison to the sbr including a detailed evaluation of both the selection storage capacity of the selected biomass substrate to biomass conversion yields robustness over time and accumulation performances using the same real mww derived feedstock 5 conclusions 1 efficient and robust selection of pha storers can be achieved in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers and dominated by pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus was selected in the long term at an optimal influent cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 2 the selective advantage of pha storers over non storing microorganisms increases with the influent cod p ratio only as long as dual c substrate and p limited conditions prevail in the system cod p ratios 200 800 gcod gp 1 indeed the selection performance deteriorates when the influent cod p ratio is too high 1000 gcod gp 1 and growth conditions become p limited only 3 increased pha storage and reduction of biomass ip were observed to accompany selection of pha storers in dual c substrate and p limited environments first we hypothesize pha storage provides a selective advantage by increasing cell size and surface ultimately allowing for a higher diffusive uptake of limiting p second we demonstrate high cod p ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular p requirements explaining why different pha storers were selected depending on the influent cod p ratio e g pannonibacter sp vs xanthobacter sp 4 overall a novel approach based on a single cstr and

19926,enriching a biomass with a high fraction of polyhydroxyalkanoate storing organisms pha storers represents an essential step in the production of phas bioplastics from municipal wastewater using mixed microbial cultures a major challenge is however to create selective growth conditions that are favourable to pha storers our study thus investigates to what extent the influent cod to phosphorus cod p ratio can be used as a tool for the robust selection of pha storers in a single continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr therefore we operated five cstrs in parallel fed with synthetic wastewater 50 acetate 50 propionate with different cod p ratios 200 1000 gcod gp 1 and performed a detailed analysis of the microbial communities over long term 30 70 solid retention times our study demonstrates that efficient and robust selection of pha storers can be achieved in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios the selective advantage for pha storers increases with the influent cod p ratio but only if growth conditions remain limited by both c substrate and p in contrast selection performance deteriorates when cod p ratios are too high and growth conditions are limited by p only at an optimal cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers and dominated by pannonibacter sp was selected in the long term finally our results suggest that high cod p ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular p requirements explaining why different pha storers i e xanthobacter sp vs pannonibacter sp were selected depending on the influent cod p ratio i e 200 vs 800 gcod gp 1 overall our results provide relevant insights for the development of a new approach for selecting pha storers based on the use of a single cstr and

of the manuscript 1 introduction the capture and side stream anaerobic treatment of organic carbon c combined with mainstream anammox for nitrogen n removal is a relevant treatment scheme for the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the future alloul et al 2018 in that context volatile fatty acids vfas produced via anaerobic fermentation of the organic c can be further upgraded into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas bioplastics an essential step in converting vfa rich feedstock into phas consists in enriching a biomass with pha storing organisms selection step while most wwtps are operated in continuous flow mode the selection of pha storing organisms pha storers has been primarily investigated in discontinuous systems i e in sequencing batch reactors sbr operated in an aerobic feast famine regime estevez alonso et al 2021 reis et al 2011 valentino et al 2017 a key challenge is therefore to be able to successfully select pha storers in continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs as well in order to gain more scope in the production of bioplastic from municipal wastewater mww using mixed microbial cultures to date however the use of a simple cstr for the selection step has been hampered by our limited understanding of the environmental growth conditions that give a selective advantage to pha storers very few studies investigated the selection of pha storers in cstrs two cstrs connected in series allow to impose an aerobic feast famine regime on the biomass and ultimately to select pha storers albuquerque et al 2010a bengtsson et al 2008 such a system however creates a weaker selective pressure than an sbr since microbial competition is not only determined by the maximum rate of substrate uptake as in a sbr but also by substrate affinity marang et al 2015 paul et al 2020 another disadvantage of selecting pha storers by imposing feast famine conditions in a continuous system is the need for two reactors phosphorus p limitation however could be a promising tool for selecting pha storers in a single cstr p limiting conditions restrict the growth of heterotrophic bacteria while nutrient uptake capacity is maintained indeed while growth is highly dependent on the synthesis of p rich ribosomes and rnas the transmembrane proteins that control nutrient uptake in heterotrophic bacteria do not require p for their synthesis elser et al 2003 franklin et al 2011 p limiting conditions thus allow for excessive uptake of non limiting c the study of natural aquatic environments also suggests that accumulating excess c in form of intracellular storage compounds provides a competitive advantage to storing bacteria under p limiting conditions ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 further strains of lake bacteria isolated in laboratory on p poor media tended to accumulate c rich compounds as opposed to strains of lake bacteria isolated on p rich media godwin and cotner 2015 2018 if the ability to store c provides a selective advandage in p limited aquatic environments an important question is to what extent p limitation e g induced by high influent cod p ratios can be used in engineered systems to successfully select pha storers influent cod p ratios 270 gcod gp 1 i e 300 cmol pmol 1 hamper the selection of pha storers in aerobic feast famine sbrs korkakaki et al 2017 while dissolved cod p ratios in the effluent of fermenters treating primary sludge can be as high as 1000 gcod gp 1 derived from soares et al 2010 yet the use of high influent cod p ratios as a tool for selecting pha storers in a single cstr has not received much attention in the only previous study cavaille et al 2016 observed pha contents up to 80 weight percent wt while investigating how biomass responded to a stepwise increase of the influent cod p ratio 80 2850 cmol pmol 1 corresponding to 80 2950 gcod gp 1 as a function of solid retention time srt 0 1 2 days the authors noted that biomass pha content increased with the influent cod p ratio and that higher srts were needed to prevent washout at higher cod p ratios although the observations of cavaille et al 2016 suggest that high influent cod p ratios select slow growing pha storers in a single cstr additional evidence is required to better understand some key aspects of the selection process of particular interest are the relative abundance of pha storers in the biomass efficiency of selection and the stability of the pha storer community over the long term robustness of selection when using c substrates representative of mww derived feedstock cavaille et al 2016 studied a simplified selective environment as they worked with acetate as the only c substrate neglecting the fact that mww derived feedstock also contains large amounts of propionate bahreini et al 2020 brison et al 2022 ucisik and henze 2008 furthermore the above study did not examine to what extent the pha storer community increases and fluctuates in the long term when the influent cod p ratio is held constant yet this robustness aspect is crucial for pratical application aiming at steady bioplastics production to date the link between the influent cod p ratio and the selection of pha storers in a single cstr remains poorly understood primarily due to lack of detailed analysis of the microbial communities in such systems the present study therefore aims for the first time to understand the long term selection 30 70 srts of pha storers in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios through a detailed analysis of the selected microbial communities we therefore sought to answer the following questions i do high influent cod p ratios allow to select a biomass with a large and stable pha storer community in the long term and ii what is the link between influent cod p ratio resulting growth conditions and selection of pha storers to answer these questions synthetic wastewaters 50 acetate 50 propionate with different cod p ratios 200 1000 gcod gp 1 were fed to five cstrs running in parallel microbial communities biomass pha and p content as well as cod and po4 3 p removal were monitored over 30 to 70 srts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental approach and synthetic wastewater composition five reactors with a working volume of 11 l were operated in parallel as single stage cstrs and fed with synthetic wastewater cod p ratios of 200 400 600 800 and 1000 gcod gp 1 were applied to the five reactors respectively table 1 influent cod concentration was kept constant at 8 gcod l 1 the c substrate consisted of 50 acetate and 50 propionate cod basis acetate and propionate are often the most abundant vfas in feedstock derived from the fermentation of mww solids e g primary sludge sieved material and were therefore used as c substrates bahreini et al 2020 brison et al

in table 1 further the synthetic wastewater contained micro nutrients ca2 mg2 k so4 2 na cl and trace elements in excess as specified in si table a1 to prevent microbial growth in the influent the synthetic wastewater was prepared as two separate solutions one containing the c substrate and p species and micro nutrients and a second one containing the n species and trace elements 10 l stock solutions were prepared in 20 fold concentrations both stock solutions as well as distilled water for dilution were continuously fed to the reactors via three automated peristaltic pumps the stock solutions were renewed every two to three weeks while the reactor influent composition cod po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations was characterised 3 times a week to ensure a constant influent was maintained throughout the experiment also the reactors were cleaned once a week to prevent biofilm growth 2 2 operating conditions and detailed set up the different cstrs were operated at a srt of 1

definition of steady state this study focused on the long term effects of the influent cod p ratio on the selection of pha storers only the steady state period of each reactor was thus considered for the more detailed analysis of the microbial communities steady state was defined as the time period during which the microbial community composition was in a dynamic equilibrium i e where fluctuations were smallest and constant over time this time period was determined for each reactor using a robust mathematical approach at the order taxonomic level 1 a ruzicka dissimilarity matrix was computed expressing the dissimilarity between samples in terms of microbial community composition with a coefficient between 0 identical and 1 highest dissimilarity possible si tables a2 a6 2 an average dissimilarity coefficient was computed for each sample with respect to all subsequent samples the average dissimilarity coefficient of the different samples was then plotted over time figs si a1 a5 steady state was visually defined as the time period where the average dissimilarity coefficient was not trending over time indicating that the microbial communities were in a dynamic equilibrium the absence of a trend during the selected steady state period was confirmed with a mann kendall test 3 the steady state period selected based on the ruzicka dissimilarity matrix was further validated with a pca analysis by considering the sample clusters formed on the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 fig si a6 the definition of steady state was done at the order taxonomic level for the following reasons i more aggregated taxonomic levels phylum class did not allow to define a clear temporal evolution of the microbial community in each reactor ii at lower taxonomic levels the microbial community in certain reactors hardly stabilized at all the duration to reach steady state as defined by the above criteria ranged from 7 to 40 days depending on the cod p ratios si fig a6 2 3 5 identification of pha storers during steady state microbial community analysis was performed at the genus taxonomic level as at least such level of detail was required to verify whether individual bacterial taxa were potential pha storers to this end we conducted a detailed literature survey on 19 genera that were most abundant average relative abundance 2 in at least one of the reactors during steady state and covered on average 83 10 83 9 92 2 98 2 and 94 3 of the sequences in the cod p 200 1000 reactors respectively si table a7 information were obtained from bergey s manual of systematics

storer when i literature clearly indicated that pha storage was a common trait to all species of that genus or when ii affiliation at the species taxonomic level polished with the midas blast tool allowed confirming that most sequences affiliated to that genus belonged to known pha storers in contrast a genus was considered a putative pha storer when at least two of its species were clearly identified as pha storers in the literature but taxonomic affiliation at the species level in our study did not allow to clearly confirm the ability of the corresponding taxa to store pha when estimating the relative abundance of pha storers in the selected microbial communities both the known and the putative pha storers were considered 2 4 calculations average values for biomass p content biomass pha content substrate to active biomass conversion yield and substrate to pha conversion yields were calculated for the steady state period only the p content of the pha free biomass allows to estimate the cellular p requirements of the selected active biomass under the assumption that no other solids than active cells and pha are formed cavaille et al 2016 korkakaki et al 2017 the p

were monitored in the different reactors throughout the experiment fig 1 the relative abundance of pha storers increased with the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 but then decreased when the cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 fig 2 a also the relative abundance of pha storers as well as the overall microbial community composition were much more stable over time in the cod p 600 and 800 reactors as compared to the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors fig 2a b the two most abundant genera across the different reactors pannonibacter and xanthobacter were confirmed to be known pha storers fig 3 concerning xanthobacter pha storage is a genus wide feature wiegel 2015 concerning the pannonibacter sp found in the different reactors 87 100 of the sequences were on average affiliated to pannonibacter phragmitetus which is a known pha storer si table a7 borsodi et al 2003 ray et al 2016 also pannonibacter sp are generally known to store pha xi et al 2018 aside from xanthobacter and pannonibacter being confirmed as known pha storers another 7 out of the 19 most abundant genera were identified as putative pha storers fig 3 the average relative abundance of pha storers was quantified and found to be highest in the cod p 800 reactor 94 including 1 putative storers followed by the cod p 600 reactor 81 including 5 putative storers fig 2a lower average relative abundancies of pha storers were observed at low cod p ratios of 200 54 including 9 putative storers and 400 gcod p 1 62 including 17 putative storers or at a very high cod p ratio of 1000 gcod p 1 57 including 36 putative storers further the relative abundance of pha storers was most stable in the cod p 600 and 800 reactors with coefficients of variation of 4 in contrast much larger variations of the relative abundance of pha storers were observed in the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors with coefficients of variation of 43 24 and 25 respectively the influent cod p ratio also influenced the composition of the pha storer community fig 3 xanthobacter sp were the most abundant pha storers at a low cod p ratio of 200 gcod gp 1 but pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus outcompeted xanthobacter sp as the influent cod p ratio increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 the relative abundance of xanthobacter sp decreased from 44 34 to 15 5 while the relative abundance of pannonibacter sp continuously increased from 1 1 up to 78 6 as the influent cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 the relative abundance of both pannonibacter sp and xanthobacter sp decreased down to 19 12 and 2 3 respectively while in turn the putative pha storer achromobacter sp proliferated 18 6 of the sequences 3 2 how does the influent cod p ratio affect the biomass ip the biomass ip was measured throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 4 a si a8 in general the higher the influent cod p ratio the lower the biomass ip fig 4a a reference ip value of 14 mgp gpcodpha free 1 can be assumed for bacterial cells when phosphorus is in excess tchobanoglous et al 2013 a cod p ratio of 200 gcod gp 1 resulted in a similar biomass ip with an average value of 13 8 1 1 mgp gpcodpha free 1 the biomass ip then gradually decreased to 7 9 1 6 5 4 0 5 and 4 0 0 3 mgp gpcodpha free 1 at cod p ratios of 400 600 and 800 gcod gp 1 respectively in the cod p 1000 reactor the biomass ip 3 9 0 9 mgp gpcodpha free 1 did not further diminish compared to the cod p 800 reactor in all reactors the reduction of the biomass ip relative to a baseline of 14 mgp gpcodpha free 1 occurred within the first day of the experiment si fig a8 3 3 how does the influent cod p ratio affect the pha storage response pha content pha composition and substrate conversion yields were measured throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 4b si a9 overall higher influent cod p ratios lead to a higher biomass pha content fig 4b the average pha content was highest in the cod p 800 reactor 0 36 0 05 gcodpha gpcod 1 followed by the cod p 1000 reactor 0 27 0 09 gcodpha gpcod 1 and lowest in the cod p 200 reactor 0 06 0 01 gcodpha gpcod 1 the cod p 400 and 600 reactors had intermediary pha contents of 0 16 0 09 and 0 18 0 04 gcodpha gpcod 1 respectively furthermore the more stable the pha storer community the more stable the pha storage response the biomass pha content was therefore most stable in the cod p 800 and 600 reactors with coefficients of variation of 15 and 22 respectively in contrast the greatest variations of pha content were observed in the cod p 400 and 1000 reactors coefficients of variation of 57 and 36 respectively in all reactors the biomass started to store pha within the first 5 days of the experiment well before the microbial community reached a dynamic equilibrium si fig a9 overall the monomeric composition of phas was similar in all reactors with primarily 3hb small amounts of 3hv and negligible amounts of 3h2mb and 3h2mv below limit of quantification high fractions of 3hv up to 50 of the pha content were observed only for the cod p 400 reactor and occurred in parallel with sudden peaks of pha content si fig a9 ultimately the influent cod p ratio also dictated to what extent c substrate was utilized for the production of active biomass or for pha storage active biomass yields were lowest in the cod p 800 and 600 reactors with 0 30 0 03 and 0 31 0 04 gpcodpha free gcodremoved 1 respectively higher active biomass yields were observed in the cod p 200 400 and 1000 reactors with 0 36 0 07 0 35 0 04 and 0 34 0 07 gpcodpha free gcodremoved 1 respectively similarily than for the pha content pha yield was highest in the cod p 800 reactor 0 18 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 followed by the cod p 1000 reactor 0 13 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 while it was lowest in the cod p 200 reactor 0 02 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 intermediary pha yields were found for the cod p 400 and 600 reactors 0 07 0 04 and 0 07 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 respectively 3 4 how does the influent cod p ratio affect cod and po4 3 p removal cod and po4 3 p removal performances were monitored throughout the experiment in the different reactors figs 5 si a10 full and stable cod removal 95 was achieved in the cod p 200 800 reactors on the contrary cod removal in the cod p 1000 reactor was unstable and fluctuated between 60 and 90 during the entire experiment also the period to reach full cod removal gradually increased from 1 day in the cod p 200 reactor to 20 days in the cod p 800 reactor however full cod removal when occuring was always achieved before the microbial community reached a dynamic equilibrium in all reactors complete and stable po4 3 p removal occurred throughout the entire duration of the experiment si fig a10 3 5 what is the link between influent cod p ratio selection of pha storers biomass ip and pha content the results of the microbial community analysis were finally related to biomass ip and pha content to gain further insight into the underlying relationships fig 6 the selection of pha storers increased with the influent cod p ratio between 200 and 800 gcod gp 1 and coincided with increasing pha storage reduction of the biomass ip and full cod removal as the cod p ratio was further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 selection and cod removal performances deteriorated while further reduction of the biomass ip was not observed the influent cod p ratio also governed the composition of the selected pha storer community in particular the competition between gen xanthobacter gen pannonibacter and gen achromobacter on a more global scale a loss in overall microbial diversity was observed in parallel to the reduction of the biomass ip for influent cod p ratios 600 gcod gp 1 si fig a11 4 discussion 4 1 high cod p ratios allow to successfully select pha storers in a single cstr an efficient and robust selection process is characterised by a biomass with high and stable pha storage capacity the pha storage capacity of a biomass in turn depends on both the relative abundance and the type of pha storers within the selected microbial community an important question is then to what extent a single cstr can be i efficient in terms of selecting a microbial community with a high relative abundance of pha storers while being ii robust in terms of maintaining a large and stable pha storer community in the long term our results demonstrate a stable microbial community consisting of more than 90 pha storers can be successfully selected at a cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 over a period of several weeks fig 2a b those results support the initial evidence by cavaille et al 2016 that pha storers can be selected in a cstr at high cod p ratios up to 2950 gcod gp 1 and at different srts 0 1 2 days at similar operating conditions than in our study cod p ratio of 700 gcod gp 1 srt 1 day cavaille et al 2016 also estimated the relative abundance of pha storers at 90 based on the analysis of a limited number of biomass samples the present study and the work of cavaille et al 2016 thus demonstrate that a single cstr is as efficient in selecting pha storers as the state of the art sbr aerobic feast famine approach where for similar c substrates the relative abundance of pha storers ranges typically between 70 and 95 albuquerque et al 2013 2010b lemos et al 2008 wang et al 2017 furthermore for the first time our study provides insights about the robustness of the selection process in a cstr using the example of the cod p 800 reactor first we show that a high relative abundance of pha storers 90 can be steadily maintained over at least 30 srts figs 1 2a second the microbial community that developed in the reactor was constantly dominated by the same pha storers pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus 78 6 and xanthobacter sp 15 5 borsodi et al 2003 ray et al 2016 wiegel 2015 indicating a stable pha storer community developed over time fig 1 si table a7 a stable pha storer community in turn translates into a stable pha storage capacity implying a robust selection process such robustness is essential for scaling up pha production using mww derived feedstock however the maximum pha storage capacity of the produced biomass ultimately depends on the type of pha storers selected an important question is therefore to what extent different pha storers are selected in the single stage cstr i depending on the c substrate and ii compared to the sbr approach pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus 78 6 followed by xanthobacter sp 15 5 were the dominant pha storers selected on a synthetic wastewater composed of 50 acetate propionate with a cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 fig 3 different pha storers were selected by cavaille et al 2016 despite rather similar operating conditions ph temperature cod p ratio and srt while working with acetate as the sole c source acidovorax sp brevundimonas sp and brachymonas sp both brevundimonas sp and brachymonas sp are known to poorly grow on propionate hiraishi 2015 vancanneyt et al 2015 which could explain why brevundimonas sp were washed out over time in our experiments e g in the cod p 800 reactor fig 1 the potential influence of the c substrate composition on the competition among pha storers highlights the importance of working with vfa mixtures that are relevant for practice since the type of pha storers selected ultimately defines the maximum pha storage capacity of the biomass the fermentation of mww derived solids primary or activated sludge typically yields a complex mixture of vfas where both acetate and propionate are major constituents together accounting for 70 90 of the vfas with the remainder consisting of iso butyrate and iso valerate brison et al 2022 da ros et al 2020 ucisik and henze 2008 working with a single c substrate e g acetate only thus creates an oversimplified selective environment poorly representative of real conditions in contrast the 50 acetate propionate mix used in our study is more representative of the vfa mixture obtained from the fermentation of real mww our results further suggest that for a similar c source the cstr approach selects different pha storers than the sbr approach in sbr systems fed with acetate propionate rich feeds the dominant pha storers typically belong to one of the following genera zooglea thauera azoarcus amaricoccus plasticicumulans and paracoccus albuquerque et al 2013 2010b janarthanan et al 2016 jiang et al 2011 lemos et al 2008 morgan sagastume 2016 wang et al 2017 none of these sbr typical pha storers dominated the microbial communities in our cstr system despite paracoccus sp and thauera sp being present in our inoculum this indicates that either the high influent cod p ratio or the associated lack of a substrate gradient or a combination of both provided a competitive advantage to other pha storers such as pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus and xanthobacter sp interestingly pannonibacter sp and xanthobacter sp were less abundant than paracoccus sp and thauera sp at the beginning of the experiments but successfully outcompeted them under the growth conditions in our cstr system si table a8 fig 3 korkakaki et al 2017 observed how xanthobacter sp outcompeted plasticicumulans sp in an sbr as they doubled the influent cod p ratio 150 to 300 molc molp 1 corresponding to 140 to 270 gcod gp 1 on the other side cavaille et al 2016 observed that the sbr typical zooglea sp dominated the microbial community in a cstr in absence of a substrate gradient but only at rather low cod p ratios 170 300 gcod gp 1 we thus hypothesize the high influent cod p ratio rather than the absence of a substrate gradient is responsible for the selection of different pha storers with the cstr approach compared to the sbr approach which is typically operated under nutrient excess i e very low cod n p ratios valentino et al 2017 since different pha storers are selected with both approaches future research should be directed towards investigating the maximum pha storage capacity of biomass selected with the cstr approach a key aspect not covered by our study 4 2 growth conditions and potential mechanisms behind the selection of pha storers our results also clearly demonstrate that both efficiency and robustness of the selection process increase with the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 but then deteriorate when the ratio is further increased to 1000 gcod gp 1 fig 2a if too high influent cod p ratios mitigate selection performance it is important to discuss the specific growth conditions under which pha storers have a selective advantage in the present study influent cod p ratios between 200 and 800 gcod gp 1 resulted in completely different growth conditions in the cstrs than an influent cod p ratio of 1000 gcod gp 1 both po4 3 p and cod were fully consumed in the cod p 200 800 reactors whereas only partial cod removal was observed in the cod p 1000 reactor figs 5 si a10 consequently the growth environment in the cod p 1000 reactor was characterized by an excess of c substrate while p remained limiting on the contrary the environments in the cod p 200 800 reactors were constantly depleted of both c substrate and p growth conditions where two nutrients are fully consumed at the same time have been described previously and referred to as dual nutrient limited durner et al 2000 egli 1991 grazerlampart et al 1986 zinn et al 2004 a conceptual summary of our results reveals that the selection of pha storers improved together with an increasing influent cod p ratio only as long as dual nutrient limited conditions were maintained fig 7 an important question is then i what mechanisms are involved in the selection of pha storers and ii to what extent those mechanisms explain the existence of dual c substrate and p limited conditions over a certain range of influent cod p ratios an increase in pha storage and a reduction in biomass ip occurred simultaneously with the selection of pha storers under dual c substrate and p limited conditions figs 6 7 cavaille et al 2016 we hypothesize those two mechanisms pha storage and reduction of biomass ip were directly involved in the selection of pha storers when influent cod p ratios increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 under p limited conditions increasing cell size and surface via storage of non limiting c substrate might help microorganisms to maintain a high diffusive transport across the cell membrane and ultimately to maximize their affinity towards the limiting p ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 the growth conditions in the cod p 200 800 reactors were by definition dual c substrate and p limited however as the cod p ratios increased from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 less and less p was available for the formation of new cells such growth limitation typically results in more c substrate being directed towards pha synthesis in pha storers cavaille et al 2016 2013 explaining the higher pha yields and lower active biomass yields in the cod p 800 reactor 0 18 0 03 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 compared to the cod p 200 reactor 0 02 0 01 gcodpha gcodremoved 1 increased pha storage might in turn have allowed pha storers to increase their size and thus their affinity towards p which could have ultimately helped them outcompete non storing organisms this potential pha storage related mechanism would however not explain the decreasing biomass ip p content of pha free active biomass figs 6 7 cavaille et al 2016 hypothesized that reduction of biomass ip as a response to increasing cod p ratios is due to the ability of the same microorganisms to adjust their cellular c p ratio to ensure cell division plasticity towards p our results however suggest that reduction of the biomass ip actually resulted from the selection of different microorganisms with low cellular p requirements rather than plasticity towards p in the cod p 800 reactor the biomass ip was as low as 4 mgp gpcodpha free 1 while pannonibacter sp accounted for 80 of the microbial community indicating pannonibacter sp have low p requirements furthermore increasing the influent cod p ratio from 200 to 800 gcod gp 1 caused a three fold decrease of the biomass ip while microorganisms with low p requirements such as pannonibacter sp gradually outcompeted microorganisms that coincided with high biomass ip such as xanthobacter sp figs 3 6 this shift in microbial community composition associated with a decrease of the biomass ip is consistent with previous observations suggesting that low cellular p requirements provide a selective advantage when influent cod p ratios are high godwin and cotner 2015 overall we hypothesize that under dual c substrate and p limited conditions i the ability to store pha drives competition between pha storers and non storers while ii the difference in cellular p requirements between microorganisms governs competition among pha storers e g pannonibacter sp vs xanthobacter sp no further reduction of the biomass ip was observed when the cod p ratio was increased from 800 to 1000 gcod gp 1 although very different microbial communities were selected figs 2b 6 these results indicate that the potential of a mixed culture to reduce its biomass ip via selection of microorganisms with low cellular p requirements is limited the data also show that growth conditions change from dual c substrate and p limited to p limited once this potential is exhausted fig 7 thus the extent to which a mixed culture can reduce its biomass ip by selecting microorganisms with low cellular p requirements ultimately defines the range of influent cod p ratios that will result in full removal of c substrate and thus dual c substrate and p limited conditions a main contribution of our study lies in identifying that selection of pha storers requires dual c substrate and p limited conditions combined with high influent cod p ratios also a conceptual summary is proposed fig 7 based on which future research activities could be directed including i confirming that cell size increase via pha storage is a key mechanism in the competition between pha storers and non storers as well as ii understanding why the selective advantage of pha storers is lost under solely p limited conditions finally the highest influent cod p ratio at which dual c substrate and p limited conditions are maintained varies with operating conditions such as the srt the larger the srt the higher the cod p ratio under which dual nutrient limited conditions can be maintained cavaille et al 2016 therefore observed dual c substrate and p limited conditions for cod p ratios up to 2000 gcod gp 1 at an srt of 2 days while at an srt of 0 2 days cod p ratios as low as 300 gcod gp 1 were the limit for dual nutrient limited growth the same authors also observed that the pha storage capacity of the selected biomass increased with the cod p ratio 80 2850 cmol pmol 1 corresponding to 80 2950 gcod gp 1 and the srt 0 1 2 days an increasing srt is however associated with decreasing biomass production substrate to biomass conversion yields further research should be directed towards better understanding the growth of pannonibacter phragmitetus under dual c substrate and p limited conditions in order to identify which operating conditions cod p ratio srt etc allow to maximize both the selective advantage for that pha storer and biomass production 4 3 practical implications we demonstrate a microbial community dominated by pha storers can be successfully selected in a single cstr fed with high influent cod p ratios implementing such an approach in practice demands controlling the influent cod p ratio reliable control of the influent cod p ratio in turn requires online monitoring and chemical adjustment of the phosphorus concentration when needed since the cod p ratios of mww derived feedstock range between 30 and 1000 gcod gp 1 brison et al 2022 da ros et al 2020 soares et al 2010 precipitation of po4 3 p might be required upfront the selection reactor chemical precipitation of po4 3 p via metal salts iron alum calcite lime etc can be easily implemented and has been widely applied in wastewater treatment over the past decades de bashan and bashan 2004 the more challenging step in controlling the influent cod p ratio will be the online monitoring of dissolved cod and po4 3 p required to ensure the correct dosage of metal salts to the precipitation tank monitoring dissolved cod in the range of several 1000 mg l 1 typical for mww derived feedstock requires the use of uv vis spectrometry based sensors e g s can sensors langergraber et al 2004 while online monitoring of po4 3 p can be done with ion selective sensors e g based on molecular imprinted polymer or colorimetric analyzers cornelissen et al 2018 warwick et al 2014 overall implementing a functioning control of the influent cod p ratio should not represent a critical technical bottleneck to the cstr approach furthermore the use of high influent cod p ratios to valorize organic c in form of phas has the advantage of simultaneously encouraging plant operators to also remove p another key nutrient in mww that needs to be recovered and cycled back into society desmidt et al 2015 finally one must be careful when discussing the relevance of using a single cstr for the production of phas selection and accumulation as opposed to using the state of the art sbr aerobic feast famine a proper evaluation of the cstr would require a global comparison to the sbr including a detailed evaluation of both the selection storage capacity of the selected biomass substrate to biomass conversion yields robustness over time and accumulation performances using the same real mww derived feedstock 5 conclusions 1 efficient and robust selection of pha storers can be achieved in a single cstr at high influent cod p ratios a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers and dominated by pannonibacter sp pannonibacter phragmitetus was selected in the long term at an optimal influent cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 2 the selective advantage of pha storers over non storing microorganisms increases with the influent cod p ratio only as long as dual c substrate and p limited conditions prevail in the system cod p ratios 200 800 gcod gp 1 indeed the selection performance deteriorates when the influent cod p ratio is too high 1000 gcod gp 1 and growth conditions become p limited only 3 increased pha storage and reduction of biomass ip were observed to accompany selection of pha storers in dual c substrate and p limited environments first we hypothesize pha storage provides a selective advantage by increasing cell size and surface ultimately allowing for a higher diffusive uptake of limiting p second we demonstrate high cod p ratios provide a selective advantage to microorganisms with low cellular p requirements explaining why different pha storers were selected depending on the influent cod p ratio e g pannonibacter sp vs xanthobacter sp 4 overall a novel approach based on a single cstr and

decrease in available sites in water with 0 26 mmol ca2 l caused a 15 reduction in removal rate low temperature greatly reduced the removal rate by both enhancing the decrease in available sites and

the divalent manganese ion mn2 which is oxidized to black manganese oxides mnox in distribution systems is a main cause of esthetic problems in drinking water civardi and tompeck 2015 gerke et al 2016 li et al 2019b riddick et al 1958 sly et al 1990 tobiason et al 2016 in a conventional treatment system including rapid sand filtration mn2 is removed in a process in which a coating of mnox on the surface of filter sand acts as a catalyst and mn2 is oxidized and precipitated on the mnox in the presence of free chlorine hu et al 2004 jones et al 2018 knocke et al 1991 singer and reckhow 2011 tobiason et al 2008 in other treatment systems such as membrane filtration however this approach does not work because there is no medium like sand that can be coated with mnox in such a situation in a membrane filtration pilot experiment we discovered that mn2 was removed to below the quantification limit by superfine powdered activated carbon spac particle size of less than a few micrometers in the presence of free chlorine saito et al 2020 a little earlier li et al 2019a also reported the catalytic effect of powdered activated carbon pac particle size of tens of micrometers on mn2 oxidation by free chlorine although activated carbon has been known as a catalyst for oxidation ahumada et al 2002 faria et al 2009 gomes et al 2010 moreno castilla et al 2000 we believe that its catalytic effect on mn2 oxidation had probably not yet been found because of its limited catalytic activity moreover traditional drinking water treatment approaches would avoid any direct interaction between activated carbon and free chlorine because of the reductive tendencies of the carbon to the free chlorine however the use of small particles spac would compensate for the weak catalytic activity and provide sufficient mn2 removal performance even with a short reaction time and this approach has been demonstrated to be practicable as a drinking water treatment method saito et al 2020 the removal of mn2 by activated carbon and free chlorine follows first order reaction kinetics eq 1 li et al 2019a saito et al 2020 however the theoretical basis for this apparent kinetics remains uncertain and to date there is no analysis of the removal kinetics or mechanism 1 ln c m c 0 m k t in contrast to activated carbon there are kinetic studies of catalytic mn2 oxidation on mnox surfaces by free chlorine the earliest in 1967 nakanishi 1967 nakanishi proposed the model that mn2 is initially adsorbed on the mnox surface and then the adsorbed mn2 is catalytically oxidized by free chlorine the rate of mn2 removal and the mass balance for the adsorbed phase mn2 on the mnox surface in the nakanishi model are as follows 2 r r k a c m q max q m k d q m 3 d q m d t k a c m q max q m k d q m k oxid q m c oxid after referencing the nakanishi model merkle et al 1997 proposed a dynamic model that considered the external film mass transfer of mn2 to the mnox surface eq 4 they assumed the local equilibrium of the freundlich adsorption isotherm in the mn2 adsorption process the basics of the merkle model have been followed in later studies bierlein et al 2015 kenari et al 2019 4 r r k f c m c e m the local equilibrium of mn2 adsorption on the mnox surface was expressed as 5 c e m f u n q m the mass balance equation for the adsorbed phase mn2 on the mnox surface is as follows 6 d q m d t k f c m c e m k oxid q m c oxid the markle model is superior to the nakanishi model in that it is capable of describing the change in the mn2 removal rate with fluid conditions in this model it is necessary to assume that either the mass transfer or the oxidation reaction is the rate limiting step to derive the pseudo first order reaction rate characteristics that are observed with activated carbon as a catalyst li et al 2019a saito et al 2020 on the other hand the rate coefficient of mn2 removal by activated carbon is little affected by differences in free chlorine concentration especially in the high concentration range saito et al 2020 but it is affected by the presence of co existing substances explained in section 4 1 and the mixing intensity of the reactor explained in section 4 2 these dependencies of the removal rate cannot be explained by the merkle model with the rate limiting step assumption therefore these models are not applicable to mn2 removal by activated carbon and free chlorine in researching heterogeneous catalysis on solid catalyst surfaces the langmuir adsorption isotherm is generally used for the kinetic analysis baxter and hu 2002 boudart and djega mariadassou 2014 chorkendorff and niemantsverdriet 2007 in reactions involving two molecules the case where both molecules adsorb to an adsorption site for the subsequent reaction is called the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism whereas the case where one molecule adsorbs to an adsorption site and then reacts directly with another molecule in the gas or liquid phase is called the eley rideal er mechanism misono 2013 prins et al 2016 ross 2012a these two mechanisms have been used in many studies of catalytic reaction kinetics although the rate of mass transfer may also affect the overall reaction rate most research dealing with gas solid catalytic reactions have focused on the chemical reactions on the catalyst surface because the rate of mass transfer is much faster than the chemical reaction gómez marín and hernández ortiz 2014 ross 2012b on the other hand the oxidative mn2 removal targeted in this study is a liquid solid reaction where the mass transfer through an external film by diffusion is much slower than in a gas solid reaction because of much higher fluid viscosity it is therefore appropriate to analyze the reaction rate taking into account the effects of mass transfer in some studies of liquid solid reactions however the focus has been on the chemical reaction concluding through qualitative discussion that the external film mass transfer rate is negligible al sakkari et al 2017 chantrasa et al 2011 dhawane et al 2021 there have been studies that considered the contribution of the external film mass transfer in catalytic reactions ercan et al 1998 hatziantoniou et al 1986 satterfield 1969 but the overall reaction rate in first order reaction form has not been derived thus we could not find any kinetic study that fit the catalytic oxidation of mn2 by activated carbon and free chlorine that also follows the first order reaction rate law in the present study we developed an overall kinetic model in the form of a first order reaction for the catalytic oxidation of trace substances such as the oxidation of mn2 in water by activated carbon in the presence of free chlorine considering external film mass transfer and the er mechanism in addition we used the developed model to quantitatively analyze the kinetics of mn2 removal by spac and free chlorine 2 theorical development 2 1 overall rate of trace substance surface oxidation the rate of mass transfer of an oxidation target mn2 in this study across an external film by molecular diffusion is 7 r f k f c m c e m we applied the er mechanism to describe the kinetics of catalytic processes of the oxidation target on the catalyst surface ross 2012a adsorption rate 8 r a k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c desorption rate 9 r d k d c site θ m oxidation rate 10 r oxid k oxid c e oxid c site θ m the quasi steady state approximation for the adsorption desorption and oxidation is applied by assuming that the net adsorption desorption rate r a r d is equal to the oxidation rate r oxid this assumption is valid when the amount of reaction intermediate adsorbed target substance c site θ m changes instantaneously depending on c e m because the adsorption site concentration on a catalyst surface c site is low 11 k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c k d c site θ m k oxid c e oxid c site θ m adsorptive mn2 removal by spac alone is not significant saito et al 2020 even after spac was pre oxidized by free chlorine mn2 removal was not evident when free chlorine was absent at the time of the reaction fig s1 these results confirm the very low adsorption capacity c site of activated carbon catalyst for mn2 oxidation target supporting the quasi steady state approximation because the catalytic oxidation of mn2 proceeds on the outer external surface of activated carbon saito et al 2020 internal diffusion of mn2 in an activated carbon particle is not considered we also applied the quasi steady state approximation for the mass transfer and the net adsorption desorption rate r f r a r d 12 k f c m c e m k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c k d c site θ m from eqs 10 and 11 the overall reaction rate r r r f r a r d r oxid is given by 13 r r k a k oxid c e oxid c e m c site 1 θ c k a c e m k oxid c e oxid k d the condition of k a c e m k oxid c e oxid k d can be assumed when the concentration of an oxidation target mn2 c e m is low compared with the oxidant concentration free chlorine c e oxid in that case 14 r r k a k oxid c e oxid c e m c site 1 θ c k oxid c e oxid k d combining eqs 12 and 14 and rearranging the resultant equation is 15 c e m c m 1 1 k a k oxid c e oxid c site 1 θ c k f k oxid c e oxid k d substituting eq 15 into eq 7 the overall removal reaction rate r r becomes 16 r r k r c m here k r is the overall reaction rate coefficient defined as follows 17 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c e oxid under conditions where c m c oxid the decrease in c oxid is minimal because oxidant free chlorine consumption by the target substance mn2 oxidation reaction is very small in addition the external film mass transfer rate of the oxidant is greater than that of the oxidation target because of its higher concentration than the oxidation target therefore the mass transfer rate of the oxidant should not be a rate limiting step for influencing the overall reaction rate thus c e oxid c oxid and 18 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid consequently the overall kinetic model for removal expressed with a first order reaction rate which was observed experimentally is derived theoretically and the overall reaction rate coefficient can be represented by a linear combination of the three rate resistances i e those due to external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption 2 2 batch reaction

reproducibility of the experimental results some of the experiments run 1 2 and 8 and a part of run 13 were conducted only once each but 4 6 samplings were conducted in each experiment providing multiple measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of free chlorine and co existing substances from eqs 1 18 and 25 the removal rate coefficient k which can be determined from the experimental results is expressed as a function of free chlorine concentration c oxid 26 1 k 1 a 1 k f 1 a 1 k a c site 1 θ c 1 a k d k oxid k a c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid eq 26 tells us that 1 the reciprocal of the removal rate coefficient 1 k hereafter called removal rate resistance is a linear function of the reciprocal of free chlorine concentration 1 c oxid and 2 both the slope of 1 k against 1 c oxid and the intercept of the linear function change depending on water quality because co existing substances competing for adsorption sites change the value of θ c the fractional adsorption site coverage the validity of eq 26 was assessed on the basis of the results of experiments where mn2 was removed by the same spac in different waters under the same temperature and mixing conditions the values of 1 k increased linearly with 1 c oxid fig 1 furthermore both the slope and the intercept of the linear relationships were different depending on the water they were smallest in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water followed by water 3 ionic water containing ca2 and other ions and waters 1 and 2 natural waters we next determined the parameter values for eq 26 by using least squares criteria to fit the experimental data the parameter values were optimized to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the observed and calculated 1 k values the parameters a k a c site k d and k oxid should have the same respective values when the same activated carbon is used and the parameter k f should have the same value when the same temperature and mixing conditions are applied to the same activated carbon on the other hand θ c should differ between the waters tested but it should be zero in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water finally the values of the parameters were uniquely determined as shown in table 4 note that the uniqueness of the determination was validated on the basis of theoretical considerations see appendix a the solid lines in fig 1 shows the 1 k calculated by eq 26 after substituting the parameter values from table 4 the solid lines are in close agreement to most of the plotted data and the square of the correlation coefficient r 2 between the experimental and calculated 1 k values was 0 97 fig s4 indicating that eq 26 successfully expressed the effects of free chlorine concentration in different waters on the removal of mn2 by spac and free chlorine according to eq 26 the removal rate coefficient comprises three group parameters each presenting a rate resistance the external film mass transfer first term on the right hand side of eq 26 adsorption second term and oxidation desorption third term fig 2 shows the breakdown of the removal rate resistance as a function of free chlorine concentration the breakdowns were calculated from each term on the right hand side of eq 26 by substituting the parameters from table 4 it is very reasonable that the removal rate resistance for oxidation desorption increases with decreasing free chlorine concentration which then decreases the removal rate coefficient the breakdown of the removal rate resistances at a free chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg l 14 1 mmol m3 in water 1 natural water fig 2a were 77 7 46 6 and 58 0 s for mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption respectively indicating that the mass transfer resistance was the largest contributor but also that all three resistances contributed roughly equally to the overall removal rate in water 2 another natural water fig 2b these values were 77 7 30 2 and 37 7 s in contrast in water 4 a carbonate buffered pure water they were 77 7 7 9 and 9 8 s respectively indicating that the mass transfer resistance was dominant in determining the overall removal rate fig 2d this is consistent with the previous finding that the removal rate coefficient in carbonate buffered pure water is predictable under the assumption that the external film mass transfer is the rate determining step saito et al 2020 the value of θ c was set to zero for water 4 because of the absence of competitive adsorption substances the values of θ c the fractional adsorption site coverage were 83 and 74 for waters 1 and 2 natural waters respectively θ c was 50 for water 3 which has the same ionic composition as the natural waters considering the earlier finding that ca2 was the dominant ion influencing mn2 removal in water saito et al 2022 we infer that the reduction of adsorption sites in the natural water was mostly due to ca2 the difference in θ c values between waters 1 and 2 and water 3 indicates that the natural organic matter nom in these waters another source of competitive adsorption substances saito et al 2022 also reduced the adsorption sites by 30 the doc of water 1 and water 2 was almost the same but θ c was greater in water 1 indicating that the characteristics of the nom influence the removal of mn2 alternatively if the turbidity component inhibits mn2 removal the relatively high turbidity of water 1 could be another reason for the higher value of θ c in water 1 on the other hand in experiments using the same nom srnom the mn2 removal rate decreased with increasing nom as well as ca2 concentrations saito et al 2022 and the application of eq 26 to those data clearly revealed that the fractional percentage of remaining adsorption sites 1 θ c actually decreased with increasing ca2 and srnom concentrations fig s5 this demonstrates the excellent ability of the eq 26 to analyze mn2 removal phenomena the two resistance model incorporating mass transfer and oxidation rates has been applied in previous studies analyzing mn2 removal with a granular mnox catalyst bierlein et al 2015 kenari et al 2019 merkle et al 1997 mnox would have a higher adsorption capacity for mn2 than activated carbon which reduces the rate resistance of adsorption and the particle size of mnox which is much larger than spac pac increases the mass transfer resistance therefore the application of the two resistance model in the previous studies was probably reasonable and does not seem to be inconsistent with our study nevertheless it would be useful to have a universal model describing the removal kinetics of mn2 by both mnox and activated carbon which have very different catalytic activities and particle sizes 4 2 effect of mixing intensity we investigated the effect of mixing intensity on the removal rate coefficient k fig 3 we plotted the experimental data and a solid line showing the values predicted by eq 26 substituting the value of k f from the mass transfer coefficient correlation equation see appendix b and table s1 a from eq 20 and the remaining parameters a k a c site θ c and k d k oxid from table 4 the agreement between the experimental and predicted values further validates eq 26 both the experimental and predicted results indicate that the removal rate coefficient increased with mixing intensity but the rate of the increase in the experimental results became steeper in the range of g 1000 s 1 deviating from the predicted rate coefficient values we hypothesized that the steep increase behind the deviation was due to the disintegration of the activated carbon particles which were mildly aggregated at the time of dosing under the high mixing intensity the predictions were made under the assumption that the size of the activated carbon particles which were partially aggregated in the stock suspension was maintained after dosing because in situ particle size measurement was not possible if this hypothesis is correct such a steep increase in the removal rate coefficient with mixing intensity in the high g value range should not be observed for activated carbon particles that are already in a dispersed state at the time of dosing to verify this hypothesis we used non aggregated activated carbon spac a2 whose particle size did not change between before and after the dispersion treatment 3 15 vs 3 01 μm and we conducted batch experiments for mn2 removal at different mixing intensities we did not observe the same steep increase in the removal rate coefficient with increasing mixing intensity for spac a2 fig s8 strongly suggesting that the steep increase observed for spac a1 was due to particle disintegration by the high mixing conditions we broke down the removal rate resistance 1 k against mixing intensity into the three resistance components i e rate resistances from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption fig 4 the effect of high mixing intensity on mn2 removal rate was large in carbonate buffered pure water but it was smaller in natural water because mass transfer resistance was not a dominant contributor this suggests that the effect of flow rate on mn removal in flow reactor which is installed prior to membrane filtration process in practice can be evaluated roughly as a change in hrt hydraulic retention time because the effect of g value turbulent mixing intensity change with flow rate change is small 4 3 effect of water temperature we investigated the effect of water temperature on the removal rate resistances 1 k fig 5 we also separated out the mass transfer resistance one component of removal rate resistances predicted by the mass transfer coefficient correlation equation see appendix b and table 1s which was validated in section 4 2 the adsorption and oxidation desorption components are not depicted because the temperature effects were not predictable as water temperature increased the viscosity decreased so the mass transfer resistance decreased on the other hand the removal rate resistance of which mass transfer resistance is one of the components also decreased we therefore consider the temperature dependence of the removal rate resistance to be due to the temperature dependence of the mass transfer resistance by subtracting the mass transfer resistance from the total removal rate resistance the magnitudes of the other components i e adsorption and oxidation desorption resistances hereafter referred to as the surface reaction resistance were elucidated and plotted against water temperature fig 6 in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water the surface reaction resistance ranged from 12 to 31 s without a clear increasing or decreasing trend with water temperature on the other hand the surface reaction resistance in water 3 ionic water clearly increased with decreasing water temperature the parameters relating to the surface reaction resistance are k a c site k d k oxid and θ c in eq 26 among these θ c is zero in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water as described in section 4 1 and therefore the lack of a temperature dependence of the surface reaction resistance in water 4 indicates that k a c site and k d k oxid are probably not affected by temperature thus the temperature dependence of surface reaction resistance observed in water 3 indicates that θ c the fraction of adsorption sites occupied by co existing substances mainly ca2 as described in section 4 1 increased with decreasing temperature this is consistent with some previous sorption studies using zeolite and kaolinite aragaw and ayalew 2019 in that ca2 adsorption is enhanced with decreasing temperature however note that there are also other studies reporting that ca2 adsorption is enhanced with increasing temperature borhade and kankrej 2017 wang et al 2021 xue et al 2014 we therefore consider that the changes in the surface reaction resistance with water temperature in water 3 can be explained by the increase of θ c due to enhanced ca2 adsorption at low water temperature in water 4 θ c was zero at all temperatures so there was no temperature dependent change in surface reaction resistance these observations suggest that the decrease in mn2 removal rate with decreasing water temperature is caused not only by the decrease in mass transfer rate from the increase in viscosity but also by the increase in adsorption of co existing substances mainly ca2 on the activated carbon which decreases the available adsorption sites for mn2 4 4 effect of activated carbon particle size we compared the mn2 removal rate coefficients k against the particle size of activated carbon fig 7 we plotted the experimental data using carbon particles of nine sizes originating from the same carbon for comparison with the prediction by eq 26 the experimental and predicted values were almost in agreement and both showed a linear relationship on a double logarithmic plot a power relationship a closer look shows that the predicted values had a steeper slope than the experimental values and the experimental values were somewhat greater than the predicted ones in the range of larger particles this could be due to any difference in particle shape or surface property we assumed a series of parameter values including a sphericity value independent of particle size for these predictions armenante and kirwan 1989 but in actual activated carbon these values could have varied with particle size overall the particle size of the activated carbon strongly affects the mn2 removal performance 4 5 effect of activated carbon species we plotted the experimental values for the removal rate coefficient k for eleven different activated carbons and a charcoal without any activation treatment against their particle sizes fig 8 although the carbon species were different we observed a rough trend of decreasing k values with increasing particle size which is the same as predicted for particles of the same type of carbon in section 4 4 focusing on the variation of individual carbon species the k values of two wood based activated carbons of similar particle size spac a1 d l3 2 2 21 μm spac d d l3 2 2 13 μm were 0 0091 s 1 and 0 0044 s 1 respectively differing by a factor of 2 1 the charcoal differed from the activated carbon spac a1 by a factor of 2 2 even though their particle sizes were similar if we assumed that these individual variations were solely due to the concentration of adsorption sites c site and applied eqs 26 20 and b 2 the values for c site varied by a factor of 8 across the activated carbons and charcoal there was no clear tendency for the activated carbons with larger internal surface area 1000 m2 g matsui et al 2015 to have clearly higher mn2 removal rates than the charcoal before the activation process 400 m2 g hitomi et al 1993 sontheimer et al 1988 but this is consistent with previous findings that mn2 removal reactions occur on the outer surface of activated carbon particles saito et al 2020 coconut shell based and coal based activated carbons reportedly have lower oxygen contents implying lower polarity than wood based activated carbon matsui et al 2015 pan et al 2017 partlan et al 2016 pendleton et al 2002 however there was no clear trend toward superiority or inferiority of activated carbon from any of the raw materials with respect to mn2 removal the relationship between carbon properties and mn2 removal specifically the competitive adsorption of mn2 awaits further study but these findings suggest that the mn2 removal performance could be maximized by selecting suitable raw materials at the procurement stage and or optimizing the activation condition during manufacture it should be noted however that the effect of carbon particle size is more crucial than carbon properties such that the k value of 2 μm carbon was 12 27 times that of 30 μm carbon fig 7 5 conclusions we derived a kinetic model for the removal of a trace substance by catalytic oxidation on a solid catalyst surface applying the derived model we quantitatively analyzed the oxidative removal rate of a trace concentration of mn2 by activated carbon as a catalyst in the presence of free chlorine 1 by introducing the external film mass transfer resistance model the surface reaction model of the eley rideal mechanism the quasi steady state approximation and the assumption that the concentration of an oxidation target substance is much lower than that of an oxidant we were able to derive an overall removal kinetic model with a first order reaction formula in which the removal rate coefficient is represented by a linear combination of the three rate resistances i e those from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption the contributions of each resistance could be easily evaluated the equations for the batch reaction are as follows d c m d t k r a c m 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid 2 the model fit well all the experimental results for the mn2 removal rate coefficients under varying water quality free chlorine concentration mixing intensity water temperature and activated carbon particle size 3 under practical conditions for mn2 removal i e natural water containing mn2 at 10 μg l free chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg cl2 l mixing intensity of 509 s 1 and water temperature of 20 c the removal rate resistances from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption were 77 7 46 6 and 58 0 s respectively and their contributions to the removal rate were roughly equal 4 in water with no competing substances the effect of water temperature on the mn2 removal rate can be explained by changes in water viscosity which affects the mass transfer coefficient in the equation above k a c site and k d k oxid which are related to adsorption desorption and oxidation would likely not be affected by temperature 5 the effect of co existing substances was analyzed quantitatively as a decrease in available adsorption sites for mn2 on the activated carbon surface a 50 decrease in the concentration of adsorption sites by the competitive cation ca2 present in water at a concentration of 0 26 mmol l resulted in a 15 decrease in the mn2 removal rate the reduction in adsorption sites by a competitive cation would become greater at lower water temperature therefore under low water temperature conditions the removal rate of mn2 is greatly reduced because of the enhanced competitive cation adsorption in addition to the decrease in mass transfer rate due to increased viscosity 6 activated carbons and charcoal had an 8 fold difference in adsorption site concentrations which resulted in removal rate coefficients that differed by a factor of 2 2 however the carbon particle size in water is a more crucial factor for the removal rate coefficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19927,catalytic oxidative removal of mn2 on activated carbon surfaces by free chlorine was recently discovered and found to be potentially practicable for water treatment when using micrometer sized activated carbon herein we newly derived a kinetic model for trace substance removal by catalytic reaction and applied it to the mn2 removal external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption contributed similarly to the mn2 removal rate under actual practical conditions the low removal rate in natural water was attributed to decreases in available adsorption sites e g a 50 decrease in available sites in water with 0 26 mmol ca2 l caused a 15 reduction in removal rate low temperature greatly reduced the removal rate by both enhancing the decrease in available sites and hindering mass transfer through increased viscosity while adsorption sites differed 8 fold between different carbon particles causing a 2 2 fold difference in removal rates carbon particle size was more influential with a 10 fold difference between 2 and 30 μm sizes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated carbon oxidation adsorption film mass transfer eley rideal

the divalent manganese ion mn2 which is oxidized to black manganese oxides mnox in distribution systems is a main cause of esthetic problems in drinking water civardi and tompeck 2015 gerke et al 2016 li et al 2019b riddick et al 1958 sly et al 1990 tobiason et al 2016 in a conventional treatment system including rapid sand filtration mn2 is removed in a process in which a coating of mnox on the surface of filter sand acts as a catalyst and mn2 is oxidized and precipitated on the mnox in the presence of free chlorine hu et al 2004 jones et al 2018 knocke et al 1991 singer and reckhow 2011 tobiason et al 2008 in other treatment systems such as membrane filtration however this approach does not work because there is no medium like sand that can be coated with mnox in such a situation in a membrane filtration pilot experiment we discovered that mn2 was removed to below the quantification limit by superfine powdered activated carbon spac particle size of less than a few micrometers in the presence of free chlorine saito et al 2020 a little earlier li et al 2019a also reported the catalytic effect of powdered activated carbon pac particle size of tens of micrometers on mn2 oxidation by free chlorine although activated carbon has been known as a catalyst for oxidation ahumada et al 2002 faria et al 2009 gomes et al 2010 moreno castilla et al 2000 we believe that its catalytic effect on mn2 oxidation had probably not yet been found because of its limited catalytic activity moreover traditional drinking water treatment approaches would avoid any direct interaction between activated carbon and free chlorine because of the reductive tendencies of the carbon to the free chlorine however the use of small particles spac would compensate for the weak catalytic activity and provide sufficient mn2 removal performance even with a short reaction time and this approach has been demonstrated to be practicable as a drinking water treatment method saito et al 2020 the removal of mn2 by activated carbon and free chlorine follows first order reaction kinetics eq 1 li et al 2019a saito et al 2020 however the theoretical basis for this apparent kinetics remains uncertain and to date there is no analysis of the removal kinetics or mechanism 1 ln c m c 0 m k t in contrast to activated carbon there are kinetic studies of catalytic mn2 oxidation on mnox surfaces by free chlorine the earliest in 1967 nakanishi 1967 nakanishi proposed the model that mn2 is initially adsorbed on the mnox surface and then the adsorbed mn2 is catalytically oxidized by free chlorine the rate of mn2 removal and the mass balance for the adsorbed phase mn2 on the mnox surface in the nakanishi model are as follows 2 r r k a c m q max q m k d q m 3 d q m d t k a c m q max q m k d q m k oxid q m c oxid after referencing the nakanishi model merkle et al 1997 proposed a dynamic model that considered the external film mass transfer of mn2 to the mnox surface eq 4 they assumed the local equilibrium of the freundlich adsorption isotherm in the mn2 adsorption process the basics of the merkle model have been followed in later studies bierlein et al 2015 kenari et al 2019 4 r r k f c m c e m the local equilibrium of mn2 adsorption on the mnox surface was expressed as 5 c e m f u n q m the mass balance equation for the adsorbed phase mn2 on the mnox surface is as follows 6 d q m d t k f c m c e m k oxid q m c oxid the markle model is superior to the nakanishi model in that it is capable of describing the change in the mn2 removal rate with fluid conditions in this model it is necessary to assume that either the mass transfer or the oxidation reaction is the rate limiting step to derive the pseudo first order reaction rate characteristics that are observed with activated carbon as a catalyst li et al 2019a saito et al 2020 on the other hand the rate coefficient of mn2 removal by activated carbon is little affected by differences in free chlorine concentration especially in the high concentration range saito et al 2020 but it is affected by the presence of co existing substances explained in section 4 1 and the mixing intensity of the reactor explained in section 4 2 these dependencies of the removal rate cannot be explained by the merkle model with the rate limiting step assumption therefore these models are not applicable to mn2 removal by activated carbon and free chlorine in researching heterogeneous catalysis on solid catalyst surfaces the langmuir adsorption isotherm is generally used for the kinetic analysis baxter and hu 2002 boudart and djega mariadassou 2014 chorkendorff and niemantsverdriet 2007 in reactions involving two molecules the case where both molecules adsorb to an adsorption site for the subsequent reaction is called the langmuir hinshelwood mechanism whereas the case where one molecule adsorbs to an adsorption site and then reacts directly with another molecule in the gas or liquid phase is called the eley rideal er mechanism misono 2013 prins et al 2016 ross 2012a these two mechanisms have been used in many studies of catalytic reaction kinetics although the rate of mass transfer may also affect the overall reaction rate most research dealing with gas solid catalytic reactions have focused on the chemical reactions on the catalyst surface because the rate of mass transfer is much faster than the chemical reaction gómez marín and hernández ortiz 2014 ross 2012b on the other hand the oxidative mn2 removal targeted in this study is a liquid solid reaction where the mass transfer through an external film by diffusion is much slower than in a gas solid reaction because of much higher fluid viscosity it is therefore appropriate to analyze the reaction rate taking into account the effects of mass transfer in some studies of liquid solid reactions however the focus has been on the chemical reaction concluding through qualitative discussion that the external film mass transfer rate is negligible al sakkari et al 2017 chantrasa et al 2011 dhawane et al 2021 there have been studies that considered the contribution of the external film mass transfer in catalytic reactions ercan et al 1998 hatziantoniou et al 1986 satterfield 1969 but the overall reaction rate in first order reaction form has not been derived thus we could not find any kinetic study that fit the catalytic oxidation of mn2 by activated carbon and free chlorine that also follows the first order reaction rate law in the present study we developed an overall kinetic model in the form of a first order reaction for the catalytic oxidation of trace substances such as the oxidation of mn2 in water by activated carbon in the presence of free chlorine considering external film mass transfer and the er mechanism in addition we used the developed model to quantitatively analyze the kinetics of mn2 removal by spac and free chlorine 2 theorical development 2 1 overall rate of trace substance surface oxidation the rate of mass transfer of an oxidation target mn2 in this study across an external film by molecular diffusion is 7 r f k f c m c e m we applied the er mechanism to describe the kinetics of catalytic processes of the oxidation target on the catalyst surface ross 2012a adsorption rate 8 r a k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c desorption rate 9 r d k d c site θ m oxidation rate 10 r oxid k oxid c e oxid c site θ m the quasi steady state approximation for the adsorption desorption and oxidation is applied by assuming that the net adsorption desorption rate r a r d is equal to the oxidation rate r oxid this assumption is valid when the amount of reaction intermediate adsorbed target substance c site θ m changes instantaneously depending on c e m because the adsorption site concentration on a catalyst surface c site is low 11 k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c k d c site θ m k oxid c e oxid c site θ m adsorptive mn2 removal by spac alone is not significant saito et al 2020 even after spac was pre oxidized by free chlorine mn2 removal was not evident when free chlorine was absent at the time of the reaction fig s1 these results confirm the very low adsorption capacity c site of activated carbon catalyst for mn2 oxidation target supporting the quasi steady state approximation because the catalytic oxidation of mn2 proceeds on the outer external surface of activated carbon saito et al 2020 internal diffusion of mn2 in an activated carbon particle is not considered we also applied the quasi steady state approximation for the mass transfer and the net adsorption desorption rate r f r a r d 12 k f c m c e m k a c e m c site 1 θ m θ c k d c site θ m from eqs 10 and 11 the overall reaction rate r r r f r a r d r oxid is given by 13 r r k a k oxid c e oxid c e m c site 1 θ c k a c e m k oxid c e oxid k d the condition of k a c e m k oxid c e oxid k d can be assumed when the concentration of an oxidation target mn2 c e m is low compared with the oxidant concentration free chlorine c e oxid in that case 14 r r k a k oxid c e oxid c e m c site 1 θ c k oxid c e oxid k d combining eqs 12 and 14 and rearranging the resultant equation is 15 c e m c m 1 1 k a k oxid c e oxid c site 1 θ c k f k oxid c e oxid k d substituting eq 15 into eq 7 the overall removal reaction rate r r becomes 16 r r k r c m here k r is the overall reaction rate coefficient defined as follows 17 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c e oxid under conditions where c m c oxid the decrease in c oxid is minimal because oxidant free chlorine consumption by the target substance mn2 oxidation reaction is very small in addition the external film mass transfer rate of the oxidant is greater than that of the oxidation target because of its higher concentration than the oxidation target therefore the mass transfer rate of the oxidant should not be a rate limiting step for influencing the overall reaction rate thus c e oxid c oxid and 18 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid consequently the overall kinetic model for removal expressed with a first order reaction rate which was observed experimentally is derived theoretically and the overall reaction rate coefficient can be represented by a linear combination of the three rate resistances i e those due to external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption 2 2 batch reaction

reproducibility of the experimental results some of the experiments run 1 2 and 8 and a part of run 13 were conducted only once each but 4 6 samplings were conducted in each experiment providing multiple measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of free chlorine and co existing substances from eqs 1 18 and 25 the removal rate coefficient k which can be determined from the experimental results is expressed as a function of free chlorine concentration c oxid 26 1 k 1 a 1 k f 1 a 1 k a c site 1 θ c 1 a k d k oxid k a c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid eq 26 tells us that 1 the reciprocal of the removal rate coefficient 1 k hereafter called removal rate resistance is a linear function of the reciprocal of free chlorine concentration 1 c oxid and 2 both the slope of 1 k against 1 c oxid and the intercept of the linear function change depending on water quality because co existing substances competing for adsorption sites change the value of θ c the fractional adsorption site coverage the validity of eq 26 was assessed on the basis of the results of experiments where mn2 was removed by the same spac in different waters under the same temperature and mixing conditions the values of 1 k increased linearly with 1 c oxid fig 1 furthermore both the slope and the intercept of the linear relationships were different depending on the water they were smallest in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water followed by water 3 ionic water containing ca2 and other ions and waters 1 and 2 natural waters we next determined the parameter values for eq 26 by using least squares criteria to fit the experimental data the parameter values were optimized to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the observed and calculated 1 k values the parameters a k a c site k d and k oxid should have the same respective values when the same activated carbon is used and the parameter k f should have the same value when the same temperature and mixing conditions are applied to the same activated carbon on the other hand θ c should differ between the waters tested but it should be zero in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water finally the values of the parameters were uniquely determined as shown in table 4 note that the uniqueness of the determination was validated on the basis of theoretical considerations see appendix a the solid lines in fig 1 shows the 1 k calculated by eq 26 after substituting the parameter values from table 4 the solid lines are in close agreement to most of the plotted data and the square of the correlation coefficient r 2 between the experimental and calculated 1 k values was 0 97 fig s4 indicating that eq 26 successfully expressed the effects of free chlorine concentration in different waters on the removal of mn2 by spac and free chlorine according to eq 26 the removal rate coefficient comprises three group parameters each presenting a rate resistance the external film mass transfer first term on the right hand side of eq 26 adsorption second term and oxidation desorption third term fig 2 shows the breakdown of the removal rate resistance as a function of free chlorine concentration the breakdowns were calculated from each term on the right hand side of eq 26 by substituting the parameters from table 4 it is very reasonable that the removal rate resistance for oxidation desorption increases with decreasing free chlorine concentration which then decreases the removal rate coefficient the breakdown of the removal rate resistances at a free chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg l 14 1 mmol m3 in water 1 natural water fig 2a were 77 7 46 6 and 58 0 s for mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption respectively indicating that the mass transfer resistance was the largest contributor but also that all three resistances contributed roughly equally to the overall removal rate in water 2 another natural water fig 2b these values were 77 7 30 2 and 37 7 s in contrast in water 4 a carbonate buffered pure water they were 77 7 7 9 and 9 8 s respectively indicating that the mass transfer resistance was dominant in determining the overall removal rate fig 2d this is consistent with the previous finding that the removal rate coefficient in carbonate buffered pure water is predictable under the assumption that the external film mass transfer is the rate determining step saito et al 2020 the value of θ c was set to zero for water 4 because of the absence of competitive adsorption substances the values of θ c the fractional adsorption site coverage were 83 and 74 for waters 1 and 2 natural waters respectively θ c was 50 for water 3 which has the same ionic composition as the natural waters considering the earlier finding that ca2 was the dominant ion influencing mn2 removal in water saito et al 2022 we infer that the reduction of adsorption sites in the natural water was mostly due to ca2 the difference in θ c values between waters 1 and 2 and water 3 indicates that the natural organic matter nom in these waters another source of competitive adsorption substances saito et al 2022 also reduced the adsorption sites by 30 the doc of water 1 and water 2 was almost the same but θ c was greater in water 1 indicating that the characteristics of the nom influence the removal of mn2 alternatively if the turbidity component inhibits mn2 removal the relatively high turbidity of water 1 could be another reason for the higher value of θ c in water 1 on the other hand in experiments using the same nom srnom the mn2 removal rate decreased with increasing nom as well as ca2 concentrations saito et al 2022 and the application of eq 26 to those data clearly revealed that the fractional percentage of remaining adsorption sites 1 θ c actually decreased with increasing ca2 and srnom concentrations fig s5 this demonstrates the excellent ability of the eq 26 to analyze mn2 removal phenomena the two resistance model incorporating mass transfer and oxidation rates has been applied in previous studies analyzing mn2 removal with a granular mnox catalyst bierlein et al 2015 kenari et al 2019 merkle et al 1997 mnox would have a higher adsorption capacity for mn2 than activated carbon which reduces the rate resistance of adsorption and the particle size of mnox which is much larger than spac pac increases the mass transfer resistance therefore the application of the two resistance model in the previous studies was probably reasonable and does not seem to be inconsistent with our study nevertheless it would be useful to have a universal model describing the removal kinetics of mn2 by both mnox and activated carbon which have very different catalytic activities and particle sizes 4 2 effect of mixing intensity we investigated the effect of mixing intensity on the removal rate coefficient k fig 3 we plotted the experimental data and a solid line showing the values predicted by eq 26 substituting the value of k f from the mass transfer coefficient correlation equation see appendix b and table s1 a from eq 20 and the remaining parameters a k a c site θ c and k d k oxid from table 4 the agreement between the experimental and predicted values further validates eq 26 both the experimental and predicted results indicate that the removal rate coefficient increased with mixing intensity but the rate of the increase in the experimental results became steeper in the range of g 1000 s 1 deviating from the predicted rate coefficient values we hypothesized that the steep increase behind the deviation was due to the disintegration of the activated carbon particles which were mildly aggregated at the time of dosing under the high mixing intensity the predictions were made under the assumption that the size of the activated carbon particles which were partially aggregated in the stock suspension was maintained after dosing because in situ particle size measurement was not possible if this hypothesis is correct such a steep increase in the removal rate coefficient with mixing intensity in the high g value range should not be observed for activated carbon particles that are already in a dispersed state at the time of dosing to verify this hypothesis we used non aggregated activated carbon spac a2 whose particle size did not change between before and after the dispersion treatment 3 15 vs 3 01 μm and we conducted batch experiments for mn2 removal at different mixing intensities we did not observe the same steep increase in the removal rate coefficient with increasing mixing intensity for spac a2 fig s8 strongly suggesting that the steep increase observed for spac a1 was due to particle disintegration by the high mixing conditions we broke down the removal rate resistance 1 k against mixing intensity into the three resistance components i e rate resistances from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption fig 4 the effect of high mixing intensity on mn2 removal rate was large in carbonate buffered pure water but it was smaller in natural water because mass transfer resistance was not a dominant contributor this suggests that the effect of flow rate on mn removal in flow reactor which is installed prior to membrane filtration process in practice can be evaluated roughly as a change in hrt hydraulic retention time because the effect of g value turbulent mixing intensity change with flow rate change is small 4 3 effect of water temperature we investigated the effect of water temperature on the removal rate resistances 1 k fig 5 we also separated out the mass transfer resistance one component of removal rate resistances predicted by the mass transfer coefficient correlation equation see appendix b and table 1s which was validated in section 4 2 the adsorption and oxidation desorption components are not depicted because the temperature effects were not predictable as water temperature increased the viscosity decreased so the mass transfer resistance decreased on the other hand the removal rate resistance of which mass transfer resistance is one of the components also decreased we therefore consider the temperature dependence of the removal rate resistance to be due to the temperature dependence of the mass transfer resistance by subtracting the mass transfer resistance from the total removal rate resistance the magnitudes of the other components i e adsorption and oxidation desorption resistances hereafter referred to as the surface reaction resistance were elucidated and plotted against water temperature fig 6 in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water the surface reaction resistance ranged from 12 to 31 s without a clear increasing or decreasing trend with water temperature on the other hand the surface reaction resistance in water 3 ionic water clearly increased with decreasing water temperature the parameters relating to the surface reaction resistance are k a c site k d k oxid and θ c in eq 26 among these θ c is zero in water 4 carbonate buffered pure water as described in section 4 1 and therefore the lack of a temperature dependence of the surface reaction resistance in water 4 indicates that k a c site and k d k oxid are probably not affected by temperature thus the temperature dependence of surface reaction resistance observed in water 3 indicates that θ c the fraction of adsorption sites occupied by co existing substances mainly ca2 as described in section 4 1 increased with decreasing temperature this is consistent with some previous sorption studies using zeolite and kaolinite aragaw and ayalew 2019 in that ca2 adsorption is enhanced with decreasing temperature however note that there are also other studies reporting that ca2 adsorption is enhanced with increasing temperature borhade and kankrej 2017 wang et al 2021 xue et al 2014 we therefore consider that the changes in the surface reaction resistance with water temperature in water 3 can be explained by the increase of θ c due to enhanced ca2 adsorption at low water temperature in water 4 θ c was zero at all temperatures so there was no temperature dependent change in surface reaction resistance these observations suggest that the decrease in mn2 removal rate with decreasing water temperature is caused not only by the decrease in mass transfer rate from the increase in viscosity but also by the increase in adsorption of co existing substances mainly ca2 on the activated carbon which decreases the available adsorption sites for mn2 4 4 effect of activated carbon particle size we compared the mn2 removal rate coefficients k against the particle size of activated carbon fig 7 we plotted the experimental data using carbon particles of nine sizes originating from the same carbon for comparison with the prediction by eq 26 the experimental and predicted values were almost in agreement and both showed a linear relationship on a double logarithmic plot a power relationship a closer look shows that the predicted values had a steeper slope than the experimental values and the experimental values were somewhat greater than the predicted ones in the range of larger particles this could be due to any difference in particle shape or surface property we assumed a series of parameter values including a sphericity value independent of particle size for these predictions armenante and kirwan 1989 but in actual activated carbon these values could have varied with particle size overall the particle size of the activated carbon strongly affects the mn2 removal performance 4 5 effect of activated carbon species we plotted the experimental values for the removal rate coefficient k for eleven different activated carbons and a charcoal without any activation treatment against their particle sizes fig 8 although the carbon species were different we observed a rough trend of decreasing k values with increasing particle size which is the same as predicted for particles of the same type of carbon in section 4 4 focusing on the variation of individual carbon species the k values of two wood based activated carbons of similar particle size spac a1 d l3 2 2 21 μm spac d d l3 2 2 13 μm were 0 0091 s 1 and 0 0044 s 1 respectively differing by a factor of 2 1 the charcoal differed from the activated carbon spac a1 by a factor of 2 2 even though their particle sizes were similar if we assumed that these individual variations were solely due to the concentration of adsorption sites c site and applied eqs 26 20 and b 2 the values for c site varied by a factor of 8 across the activated carbons and charcoal there was no clear tendency for the activated carbons with larger internal surface area 1000 m2 g matsui et al 2015 to have clearly higher mn2 removal rates than the charcoal before the activation process 400 m2 g hitomi et al 1993 sontheimer et al 1988 but this is consistent with previous findings that mn2 removal reactions occur on the outer surface of activated carbon particles saito et al 2020 coconut shell based and coal based activated carbons reportedly have lower oxygen contents implying lower polarity than wood based activated carbon matsui et al 2015 pan et al 2017 partlan et al 2016 pendleton et al 2002 however there was no clear trend toward superiority or inferiority of activated carbon from any of the raw materials with respect to mn2 removal the relationship between carbon properties and mn2 removal specifically the competitive adsorption of mn2 awaits further study but these findings suggest that the mn2 removal performance could be maximized by selecting suitable raw materials at the procurement stage and or optimizing the activation condition during manufacture it should be noted however that the effect of carbon particle size is more crucial than carbon properties such that the k value of 2 μm carbon was 12 27 times that of 30 μm carbon fig 7 5 conclusions we derived a kinetic model for the removal of a trace substance by catalytic oxidation on a solid catalyst surface applying the derived model we quantitatively analyzed the oxidative removal rate of a trace concentration of mn2 by activated carbon as a catalyst in the presence of free chlorine 1 by introducing the external film mass transfer resistance model the surface reaction model of the eley rideal mechanism the quasi steady state approximation and the assumption that the concentration of an oxidation target substance is much lower than that of an oxidant we were able to derive an overall removal kinetic model with a first order reaction formula in which the removal rate coefficient is represented by a linear combination of the three rate resistances i e those from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption the contributions of each resistance could be easily evaluated the equations for the batch reaction are as follows d c m d t k r a c m 1 k r 1 k f 1 k a c site 1 θ c k d k a k oxid c site 1 θ c 1 c oxid 2 the model fit well all the experimental results for the mn2 removal rate coefficients under varying water quality free chlorine concentration mixing intensity water temperature and activated carbon particle size 3 under practical conditions for mn2 removal i e natural water containing mn2 at 10 μg l free chlorine concentration of 1 0 mg cl2 l mixing intensity of 509 s 1 and water temperature of 20 c the removal rate resistances from external film mass transfer adsorption and oxidation desorption were 77 7 46 6 and 58 0 s respectively and their contributions to the removal rate were roughly equal 4 in water with no competing substances the effect of water temperature on the mn2 removal rate can be explained by changes in water viscosity which affects the mass transfer coefficient in the equation above k a c site and k d k oxid which are related to adsorption desorption and oxidation would likely not be affected by temperature 5 the effect of co existing substances was analyzed quantitatively as a decrease in available adsorption sites for mn2 on the activated carbon surface a 50 decrease in the concentration of adsorption sites by the competitive cation ca2 present in water at a concentration of 0 26 mmol l resulted in a 15 decrease in the mn2 removal rate the reduction in adsorption sites by a competitive cation would become greater at lower water temperature therefore under low water temperature conditions the removal rate of mn2 is greatly reduced because of the enhanced competitive cation adsorption in addition to the decrease in mass transfer rate due to increased viscosity 6 activated carbons and charcoal had an 8 fold difference in adsorption site concentrations which resulted in removal rate coefficients that differed by a factor of 2 2 however the carbon particle size in water is a more crucial factor for the removal rate coefficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19928,pharmaceuticals are relatively new to nature and often not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps consequently these micropollutants end up in water bodies all around the world posing a great environmental risk one exception to this recalcitrant conversion is paracetamol whose full degradation has been linked to several microorganisms however the genes and corresponding proteins involved in microbial paracetamol degradation are still elusive in order to improve our knowledge of the microbial paracetamol degradation pathway we inoculated a bioreactor with sludge of a hospital wwtp pharmafilter delft nl and fed it with paracetamol as the sole carbon source paracetamol was fully degraded without any lag phase and the enriched microbial community was investigated by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses which demonstrated that the microbial community was very diverse dilution and plating on paracetamol amended agar plates yielded two pseudomonas sp isolates a fast growing pseudomonas sp that degraded 200 mg l of paracetamol in approximately 10 h while excreting 4 aminophenol and a slow growing pseudomonas sp that degraded paracetamol without obvious intermediates in more than 90 days each pseudomonas sp contained a different highly expressed amidase 31 identity to each other these amidase genes were not detected in the bioreactor metagenome suggesting that other as yet uncharacterized amidases may be responsible for the first biodegradation step of paracetamol uncharacterized deaminase genes and genes encoding dioxygenase enzymes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds and amino acids were the most likely candidates responsible for the degradation of paracetamol intermediates based on their high expression levels in the bioreactor metagenome and the pseudomonas spp genomes furthermore cross feeding between different community members might have occurred to efficiently degrade paracetamol and its intermediates in the bioreactor this study increases our knowledge about the ongoing microbial evolution towards biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and points to a large diversity of amidase enzymes that are likely

severe risk to the environment and to human health gavrilescu et al 2015 wilkinson john et al 2022 the consumption of medication and personal care products will most likely increase in the future therefore there is an urgent need to develop new technologies able to remove these chemicals at low concentrations before reaching the environment until now cost efficient removal of common pollutants i e ammonium nitrogen has been achieved using microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as large scale use of pharmaceuticals has only recently resulted in discharge to many different environments the metabolic pathways of their conversion at relatively low concentrations might not have evolved yet or might not be very efficient acetaminophen n acetyl p aminophenol apap more commonly known as paracetamol is one of the most consumed analgesic drugs worldwide wu et al 2012 consequently its concentration in wastewater and surface waters is among the highest of all pharmaceutical micropollutants apap concentration can reach more than 100 µg l in wwtp influents and more than 100 ng l in rivers kanama et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2022 wu et al 2012 watson database https data emissieregistratie nl watson unlike many other pharmaceuticals apap is degraded by microorganisms and is often well removed in wwtps several microorganisms have been related to apap

ap and hydroquinone hq have been measured in several apap biodegradation experiments park and oh 2020a b zhang et al 2013 consequently an aryl acylamidase a deaminase and hydroquinone 1 2 dioxygenase were proposed as enzymes potentially involved in the biodegradation pathway of apap grignet et al 2022 lee et al 2015 żur et al 2018b in fact five amidases have been shown to transform apap to 4 ap or

degradation since it was measured in a burkholderia sp degrading 4 ap takenaka et al 2003 despite this knowledge the exact genes enzymes that microorganisms are using for apap biodegradation in the environment are currently unknown to fill this gap we analyzed the apap degrading microbial community from a hospital wwtp by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics furthermore we were able to isolate two pseudomonas species from the bioreactor that were capable of growing on apap our aim was to identify the genes involved in apap biodegradation and determine the genomic location and organization of these genes clusters in different microorganisms these results will help to understand the evolution of microbial metabolism towards biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and will provide molecular biomarkers to screen environments for apap degrading microorganisms 2 methods 2 1 sampling and bioreactor set up biomass was obtained from a membrane bioreactor mbr and a granular activated carbon gac

from 0 022 to 0 227 mg apap min this was done by increasing the concentration of apap in the medium to 400 mg l and by reducing the hydraulic retention time hrt from 2 4 to 1 8 d fig 1 when bacterial growth became exponential the solid retention time srt was set to 10 d to reach a steady state after about 90 d the hrt was set to 3 7 d to determine the microbial community changes at lower apap

designated as pfast and pslow respectively were found in the agar plates both colonies were used to inoculate bottles containing synthetic bioreactor medium with 200 mg l apap as sole carbon source one milliliter of these cultures was used as inoculum for triplicate bottle experiments where apap biodegradation kinetics were measured and the dna and rna of the bacteria were sequenced dna and rna

dna sequencing data from the slow growing isolate pslow were quality checked and trimmed with bbduk assembled with metaspades and annotated with metascan the dna sample consisted of two genomes a very

each gene in kilobases second the per million scaling factor was calculated sum of all the reads per kilobase in one sample divided by one million and third tpm were calculated reads per kilobase of each gene divided by the per million scaling factor approximately the top 10 most highly expressed genes in each microorganism or bin were considered as highly expressed the rna coverage of each bin in the metagenome was calculated or defined as the number of bases mapped to the set of protein coding genes from each bin divided by the total number of bases in each bin amidase sequences were retrieved by searching for amidase amidohydrolase and amidotransferase terms in the annotated metagenome the highly expressed and uncharacterized amidase sequences were aligned with clustal omega higgins and sharp 1988 and muscle edgar 2004 and the phylogenetic trees were created with mega7 kumar et al 2016 and mega11 tamura et al 2021 using the maximum likelihood algorithm jones et al 1992 and bootstrap analysis or the neighbor joining method to analyse the tree topology saitou and nei 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor performance and bacterial community changes a bioreactor was inoculated with sludge from a wwtp treating hospital waste apap was added as the sole carbon source at all times during the experiment and it was fully removed since the beginning without lag phase no transformation products were detected to discard the possibility of abiotic removal such as adsorption to biomass we measured apap concentration in the presence of autoclaved sludge or active biomass used in the bioreactor inoculum while active biomass removed 50 mg l of apap in 4 h autoclaved biomass did not remove apap during the four days of the experiment supplementary fig s1 the microbial community was very diverse and changed during the different operational settings fig 1 in the first start up phase the total suspended solids tss gradually increased to about 1 1 g l as all biomass was retained in the bioreactor via a membrane module the hrt was 1 8 days under these conditions the microbial community was dominated by members of the families chitinophagaceae haliangiaceae phycisphaeraceae pseudomonadaceae saccharimonadaceae and sphingobacteriaceae when compared to the inoculum mix in the second phase a srt of 10 days was maintained in order to keep the biomass concentration tss stable at a steady state this led to a decrease of the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae phycisphaeraceae and sphingobacteriaceae while increasing burkholderiaceae chitinophagaceae and polyangiaceae in the third phase the hrt was increased from 1 8 to 3 7 days resulting in a bacterial community dominated by the heterotrophic bacteria blastocatellaceae burkholderiaceae and chitinophagaceae nitrospiraceae were also enriched which might be the result of growth on low concentration of residual ammonium in the reactor overall the alpha diversity richness and evenness of species decreased over time in the bioreactor which corresponds to a selection and enrichment process supplementary fig s2 the previously mentioned taxa are normally found in wwtps due to their ability to degrade organic matter or ammonium nitrite nitrospira morin et al 2020 saunders et al 2016 the presence of heterotrophs able to degrade complex organic matter i e chitinophagaceae and polyangiaceae might indicate possible predation and biomass recycling in the bioreactor petters et al 2021 furthermore members of the pseudomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae families have been reported to degrade apap and 4 ap respectively park and oh 2020a takenaka et al 2003 żur et al 2018a 3 2 paracetamol degradation by two pseudomonas spp isolates after serial dilutions of the bioreactor biomass and plating the highest dilution showing apap removal on agar mineral medium with apap as sole carbon source two pseudomonas spp were obtained fig 1b batch and fig 2 apap medium without inoculum did not show apap removal and both pseudomonas isolates were not able to grow on synthetic medium without apap pseudomonas sp pfast degraded 200 mg l apap in 10 h and converted it into 4 ap which precipitated in the medium as a dark brown solid since 4 ap was purchased as a white solid we dissolved 4 ap in the bioreactor synthetic medium without bacteria and observed a color change in the medium and an abiotic removal due to precipitation supplementary fig s3 kim et al 2017 observed that hq was a white solid but the formation of a charge transfer complex with quinone turned it into a dark solid therefore 4 ap might also be forming complexes that lead to its coloration and precipitation 4 ap might also be transformed by the pfast isolate much slower than apap hq was also detected as an intermediate but in a much lower concentration than 4 ap data not shown the other pseudomonas sp pslow degraded 200 mg l apap in approximately 90 d without the accumulation of aromatic transformation products since apap was not degraded in the synthetic medium without bacteria and it did not adsorb to autoclaved sludge supplementary fig s1 we hypothesized that pseudomonas pslow cleaved the aromatic ring if the ring cleavage is a slow reaction this step might be coupled to the slow production of 4 ap after apap amide cleavage in the pfast isolate this process might be imbalanced because the formation of 4 ap is faster than the later ring cleavage reaction previous studies showed that other pseudomonas spp are also able to degrade apap in a few hours de gusseme et al 2011 hu et al 2013 park and oh 2020a zhang et al 2013 żur et al 2018a however we are not aware of reports describing bacteria that degrade apap at low rates 3 3 highly expressed amidases in the two pseudomonas spp isolates after dna and rna sequencing a highly expressed gene cluster was identified in the pfast isolate that contained a putative amide transporter amis urei family oacklnda 05759 and an amidase like protein oacklnda 05760 with 85 sequence identity to an aryl acylamidase known to convert apap into 4 ap and acetate ko et al 2010 lee et al 2015 the transporter might be catalyzing the uptake of apap or the excretion of 4 ap the genome of the pslow isolate contained neither this amidase nor the putative amide transporter instead it encoded three other amidases with 95 query coverage and 28 31 identity to the psfast amidase the most similar amidase 31 identity bkdbljdl 05334 was upregulated in the transcriptome of strain pslow cultivated with apap as the sole carbon source this amidase was encoded in a gene cluster together with a gene for a zinc dependent hydrolase bkdbljdl 05335 interestingly these genes were also present in the fast growing pseudomonas isolate but not highly expressed the difference in apap biodegradation rate and consequently growth between both pseudomonas spp was most likely related to the presence of oacklnda 05760 amidase in pfast which might be able to transform apap to 4 ap at high rates another option could be that the putative amide transporter oacklnda 05759 was involved in a faster uptake of apap and thus transformation into 4 ap further studies are needed to answer this question the highly expressed amidase gene of strain pslow was present in the chromosome of numerous pseudomonas species registered in the ncbi nucleotide collection however the highly expressed amidase gene from strain pfast was only found in a few microorganisms that came from various locations around the world

and in the chromosome of pseudomonas and burkholderia spp isolated from soil activated sludge and hospitals d souza et al 2019 ko et al 2010 patil et al 2017 żur et al 2018b many bacteria contained a similar amis urei family transporter gene next to the amidase gene and different mobile genetic elements nearby tn3 transposons is630 insertion sequences and inti1 integrases our strain pfast also had two insertion sequences is6100 and is21 oacklnda 05756 oacklnda 05781 one tn3 transposase gene oacklnda 05752 and one recombinase gene oacklnda 05755 near the highly expressed amidase gene consequently the whole gene cluster might have been exchanged between different species via horizontal gene transfer hgt rios miguel et al 2020 finally the low number of homologous proteins in the ncbi database might indicate the recent evolution of this amidase towards paracetamol biodegradation or our limited ability to find and identify these genes 3 4 amidase diversity in the metagenome to check and confirm whether the bioreactor microbial community contained more unidentified amidases involved in apap and intermediate conversion we analyzed the total metagenome at operational day 77 before analyzing the amidase genes 14 mags were recovered from the bioreactor metagenome and approximately 30 of the total reads remained unbinned the binning process and taxonomy assignment is a required step before the analysis of genes of interest because it allows the linkage of these genes to a specific microbial genome from the metagenome table 1 shows the 14 recovered mags ordered from highest to lowest coverage based on rna sequencing data calculated with rna bases mapped to protein coding genes chitinophagaceae and myxococcales were the most active rna coverage bacteria and also the most abundant dna coverage together with microbacterium and patescibacteria despite the high abundance of the patescibacteria mag it had low completeness the reason for this might be that the single copy genes normally used to calculate completeness are often not detected in patescibacteria genomes brown et al 2015 pseudomonas spp were low abundant in the metagenome and only present in the unbinned reads the highest blast identity match of the pfast amidase was 50 for proteins encoded on the unbinned contigs the 14 mags only contained amidases with a maximum of 30 sequence identity for the pslow isolate the highest match was 50 for proteins encoded on the unbinned contigs as well as the rubrivivax and betaproteobacteria mags since the apap concentration was below the detection limit 0 2 mg l in the bioreactor but continuously supplied with the medium inflow uncharacterized amidases might be responsible for apap biodegradation at low concentrations in the bioreactor a phylogenetic tree was created with the top 150 most expressed amidases in the metagenome the uncharacterized amidases enzymes annotated as amidase and whose function is not known present in both pseudomonas isolates and five amidases known to degrade apap obtained from literature and databases supplementary fig s4 supplementary table s1 all the uncharacterized amidases from the metagenome and the pseudomonas isolate genomes clustered together green cluster in supplementary fig s4 including four amidases known to degrade paracetamol ko et al 2010 lee et al 2015 yun et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 2020 2019 this group belongs to the amidase signature as enzyme family ec 3 5 1 4 characterized by a highly conserved signature region of approximately 160 amino acids that includes a canonical catalytic triad ser cisser lys and a gly ser rich motif ggss gs g one amidase agc74206 1 dimethoate hydrolase dmha previously reported to degrade apap chen et al 2016 did not cluster in this group supplementary fig s4 consequently there is the possibility that other amidase families are also able to transform apap for instance a histone deacetylase like amidohydrolase clustered together with the apap degrading amidase dmha suggesting its reactivity towards apap the green as amidase cluster of the phylogenetic tree in supplementary fig s4 was analyzed in more detail fig 3 the amidase gene expression level in each bin mag was added to the tree i e top 10 and the amino acid sequences were manually blasted against the ncbi non redundant protein database to improve the annotation furthermore partial sequences like one highly expressed amidase gene from betaproteobacteria eaedefln 03924 were removed from the analysis twelve amidases were identified as asp trna asn glu trna gln amidotransferase subunit gata and they all clustered together green cluster in fig 3 this type of amidase is involved in the transformation of glu trnagln to gln trnagln for the synthesis of proteins gene duplication and mutation events in this amidotransferase were probably the key contributors to the high number of uncharacterized amidases with broad substrate specificity another cluster with low bootstrap support in the phylogenetic tree of fig 3 contained highly expressed amidases top 10 of the pseudomonas genomes and the microbacterium mag red amidases in fig 3 oacklnda 05760 bkdbljdl 05334 bjlacckg 02946 the microbacterium amidase only had 91 query coverage and 63 identity to the closest amidase in the ncbi non redundant protein database this means that this amidase was sequenced for the first time and thus the evolution of amidases towards paracetamol biodegradation might be an ongoing process the microbacterium amidase was part of a highly expressed gene cluster containing a flavin reductase bjlacckg 02944 an arylformamidase bjlacckg 02945 a branched chain amino acid abc transporter bjlacckg 02947 bjlacckg 02948 bjlacckg 02949 bjlacckg 02950 bjlacckg 02951 and one oxidoreductase bjlacckg 02952 furthermore an is110 family transposase gene bjlacckg 02943 was right next to this highly expressed gene cluster four amidases known to degrade apap were also part of the phylogenetic tree cluster containing the highly expressed amidases of the pseudomonas genomes and microbacterium mag ans81375 1 arylamidase mah acp39716 2 aryl acylamidase anb41810 1 tricocarban amidase tcca afc37599 1 aryl amidase a ampa blue amidases in fig 3 three amidase genes present on the unbinned contigs were highly expressed in relation to all the unbinned protein coding genes top 10 orange amidases in fig 3 they were affiliated with actinomycetia and comamonadaceae spp kgeggeom 07080 kgeggeom 08489 kgeggeom 08132 and might also be degrading apap in the bioreactor non highly expressed amidase genes might also have the potential to degrade apap even though their genes were not strongly regulated when apap was present for instance the non highly expressed amidase oacklnda 00714 of the pfast strain was identical to the highly expressed amidase bkdbljdl 05334 of the pslow strain so it had the potential to degrade apap at slow rates but it was not highly expressed in pfast finally a multiple sequence alignment was performed with the amidases known to degrade apap except for dmha which is not part of the as family and the highly expressed amidases from the pseudomonas genomes and the metagenome supplementary file 2 lee et al previously determined the three dimensional structure of the amidase acp39716 2 with apap as a substrate lee et al 2015 they revealed several residues involved in catalysis and apap binding that we investigated in our alignment the aligned amidases contained a conserved catalytic triad ser187 cisser163 lys84 highlighted in green gly ser rich motif ggssgg in bold and oxyanion hole g ggs in bold the substrate binding pocket contained two loop regions highlighted in fair and dark grey and one α helix highlighted in blue that were less conserved in the crystal structure of acp39716 another two residues tyr136 and thr330 highlighted in yellow were described to bind to the hydroxyl group at the para position in apap via hydrogen bonds with two water molecules however thr330 was only present in approximately half of the aligned amidase sequences and tyr136 was not present in any of them thus the amidases from this study might have different substrate specificities compared to the acp39716 2 amidase furthermore we conclude that tyr136 and thr330 are not strictly necessary for apap binding and degradation 3 5 paracetamol degradation pathway highly expressed gene candidates the first step in apap biodegradation is the cleavage of the amide bond by an amidase to produce 4 ap and acetate fig 4 in each pseudomonas genome a different highly expressed amidase was identified presumably performing this cleavage oacklnda 05760 bkdbljdl 05334 in the bioreactor metagenome the microbacterium mag was the only one with a highly expressed amidase inside the as family cluster bjlacckg 02946 from which four amidases were previously reported to degrade apap fig 3 the betaproteobacteria mag also had a highly expressed uncharacterized amidase gene eaedefln 03924 however the nucleotide sequence was partial so we could not check its classification therefore microbacterium and betaproteobacteria might have been involved in transforming apap into 4 ap together with some low abundant bacteria in the unbinned group an alternative first step for apap biodegradation could be its hydroxylation to form 3 hydroxyacetaminophen a metabolite measured in soil by li et al 2014 however due to the high concentration of 4 ap in the pseudomonas experiments the cleavage of the amide bond might be the dominant mechanism the enzyme deaminating 4 ap is still unknown and we did not find an obvious gene responsible for this reaction uncharacterized rida family protein genes were highly expressed in the two pseudomonas genomes and in the microbacterium and betaproteobacteria mags oacklnda 05815 oacklnda 03065 bkdbljdl 03266 bkdbljdl 01320 bjlacckg 02940 bjlacckg 02936 eaedefln 02051 therefore these proteins might have been involved in deaminating 4 ap or deaminating the aminomuconate intermediates after ring cleavage he and spain 1998 furthermore two ammonia lyase genes were highly expressed in the genome of the pslow strain aspartate ammonia lyase and ethanolamine ammonia lyase bkdbljdl 01355 bkdbljdl 02838 however these genes were not highly expressed in the pfast genome and the metagenome from the bioreactor the investigated bacteria did not use any known hydroquinone 1 2 dioxygenase which is a type iii ring cleaving extradiol dioxygenase cupin superfamily with a catalytic mechanism analogous to that of the extradiol type dioxygenases instead the up regulated type iii extradiol dioxygenase genes present in bioreactor mags chitinophagaceae 1 2 and betaproteobacteria 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3 4 dioxygenase nlckofof 01117 jpnlmfaj 02227 eaedefln 00964 bacteroidetes rubrivivax and myxococcales 2 homogentisate 1 2 dioxygenase kgebagmn 02738 hfdflmdg 05905 opijccok 08966 might have cleaved the aromatic ring of hq to produce 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde as previously described żur et al 2018b fig 4 homogentisate 1 2 dioxygenase and 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3 4 dioxygenase are type iii extradiol dioxygenases able to cleave the aromatic ring of non catecholic substrates which are characterized by not having vicinal diols for example homo gentisate and hydroquinone have two hydroxyl groups in para position and 3 hydroxyanthranilate has one hydroxyl one amino and one carboxylic acid group as ring substituents these two dioxygenases are involved in the degradation of aromatic amino acids therefore bacteria might use the side activities of existing enzymes to degrade aromatic micropollutants such as apap the ring cleavage of aromatic compounds containing hydroxyl and amino substituents i e 2 aminophenol 3 hydroxyanthranilate and 5 aminosalicylate has been previously reported hintner et al 2004 li de et al 2013 takenaka et al 1997 wang et al 2020 therefore the aromatic ring of 4 ap might also be cleaved before deamination by class iii ring cleaving dioxygenases however metabolites confirming this pathway have not yet been measured an alternative route for the direct ring cleavage of hq is the hydroxylation of hq to form hydroxyquinol 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene and later the ring cleavage of hydroxyquinol by an intradiol type dioxygenase ferraroni et al 2005 takenaka et al 2003 or an extradiol type dioxygenase probably from the vicinal oxygen chelate voc or type i superfamily murakami et al 1999 fig 4 catechol has been previously measured during apap microbial degradation dai et al 2021 ivshina et al 2005 suggesting that it could be a transformation product that is further cleaved by intradiol type or extradiol type dioxygenases the hydroxylation of hq can be performed by ring hydroxylating dioxygenases or monooxygenases in the pfast isolate genome an uncharacterized ring hydroxylating dioxygenase oacklnda 03401 and an intradiol catechol 1 2 dioxygenase oacklnda 05722 were highly expressed furthermore two uncharacterized extradiol type dioxygenases were highly expressed in both pseudomonas isolate genomes oacklnda 01459 bkdbljdl 01807 these dioxygenases were similar to 4 5 dopa dioxygenase which is part of the voc extradiol dioxygenases wang et al 2019 in the bioreactor the rubrivivax mag had a phenol hydroxylase hfdflmdg 03468 hfdflmdg 03467 hfdflmdg 03466 an uncharacterized ring hydroxylating dioxygenase hfdflmdg 03024 a 4 hydroxybenzoate 3 monooxygenase hfdflmdg 05635 and a extradiol protocatechuate 4 5 dioxygenase hfdflmdg 01086 hfdflmdg 01087 highly expressed the microbacterium mag contained a highly expressed voc extradiol 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetate homoprotocatechuate 2 3 dioxygenase involved in the degradation of tyrosine bjlacckg 03009 the betaproteobacteria mag had a putative ring hydroxylating dioxygenase eaedefln 00364 and a 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase eaedefln 02889 able to hydroxylate and decarboxylate aromatic rings in the tyrosine degradation pathway many other mags contained this gene up regulated i e bacteroidetes comamonadaceae and myxococcales 2 kgebagmn 02075 jmgbclmb 02041 opijccok 08967 finally the alicycliphilus mag had a highly expressed gene cluster containing an mfs transporter mdklgidk 02282 a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter substrate binding protein mdklgidk 02283 an muconolactone d isomerase mdklgidk 02284 an 3 oxoadipate enol lactonase mdklgidk 02285 a 1 6 dihydroxycyclohexa 2 4 diene 1 carboxylate dehydrogenase mdklgidk 02286 an intradiol catechol 1 2 dioxygenase gene mdklgidk 02287 and a muconate cycloisomerase mdklgidk 02288 this highly expressed gene cluster suggests the ability of alicycliphilus to fully degrade hydroxyquinol via the oxoadipate pathway interestingly the alicycliphilus mag had hydroquinone dioxygenase genes mdklgidk 00653 mdklgidk 00654 that were not highly expressed acetyl coa synthetase genes and genes encoding enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca and glyoxylate cycles isocitrate lyase were highly expressed in the transcriptome of both pseudomonas spp and several mags i e microbacterium rubrivivax alycicliphilus and actinomycetales thus indicating their ability to grow on acetate after cleaving the apap amide bond or via cross feeding from other bacteria fig 4 finally the highly expressed gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase family protein could be involved in the conversion of muconolactone intermediates to eventually reach the tca cycle for bacterial growth in the pseudomonas isolates oacklnda 03472 bkdbljdl 01962 the microbacterium rubrivivax and betaproteobacteria mags had highly expressed dioxygenases but they did not have up regulated genes belonging to the β ketoadipate pathway involved in the conversion of aromatic metabolites into tca intermediates therefore it is unclear whether they were able to assimilate aromatic compounds or not furthermore the rubrivivax and alicycliphilus mags did not have any highly expressed amidase from the as family suggesting that cross feeding of acetate and aromatic intermediates was happening in the bioreactor the myxococcales family is known for its diverse metabolism and its predatory nature so the two bioreactor mags affiliated to the myxococcales family might have lived from the metabolites and cellular components of decaying microorganisms müller et al 2016 similarly the chitinophagaceae family is known to degrade complex organic matter and therefore the three bioreactor mags affiliated to the chitinophagaceae family could also have been biomass recyclers in the bioreactor morin et al 2020 the highest expressed metabolic genes of these mags were involved in the tca cycle gluconeogenesis and metabolism of lipids peptidoglycan nucleotides and amino acids thus not providing many hints about their exact catabolism or energy source similarly the metabolism of bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinomycetales and comamonadaceae mags was ambiguous and they might also be predators or biomass recyclers in addition we found that type ii and type iv secretion systems were highly expressed in several mags i e acidobacteria comamonadaceae which might have been involved in predation defense and conjugation activities between microorganisms aharon et al 2021 sgro et al 2019 however some of these mags might also degrade apap transformation products via their highly expressed dioxygenases i e chitinophagaceae 1 2 bacteroidetes myxococcales 2 the patescibacteria mag mostly contained genes encoding carbohydrate degrading enzymes so it might have thrived in symbiosis with other microbial community members that produced exopolysaccharides 3 6 highly expressed nitrification and denitrification genes in the bioreactor the majority of the mags except for patescibacteria and myxococcales 1 had highly expressed genes encoding enzymes from the denitrification pathway all four genes encoding the full pathway of denitrification could only be found in one mag affiliated with alicycliphilus denitrificans as well as the in the unbinned contigs nitrate reductase nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase the bioreactor was fully aerated but biomass was spatially organized in small granules supplementary fig s5 so there might have been anoxic conditions towards the inside of the granules favoring denitrification nitrate and nitrite were not added to the medium so nitrifying microorganisms were apparently also active in the bioreactor a single highly expressed ammonia monooxygenase subunits a b c kgeggeom 12202 kgeggeom 12201 kgeggeom 12203 was encoded in the unbinned contigs and affiliated with the complete ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira sp this finding suggests that some ammonia released from decaying biomass from the paracetamol degradation and from the ammonia supply in the medium intended for assimilation 1 mm was converted into nitrate by comammox nitrospira sp and subsequently available for oxygen limited denitrification 4 conclusions on the basis of our cultivation and metagenomic analysis we conclude that apap was immediately degraded by the activated sludge of a hospital wwtp and that a diverse microbial community was enriched under low apap concentrations in a membrane bioreactor high apap concentrations in batch led to the dominance of a fast growing pseudomonas species several uncharacterized amidases from the as family were highly expressed in the genome of a fast and a slow growing pseudomonas species and the bioreactor metagenome they might be cleaving apap into 4 ap at different rates genes encoding for uncharacterized rida family proteins were highly expressed in the genome of the pseudomonas isolates and several bioreactor mags they are known to have deaminase activity so they might be converting 4 ap to hq or cleaving reactive enamine intermediates genes encoding for intradiol and extradiol type dioxygenases were highly expressed in the genomes of the pseudomonas isolates and the bioreactor metagenome many of these genes are part of the degradation pathway of aromatic amino acids therefore microorganisms might take advantage of the side activities of existing enzymes encoded in their genomes for the degradation of apap transformation products candidate apap degrading amidases deaminases and dioxygenases were not combined in the same gene cluster highly expressed genes encoding amidases were often found in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements which suggests that apap degrading amidase genes are currently being exchanged between different bacteria via hgt taken together these results suggest a role of uncharacterized amidases deaminases and dioxygenases in the biodegradation of apap and the use of cross feeding to efficiently degrade apap in wwtp microbial communities furthermore the high number of microorganisms able to degrade apap might be the result of the broad substrate spectrum of amidases and its evolution together with the fact that just one enzyme amidase is needed to grow on apap derived acetate this study contributes to a better understanding of microbial evolution towards pharmaceutical biodegradation and demonstrates the complexity

19928,pharmaceuticals are relatively new to nature and often not completely removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtps consequently these micropollutants end up in water bodies all around the world posing a great environmental risk one exception to this recalcitrant conversion is paracetamol whose full degradation has been linked to several microorganisms however the genes and corresponding proteins involved in microbial paracetamol degradation are still elusive in order to improve our knowledge of the microbial paracetamol degradation pathway we inoculated a bioreactor with sludge of a hospital wwtp pharmafilter delft nl and fed it with paracetamol as the sole carbon source paracetamol was fully degraded without any lag phase and the enriched microbial community was investigated by metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses which demonstrated that the microbial community was very diverse dilution and plating on paracetamol amended agar plates yielded two pseudomonas sp isolates a fast growing pseudomonas sp that degraded 200 mg l of paracetamol in approximately 10 h while excreting 4 aminophenol and a slow growing pseudomonas sp that degraded paracetamol without obvious intermediates in more than 90 days each pseudomonas sp contained a different highly expressed amidase 31 identity to each other these amidase genes were not detected in the bioreactor metagenome suggesting that other as yet uncharacterized amidases may be responsible for the first biodegradation step of paracetamol uncharacterized deaminase genes and genes encoding dioxygenase enzymes involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds and amino acids were the most likely candidates responsible for the degradation of paracetamol intermediates based on their high expression levels in the bioreactor metagenome and the pseudomonas spp genomes furthermore cross feeding between different community members might have occurred to efficiently degrade paracetamol and its intermediates in the bioreactor this study increases our knowledge about the ongoing microbial evolution towards biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and points to a large diversity of amidase enzymes that are likely

metagenome assembled genome tpm transcripts per million 1 introduction hundreds of pharmaceutical compounds are being detected at low concentrations in water bodies all around the world posing a severe risk to the environment and to human health gavrilescu et al 2015 wilkinson john et al 2022 the consumption of medication and personal care products will most likely increase in the future therefore there is an urgent need to develop new technologies able to remove these chemicals at low concentrations before reaching the environment until now cost efficient removal of common pollutants i e ammonium nitrogen has been achieved using microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as large scale use of pharmaceuticals has only recently resulted in discharge to many different environments the metabolic pathways of their conversion at relatively low concentrations might not have evolved yet or might not be very efficient acetaminophen n acetyl p aminophenol apap more commonly known as paracetamol is one of the most consumed analgesic drugs worldwide wu et al 2012 consequently its concentration in wastewater and surface waters is among the highest of all pharmaceutical micropollutants apap concentration can reach more than 100 µg l in wwtp influents and more than 100 ng l in rivers kanama et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2022 wu et al 2012 watson database https data emissieregistratie nl watson unlike many other pharmaceuticals apap is degraded by microorganisms and is often well removed in wwtps several microorganisms have been related to apap

et al 2018a however the genomes of these microorganisms have not yet been reported and therefore the responsible genes and mechanisms for apap biodegradation in wwtps are not yet known 4 aminophenol 4 ap and hydroquinone hq have been measured in several apap biodegradation experiments park and oh 2020a b zhang et al 2013 consequently an aryl acylamidase a deaminase and hydroquinone 1 2 dioxygenase were proposed as enzymes potentially involved in the biodegradation pathway of apap grignet et al 2022 lee et al 2015 żur et al 2018b in fact five amidases have been shown to transform apap to 4 ap or to a brown compound supplementary table s1 chen et al 2016 ko et al 2010 lee et al 2015 yun et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 2020 2019 besides 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene could be an intermediate of apap degradation since it was measured in a burkholderia sp degrading 4 ap takenaka et al 2003 despite this knowledge the exact genes enzymes that microorganisms are using for apap biodegradation in the environment are currently unknown to fill this gap we analyzed the apap degrading microbial community from a hospital wwtp by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics furthermore we were able to isolate two pseudomonas species from the bioreactor that were capable of growing on apap our aim was to identify the genes involved in apap biodegradation and determine the genomic location and organization of these genes clusters in different microorganisms these results will help to understand the evolution of microbial metabolism towards biodegradation of pharmaceuticals and will provide molecular biomarkers to screen environments for apap degrading microorganisms 2 methods 2 1 sampling and bioreactor set up biomass was obtained from a membrane bioreactor mbr and a granular activated carbon gac

ml of the gac biomass the same inoculum was autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c and incubated with 50 mg l of apap to investigate its adsorption to biomass the sludge without heat inactivation was also tested in the experiment the lab scale membrane and bioreactor vessel were built at radboud university technical center the bioreactor appliances were from applikon biotechnology b v delft the netherlands the membrane consisted of an integral immersed zenon zw 1 module with 0 04 µm pore sized hollow fibers from suez water technologies solutions feasterville trevose usa it was never

from 0 022 to 0 227 mg apap min this was done by increasing the concentration of apap in the medium to 400 mg l and by reducing the hydraulic retention time hrt from 2 4 to 1 8 d fig 1 when bacterial growth became exponential the solid retention time srt was set to 10 d to reach a steady state after about 90 d the hrt was set to 3 7 d to determine the microbial community changes at lower apap loading rates fig 1 furthermore the bioreactor was run in the dark at constant 500 rpm stirring a ph value of 7 an airflow rate of 30 ml min and room temperature 20 1 c a ph sensor was connected to a

biomass in synthetic medium same as the bioreactor with apap as sole carbon source 0 2 0 4 g l the biomass of the most highly diluted culture displaying apap biodegradation was plated on agar solidified medium with apap as sole carbon source this solid medium consisted of the bioreactor synthetic medium 0 4 g l of apap and 1 5 w v bacteriological agar vwr belgium brown and white colonies designated as pfast and pslow respectively were found in the agar plates both colonies were used to inoculate bottles containing synthetic bioreactor medium with 200 mg l apap as sole carbon source one milliliter of these cultures was used as inoculum for triplicate bottle experiments where apap biodegradation kinetics were measured and the dna and rna of the bacteria were sequenced dna and rna from both isolates were extracted as described above except for the pfast dna extraction for ont sequencing which was performed at baseclear with the wizard hmw dna extraction kit promega benelux b v leiden the netherlands the genome of the fast growing isolate pfast was sequenced using illumina novaseq and ont gridion at baseclear leiden the netherlands rna of this isolate was sequenced using illumina novaseq also at baseclear only one of the 3 rna samples could be sequenced the genome and transcriptome of the slow growing isolate pslow were sequenced using an in house illumina miseq for dna library preparation the nextera xt kit was used and for transcriptomic library preparation the truseq stranded mrna kit was used according to the manufacturer s instructions illumina san diego usa all dna and rna quantifications and quality checks were performed as described above qubit and bioanalyzer for genomic dna libraries 300 bp paired end sequencing was performed and for the transcriptomes 150 bp single read sequencing was done using the illumina miseq sequencing machine illumina san diego california the raw sequence data and metadata of the bioreactor and isolates have been deposited at the read sequence archive sra database of the ncbi under the bioproject id prjna831879 2 4 bioinformatic analysis 2 4 1 16s rrna gene sequencing data analysis analysis of the 16s rrna sequencing output files was performed within r version 3 4 1 team 2013 using the dada2 pipeline callahan et al 2016 taxonomic assignment of the reads was up to the species level when possible using the silva non redundant database version 128 yilmaz et al 2014 count data were normalized to relative abundances data visualization and analysis were performed using phyloseq and ggplot packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 wickham and wickham 2007 chao1 simpson and shannon diversity indices were calculated using the estimate richness function of the phyloseq package 2 4 2 dna assembly binning and annotation the quality of the metagenome sequencing data was assessed using fastqc before and after quality processing quality trimming adapter removal and contaminant filtering of illumina paired end sequencing reads was performed using bbduk bbtools doe joint genome institute lawrence berkeley national laboratory usa the dna trimmed reads were assembled using metaspades and aligned to the assembly using bbmap to generate coverage information nurk et al 2017 the assemblies were binned using different binning algorithms binsanity concoct maxbin 2 0 and metabat 2 alneberg et al 2014 graham et al 2017 kang et al 2019 wu et al 2015 das tool was used for consensus binning sieber et al 2018 gtdb tk was used to assign taxonomy and checkm was used to assess the quality of the bins or metagenome assembled genomes mags chaumeil et al 2019 parks et al 2015 annotation was performed by metascan cremers et al 2022 under revision the annotation method was described previously by in t zandt et al 2020 poghosyan et al 2020 briefly genes were called by prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and subsequent open reading frames were annotated with hmmer eddy 2009 and a set of custom made databases dna sequencing data from the slow growing isolate pslow were quality checked and trimmed with bbduk assembled with metaspades and annotated with metascan the dna sample consisted of two genomes a very minor contaminant so we separated the contigs using maxbin 2 0 wu et al 2015 dna illumina reads from the fast growing isolate pfast were quality controlled and trimmed using bbduk with minimum trim

with minimum split read size of 3000 illumina and ont quality trimmed reads were assembled using unicycler with a minimum length of 1000 in the resulting metascan was used for annotation completion and contamination scores of the pslow and pfast assemblies were estimated using checkm s lineage workflow the whole genome phylogenetic position of both assemblies was inferred using gtdb tk if not specified settings were default 2 4 3 transcriptome analysis the rna reads were trimmed using sickle and mapped with bbmap allowing 1 mismatch bbtools to the protein coding genes of each isolate or to the contigs of the whole metagenome then transcripts per million tpm were calculated in excel for each gene in each sample first reads per kilobase were calculated read counts divided by the length of each gene in kilobases second the per million scaling factor was calculated sum of all the reads per kilobase in one sample divided by one million and third tpm were calculated reads per kilobase of each gene divided by the per million scaling factor approximately the top 10 most highly expressed genes in each microorganism or bin were considered as highly expressed the rna coverage of each bin in the metagenome was calculated or defined as the number of bases mapped to the set of protein coding genes from each bin divided by the total number of bases in each bin amidase sequences were retrieved by searching for amidase amidohydrolase and amidotransferase terms in the annotated metagenome the highly expressed and uncharacterized amidase sequences were aligned with clustal omega higgins and sharp 1988 and muscle edgar 2004 and the phylogenetic trees were created with mega7 kumar et al 2016 and mega11 tamura et al 2021 using the maximum likelihood algorithm jones et al 1992 and bootstrap analysis or the neighbor joining method to analyse the tree topology saitou and nei 1987 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor performance and bacterial community changes a bioreactor was inoculated with sludge from a wwtp treating hospital waste apap was added as the sole carbon source at all times during the experiment and it was fully removed since the beginning without lag phase no transformation products were detected to discard the possibility of abiotic removal such as adsorption to biomass we measured apap concentration in the presence of autoclaved sludge or active biomass used in the bioreactor inoculum while active biomass removed 50 mg l of apap in 4 h autoclaved biomass did not remove apap during the four days of the experiment supplementary fig s1 the microbial community was very diverse and changed during the different operational settings fig 1 in the first start up phase the total suspended solids tss gradually increased to about 1 1 g l as all biomass was retained in the bioreactor via a membrane module the hrt was 1 8 days under these conditions the microbial community was dominated by members of the families chitinophagaceae haliangiaceae phycisphaeraceae pseudomonadaceae saccharimonadaceae and sphingobacteriaceae when compared to the inoculum mix in the second phase a srt of 10 days was maintained in order to keep the biomass concentration tss stable at a steady state this led to a decrease of the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae phycisphaeraceae and sphingobacteriaceae while increasing burkholderiaceae chitinophagaceae and polyangiaceae in the third phase the hrt was increased from 1 8 to 3 7 days resulting in a bacterial community dominated by the heterotrophic bacteria blastocatellaceae burkholderiaceae and chitinophagaceae nitrospiraceae were also enriched which might be the result of growth on low concentration of residual ammonium in the reactor overall the alpha diversity richness and evenness of species decreased over time in the bioreactor which corresponds to a selection and enrichment process supplementary fig s2 the previously mentioned taxa are normally found in wwtps due to their ability to degrade organic matter or ammonium nitrite nitrospira morin et al 2020 saunders et al 2016 the presence of heterotrophs able to degrade complex organic matter i e chitinophagaceae and polyangiaceae might indicate possible predation and biomass recycling in the bioreactor petters et al 2021 furthermore members of the pseudomonadaceae and burkholderiaceae families have been reported to degrade apap and 4 ap respectively park and oh 2020a takenaka et al 2003 żur et al 2018a 3 2 paracetamol degradation by two pseudomonas spp isolates after serial dilutions of the bioreactor biomass and plating the highest dilution showing apap removal on agar mineral medium with apap as sole carbon source two pseudomonas spp were obtained fig 1b batch and fig 2 apap medium without inoculum did not show apap removal and both pseudomonas isolates were not able to grow on synthetic medium without apap pseudomonas sp pfast degraded 200 mg l apap in 10 h and converted it into 4 ap which precipitated in the medium as a dark brown solid since 4 ap was purchased as a white solid we dissolved 4 ap in the bioreactor synthetic medium without bacteria and observed a color change in the medium and an abiotic removal due to precipitation supplementary fig s3 kim et al 2017 observed that hq was a white solid but the formation of a charge transfer complex with quinone turned it into a dark solid therefore 4 ap might also be forming complexes that lead to its coloration and precipitation 4 ap might also be transformed by the pfast isolate much slower than apap hq was also detected as an intermediate but in a much lower concentration than 4 ap data not shown the other pseudomonas sp pslow degraded 200 mg l apap in approximately 90 d without the accumulation of aromatic transformation products since apap was not degraded in the synthetic medium without bacteria and it did not adsorb to autoclaved sludge supplementary fig s1 we hypothesized that pseudomonas pslow cleaved the aromatic ring if the ring cleavage is a slow reaction this step might be coupled to the slow production of 4 ap after apap amide cleavage in the pfast isolate this process might be imbalanced because the formation of 4 ap is faster than the later ring cleavage reaction previous studies showed that other pseudomonas spp are also able to degrade apap in a few hours de gusseme et al 2011 hu et al 2013 park and oh 2020a zhang et al 2013 żur et al 2018a however we are not aware of reports describing bacteria that degrade apap at low rates 3 3 highly expressed amidases in the two pseudomonas spp isolates after dna and rna sequencing a highly expressed gene cluster was identified in the pfast isolate that contained a putative amide transporter amis urei family oacklnda 05759 and an amidase like protein oacklnda 05760 with 85 sequence identity to an aryl acylamidase known to convert apap into 4 ap and acetate ko et al 2010 lee et al 2015 the transporter might be catalyzing the uptake of apap or the excretion of 4 ap the genome of the pslow isolate contained neither this amidase nor the putative amide transporter instead it encoded three other amidases with 95 query coverage and 28 31 identity to the psfast amidase the most similar amidase 31 identity bkdbljdl 05334 was upregulated in the transcriptome of strain pslow cultivated with apap as the sole carbon source this amidase was encoded in a gene cluster together with a gene for a zinc dependent hydrolase bkdbljdl 05335 interestingly these genes were also present in the fast growing pseudomonas isolate but not highly expressed the difference in apap biodegradation rate and consequently growth between both pseudomonas spp was most likely related to the presence of oacklnda 05760 amidase in pfast which might be able to transform apap to 4 ap at high rates another option could be that the putative amide transporter oacklnda 05759 was involved in a faster uptake of apap and thus transformation into 4 ap further studies are needed to answer this question the highly expressed amidase gene of strain pslow was present in the chromosome of numerous pseudomonas species registered in the ncbi nucleotide collection however the highly expressed amidase gene from strain pfast was only found in a few microorganisms that came from various locations around the world australia china pakistan india korea india poland in the plasmid of multi drug resistant acinetobacter spp isolated from patients and hospitals ghaly et al 2020 kizny gordon et al 2020 zou et al 2017 and in the chromosome of pseudomonas and burkholderia spp isolated from soil activated sludge and hospitals d souza et al 2019 ko et al 2010 patil et al 2017 żur et al 2018b many bacteria contained a similar amis urei family transporter gene next to the amidase gene and different mobile genetic elements nearby tn3 transposons is630 insertion sequences and inti1 integrases our strain pfast also had two insertion sequences is6100 and is21 oacklnda 05756 oacklnda 05781 one tn3 transposase gene oacklnda 05752 and one recombinase gene oacklnda 05755 near the highly expressed amidase gene consequently the whole gene cluster might have been exchanged between different species via horizontal gene transfer hgt rios miguel et al 2020 finally the low number of homologous proteins in the ncbi database might indicate the recent evolution of this amidase towards paracetamol biodegradation or our limited ability to find and identify these genes 3 4 amidase diversity in the metagenome to check and confirm whether the bioreactor microbial community contained more unidentified amidases involved in apap and intermediate conversion we analyzed the total metagenome at operational day 77 before analyzing the amidase genes 14 mags were recovered from the bioreactor metagenome and approximately 30 of the total reads remained unbinned the binning process and taxonomy assignment is a required step before the analysis of genes of interest because it allows the linkage of these genes to a specific microbial genome from the metagenome table 1 shows the 14 recovered mags ordered from highest to lowest coverage based on rna sequencing data calculated with rna bases mapped to protein coding genes chitinophagaceae and myxococcales were the most active rna coverage bacteria and also the most abundant dna coverage together with microbacterium and patescibacteria despite the high abundance of the patescibacteria mag it had low completeness the reason for this might be that the single copy genes normally used to calculate completeness are often not detected in patescibacteria genomes brown et al 2015 pseudomonas spp were low abundant in the metagenome and only present in the unbinned reads the highest blast identity match of the pfast amidase was 50 for proteins encoded on the unbinned contigs the 14 mags only contained amidases with a maximum of 30 sequence identity for the pslow isolate the highest match was 50 for proteins encoded on the unbinned contigs as well as the rubrivivax and betaproteobacteria mags since the apap concentration was below the detection limit 0 2 mg l in the bioreactor but continuously supplied with the medium inflow uncharacterized amidases might be responsible for apap biodegradation at low concentrations in the bioreactor a phylogenetic tree was created with the top 150 most expressed amidases in the metagenome the uncharacterized amidases enzymes annotated as amidase and whose function is not known present in both pseudomonas isolates and five amidases known to degrade apap obtained from literature and databases supplementary fig s4 supplementary table s1 all the uncharacterized amidases from the metagenome and the pseudomonas isolate genomes clustered together green cluster in supplementary fig s4 including four amidases known to degrade paracetamol ko et al 2010 lee et al 2015 yun et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 2020 2019 this group belongs to the amidase signature as enzyme family ec 3 5 1 4 characterized by a highly conserved signature region of approximately 160 amino acids that includes a canonical catalytic triad ser cisser lys and a gly ser rich motif ggss gs g one amidase agc74206 1 dimethoate hydrolase dmha previously reported to degrade apap chen et al 2016 did not cluster in this group supplementary fig s4 consequently there is the possibility that other amidase families are also able to transform apap for instance a histone deacetylase like amidohydrolase clustered together with the apap degrading amidase dmha suggesting its reactivity towards apap the green as amidase cluster of the phylogenetic tree in supplementary fig s4 was analyzed in more detail fig 3 the amidase gene expression level in each bin mag was added to the tree i e top 10 and the amino acid sequences were manually blasted against the ncbi non redundant protein database to improve the annotation furthermore partial sequences like one highly expressed amidase gene from betaproteobacteria eaedefln 03924 were removed from the analysis twelve amidases were identified as asp trna asn glu trna gln amidotransferase subunit gata and they all clustered together green cluster in fig 3 this type of amidase is involved in the transformation of glu trnagln to gln trnagln for the synthesis of proteins gene duplication and mutation events in this amidotransferase were probably the key contributors to the high number of uncharacterized amidases with broad substrate specificity another cluster with low bootstrap support in the phylogenetic tree of fig 3 contained highly expressed amidases top 10 of the pseudomonas genomes and the microbacterium mag red amidases in fig 3 oacklnda 05760 bkdbljdl 05334 bjlacckg 02946 the microbacterium amidase only had 91 query coverage and 63 identity to the closest amidase in the ncbi non redundant protein database this means that this amidase was sequenced for the first time and thus the evolution of amidases towards paracetamol biodegradation might be an ongoing process the microbacterium amidase was part of a highly expressed gene cluster containing a flavin reductase bjlacckg 02944 an arylformamidase bjlacckg 02945 a branched chain amino acid abc transporter bjlacckg 02947 bjlacckg 02948 bjlacckg 02949 bjlacckg 02950 bjlacckg 02951 and one oxidoreductase bjlacckg 02952 furthermore an is110 family transposase gene bjlacckg 02943 was right next to this highly expressed gene cluster four amidases known to degrade apap were also part of the phylogenetic tree cluster containing the highly expressed amidases of the pseudomonas genomes and microbacterium mag ans81375 1 arylamidase mah acp39716 2 aryl acylamidase anb41810 1 tricocarban amidase tcca afc37599 1 aryl amidase a ampa blue amidases in fig 3 three amidase genes present on the unbinned contigs were highly expressed in relation to all the unbinned protein coding genes top 10 orange amidases in fig 3 they were affiliated with actinomycetia and comamonadaceae spp kgeggeom 07080 kgeggeom 08489 kgeggeom 08132 and might also be degrading apap in the bioreactor non highly expressed amidase genes might also have the potential to degrade apap even though their genes were not strongly regulated when apap was present for instance the non highly expressed amidase oacklnda 00714 of the pfast strain was identical to the highly expressed amidase bkdbljdl 05334 of the pslow strain so it had the potential to degrade apap at slow rates but it was not highly expressed in pfast finally a multiple sequence alignment was performed with the amidases known to degrade apap except for dmha which is not part of the as family and the highly expressed amidases from the pseudomonas genomes and the metagenome supplementary file 2 lee et al previously determined the three dimensional structure of the amidase acp39716 2 with apap as a substrate lee et al 2015 they revealed several residues involved in catalysis and apap binding that we investigated in our alignment the aligned amidases contained a conserved catalytic triad ser187 cisser163 lys84 highlighted in green gly ser rich motif ggssgg in bold and oxyanion hole g ggs in bold the substrate binding pocket contained two loop regions highlighted in fair and dark grey and one α helix highlighted in blue that were less conserved in the crystal structure of acp39716 another two residues tyr136 and thr330 highlighted in yellow were described to bind to the hydroxyl group at the para position in apap via hydrogen bonds with two water molecules however thr330 was only present in approximately half of the aligned amidase sequences and tyr136 was not present in any of them thus the amidases from this study might have different substrate specificities compared to the acp39716 2 amidase furthermore we conclude that tyr136 and thr330 are not strictly necessary for apap binding and degradation 3 5 paracetamol degradation pathway highly expressed gene candidates the first step in apap biodegradation is the cleavage of the amide bond by an amidase to produce 4 ap and acetate fig 4 in each pseudomonas genome a different highly expressed amidase was identified presumably performing this cleavage oacklnda 05760 bkdbljdl 05334 in the bioreactor metagenome the microbacterium mag was the only one with a highly expressed amidase inside the as family cluster bjlacckg 02946 from which four amidases were previously reported to degrade apap fig 3 the betaproteobacteria mag also had a highly expressed uncharacterized amidase gene eaedefln 03924 however the nucleotide sequence was partial so we could not check its classification therefore microbacterium and betaproteobacteria might have been involved in transforming apap into 4 ap together with some low abundant bacteria in the unbinned group an alternative first step for apap biodegradation could be its hydroxylation to form 3 hydroxyacetaminophen a metabolite measured in soil by li et al 2014 however due to the high concentration of 4 ap in the pseudomonas experiments the cleavage of the amide bond might be the dominant mechanism the enzyme deaminating 4 ap is still unknown and we did not find an obvious gene responsible for this reaction uncharacterized rida family protein genes were highly expressed in the two pseudomonas genomes and in the microbacterium and betaproteobacteria mags oacklnda 05815 oacklnda 03065 bkdbljdl 03266 bkdbljdl 01320 bjlacckg 02940 bjlacckg 02936 eaedefln 02051 therefore these proteins might have been involved in deaminating 4 ap or deaminating the aminomuconate intermediates after ring cleavage he and spain 1998 furthermore two ammonia lyase genes were highly expressed in the genome of the pslow strain aspartate ammonia lyase and ethanolamine ammonia lyase bkdbljdl 01355 bkdbljdl 02838 however these genes were not highly expressed in the pfast genome and the metagenome from the bioreactor the investigated bacteria did not use any known hydroquinone 1 2 dioxygenase which is a type iii ring cleaving extradiol dioxygenase cupin superfamily with a catalytic mechanism analogous to that of the extradiol type dioxygenases instead the up regulated type iii extradiol dioxygenase genes present in bioreactor mags chitinophagaceae 1 2 and betaproteobacteria 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3 4 dioxygenase nlckofof 01117 jpnlmfaj 02227 eaedefln 00964 bacteroidetes rubrivivax and myxococcales 2 homogentisate 1 2 dioxygenase kgebagmn 02738 hfdflmdg 05905 opijccok 08966 might have cleaved the aromatic ring of hq to produce 4 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde as previously described żur et al 2018b fig 4 homogentisate 1 2 dioxygenase and 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3 4 dioxygenase are type iii extradiol dioxygenases able to cleave the aromatic ring of non catecholic substrates which are characterized by not having vicinal diols for example homo gentisate and hydroquinone have two hydroxyl groups in para position and 3 hydroxyanthranilate has one hydroxyl one amino and one carboxylic acid group as ring substituents these two dioxygenases are involved in the degradation of aromatic amino acids therefore bacteria might use the side activities of existing enzymes to degrade aromatic micropollutants such as apap the ring cleavage of aromatic compounds containing hydroxyl and amino substituents i e 2 aminophenol 3 hydroxyanthranilate and 5 aminosalicylate has been previously reported hintner et al 2004 li de et al 2013 takenaka et al 1997 wang et al 2020 therefore the aromatic ring of 4 ap might also be cleaved before deamination by class iii ring cleaving dioxygenases however metabolites confirming this pathway have not yet been measured an alternative route for the direct ring cleavage of hq is the hydroxylation of hq to form hydroxyquinol 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene and later the ring cleavage of hydroxyquinol by an intradiol type dioxygenase ferraroni et al 2005 takenaka et al 2003 or an extradiol type dioxygenase probably from the vicinal oxygen chelate voc or type i superfamily murakami et al 1999 fig 4 catechol has been previously measured during apap microbial degradation dai et al 2021 ivshina et al 2005 suggesting that it could be a transformation product that is further cleaved by intradiol type or extradiol type dioxygenases the hydroxylation of hq can be performed by ring hydroxylating dioxygenases or monooxygenases in the pfast isolate genome an uncharacterized ring hydroxylating dioxygenase oacklnda 03401 and an intradiol catechol 1 2 dioxygenase oacklnda 05722 were highly expressed furthermore two uncharacterized extradiol type dioxygenases were highly expressed in both pseudomonas isolate genomes oacklnda 01459 bkdbljdl 01807 these dioxygenases were similar to 4 5 dopa dioxygenase which is part of the voc extradiol dioxygenases wang et al 2019 in the bioreactor the rubrivivax mag had a phenol hydroxylase hfdflmdg 03468 hfdflmdg 03467 hfdflmdg 03466 an uncharacterized ring hydroxylating dioxygenase hfdflmdg 03024 a 4 hydroxybenzoate 3 monooxygenase hfdflmdg 05635 and a extradiol protocatechuate 4 5 dioxygenase hfdflmdg 01086 hfdflmdg 01087 highly expressed the microbacterium mag contained a highly expressed voc extradiol 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetate homoprotocatechuate 2 3 dioxygenase involved in the degradation of tyrosine bjlacckg 03009 the betaproteobacteria mag had a putative ring hydroxylating dioxygenase eaedefln 00364 and a 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase eaedefln 02889 able to hydroxylate and decarboxylate aromatic rings in the tyrosine degradation pathway many other mags contained this gene up regulated i e bacteroidetes comamonadaceae and myxococcales 2 kgebagmn 02075 jmgbclmb 02041 opijccok 08967 finally the alicycliphilus mag had a highly expressed gene cluster containing an mfs transporter mdklgidk 02282 a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter substrate binding protein mdklgidk 02283 an muconolactone d isomerase mdklgidk 02284 an 3 oxoadipate enol lactonase mdklgidk 02285 a 1 6 dihydroxycyclohexa 2 4 diene 1 carboxylate dehydrogenase mdklgidk 02286 an intradiol catechol 1 2 dioxygenase gene mdklgidk 02287 and a muconate cycloisomerase mdklgidk 02288 this highly expressed gene cluster suggests the ability of alicycliphilus to fully degrade hydroxyquinol via the oxoadipate pathway interestingly the alicycliphilus mag had hydroquinone dioxygenase genes mdklgidk 00653 mdklgidk 00654 that were not highly expressed acetyl coa synthetase genes and genes encoding enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid tca and glyoxylate cycles isocitrate lyase were highly expressed in the transcriptome of both pseudomonas spp and several mags i e microbacterium rubrivivax alycicliphilus and actinomycetales thus indicating their ability to grow on acetate after cleaving the apap amide bond or via cross feeding from other bacteria fig 4 finally the highly expressed gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase family protein could be involved in the conversion of muconolactone intermediates to eventually reach the tca cycle for bacterial growth in the pseudomonas isolates oacklnda 03472 bkdbljdl 01962 the microbacterium rubrivivax and betaproteobacteria mags had highly expressed dioxygenases but they did not have up regulated genes belonging to the β ketoadipate pathway involved in the conversion of aromatic metabolites into tca intermediates therefore it is unclear whether they were able to assimilate aromatic compounds or not furthermore the rubrivivax and alicycliphilus mags did not have any highly expressed amidase from the as family suggesting that cross feeding of acetate and aromatic intermediates was happening in the bioreactor the myxococcales family is known for its diverse metabolism and its predatory nature so the two bioreactor mags affiliated to the myxococcales family might have lived from the metabolites and cellular components of decaying microorganisms müller et al 2016 similarly the chitinophagaceae family is known to degrade complex organic matter and therefore the three bioreactor mags affiliated to the chitinophagaceae family could also have been biomass recyclers in the bioreactor morin et al 2020 the highest expressed metabolic genes of these mags were involved in the tca cycle gluconeogenesis and metabolism of lipids peptidoglycan nucleotides and amino acids thus not providing many hints about their exact catabolism or energy source similarly the metabolism of bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinomycetales and comamonadaceae mags was ambiguous and they might also be predators or biomass recyclers in addition we found that type ii and type iv secretion systems were highly expressed in several mags i e acidobacteria comamonadaceae which might have been involved in predation defense and conjugation activities between microorganisms aharon et al 2021 sgro et al 2019 however some of these mags might also degrade apap transformation products via their highly expressed dioxygenases i e chitinophagaceae 1 2 bacteroidetes myxococcales 2 the patescibacteria mag mostly contained genes encoding carbohydrate degrading enzymes so it might have thrived in symbiosis with other microbial community members that produced exopolysaccharides 3 6 highly expressed nitrification and denitrification genes in the bioreactor the majority of the mags except for patescibacteria and myxococcales 1 had highly expressed genes encoding enzymes from the denitrification pathway all four genes encoding the full pathway of denitrification could only be found in one mag affiliated with alicycliphilus denitrificans as well as the in the unbinned contigs nitrate reductase nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase the bioreactor was fully aerated but biomass was spatially organized in small granules supplementary fig s5 so there might have been anoxic conditions towards the inside of the granules favoring denitrification nitrate and nitrite were not added to the medium so nitrifying microorganisms were apparently also active in the bioreactor a single highly expressed ammonia monooxygenase subunits a b c kgeggeom 12202 kgeggeom 12201 kgeggeom 12203 was encoded in the unbinned contigs and affiliated with the complete ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira sp this finding suggests that some ammonia released from decaying biomass from the paracetamol degradation and from the ammonia supply in the medium intended for assimilation 1 mm was converted into nitrate by comammox nitrospira sp and subsequently available for oxygen limited denitrification 4 conclusions on the basis of our cultivation and metagenomic analysis we conclude that apap was immediately degraded by the activated sludge of a hospital wwtp and that a diverse microbial community was enriched under low apap concentrations in a membrane bioreactor high apap concentrations in batch led to the dominance of a fast growing pseudomonas species several uncharacterized amidases from the as family were highly expressed in the genome of a fast and a slow growing pseudomonas species and the bioreactor metagenome they might be cleaving apap into 4 ap at different rates genes encoding for uncharacterized rida family proteins were highly expressed in the genome of the pseudomonas isolates and several bioreactor mags they are known to have deaminase activity so they might be converting 4 ap to hq or cleaving reactive enamine intermediates genes encoding for intradiol and extradiol type dioxygenases were highly expressed in the genomes of the pseudomonas isolates and the bioreactor metagenome many of these genes are part of the degradation pathway of aromatic amino acids therefore microorganisms might take advantage of the side activities of existing enzymes encoded in their genomes for the degradation of apap transformation products candidate apap degrading amidases deaminases and dioxygenases were not combined in the same gene cluster highly expressed genes encoding amidases were often found in the vicinity of mobile genetic elements which suggests that apap degrading amidase genes are currently being exchanged between different bacteria via hgt taken together these results suggest a role of uncharacterized amidases deaminases and dioxygenases in the biodegradation of apap and the use of cross feeding to efficiently degrade apap in wwtp microbial communities furthermore the high number of microorganisms able to degrade apap might be the result of the broad substrate spectrum of amidases and its evolution together with the fact that just one enzyme amidase is needed to grow on apap derived acetate this study contributes to a better understanding of microbial evolution towards pharmaceutical biodegradation and demonstrates the complexity

19929,nitrification the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite is important for many engineered water treatment systems the sequential steps of this respiratory process are carried out by distinct microbial guilds including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and newly discovered members of the genus nitrospira that conduct complete ammonia oxidation comammox even though all of these nitrifiers have been identified within water treatment systems their relative contributions to nitrogen cycling are poorly understood although aoa contribute to nitrification in many wastewater treatment plants they are generally outnumbered by aob in contrast aoa and comammox nitrospira typically dominate relatively low ammonia environments such as drinking water treatment tertiary wastewater treatment systems and aquaculture aquarium filtration studies that focus on the abundance of ammonia oxidizers may misconstrue the actual role that distinct nitrifying guilds play in a system understanding which ammonia oxidizers are active is useful for further optimization of engineered systems that rely on nitrifiers for ammonia removal this review highlights known distributions of aoa and comammox nitrospira in engineered water treatment systems and suggests future research directions that will help assess their contributions to nitrification and identify factors that influence their distributions and activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification ammonia oxidizing archaea nitrospira comammox ammonia oxidation water treatment amoa introduction human activities produce domestic and commercial wastewater containing high concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen which is frequently treated to prevent negative impacts for receiving waters an important part of this treatment is nitrification which is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate a key step in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen fig 1 ammonia is toxic to aquatic life in relatively low concentrations and although ammonia and nitrate both contribute to eutrophication in nitrogen limited waters nitrate is generally preferable because it has no direct oxygen demand can be further converted to nitrogen gas by anaerobic respiration e g denitrification and anammox and has comparatively low toxicity for aquatic organisms nitrification is an important function within many natural and engineered environments and involves two aerobic respiratory steps ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation fig 1 for over 100 years only chemolithoautotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob were thought to catalyze ammonia oxidation these characterized nitrifiers belonged to the phylum proteobacteria with most species affiliated with the burkholderiales formerly betaproteobacteria i e nitrosomonas nitrosospira and others belonging to the chromatiales i e nitrosococcus all now classified within the class gammaproteobacteria purkhold et al 2000 fig 2 first predicted by marine metagenomics treusch et al 2005 venter et al 2004 and then demonstrated by a pure culture isolated from a marine aquarium könneke et al 2005 members of the thermoproteota formerly thaumarchaeota can also oxidize ammonia ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa an anaerobic counterpart anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is carried out by six bacterial genera associated with the planktomycetota formerly planctomycetes strous et al 1999 the second step of nitrification nitrite oxidation is performed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob that are taxonomically diverse and belong to four different phyla i e proteobacteria nitrospinota nitrospirota and chloroflexota daims et al 2016 although the two steps of aerobic nitrification were long thought to be carried out by distinct microorganisms theoretical predictions indicated that these steps could be conducted by individual microorganisms capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox and that such microorganisms were likely to exist in the environment costa et al 2006 comammox bacteria were hypothesized to have high growth yields low growth rates and be competitive in biofilm habitats where ammonia mass transfer is low a decade after the prediction of the existence of microorganisms mediating comammox bacteria of the genus nitrospira fig 2 capable of carrying out both ammonia and nitrite oxidation were reported simultaneously by two research groups daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 many studies have explored the diversity abundance and activity of aoa in soil marine freshwater estuary and hot spring environments fig 2 given their recent discovery less is known about the distribution and activity of comammox nitrospira many engineered systems are specifically designed to reduce ammonia loads by promoting nitrification such as domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps aquarium filters aquaculture operations and drinking water treatment systems to enhance nitrogen removal and system operations a more fundamental understanding of the community ecology and activity of ammonia oxidizers is essential exploring factors involved in niche differentiation of the three nitrifying guilds provides a basis for controlling nitrification recent reviews have focused on the presence and role of nitrospira species in engineered systems mehrani et al 2020 applied biotechnological potential of comammox lawson and lücker 2018 or the ecophysiology of comammox nitrospira in various ecosystems koch et al 2018 given the relatively recent discoveries of aoa and comammox nitrospira in engineered systems this review focuses on summarizing recent literature examining the abundance distribution and activity of nitrifiers in water treatment systems ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa the aoa are broadly distributed in soil tourna et al 2011 marine qin et al 2014 and freshwater french et al 2012 environments in addition to wwtps li et al 2016 sauder et al 2017 aoa can be classified into five main clusters based on phylogeny of the amoa gene which encodes the active subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase amo enzyme that catalyzes the first step of ammonia oxidation pester et al 2012 the main clusters broadly distribute within group i 1a marine group which includes nitrosopumilus maritimus könneke et al 2005 and group i 1b soil group which includes nitrososphaera viennensis tourna et al 2011 fig 2 all cultivated aoa are thus far considered chemolithoautotrophs because they gain energy from ammonia oxidation and fix carbon dioxide into biomass e g könneke et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 walker et al 2010 previously aoa were considered to have a higher affinity for ammonia than aob martens habbena et al 2009 which confers an advantage in ammonia limited environments but recent evidence suggests that cell surface area to volume ratios explain observed variations in affinity jung et al 2021 indeed such high ratios could help explain a dominance of some aoa and potentially comammox nitrospira in low ammonia environments such as oligotrophic waters the reported affinities of aoa for ammonia vary widely depending on species with nh3 half saturation constant km values from 3 nm for nitrosopumilus maritimus martens habbena et al 2009 to 4 4 µm for candidatus nitrosotenuis uzonensis kits et al 2017 in comparison aob typically have km values of 6 to 11 µm but oligotrophic aob have been reported to have nh3 km values in the range of 0 3 to 4 0 µm putting them in a similar range as known aoa hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 lehtovirta morley 2018 prosser and nicol 2012 this complicates a view of niche partitioning of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms based on ammonia affinity alone complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox bacteria existing enrichment cultures of comammox nitrospira originate from engineered environments including the trickling filter of an aquaculture system and a hot water pipe from a deep oil exploration well daims et al 2015 sakoula et al 2021a van kessel et al 2015 these aquatic habitats provide a surface for attached growth and are relatively oligotrophic consistent with the predicted niche for comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 subsequently comammox nitrospira were discovered via metagenomics in a drinking water treatment plant again processing water with relatively low ammonia concentrations pinto et al 2015 since the initial discovery of comammox nitrospira inopinata has been isolated in pure culture facilitating study of its growth kinetics kits et al 2017 known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira lineage ii daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which is widespread in diverse marine freshwater soil geothermal and engineered environments daims et al 2016 2001 in addition to enzymes that carry out nitrite oxidization such as nitrite oxidoreductase nxr comammox nitrospira genomes encode genes for enzymes that catalyze ammonia oxidation including amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao the amo encoding genes of comammox nitrospira are phylogenetically distinct from those of aoa and aob although they cluster more closely with aob daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 fig 2 based on analysis of amoa genes affiliated with lineage ii nitrospira daims et al 2015 identified two distinct clades of comammox nitrospira clades a and b all existing cultivated species of comammox nitrospira belong to clade a fig 2 among known nitrospira only comammox nitrospira encode for ammonia oxidation genes and therefore identification of comammox nitrospira can be established through phylogenetic analysis of the amoa gene fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 all cultivated comammox nitrospira are considered chemolithotrophs because they gain energy from complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 recent studies examined substrate affinity and kinetics of n inopinata pure culture and ca n kreftii a highly enriched culture revealing that both species have high apparent ammonia affinities reported km app of 49 83 nm and 36 nm nh3 respectively especially compared to aob kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021a only the marine aoa representative n maritimus has a higher reported ammonia affinity than n inopinata kits et al 2017 as mentioned earlier for aoa it is interesting to speculate that the surface area to volume ratio may also account for the high substrate affinity exhibited by comammox nitrospira however given the known gradient of ammonia affinities for aoa and aob hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 and with only one pure culture of comammox nitrospira with which to study affinity it is premature to conclude that this characteristic of high ammonia affinity is broadly applicable to all comammox nitrospira as more comammox nitrospira strains become available in pure culture their kinetic characterization will help clarify why comammox nitrospira appear to have a higher substrate affinity and how that impacts niche differentiation aoa and comammox nitrospira in wastewater treatment systems despite the importance of nitrifying microorganisms in wastewater treatment the relative contributions of aoa comammox nitrospira and aob to wastewater nitrification remain unclear in general wastewater contains relatively high concentrations of ammonia which should favor aob over aoa and comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2009 schleper 2010 indeed many studies have reported the numerical dominance of aob in municipal and industrial wwtps e g mussmann et al 2011 wells et al 2009 zheng et al 2021 and a high abundance of comammox nitrospira have been detected in tertiary treatment systems which have relatively low ammonia concentrations spasov et al 2020 wastewater aoa were first identified based on archaeal amoa genes in dna extracts from activated sludge of five municipal wwtps and sequencing revealed that the majority of these aoa belonged to the group i 1b zhang et al 2009 subsequent studies demonstrated that aoa communities vary across wwtps because of differing operational parameters oishi et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 another study sampled a single municipal wwtp weekly for one year and found that aoa were present in only 15 of the samples and were approximately 1000 fold less abundant than aob wells et al 2009 several studies have corroborated these findings and demonstrated numerical dominance of aob for example a survey of 52 industrial and municipal wwtps in europe found that aob were numerically dominant in all but four wwtps mussmann et al 2011 in additional studies of various types of wwtps in beijing both aoa and aob were detected in a majority of samples but aob were numerically dominant in both municipal and industrial wwtps gao et al 2013 2014 additionally aob were reported to outnumber aoa in municipal wwtps fan et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 wwtp effluent huo et al 2017 a wwtp treating landfill leachate yapsakli et al 2011 and nitrifying bioreactors gao et al 2016 the authors indicate that variable operating parameters such as temperature dissolved oxygen concentration short solids retention time sensitivity to toxic compounds and nitrate concentration as a possible explanation for the observed high aob abundance although no single factor appeared to govern the coexistence of aoa and aob in wwtps despite many studies showing numerical dominance of aob in wwtps some have found approximately equal abundances of aoa and aob limpiyakorn et al 2011 reddy et al 2014 sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 or reported aoa as numerically dominant limpiyakorn et al 2011 pan et al 2018a roy et al 2017 sauder et al 2017 a survey of six municipal and industrial wwtps determined that although both aoa and aob were present in all samples aob dominated industrial coking and dyeing treatment plants whereas aoa were more abundant in municipal wwtps bai et al 2012 in several municipal wwtps group i 1b aoa outnumbered aob chen et al 2017 pornkulwat et al 2018 sauder et al 2017 demonstrating that municipal wwtps are not exclusively dominated by aob moreover pornkulwat et al 2018 used dna stable isotope probing dna sip to demonstrate that both aob and aoa incorporated 13c labelled bicarbonate in the presence of ammonia suggesting that both aob and aoa grow chemolithoautotrophically within the studied wwtp several studies have investigated the influence of ammonia on the relative abundance of aoa and aob in wwtps and suggested that ammonia concentrations are an important factor for shaping ammonia oxidizing communities when quantifying aoa and aob amoa genes in sludge samples incubation with high ammonia concentrations repressed transcription of archaeal but not bacterial amoa genes fukushima et al 2012 limpiyakorn et al 2011 another study obtained municipal wwtp sludge with approximately equal numbers of aoa and aob and demonstrated that upon incubation with high ammonia concentrations aoa abundances declined whereas aob population sizes were stable sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 in the rotating biological contactors rbcs of a municipal wwtp relative aoa abundances increased as ammonia concentrations decreased suggesting a low ammonia niche for these aoa sauder et al 2012 although ammonia concentrations appear to influence ammonia oxidizing community composition additional factors are likely important for example temperature may play a role in the nitrifying communities of wastewater treatment systems studies have demonstrated that aoa were the dominant active ammonia oxidizers in wwtps during cold months as measured by labelled heavy carbon incorporation during autotrophic ammonia oxidation fan et al 2018 pan et al 2018b fan et al 2018 found that more aoa amoa genes were labelled than those of aob despite aob outnumbering aoa in seed sludge the active aoa were identified as ca nitrosocosmicus hydrocola formerly ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare and ca nitrososphaera evergladensis the authors suggest that aoa may be adapted to lower temperatures and may play a greater role in ammonia oxidation in wwtps during the winter months than aob in addition to substrate affinity and temperature exposure to varying levels of organic matter and metals such as copper may be an important factor involved in niche partitioning between aoa and aob cao et al 2011 previous work has shown that several aoa and aob species are inhibited by various concentrations of organic compounds clark and schmidt 1967 jung et al 2018 lehtovirta morley et al 2014 qin et al 2017 recently gwak et al 2020 revealed that several aoa and aob strains present in wwtps have varying sensitivities to organic compounds with high metal chelation potentials this study demonstrated that organic compounds like peptone and humic acids sequester copper thereby reducing availability to aoa for the production of copper containing enzymes including ammonia monooxygenase as such the addition of copper could reverse the inhibitory effects of organic compounds on aoa therefore gwak et al 2020 concluded that the reduction of copper bioavailability by metal complexing organic compounds may account for the lower abundance of aoa often observed in municipal wwtps another study examined activated sludge from a wwtp deep oxidation ditch with high levels of bioavailable copper and determined that aoa were dominant ammonia oxidizers based on both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data yang et al 2021 more recently koike et al 2022 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira in a groundwater fed bioreactor were also stimulated by copper supplementation ultimately resulting in enhanced ammonia removal efficiency the dominance of aoa and comammox nitrospira over aob in the activated sludge and groundwater fed bioreactors was explained by high copper and ammonia levels and low oxygen concentrations in the system taken together these findings suggest that aoa are relatively more dependent on copper and that this metal may play a role in niche differentiation between aoa and aob comammox nitrospira were first discovered in wwtps through screens of public database metagenomes daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and multiple amoa amplicon sequence variants asvs of clade a comammox nitrospira were found in the same wwtp pjevac et al 2017 although these clade a comammox nitrospira were less abundant than aob a substantial proportion 14 34 of the detected amoa genes were affiliated with comammox nitrospira in both activated sludge and the biofilm of another wwtp amoa genes similar to those of n inopinata were found at low relative abundance chao et al 2016 a one year study of an activated sludge wwtp system detected comammox nitrospira amoa genes at lower abundances than aob and aoa amoa fan et al 2017 similarly comammox nitrospira were not found at high abundance in wwtps in cold months pan et al 2018b however it is important to note that these latter two studies used quantitative pcr qpcr primers to specifically target amoa genes of n inopinata and not all comammox associated amoa genes thus these surveys may not have quantified all comammox nitrospira present in contrast wang et al 2018 found that comammox nitrospira were more abundant than aob in activated sludge of eight full scale wwtps comammox nitrospira have also been found ubiquitously in a study of full scale biological nutrient removal wwtps annavajhala et al 2018 demonstrating that comammox nitrospira could play a role in wwtp nitrification most studies have only detected clade a comammox nitrospira in wwtps and only one study reported clade b comammox nitrospira populations in a wwtp xia et al 2018 comammox nitrospira were dominant nitrifiers in the microaerobic stage of a lab scale biological nutrient removal reactor camejo et al 2017 with few aoa or aob present most ammonia oxidation was likely due to the detected nitrospira the comammox nitrospira enriched from this reactor were classified as ca nitrospira nitrosa additional studies reported that most comammox species detected in activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps and bioreactors with low dissolved oxygen levels were also closely related to ca n nitrosa keene et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 furthermore one study has found that comammox amoa transcript abundance either exceeded or was approximately equivalent to that of aob in six out of eight wwtps studied zheng et al 2019 most of these sequences clustered with ca n nitrosa and the authors suggest that comammox nitrospira in this cluster could be the dominant group of comammox nitrospira found in wwtps with relatively high ammonia concentrations contradicting earlier assumptions of adaptation to a low ammonia niche comammox nitrospira have been detected in several parts of wwtps including activated sludge aeration basins where ammonia concentrations are relatively high as well as rbcs used for tertiary treatment where ammonia concentration is relatively low a metagenomic study of the biofilm microbial community of rbcs found that comammox nitrospira were the dominant ammonia oxidizers present spasov et al 2020 several nitrospira metagenome assembled genomes mags encoded genes for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation showing that they were genetically capable of complete ammonia oxidation it appears that many novel comammox nitrospira populations co existed in these rbcs prior work used card mar fish on rbc biofilm samples incubated with ammonia and labelled bicarbonate to reveal mar positive nitrospira sauder et al 2017 if many of these nitrospira were comammox bacteria as demonstrated by a subsequent study of this same system spasov et al 2020 these findings likely implicate comammox nitrospira in actively fixing bicarbonate while performing comammox reactions taken together the high relative abundance and genetic diversity of those comammox nitrospira ecotypes make them ideal targets for ongoing cultivation efforts it is important to note that from the context of ammonia removal in wwtps the comammox process may disrupt other relevant processes like anammox because nitrite i e the substrate used by anammox bacteria is removed by comammox nitrospira efficient nitrification denitrification in wastewater treatment systems relies on partial ammonia removal followed by the conversion of residual ammonia and nitrite to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria therefore the interaction of comammox nitrospira with anammox bacteria requires further examination and the evaluation of the effect of comammox anammox interaction on nitrification performance stability and efficiency must be considered although many studies have quantified nitrifying microorganisms in wwtps relatively few studies have attempted to assess the relative contributions of various groups to ammonia oxidation studies that have assessed activity typically either utilize incorporation of labelled inorganic carbon in association with ammonia oxidation or use differential inhibitors of ammonia oxidation in aoa and aob in one such study pan et al 2018b used 13c labelled substrate to show that aoa and not aob nor comammox nitrospira dominate ammonia oxidation in a full scale wwtp during the winter season conversely mussmann et al 2011 detected aoa in industrial wwtps treating oil refinery waste but showed that these archaea were not mediating chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidation despite actively expressing amoa genes which was supported by a biofilm incubation experiment with similar aoa sauder et al 2017 these results challenge assumptions that aoa and aob contributions to ammonia oxidation correspond to the detection of their respective amoa genes in contrast several studies found that regardless of whether aoa or aob amoa genes dominate both aoa and aob assimilate labelled organic carbon pan et al 2018a roy et al 2017 srithep et al 2018 and the use of differential inhibitors has offered additional support demonstrating that both aoa and aob can contribute to ammonia oxidation srithep et al 2018 however others showed that aob assimilated more labelled carbon than aoa even though aoa outnumbered aob in the activated sludge samples pan et al 2018a understanding parameters relevant for shaping nitrifying microbial communities is essential for improving nitrogen removal strategies in wastewater treatment systems although aob and potentially comammox nitrospira account for most nitrification activity in municipal wastewater treatment plants it is still valuable to explore the role that aoa and comammox nitrospira play in engineered aquatic systems to this end contribution to nitrification cannot be inferred solely by measured aoa or aob abundances and it is therefore crucial to consider in situ activity of aoa and comammox nitrospira in ecological surveys of wastewater treatment systems both aoa and comammox nitrospira may play additional as yet unknown roles in wastewater treatment systems such as the biotransformation of compounds other than ammonia for example nitrososphaera gargensis and nitrospira species have been shown to transform the pharmaceuticals mianserin ranitidine asulam and fenhexamid in co metabolism with ammonia oxidation han et al 2019 li et al 2022 men et al 2016 in addition preliminary evidence suggests that aoa affiliated with the nitrosocosmicus genus may have the potential for mixotrophic growth mussmann et al 2011 sauder et al 2017 based on genetic evidence it appears that several comammox nitrospira strains have the ability to use alternate nitrogen sources such as cyanate and urea recently two comammox mags from the rbcs and one comammox mag from a full scale wwtp were shown to encode cyanate hydratase the marker gene for cyanate degradation suggesting the potential ability of comammox nitrospira to grow on cyanate in ammonia limited environments spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 several comammox nitrospira mags also recovered in spasov et al 2020 contained full sets of ure genes indicating the ability to hydrolyze urea to ammonia the capability of urea hydrolysis is common amongst canonical nob including nitrospira and is thought to be associated with a reciprocal feeding lifestyle between strict nob who are able to supply ammonia to ammonia oxidizers in exchange for nitrite production koch et al 2015 ding et al 2021 along with comammox nitrospira several aoa possess the capability to hydrolyze urea in wwtp environments providing them with alternative nitrogen energy sources yang et al 2021 given their varying abundances in wwtps and their potential metabolic versatility continued research on the distributions and in situ activity of aoa and comammox nitrospira will help determine contributions to nitrification in wwtps aoa and comammox nitrospira in drinking water systems ammonia removal is important for drinking water systems because of strict regulatory guidelines for drinking water tatari et al 2017b aoa have been detected in several nitrifying engineered biofilter environments related to drinking water treatment including granular activated carbon of drinking water treatment plants dwtps kasuga et al 2010 and groundwater treatment systems for drinking water production albers et al 2015 de vet et al 2009 2011 nagymáté et al 2016 van der wielen et al 2009 van der wielen et al 2009 used qpcr and sequencing to examine the distribution and the abundance of aob and aoa in three groundwater source drinking water treatment plants in this system aoa dominated certain stages of the drinking water systems whereas aob dominate other stages the overall abundance of aoa and aob correlated positively with ammonia removal and either negatively or positively associated with dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the treatment trains respectively these results suggest that a high dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the water might inhibit the growth of aoa van der wielen et al 2009 more recently poghosyan et al 2020 used metagenomics to examine a rapid sand filter biofilm in a dutch drinking water system and found that an aoa mag belonging to the genus nitrosoarchaeum constituted 0 2 of the overall assembled reads poghosyan et al 2020 in drinking water purification plants from tokyo japan activated carbon filters contained both aoa and aob and suggested that ozonation may govern aoa populations in the filters niu et al 2016 furthermore aoa amoa genes dominated over those of aob within household sand filters nitzsche et al 2015 in contrast in rapid sand filters treating groundwater aoa were at a low abundance compared to aob fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 roy et al 2020 tatari et al 2017b the authors suggest that the length of backwashing of the activated carbon filters and ammonia concentrations may play roles in niche differentiation many drinking water systems use chloramine for disinfection which releases ammonia as it decomposes aoa have been detected in drinking water distribution systems where nitrifying microorganisms are often considered a nuisance because they accelerate the decomposition of chloramine which decreases the residual disinfectant regan et al 2002 wang et al 2017 the growth of strict ammonia oxidizers may also pose a problem because of the production of nitrite which is also toxic lytle et al 2007 archaeal amoa genes were detected in two drinking water distribution systems in ontario canada scott et al 2015 and their presence was stable over the course of a nine month sampling period in addition aoa were detected in biofilms of simulated premise plumbing systems for drinking water delivery using both copper and pvc as pipe materials santillana et al 2016 in these actively nitrifying systems archaea were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and pcr and associated gene sequences clustered with the nitrosotenuis cluster within group i 1a since their discovery comammox amoa sequences have been found in metagenomes of drinking water distribution systems and groundwater wells daims et al 2015 using metagenomic sequence data from a drinking water plant pinto et al 2015 identified amoabc and hao genes on the same scaffold in a bin that belonged to the nitrospira genus the amoa sequence in this genome bin clustered with the amoa genes of comammox nitrospira cultures another pcr based study revealed three drinking water treatment plants and one groundwater well that contained amoa genes of both clades of comammox nitrospira pjevac et al 2017 in the groundwater well comammox nitrospira were more abundant than aoa or aob although this was not observed in one of the drinking water treatment plant samples gülay et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 several nitrospira species have been previously detected in high abundance in drinking water systems including several rapid sand filter systems albers et al 2015 fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 in groundwater fed rapid sand filters from 12 full scale dwtps clade b comammox nitrospira were the most abundant group of ammonia oxidizers present exceeding the abundance of both aoa and aob fowler et al 2018 however the role of comammox nitrospira in this system remains unclear and further research is required to determine their activity in rapid sand filters in another study four comammox nitrospira mags were retrieved from household tap water filters from singapore china and the usa demonstrating that these organisms are widely distributed in drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2017 these authors also looked for nitrifiers in other drinking water datasets in addition to their tap water samples and found evidence of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira with nitrospira frequently outnumbering other ammonia oxidizing groups taken together these studies point to a high abundance of comammox nitrospira in drinking water systems with much of the research focus on rapid sand filters these drinking water related environments are typically low in ammonia and nitrite and the rapid sand filters offer a place for biofilm growth consistent with the predicted niche of comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 overall the abundances of aoa vary greatly across different types and stages of drinking water systems and it is also unclear the extent to which aoa contribute to ammonia oxidation further work is needed to determine their activity and relative contribution to nitrification in dwtps aoa and comammox nitrospira in aquarium biofilters and aquaculture operations ammonia is a metabolic waste product excreted by fish and other aquatic organisms ammonia toxicity is of particular concern for relatively closed ecosystems such as aquaculture operations and home and commercial aquaria where ammonia can accumulate quickly to lethal concentrations in the absence of active nitrification the un ionized form of ammonia nh3 is particularly toxic to fish with chronic stress and disease associated with concentrations exceeding 0 1 mg l 1 in aquarium and aquaculture systems andrews et al 1988 parker 2002 in order to convert toxic ammonia to nitrate aquarium biofilters are designed to promote the growth of nitrifying populations using the high surface area of filter support material e g sponge ceramic or polymer and rapid flow rates of aerated water despite their importance to fish health within many industrial biofilters including aquaculture little is known of the microorganisms catalyzing nitrification in association with aquarium biofilter support material traditionally aob such as nitrosomonas spp were thought to be solely responsible for ammonia oxidation in aquatic environments including aquaria the use of aob containing aquarium supplements is widespread for promoting aquarium nitrification indeed evidence suggests that aob may play a role in aquarium nitrification for example hovanec and delong 1996 found that nitrosomonas like bacteria from the betaproteobacteria were associated with the saltwater aquaria in their study although they only detected aob in 2 of 38 freshwater aquaria despite observing vigorous nitrification rates this led the authors to conclude that an unknown group of microorganisms was performing ammonia oxidation in freshwater aquarium biofilters subsequent studies determined that nitrosomonas spp could be enriched from freshwater aquarium biofilters burrell et al 2001 indicating that they may exist in these environments at abundances too low for detection since the discovery of aoa several studies have investigated aoa in aquarium biofilters the first isolated aoa representative nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 was obtained from sediment of a marine aquarium könneke et al 2005 the n maritimus genome shares high synteny with contigs obtained from the open ocean walker et al 2010 demonstrating that this representative from an aquarium may be an important representative of aoa in natural environments furthermore ca nitrosotenuis aquarius cultivated from a freshwater aquarium biofilter demonstrates in situ ammonia oxidation activity indicating that aoa contribute to ammonia oxidation in aquarium biofilters sauder et al 2018 other studies have analyzed the diversity of aoa in aquarium biofilters urakawa et al 2008 identified the presence of amoa genes from aob and aoa in marine aquarium biofilters from a public aquarium in japan and suggested that the diversity of aoa and aob decreased in low temperature marine aquaria these studies highlight the overlooked importance of aoa in aquaria biofilters additional studies have detected aoa in marine and freshwater aquaria and have provided evidence for the numerical dominance of aoa in freshwater aquarium biofilters bagchi et al 2014 bik et al 2019 sauder et al 2011 sauder and colleagues examined saltwater and freshwater aquaria and highlighted that most aoa amoa sequences derived from freshwater and saltwater cluster separately suggesting niche adaptation of aoa to saltwater or freshwater environments additionally the ratio of aob to aoa appeared to be largely governed by aquarium ammonia concentrations sauder et al 2011 however due to their recent discovery comammox nitrospira were not considered in any of these studies a recent survey of aquarium biofilters discovered that both comammox and aoa are dominant ammonia oxidizers within freshwater biofilters mcknight and neufeld 2021 clade a comammox nitrospira were detected in all 38 freshwater biofilters sampled during the survey indicating the prevalence of comammox nitrospira in this environment was previously overlooked prior to their discovery in contrast there were no comammox nitrospira detected in the saltwater aquaria where their biofilters were either dominated by aoa or aob although the ubiquitous presence of comammox nitrospira across freshwater biofilters in this survey suggests an important role in aquarium nitrification further research is needed to confirm their activity in situ recirculating aquaculture system ras biofilters use similar strategies to wwtps to regulate water quality and share many characteristics with aquaria several studies have examined ammonia oxidizing microbial communities in aquaculture systems in all compartments and in sampled tank water of a marine shrimp ras aoa amoa genes outnumbered bacterial amoa genes by orders of magnitude and were phylogenetically related to n maritimus brown et al 2013 similarly the abundance of archaeal amoa genes was 12 fold higher than those of bacterial amoa in a freshwater ras khangembam et al 2017 in addition to aoa recent studies have identified the presence of comammox nitrospira within ras biofilters one study reported that nitrite oxidizing nitrospira and comammox nitrospira co exist in a ras filter at similar abundances bartelme et al 2017 in the filter comammox nitrospira were approximately two fold more abundant than aoa and aoa were in turn more abundant than nitrosomonas aob because nitrosomonas and nitrobacter are commonly used to model ras capacities existing models to determine capacities may be inaccurate given their exclusion of abundant nitrifiers similar to ras biofilters aquaponics systems also implement a recirculating system that combines both fish and vegetable growth with potential roles for nitrifying microbial guilds comammox nitrospira have recently been identified as the dominant ammonia oxidizers within a backyard aquaponics system based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomic data heise et al 2021 the system operated at a low steady state ammonia concentration which corresponds well to the low ammonia predicted niche of comammox nitrospira interestingly the presence of traditional aob and aoa was negligible which suggested that the nitrospira present were responsible for nitrification in the sampled sediments heise et al 2021 however the study did not assess microbial communities present in the grow beds of the system where nitrification also occurs given the low ammonia concentrations imposed by design constraints and the predicted niche of nitrifying guilds it is unsurprising that aquaculture systems can favor aoa and comammox nitrospira over aob bartelme et al 2019 overall an improved knowledge of these nitrifiers offers an opportunity to fine tune these systems by providing optimal conditions for the growth of the microorganisms that can achieve the desired nitrification rate to optimize animal production future research nitrification is a critical process in wwtps drinking water systems and aquaculture operations but understanding of the microbial contributions and controls on the process remains limited aoa and comammox nitrospira have frequently been detected in engineered water treatment systems but analyses typically focus on the relative abundances of nitrifiers without quantifying the contributions of various groups to nitrification indeed in some wwtps even the basic metabolism of aoa remains unknown given that abundant and actively growing amoa encoding archaea were not performing ammonia oxidation mussman et al 2011 determination of relative contributions from various microbial groups to nitrification in the environment remains a challenge but use of differential inhibitors stable isotope probing and creative fish strategies can help further address these questions to assess the contributions of aoa and aob to ammonia oxidation in environmental samples differential inhibitors have been used and have the potential to be applied for comammox nitrospira in addition to inhibiting aob allylthiourea atu has also been shown to inhibit ammonia oxidation in comammox nitrospira van kessel et al 2015 unpublished data which is expected given the similarity of ammonia oxidation enzymes between these groups however because atu will inhibit both aob and comammox nitrospira the contributions of each cannot be separated if they are both present in the same environment such as in incubations of wwtp biofilm that demonstrated strong inhibition by atu sauder et al 2017 it is important to note that because atu is a copper chelator it also inhibits aoa in addition to aob and comammox nitrospira albeit at a higher concentration compared to aob and comammox nitrospira ptio a nitric oxide scavenger has previously been shown to inhibit aoa and n inopinata in the rbcs ammonia oxidation was also partially inhibited by ptio indicating that the aoa or comammox nitrospira may contribute to ammonia oxidation in the rbcs additionally nitrospira were labelled with 14c bicarbonate during incubations with ammonia this labelling along with the inconsistencies in activity assessments with the differential inhibitors could be attributed to comammox nitrospira as suggested by sauder et al 2017 finding inhibitors that will selectively inhibit ammonia oxidation by discrete nitrifying groups is an important step towards quantifying their distinct contributions under environmentally relevant conditions recent research suggests that simvastatin is a selective inhibitor of ammonia oxidation by aoa which may be used to discern ammonia oxidation activity by aoa and aob zhao et al 2020 currently there are no known comammox specific inhibitors although chlorate has been proposed as an indicator of comammox nitrospira activity tatari et al 2017a the mechanism of inhibition by chlorate is thought to be due to the conversion of chlorate to chlorite by the activity of nitrite oxidoreductase and that chlorite is the true inhibitor of nitrite oxidation hynes and knowles 1983 future research should assess its effectiveness for use as a general inhibitor of comammox nitrospira to find new nitrification inhibitors that are more selective of their target group it would be important to study key differences in ammonia oxidation pathways between aoa aob and comammox nitrospira additionally it would be useful to examine other compounds that target physiological differences between nitrifying groups e g antibiotics copper dependency organic carbon compounds stable isotope probing sip is a powerful method that has been used to explore the activity of ammonia oxidizers within complex microbial communities however a major limitation of this method is cross feeding which may obscure the identity of the primary consumers of the labelled substrate however the recent development of a flow through sip technique flow sip minimizes the occurrence of cross feeding by placing microbial cells on a membrane filter while continuously flowing labelled substrate across the membrane resulting in the continual removal of labelled secondary metabolites mooshammer et al 2021 using this technique the primary nitrifiers in an activated sludge sample were determined and the authors suggest that flow sip incubations with 13c labelled bicarbonate and unlabeled ammonia in conjunction with dna or rna sip would make it possible to distinguish between comammox and canonical nob nitrospira present in a microbial community because the nob nitrospira would not be active and labelled under these conditions mooshammer et al 2021 this method holds promise in distinguishing the activity of various nitrifying groups within a given sample and doing so while allowing for exposure of sustained in situ conditions that reflect environmentally relevant substrate and product concentrations the fish method has been used in the study of nitrifying communities and has allowed researchers to explore the spatial dynamics of nitrifiers within a biofilm environment matsumoto et al 2010 okabe et al 1999 suarez et al 2019 beyond the challenge of differentiating activity of various groups of nitrifiers distinguishing canonical nob nitrospira from comammox nitrospira presents additional challenges given their phylogenetic similarity recent development of an activity based labelling method for the detection of ammonia oxidizers may help overcome the issue of comammox nitrospira identification with fish while identifying active ammonia oxidizers in a microbial community a novel activity based protein profiling abpp protocol enables the fluorescent tagging of cells containing catalytically active ammonia monooxygenase enzymes allowing for the identification of active ammonia oxidizers within a microbial community sakoula et al 2021b although the abpp was successfully shown to label active aob and comammox nitrospira this current protocol was not successful in labelling aoa cells when combining the abpp with nitrospira 16s rrna targeted fish for phylogenetic identification comammox nitrospira can be distinguished from nob nitrospira because only active comammox nitrospira will be labelled through both fish and abpp approaches in future studies these methods may enable further insight into the nitrification activity of different microbial groups in water treatment systems to fully explore the ecophysiology cellular kinetics and metabolism of aoa and comammox nitrospira and to be able to test hypotheses generated by cultivation independent methods further enrichment cultures or pure cultures are needed additional comammox nitrospira enrichment derived from wwtps and dwtps are of specific interest for comparison in the context of biochemical characteristics and niche differentiation because of their slow growth rate and low biomass yields comammox nitrospira are notoriously difficult to cultivate a combination of size based enrichment strategies cell sorting continuous feeding bioreactors and antibiotics have been used to enrich several clade a comammox nitrospira species daims et al 2015 fujitani et al 2020 kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021a takahashi et al 2020 van kessel 2015 wang et al 2021 there is an urgent need for standardized cultivation protocols that can be reliably used to cultivate comammox nitrospira the combination of cultivation dependent and cultivation independent techniques are both necessary to fill the gap in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle in engineered water treatment systems conclusion contributions to nitrification within engineered aquatic systems must now be reconsidered in light of the discovery of comammox nitrospira particularly given that several studies have reported the presence and dominance of the genus nitrospira in wwtps daims et al 2001 gruber dorninger et al 2015 kruse et al 2013 yao and peng 2017 it will be important to determine the nitrification activity of comammox nitrospira in these engineered environments as well as that of other nitrifying groups that are frequently found in the same habitats and may exhibit complex relationships for example ammonia oxidizers interact directly with nitrite oxidizers and because of this functional dependency these groups are often found co localized in aggregates providing insights into their interdependence exploring the activity and interactions of comammox nitrospira and aoa with each other and other nitrogen cycling community members will lead to a more complete understanding of factors that control ammonia removal in engineered water treatment systems and could provide insights that lead to improved design and performance of these systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

19929,nitrification the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite is important for many engineered water treatment systems the sequential steps of this respiratory process are carried out by distinct microbial guilds including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and newly discovered members of the genus nitrospira that conduct complete ammonia oxidation comammox even though all of these nitrifiers have been identified within water treatment systems their relative contributions to nitrogen cycling are poorly understood although aoa contribute to nitrification in many wastewater treatment plants they are generally outnumbered by aob in contrast aoa and comammox nitrospira typically dominate relatively low ammonia environments such as drinking water treatment tertiary wastewater treatment systems and aquaculture aquarium filtration studies that focus on the abundance of ammonia oxidizers may misconstrue the actual role that distinct nitrifying guilds play in a system understanding which ammonia oxidizers are active is useful for further optimization of engineered systems that rely on nitrifiers for ammonia removal this review highlights known distributions of aoa and comammox nitrospira in engineered water treatment systems and suggests future research directions that will help assess their contributions to nitrification and identify factors that influence their distributions and activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification ammonia oxidizing archaea nitrospira comammox ammonia oxidation water treatment amoa introduction human activities produce domestic and commercial wastewater containing high concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen which is frequently treated to prevent negative impacts for receiving waters an important part of this treatment is nitrification which is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate a key step in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen fig 1 ammonia is toxic to aquatic life in relatively low concentrations and although ammonia and nitrate both contribute to eutrophication in nitrogen limited waters nitrate is generally preferable because it has no direct oxygen demand can be further converted to nitrogen gas by anaerobic respiration e g denitrification and anammox and has comparatively low toxicity for aquatic organisms nitrification is an important function within many natural and engineered environments and involves two aerobic respiratory steps ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation fig 1 for over 100 years only chemolithoautotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob were thought to catalyze ammonia oxidation these characterized nitrifiers belonged to the phylum proteobacteria with most species affiliated with the burkholderiales formerly betaproteobacteria i e nitrosomonas nitrosospira and others belonging to the chromatiales i e nitrosococcus all now classified within the class gammaproteobacteria purkhold et al 2000 fig 2 first predicted by marine metagenomics treusch et al 2005 venter et al 2004 and then demonstrated by a pure culture isolated from a marine aquarium könneke et al 2005 members of the thermoproteota formerly thaumarchaeota can also oxidize ammonia ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa an anaerobic counterpart anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is carried out by six bacterial genera associated with the planktomycetota formerly planctomycetes strous et al 1999 the second step of nitrification nitrite oxidation is performed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob that are taxonomically diverse and belong to four different phyla i e proteobacteria nitrospinota nitrospirota and chloroflexota daims et al 2016 although the two steps of aerobic nitrification were long thought to be carried out by distinct microorganisms theoretical predictions indicated that these steps could be conducted by individual microorganisms capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox and that such microorganisms were likely to exist in the environment costa et al 2006 comammox bacteria were hypothesized to have high growth yields low growth rates and be competitive in biofilm habitats where ammonia mass transfer is low a decade after the prediction of the existence of microorganisms mediating comammox bacteria of the genus nitrospira fig 2 capable of carrying out both ammonia and nitrite oxidation were reported simultaneously by two research groups daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 many studies have explored the diversity abundance and activity of aoa in soil marine freshwater estuary and hot spring environments fig 2 given their recent discovery less is known about the distribution and activity of comammox nitrospira many engineered systems are specifically designed to reduce ammonia loads by promoting nitrification such as domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants wwtps aquarium filters aquaculture operations and drinking water treatment systems to enhance nitrogen removal and system operations a more fundamental understanding of the community ecology and activity of ammonia oxidizers is essential exploring factors involved in niche differentiation of the three nitrifying guilds provides a basis for controlling nitrification recent reviews have focused on the presence and role of nitrospira species in engineered systems mehrani et al 2020 applied biotechnological potential of comammox lawson and lücker 2018 or the ecophysiology of comammox nitrospira in various ecosystems koch et al 2018 given the relatively recent discoveries of aoa and comammox nitrospira in engineered systems this review focuses on summarizing recent literature examining the abundance distribution and activity of nitrifiers in water treatment systems ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa the aoa are broadly distributed in soil tourna et al 2011 marine qin et al 2014 and freshwater french et al 2012 environments in addition to wwtps li et al 2016 sauder et al 2017 aoa can be classified into five main clusters based on phylogeny of the amoa gene which encodes the active subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase amo enzyme that catalyzes the first step of ammonia oxidation pester et al 2012 the main clusters broadly distribute within group i 1a marine group which includes nitrosopumilus maritimus könneke et al 2005 and group i 1b soil group which includes nitrososphaera viennensis tourna et al 2011 fig 2 all cultivated aoa are thus far considered chemolithoautotrophs because they gain energy from ammonia oxidation and fix carbon dioxide into biomass e g könneke et al 2014 tourna et al 2011 walker et al 2010 previously aoa were considered to have a higher affinity for ammonia than aob martens habbena et al 2009 which confers an advantage in ammonia limited environments but recent evidence suggests that cell surface area to volume ratios explain observed variations in affinity jung et al 2021 indeed such high ratios could help explain a dominance of some aoa and potentially comammox nitrospira in low ammonia environments such as oligotrophic waters the reported affinities of aoa for ammonia vary widely depending on species with nh3 half saturation constant km values from 3 nm for nitrosopumilus maritimus martens habbena et al 2009 to 4 4 µm for candidatus nitrosotenuis uzonensis kits et al 2017 in comparison aob typically have km values of 6 to 11 µm but oligotrophic aob have been reported to have nh3 km values in the range of 0 3 to 4 0 µm putting them in a similar range as known aoa hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 lehtovirta morley 2018 prosser and nicol 2012 this complicates a view of niche partitioning of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms based on ammonia affinity alone complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox bacteria existing enrichment cultures of comammox nitrospira originate from engineered environments including the trickling filter of an aquaculture system and a hot water pipe from a deep oil exploration well daims et al 2015 sakoula et al 2021a van kessel et al 2015 these aquatic habitats provide a surface for attached growth and are relatively oligotrophic consistent with the predicted niche for comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 subsequently comammox nitrospira were discovered via metagenomics in a drinking water treatment plant again processing water with relatively low ammonia concentrations pinto et al 2015 since the initial discovery of comammox nitrospira inopinata has been isolated in pure culture facilitating study of its growth kinetics kits et al 2017 known comammox bacteria belong to nitrospira lineage ii daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which is widespread in diverse marine freshwater soil geothermal and engineered environments daims et al 2016 2001 in addition to enzymes that carry out nitrite oxidization such as nitrite oxidoreductase nxr comammox nitrospira genomes encode genes for enzymes that catalyze ammonia oxidation including amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao the amo encoding genes of comammox nitrospira are phylogenetically distinct from those of aoa and aob although they cluster more closely with aob daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 fig 2 based on analysis of amoa genes affiliated with lineage ii nitrospira daims et al 2015 identified two distinct clades of comammox nitrospira clades a and b all existing cultivated species of comammox nitrospira belong to clade a fig 2 among known nitrospira only comammox nitrospira encode for ammonia oxidation genes and therefore identification of comammox nitrospira can be established through phylogenetic analysis of the amoa gene fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 all cultivated comammox nitrospira are considered chemolithotrophs because they gain energy from complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 recent studies examined substrate affinity and kinetics of n inopinata pure culture and ca n kreftii a highly enriched culture revealing that both species have high apparent ammonia affinities reported km app of 49 83 nm and 36 nm nh3 respectively especially compared to aob kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021a only the marine aoa representative n maritimus has a higher reported ammonia affinity than n inopinata kits et al 2017 as mentioned earlier for aoa it is interesting to speculate that the surface area to volume ratio may also account for the high substrate affinity exhibited by comammox nitrospira however given the known gradient of ammonia affinities for aoa and aob hu and he 2017 kits et al 2017 and with only one pure culture of comammox nitrospira with which to study affinity it is premature to conclude that this characteristic of high ammonia affinity is broadly applicable to all comammox nitrospira as more comammox nitrospira strains become available in pure culture their kinetic characterization will help clarify why comammox nitrospira appear to have a higher substrate affinity and how that impacts niche differentiation aoa and comammox nitrospira in wastewater treatment systems despite the importance of nitrifying microorganisms in wastewater treatment the relative contributions of aoa comammox nitrospira and aob to wastewater nitrification remain unclear in general wastewater contains relatively high concentrations of ammonia which should favor aob over aoa and comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 martens habbena et al 2009 schleper 2010 indeed many studies have reported the numerical dominance of aob in municipal and industrial wwtps e g mussmann et al 2011 wells et al 2009 zheng et al 2021 and a high abundance of comammox nitrospira have been detected in tertiary treatment systems which have relatively low ammonia concentrations spasov et al 2020 wastewater aoa were first identified based on archaeal amoa genes in dna extracts from activated sludge of five municipal wwtps and sequencing revealed that the majority of these aoa belonged to the group i 1b zhang et al 2009 subsequent studies demonstrated that aoa communities vary across wwtps because of differing operational parameters oishi et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 another study sampled a single municipal wwtp weekly for one year and found that aoa were present in only 15 of the samples and were approximately 1000 fold less abundant than aob wells et al 2009 several studies have corroborated these findings and demonstrated numerical dominance of aob for example a survey of 52 industrial and municipal wwtps in europe found that aob were numerically dominant in all but four wwtps mussmann et al 2011 in additional studies of various types of wwtps in beijing both aoa and aob were detected in a majority of samples but aob were numerically dominant in both municipal and industrial wwtps gao et al 2013 2014 additionally aob were reported to outnumber aoa in municipal wwtps fan et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 wwtp effluent huo et al 2017 a wwtp treating landfill leachate yapsakli et al 2011 and nitrifying bioreactors gao et al 2016 the authors indicate that variable operating parameters such as temperature dissolved oxygen concentration short solids retention time sensitivity to toxic compounds and nitrate concentration as a possible explanation for the observed high aob abundance although no single factor appeared to govern the coexistence of aoa and aob in wwtps despite many studies showing numerical dominance of aob in wwtps some have found approximately equal abundances of aoa and aob limpiyakorn et al 2011 reddy et al 2014 sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 or reported aoa as numerically dominant limpiyakorn et al 2011 pan et al 2018a roy et al 2017 sauder et al 2017 a survey of six municipal and industrial wwtps determined that although both aoa and aob were present in all samples aob dominated industrial coking and dyeing treatment plants whereas aoa were more abundant in municipal wwtps bai et al 2012 in several municipal wwtps group i 1b aoa outnumbered aob chen et al 2017 pornkulwat et al 2018 sauder et al 2017 demonstrating that municipal wwtps are not exclusively dominated by aob moreover pornkulwat et al 2018 used dna stable isotope probing dna sip to demonstrate that both aob and aoa incorporated 13c labelled bicarbonate in the presence of ammonia suggesting that both aob and aoa grow chemolithoautotrophically within the studied wwtp several studies have investigated the influence of ammonia on the relative abundance of aoa and aob in wwtps and suggested that ammonia concentrations are an important factor for shaping ammonia oxidizing communities when quantifying aoa and aob amoa genes in sludge samples incubation with high ammonia concentrations repressed transcription of archaeal but not bacterial amoa genes fukushima et al 2012 limpiyakorn et al 2011 another study obtained municipal wwtp sludge with approximately equal numbers of aoa and aob and demonstrated that upon incubation with high ammonia concentrations aoa abundances declined whereas aob population sizes were stable sonthiphand and limpiyakorn 2011 in the rotating biological contactors rbcs of a municipal wwtp relative aoa abundances increased as ammonia concentrations decreased suggesting a low ammonia niche for these aoa sauder et al 2012 although ammonia concentrations appear to influence ammonia oxidizing community composition additional factors are likely important for example temperature may play a role in the nitrifying communities of wastewater treatment systems studies have demonstrated that aoa were the dominant active ammonia oxidizers in wwtps during cold months as measured by labelled heavy carbon incorporation during autotrophic ammonia oxidation fan et al 2018 pan et al 2018b fan et al 2018 found that more aoa amoa genes were labelled than those of aob despite aob outnumbering aoa in seed sludge the active aoa were identified as ca nitrosocosmicus hydrocola formerly ca nitrosocosmicus exaquare and ca nitrososphaera evergladensis the authors suggest that aoa may be adapted to lower temperatures and may play a greater role in ammonia oxidation in wwtps during the winter months than aob in addition to substrate affinity and temperature exposure to varying levels of organic matter and metals such as copper may be an important factor involved in niche partitioning between aoa and aob cao et al 2011 previous work has shown that several aoa and aob species are inhibited by various concentrations of organic compounds clark and schmidt 1967 jung et al 2018 lehtovirta morley et al 2014 qin et al 2017 recently gwak et al 2020 revealed that several aoa and aob strains present in wwtps have varying sensitivities to organic compounds with high metal chelation potentials this study demonstrated that organic compounds like peptone and humic acids sequester copper thereby reducing availability to aoa for the production of copper containing enzymes including ammonia monooxygenase as such the addition of copper could reverse the inhibitory effects of organic compounds on aoa therefore gwak et al 2020 concluded that the reduction of copper bioavailability by metal complexing organic compounds may account for the lower abundance of aoa often observed in municipal wwtps another study examined activated sludge from a wwtp deep oxidation ditch with high levels of bioavailable copper and determined that aoa were dominant ammonia oxidizers based on both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data yang et al 2021 more recently koike et al 2022 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira in a groundwater fed bioreactor were also stimulated by copper supplementation ultimately resulting in enhanced ammonia removal efficiency the dominance of aoa and comammox nitrospira over aob in the activated sludge and groundwater fed bioreactors was explained by high copper and ammonia levels and low oxygen concentrations in the system taken together these findings suggest that aoa are relatively more dependent on copper and that this metal may play a role in niche differentiation between aoa and aob comammox nitrospira were first discovered in wwtps through screens of public database metagenomes daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and multiple amoa amplicon sequence variants asvs of clade a comammox nitrospira were found in the same wwtp pjevac et al 2017 although these clade a comammox nitrospira were less abundant than aob a substantial proportion 14 34 of the detected amoa genes were affiliated with comammox nitrospira in both activated sludge and the biofilm of another wwtp amoa genes similar to those of n inopinata were found at low relative abundance chao et al 2016 a one year study of an activated sludge wwtp system detected comammox nitrospira amoa genes at lower abundances than aob and aoa amoa fan et al 2017 similarly comammox nitrospira were not found at high abundance in wwtps in cold months pan et al 2018b however it is important to note that these latter two studies used quantitative pcr qpcr primers to specifically target amoa genes of n inopinata and not all comammox associated amoa genes thus these surveys may not have quantified all comammox nitrospira present in contrast wang et al 2018 found that comammox nitrospira were more abundant than aob in activated sludge of eight full scale wwtps comammox nitrospira have also been found ubiquitously in a study of full scale biological nutrient removal wwtps annavajhala et al 2018 demonstrating that comammox nitrospira could play a role in wwtp nitrification most studies have only detected clade a comammox nitrospira in wwtps and only one study reported clade b comammox nitrospira populations in a wwtp xia et al 2018 comammox nitrospira were dominant nitrifiers in the microaerobic stage of a lab scale biological nutrient removal reactor camejo et al 2017 with few aoa or aob present most ammonia oxidation was likely due to the detected nitrospira the comammox nitrospira enriched from this reactor were classified as ca nitrospira nitrosa additional studies reported that most comammox species detected in activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps and bioreactors with low dissolved oxygen levels were also closely related to ca n nitrosa keene et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 furthermore one study has found that comammox amoa transcript abundance either exceeded or was approximately equivalent to that of aob in six out of eight wwtps studied zheng et al 2019 most of these sequences clustered with ca n nitrosa and the authors suggest that comammox nitrospira in this cluster could be the dominant group of comammox nitrospira found in wwtps with relatively high ammonia concentrations contradicting earlier assumptions of adaptation to a low ammonia niche comammox nitrospira have been detected in several parts of wwtps including activated sludge aeration basins where ammonia concentrations are relatively high as well as rbcs used for tertiary treatment where ammonia concentration is relatively low a metagenomic study of the biofilm microbial community of rbcs found that comammox nitrospira were the dominant ammonia oxidizers present spasov et al 2020 several nitrospira metagenome assembled genomes mags encoded genes for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation showing that they were genetically capable of complete ammonia oxidation it appears that many novel comammox nitrospira populations co existed in these rbcs prior work used card mar fish on rbc biofilm samples incubated with ammonia and labelled bicarbonate to reveal mar positive nitrospira sauder et al 2017 if many of these nitrospira were comammox bacteria as demonstrated by a subsequent study of this same system spasov et al 2020 these findings likely implicate comammox nitrospira in actively fixing bicarbonate while performing comammox reactions taken together the high relative abundance and genetic diversity of those comammox nitrospira ecotypes make them ideal targets for ongoing cultivation efforts it is important to note that from the context of ammonia removal in wwtps the comammox process may disrupt other relevant processes like anammox because nitrite i e the substrate used by anammox bacteria is removed by comammox nitrospira efficient nitrification denitrification in wastewater treatment systems relies on partial ammonia removal followed by the conversion of residual ammonia and nitrite to nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria therefore the interaction of comammox nitrospira with anammox bacteria requires further examination and the evaluation of the effect of comammox anammox interaction on nitrification performance stability and efficiency must be considered although many studies have quantified nitrifying microorganisms in wwtps relatively few studies have attempted to assess the relative contributions of various groups to ammonia oxidation studies that have assessed activity typically either utilize incorporation of labelled inorganic carbon in association with ammonia oxidation or use differential inhibitors of ammonia oxidation in aoa and aob in one such study pan et al 2018b used 13c labelled substrate to show that aoa and not aob nor comammox nitrospira dominate ammonia oxidation in a full scale wwtp during the winter season conversely mussmann et al 2011 detected aoa in industrial wwtps treating oil refinery waste but showed that these archaea were not mediating chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidation despite actively expressing amoa genes which was supported by a biofilm incubation experiment with similar aoa sauder et al 2017 these results challenge assumptions that aoa and aob contributions to ammonia oxidation correspond to the detection of their respective amoa genes in contrast several studies found that regardless of whether aoa or aob amoa genes dominate both aoa and aob assimilate labelled organic carbon pan et al 2018a roy et al 2017 srithep et al 2018 and the use of differential inhibitors has offered additional support demonstrating that both aoa and aob can contribute to ammonia oxidation srithep et al 2018 however others showed that aob assimilated more labelled carbon than aoa even though aoa outnumbered aob in the activated sludge samples pan et al 2018a understanding parameters relevant for shaping nitrifying microbial communities is essential for improving nitrogen removal strategies in wastewater treatment systems although aob and potentially comammox nitrospira account for most nitrification activity in municipal wastewater treatment plants it is still valuable to explore the role that aoa and comammox nitrospira play in engineered aquatic systems to this end contribution to nitrification cannot be inferred solely by measured aoa or aob abundances and it is therefore crucial to consider in situ activity of aoa and comammox nitrospira in ecological surveys of wastewater treatment systems both aoa and comammox nitrospira may play additional as yet unknown roles in wastewater treatment systems such as the biotransformation of compounds other than ammonia for example nitrososphaera gargensis and nitrospira species have been shown to transform the pharmaceuticals mianserin ranitidine asulam and fenhexamid in co metabolism with ammonia oxidation han et al 2019 li et al 2022 men et al 2016 in addition preliminary evidence suggests that aoa affiliated with the nitrosocosmicus genus may have the potential for mixotrophic growth mussmann et al 2011 sauder et al 2017 based on genetic evidence it appears that several comammox nitrospira strains have the ability to use alternate nitrogen sources such as cyanate and urea recently two comammox mags from the rbcs and one comammox mag from a full scale wwtp were shown to encode cyanate hydratase the marker gene for cyanate degradation suggesting the potential ability of comammox nitrospira to grow on cyanate in ammonia limited environments spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 several comammox nitrospira mags also recovered in spasov et al 2020 contained full sets of ure genes indicating the ability to hydrolyze urea to ammonia the capability of urea hydrolysis is common amongst canonical nob including nitrospira and is thought to be associated with a reciprocal feeding lifestyle between strict nob who are able to supply ammonia to ammonia oxidizers in exchange for nitrite production koch et al 2015 ding et al 2021 along with comammox nitrospira several aoa possess the capability to hydrolyze urea in wwtp environments providing them with alternative nitrogen energy sources yang et al 2021 given their varying abundances in wwtps and their potential metabolic versatility continued research on the distributions and in situ activity of aoa and comammox nitrospira will help determine contributions to nitrification in wwtps aoa and comammox nitrospira in drinking water systems ammonia removal is important for drinking water systems because of strict regulatory guidelines for drinking water tatari et al 2017b aoa have been detected in several nitrifying engineered biofilter environments related to drinking water treatment including granular activated carbon of drinking water treatment plants dwtps kasuga et al 2010 and groundwater treatment systems for drinking water production albers et al 2015 de vet et al 2009 2011 nagymáté et al 2016 van der wielen et al 2009 van der wielen et al 2009 used qpcr and sequencing to examine the distribution and the abundance of aob and aoa in three groundwater source drinking water treatment plants in this system aoa dominated certain stages of the drinking water systems whereas aob dominate other stages the overall abundance of aoa and aob correlated positively with ammonia removal and either negatively or positively associated with dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the treatment trains respectively these results suggest that a high dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the water might inhibit the growth of aoa van der wielen et al 2009 more recently poghosyan et al 2020 used metagenomics to examine a rapid sand filter biofilm in a dutch drinking water system and found that an aoa mag belonging to the genus nitrosoarchaeum constituted 0 2 of the overall assembled reads poghosyan et al 2020 in drinking water purification plants from tokyo japan activated carbon filters contained both aoa and aob and suggested that ozonation may govern aoa populations in the filters niu et al 2016 furthermore aoa amoa genes dominated over those of aob within household sand filters nitzsche et al 2015 in contrast in rapid sand filters treating groundwater aoa were at a low abundance compared to aob fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 roy et al 2020 tatari et al 2017b the authors suggest that the length of backwashing of the activated carbon filters and ammonia concentrations may play roles in niche differentiation many drinking water systems use chloramine for disinfection which releases ammonia as it decomposes aoa have been detected in drinking water distribution systems where nitrifying microorganisms are often considered a nuisance because they accelerate the decomposition of chloramine which decreases the residual disinfectant regan et al 2002 wang et al 2017 the growth of strict ammonia oxidizers may also pose a problem because of the production of nitrite which is also toxic lytle et al 2007 archaeal amoa genes were detected in two drinking water distribution systems in ontario canada scott et al 2015 and their presence was stable over the course of a nine month sampling period in addition aoa were detected in biofilms of simulated premise plumbing systems for drinking water delivery using both copper and pvc as pipe materials santillana et al 2016 in these actively nitrifying systems archaea were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and pcr and associated gene sequences clustered with the nitrosotenuis cluster within group i 1a since their discovery comammox amoa sequences have been found in metagenomes of drinking water distribution systems and groundwater wells daims et al 2015 using metagenomic sequence data from a drinking water plant pinto et al 2015 identified amoabc and hao genes on the same scaffold in a bin that belonged to the nitrospira genus the amoa sequence in this genome bin clustered with the amoa genes of comammox nitrospira cultures another pcr based study revealed three drinking water treatment plants and one groundwater well that contained amoa genes of both clades of comammox nitrospira pjevac et al 2017 in the groundwater well comammox nitrospira were more abundant than aoa or aob although this was not observed in one of the drinking water treatment plant samples gülay et al 2019 pjevac et al 2017 several nitrospira species have been previously detected in high abundance in drinking water systems including several rapid sand filter systems albers et al 2015 fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 in groundwater fed rapid sand filters from 12 full scale dwtps clade b comammox nitrospira were the most abundant group of ammonia oxidizers present exceeding the abundance of both aoa and aob fowler et al 2018 however the role of comammox nitrospira in this system remains unclear and further research is required to determine their activity in rapid sand filters in another study four comammox nitrospira mags were retrieved from household tap water filters from singapore china and the usa demonstrating that these organisms are widely distributed in drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2017 these authors also looked for nitrifiers in other drinking water datasets in addition to their tap water samples and found evidence of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira with nitrospira frequently outnumbering other ammonia oxidizing groups taken together these studies point to a high abundance of comammox nitrospira in drinking water systems with much of the research focus on rapid sand filters these drinking water related environments are typically low in ammonia and nitrite and the rapid sand filters offer a place for biofilm growth consistent with the predicted niche of comammox nitrospira costa et al 2006 overall the abundances of aoa vary greatly across different types and stages of drinking water systems and it is also unclear the extent to which aoa contribute to ammonia oxidation further work is needed to determine their activity and relative contribution to nitrification in dwtps aoa and comammox nitrospira in aquarium biofilters and aquaculture operations ammonia is a metabolic waste product excreted by fish and other aquatic organisms ammonia toxicity is of particular concern for relatively closed ecosystems such as aquaculture operations and home and commercial aquaria where ammonia can accumulate quickly to lethal concentrations in the absence of active nitrification the un ionized form of ammonia nh3 is particularly toxic to fish with chronic stress and disease associated with concentrations exceeding 0 1 mg l 1 in aquarium and aquaculture systems andrews et al 1988 parker 2002 in order to convert toxic ammonia to nitrate aquarium biofilters are designed to promote the growth of nitrifying populations using the high surface area of filter support material e g sponge ceramic or polymer and rapid flow rates of aerated water despite their importance to fish health within many industrial biofilters including aquaculture little is known of the microorganisms catalyzing nitrification in association with aquarium biofilter support material traditionally aob such as nitrosomonas spp were thought to be solely responsible for ammonia oxidation in aquatic environments including aquaria the use of aob containing aquarium supplements is widespread for promoting aquarium nitrification indeed evidence suggests that aob may play a role in aquarium nitrification for example hovanec and delong 1996 found that nitrosomonas like bacteria from the betaproteobacteria were associated with the saltwater aquaria in their study although they only detected aob in 2 of 38 freshwater aquaria despite observing vigorous nitrification rates this led the authors to conclude that an unknown group of microorganisms was performing ammonia oxidation in freshwater aquarium biofilters subsequent studies determined that nitrosomonas spp could be enriched from freshwater aquarium biofilters burrell et al 2001 indicating that they may exist in these environments at abundances too low for detection since the discovery of aoa several studies have investigated aoa in aquarium biofilters the first isolated aoa representative nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 was obtained from sediment of a marine aquarium könneke et al 2005 the n maritimus genome shares high synteny with contigs obtained from the open ocean walker et al 2010 demonstrating that this representative from an aquarium may be an important representative of aoa in natural environments furthermore ca nitrosotenuis aquarius cultivated from a freshwater aquarium biofilter demonstrates in situ ammonia oxidation activity indicating that aoa contribute to ammonia oxidation in aquarium biofilters sauder et al 2018 other studies have analyzed the diversity of aoa in aquarium biofilters urakawa et al 2008 identified the presence of amoa genes from aob and aoa in marine aquarium biofilters from a public aquarium in japan and suggested that the diversity of aoa and aob decreased in low temperature marine aquaria these studies highlight the overlooked importance of aoa in aquaria biofilters additional studies have detected aoa in marine and freshwater aquaria and have provided evidence for the numerical dominance of aoa in freshwater aquarium biofilters bagchi et al 2014 bik et al 2019 sauder et al 2011 sauder and colleagues examined saltwater and freshwater aquaria and highlighted that most aoa amoa sequences derived from freshwater and saltwater cluster separately suggesting niche adaptation of aoa to saltwater or freshwater environments additionally the ratio of aob to aoa appeared to be largely governed by aquarium ammonia concentrations sauder et al 2011 however due to their recent discovery comammox nitrospira were not considered in any of these studies a recent survey of aquarium biofilters discovered that both comammox and aoa are dominant ammonia oxidizers within freshwater biofilters mcknight and neufeld 2021 clade a comammox nitrospira were detected in all 38 freshwater biofilters sampled during the survey indicating the prevalence of comammox nitrospira in this environment was previously overlooked prior to their discovery in contrast there were no comammox nitrospira detected in the saltwater aquaria where their biofilters were either dominated by aoa or aob although the ubiquitous presence of comammox nitrospira across freshwater biofilters in this survey suggests an important role in aquarium nitrification further research is needed to confirm their activity in situ recirculating aquaculture system ras biofilters use similar strategies to wwtps to regulate water quality and share many characteristics with aquaria several studies have examined ammonia oxidizing microbial communities in aquaculture systems in all compartments and in sampled tank water of a marine shrimp ras aoa amoa genes outnumbered bacterial amoa genes by orders of magnitude and were phylogenetically related to n maritimus brown et al 2013 similarly the abundance of archaeal amoa genes was 12 fold higher than those of bacterial amoa in a freshwater ras khangembam et al 2017 in addition to aoa recent studies have identified the presence of comammox nitrospira within ras biofilters one study reported that nitrite oxidizing nitrospira and comammox nitrospira co exist in a ras filter at similar abundances bartelme et al 2017 in the filter comammox nitrospira were approximately two fold more abundant than aoa and aoa were in turn more abundant than nitrosomonas aob because nitrosomonas and nitrobacter are commonly used to model ras capacities existing models to determine capacities may be inaccurate given their exclusion of abundant nitrifiers similar to ras biofilters aquaponics systems also implement a recirculating system that combines both fish and vegetable growth with potential roles for nitrifying microbial guilds comammox nitrospira have recently been identified as the dominant ammonia oxidizers within a backyard aquaponics system based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomic data heise et al 2021 the system operated at a low steady state ammonia concentration which corresponds well to the low ammonia predicted niche of comammox nitrospira interestingly the presence of traditional aob and aoa was negligible which suggested that the nitrospira present were responsible for nitrification in the sampled sediments heise et al 2021 however the study did not assess microbial communities present in the grow beds of the system where nitrification also occurs given the low ammonia concentrations imposed by design constraints and the predicted niche of nitrifying guilds it is unsurprising that aquaculture systems can favor aoa and comammox nitrospira over aob bartelme et al 2019 overall an improved knowledge of these nitrifiers offers an opportunity to fine tune these systems by providing optimal conditions for the growth of the microorganisms that can achieve the desired nitrification rate to optimize animal production future research nitrification is a critical process in wwtps drinking water systems and aquaculture operations but understanding of the microbial contributions and controls on the process remains limited aoa and comammox nitrospira have frequently been detected in engineered water treatment systems but analyses typically focus on the relative abundances of nitrifiers without quantifying the contributions of various groups to nitrification indeed in some wwtps even the basic metabolism of aoa remains unknown given that abundant and actively growing amoa encoding archaea were not performing ammonia oxidation mussman et al 2011 determination of relative contributions from various microbial groups to nitrification in the environment remains a challenge but use of differential inhibitors stable isotope probing and creative fish strategies can help further address these questions to assess the contributions of aoa and aob to ammonia oxidation in environmental samples differential inhibitors have been used and have the potential to be applied for comammox nitrospira in addition to inhibiting aob allylthiourea atu has also been shown to inhibit ammonia oxidation in comammox nitrospira van kessel et al 2015 unpublished data which is expected given the similarity of ammonia oxidation enzymes between these groups however because atu will inhibit both aob and comammox nitrospira the contributions of each cannot be separated if they are both present in the same environment such as in incubations of wwtp biofilm that demonstrated strong inhibition by atu sauder et al 2017 it is important to note that because atu is a copper chelator it also inhibits aoa in addition to aob and comammox nitrospira albeit at a higher concentration compared to aob and comammox nitrospira ptio a nitric oxide scavenger has previously been shown to inhibit aoa and n inopinata in the rbcs ammonia oxidation was also partially inhibited by ptio indicating that the aoa or comammox nitrospira may contribute to ammonia oxidation in the rbcs additionally nitrospira were labelled with 14c bicarbonate during incubations with ammonia this labelling along with the inconsistencies in activity assessments with the differential inhibitors could be attributed to comammox nitrospira as suggested by sauder et al 2017 finding inhibitors that will selectively inhibit ammonia oxidation by discrete nitrifying groups is an important step towards quantifying their distinct contributions under environmentally relevant conditions recent research suggests that simvastatin is a selective inhibitor of ammonia oxidation by aoa which may be used to discern ammonia oxidation activity by aoa and aob zhao et al 2020 currently there are no known comammox specific inhibitors although chlorate has been proposed as an indicator of comammox nitrospira activity tatari et al 2017a the mechanism of inhibition by chlorate is thought to be due to the conversion of chlorate to chlorite by the activity of nitrite oxidoreductase and that chlorite is the true inhibitor of nitrite oxidation hynes and knowles 1983 future research should assess its effectiveness for use as a general inhibitor of comammox nitrospira to find new nitrification inhibitors that are more selective of their target group it would be important to study key differences in ammonia oxidation pathways between aoa aob and comammox nitrospira additionally it would be useful to examine other compounds that target physiological differences between nitrifying groups e g antibiotics copper dependency organic carbon compounds stable isotope probing sip is a powerful method that has been used to explore the activity of ammonia oxidizers within complex microbial communities however a major limitation of this method is cross feeding which may obscure the identity of the primary consumers of the labelled substrate however the recent development of a flow through sip technique flow sip minimizes the occurrence of cross feeding by placing microbial cells on a membrane filter while continuously flowing labelled substrate across the membrane resulting in the continual removal of labelled secondary metabolites mooshammer et al 2021 using this technique the primary nitrifiers in an activated sludge sample were determined and the authors suggest that flow sip incubations with 13c labelled bicarbonate and unlabeled ammonia in conjunction with dna or rna sip would make it possible to distinguish between comammox and canonical nob nitrospira present in a microbial community because the nob nitrospira would not be active and labelled under these conditions mooshammer et al 2021 this method holds promise in distinguishing the activity of various nitrifying groups within a given sample and doing so while allowing for exposure of sustained in situ conditions that reflect environmentally relevant substrate and product concentrations the fish method has been used in the study of nitrifying communities and has allowed researchers to explore the spatial dynamics of nitrifiers within a biofilm environment matsumoto et al 2010 okabe et al 1999 suarez et al 2019 beyond the challenge of differentiating activity of various groups of nitrifiers distinguishing canonical nob nitrospira from comammox nitrospira presents additional challenges given their phylogenetic similarity recent development of an activity based labelling method for the detection of ammonia oxidizers may help overcome the issue of comammox nitrospira identification with fish while identifying active ammonia oxidizers in a microbial community a novel activity based protein profiling abpp protocol enables the fluorescent tagging of cells containing catalytically active ammonia monooxygenase enzymes allowing for the identification of active ammonia oxidizers within a microbial community sakoula et al 2021b although the abpp was successfully shown to label active aob and comammox nitrospira this current protocol was not successful in labelling aoa cells when combining the abpp with nitrospira 16s rrna targeted fish for phylogenetic identification comammox nitrospira can be distinguished from nob nitrospira because only active comammox nitrospira will be labelled through both fish and abpp approaches in future studies these methods may enable further insight into the nitrification activity of different microbial groups in water treatment systems to fully explore the ecophysiology cellular kinetics and metabolism of aoa and comammox nitrospira and to be able to test hypotheses generated by cultivation independent methods further enrichment cultures or pure cultures are needed additional comammox nitrospira enrichment derived from wwtps and dwtps are of specific interest for comparison in the context of biochemical characteristics and niche differentiation because of their slow growth rate and low biomass yields comammox nitrospira are notoriously difficult to cultivate a combination of size based enrichment strategies cell sorting continuous feeding bioreactors and antibiotics have been used to enrich several clade a comammox nitrospira species daims et al 2015 fujitani et al 2020 kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021a takahashi et al 2020 van kessel 2015 wang et al 2021 there is an urgent need for standardized cultivation protocols that can be reliably used to cultivate comammox nitrospira the combination of cultivation dependent and cultivation independent techniques are both necessary to fill the gap in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle in engineered water treatment systems conclusion contributions to nitrification within engineered aquatic systems must now be reconsidered in light of the discovery of comammox nitrospira particularly given that several studies have reported the presence and dominance of the genus nitrospira in wwtps daims et al 2001 gruber dorninger et al 2015 kruse et al 2013 yao and peng 2017 it will be important to determine the nitrification activity of comammox nitrospira in these engineered environments as well as that of other nitrifying groups that are frequently found in the same habitats and may exhibit complex relationships for example ammonia oxidizers interact directly with nitrite oxidizers and because of this functional dependency these groups are often found co localized in aggregates providing insights into their interdependence exploring the activity and interactions of comammox nitrospira and aoa with each other and other nitrogen cycling community members will lead to a more complete understanding of factors that control ammonia removal in engineered water treatment systems and could provide insights that lead to improved design and performance of these systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare
