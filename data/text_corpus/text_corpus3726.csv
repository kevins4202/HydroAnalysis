18630,this study investigated the transformation of secondary amine pharmaceuticals in uv c no3 and in nitrate rich wastewater at 254 nm by taking diclofenac diphenylamine mefenamic acid and furosemide as probe compounds the degradation of targeted compounds were positively related to nitrate concentration and mainly caused by the formation of peroxynitrite and related reactive nitrogen species e g nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide radicals major transformation products were identified to provide fundamental understanding of the selective oxidation of secondary amine with reactive nitrogen species uv photolysis hydroxyl radical oxidation nitration and nitrosation processes were found to be the most significant transformation pathways in case of diphenylamine for which most of the identified intermediates were available as standard the relative significance of each transformation route could be established highlighting for the first time the important role of n nitrosation processes in uv no3 treatment followed by the decomposition of the resulting n nitroso compounds by an alpha hydroxylation mechanism this specific transformation pathway was of concern because it constitutes the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity and may contribute to the increase in effluent genotoxicity under uv c treatment in addition to the formation of nitrophenols hydrogenocarbonate ions at concentration values higher than 300 mg l appeared to be a protective specie against nitrosation processes due to the formation of carbamate adducts but h2o2 in uv c h2o2 could be responsible for an exacerbation of the n nitrosation pathway due to an addition source of hydroxyl radical in the system the occurrence of major transformation products of diclofenac was confirmed in nitrate rich wastewater under uv c treatment at pilot scale operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords secondary amine uv c phototransformation nitrate genotoxicity transformation pathway 1 introduction uv c treatment is one of the main disinfection techniques used in biological wastewater treatment plants because no addition of chemicals is required which limits the formation of toxic disinfection by products the uv c doses typically applied for disinfection 15 50 mj cm2 are not sufficient to remove organic micropollutants except the most photosensitive ones e g triclosan diclofenac sulfamethoxazole paredes et al 2018 for this specific purpose the additional use of an oxidant hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or peroxydisulfate pds is necessary miklos et al 2018 nihemaiti et al 2018 known drawbacks for the implementation of uv c treatments in nitrate no3 rich wastewater are i the potential formation of nitrite ions at concentration that can exceed the 0 1 mg l eu regulatory limit in presence of dissolved organic matter semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 and ii mutagenicity formation when this latter was measured by applying ames ii assay on concentrated water samples martijn et al 2016 consequently a post treatment with granulated activated carbon filtration or dune infiltration was recommended to reach the full removal of the genotoxic effect heringa et al 2011 genotoxicity has been linked to no3 ions photolysis and the formation of nitrated compounds e g nitrophenols kolkman et al 2015 however generated nitrophenols concentrations alone in the 10 50 ng l range semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2018 might not account for the whole genotoxicity of uv c no3 rich samples one hypothesis is the implication of nitrosation reactions because numerous nitrosamines have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic by themselves or after a metabolization step under low pressure lp uv at 254 nm no3 photolysis mainly causes the formation of peroxynitrite onoo nitrogen dioxide radical no2 and hydroxyl radical oh goldstein et al 2007 onoo is a reactive specie essential intermediate for nitrite generation but also a nitrosating agent able to quickly react particularly with secondary amines to give n nitroso derivatives sun et al 2012 nitrous anhydride n2o3 is also a strong nitrosating agent mainly resulting from the autooxidation of nitrogen oxide radical no eq 1 and from the recombination of no2 and no radicals eq 2 no can be mainly generated via the photolysis of nitrite mack and bolton 1999 through the oxidation of onoo by oh eq 3 and the photolysis of onoo eq 4 goldstein et al 1998 kissner et al 1997 1 4 no o 2 2 n 2 o 3 k 8 106 m 2s 1 2 n o n o 2 n 2 o 3 k 1 1 109 m 1s 1 3 o h onoo oh o 2 n o k 4 8 0 8 109 m 1s 1 4 onoo h v n o o 2 n2o3 being a second generation oxidant in uv c no3 system this reactive nitrogen specie might be of less significance than onoo our assumption is that the potential formation of carcinogen nitrosamines involving direct or indirect reactions of secondary amines with onoo and or n2o3 has been overlooked in uv c no3 treatment many pharmaceuticals belong to the class of secondary amines for which the formation of n nitroso derivatives is strongly expected brambilla and martelli 2007 consequently the major contribution of this work has been to investigate nitrosation reactions of secondary amine pharmaceuticals in no3 rich wastewater under lp uv c irradiation by taking diclofenac dcf mefenamic acid mef furosemide fur and diphenylamine dpa as probe compounds dcf was selected as probe compound because the dcf cytotoxicity increased after uv c treatment huang et al 2018 a mutagenic potential was found for fur photoproducts compared to the parental compound under simulated solar irradiation isidori et al 2006 the uv photolysis of the non mutagenic nitrosodpa leads to the formation of mutagens detectable in the ta98 strain with and without the s9 mix addition mestankova et al 2016 while the formation of nitroso derivatives of mef has been already evidenced in presence of nitrite no2 ions under uv c irradiation chen et al 2015 the originality of the work was therefore to demonstrate the relevance of n nitrosation reactions in uv c treatment specific aims included i investigating the degradation kinetics of probe compounds under different experimental conditions ii the identification of pharmaceuticals transformation pathways by identifying stable intermediates by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms and iii a discussion on the

hydrogenocarbonate hco3na and hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 wt in h2o were obtained from sigma aldrich acetonitrile hplc grade and isopropanol hplc grade were obtained from carlo erba val de reuil france 2 2 photochemical experiments experiments were carried out with a 0 5 l cylindrical immersion type photoreactor heraeus tq 150 model equipped with a monochromatic low pressure mercury uv lamp λ 254 nm 15 w the radiation path length inside the reactor was 2 cm water samples were either distilled water spiked successively with no3 20 mg l no2 5 mg l with a mixture of no3 20 mg l hco3 200 mg l or no3 20 mg l h2o2 1 mg l or secondary treated domestic wastewater the major physico chemical characteristics of the investigated wastewater are reported in table 1 ph was adjusted at 7 5 by dropwise addition of h2so4 1 m or naoh solution 1 m because oh quantum yields ϕ oh for the photolysis of no3 are independent of ph between ph 4 and 9 zellner et al 1990 ph remained constant during experiments dcf dpa fur and mef stock solutions 1000 ppm were prepared in acetonitrile to avoid oh scavenging because acetonitrile shows a remarkably low reactivity with oh with a second order kinetic rate constant of 8 7 106 m 1s 1 brizzolari et al 2017 initial concentration of targeted compounds was 3 mg l the intensity of the emitted lamp was determined by chemical actinometry using o nitrobenzaldehyde and was found to be 30 2 mj cm2 willet and hites 2000 and see supplementary material sm for calculations uv fluence up to 250 j cm2 was applied starting from 30 mj cm2 the reactor solution was maintained at 23 c 1 atm using a water cooled quartz immersion well the content of the immersion reactor was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer bar 400 rpm two types of control samples were included in the experiments blank and zero samples blanks were prepared in the same way as the exposed samples only omitting the target compounds zero samples were prepared for each experiment in the same way as the samples but were not exposed to the uv light samples were taken every 1 or 2 min and were stored at 20 c prior to analysis after quenching with the addition of methanol a well known oh scanvenger at high concentration 5 mm to limit as much as possible side reactions with others reactive species than oh the samples were analyzed directly using lc hrms and immediately after sampling without additional sample preparation except filtration on 0 2 μm filter for kinetic studies and for identification of phototransformation products tps quantification was carried out by using deuterated internal standard calibration typical experiments consisted of pre heating the lamp for approximately 10 min 300 ml of aqueous solution were then charged into the reactor experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results are given as a mean of these three replicates for pilot scale experiments an uv c rw reactor from bio uv company lunel france with a capacity of 3 5 m3 h was used this reactor was equipped with 3 300 w monochromatic lp uv c lamps and with mechanical cleaning wipers to minimize the influence of deposits resulting in reduced intensity over time the uv c reactor was installed on site at the outlet of a biological wastewater treatment plant with a secondary effluent containing 12 7 mgc l of toc 514 mg l hco3 17 9 mg l no3 0 24 mg l no2 195 3 mg l cl and containing dcf at a concentration level of 455 36 ng l uv transmittance uvt254 was determined by a varian uv vis spectrometer and was found to be between 58 and 62 dpa mef and fur were not detected in influent prior to lc hrms analysis solid phase extraction was conducted on 200 mg oasis hlb cartridges waters 250 ml sample was loaded on spe cartridges which were eluted with 4 ml methanol influent and effluent samples were collected right before and after the reactor 2 3 analytical methodologies the concentration of no3 no2 and chloride ions were determined using a dionex ion chromatograph with ionpac as18 column 2 250 mm the mobile phase was comprised of 1 0 mm nahco3 and 3 5 mm na2co3 for dcf dpa mef fur and their tps samples were analyzed using an ultimate 3000 dionex lc system hyphenated to a thermoscientific exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer chromatographic separation was carried out on a xterra c 18 analytical column 150 2 1 mm 3 5 μm particle size using a mobile phase consisting of a water and b acetonitrile for negative electrospray ionization esi and a mobile phase consisting of a water 0 1 formic acid and b acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid for positive electrospray ionization esi at a 0 15 ml min 1 flow rate the run started isocratically with 5 b for 5 min a gradient was then applied to raise the percentage of b from 5 to 95 in 10 min this percentage remaining constant for 5 min the column was rinsed with 100 b during 5 min and then back to initial conditions the orbitrap ms was operated in the full scan mode with a mass range from m z 50 to 600 operating conditions were the followings electrospray voltage 4 0 kv sheath gas 35 arbitrary units esi or 55 au in esi auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units both in esi and esi tube lens 70 v esi and 100 v in esi skimmer 16 v both in esi and esi and capillary voltage 65 v esi and 50 v in esi the heater in the source was set to 200 c and the heated capillary in the mass spectrometer was operated at 300 c for data processing and analysis a suspect screening workflow was used a csv database was made up of a list of possible tps with their molecular formula exact mass and structure this list was generated from a literature search of tps of dcf dpa fur and mef generated during photochemical experiments others oxidative treatments and biodegradation metabolism experiments detection and differentiation of ms features in the samples were carried out in the following steps peak detection chromatogram building chromatogram deconvolution deisotoping filtering according to peak width 0 05 1 min and peak alignment ultimately any missed peaks were re iteratively extracted based on the rt the identification of potential tps resulting from implemented workflow was based on accurate mass and isotopic pattern in ms mode their tentative structures were postulated based on the mass shift of the tp in comparison to the mass of their respective parent compound their elemental formula a maximal mass variation of 5 ppm between the measured and theoretical parent ions was allowed when applicable the measured isotope pattern matched the predicted one with an isotope pattern score of at least 70 identified tps were not present in the respective blank samples and had to be present in at least two out of three replicates in addition the identification of nitrosated and nitrated tps was easily achieved because their ms ms spectra were characterized by losses of 30 and 46 amu corresponding to no and no2 losses respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceuticals degradation kinetics all the degradation kinetics fitted pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 96 and the fluence based pseudo first order kinetic rate constants kobs and half lives were calculated accordingly in order to determine the kinetic profiles of dcf fur mef and dpa during photochemical degradation table 2 summarizes the different results obtained under different uv c irradiation conditions at ph 7 5 i e uv c no3 uv c no2 and uv c no3 rich wastewater and the degradation kinetics are shown in supplementary material fig sm 1 as expected all selected compounds underwent fast direct photolysis with kdcf kdpa kmef kfur however no3 ions 20 mg l were observed to promote degradation of all investigated compounds while degradation kinetic rates decreased in wastewater due to the shadowing and radical scavenging effects of dissolved organic matter surprisingly degradation kinetics slowed down in presence of no2 ions it is known that the production of oh is more favorable under no2 irradiation than in presence of no3 consequently it was assumed that the hydroxylation pathway was probably not the prevailing transformation pathway of targeted compounds at the beginning of the experiments the oh influence in the process of targeted compounds oxidation was assessed by the application of 2 propanol a well known oh scavenger with a second order rate constant for the reaction with oh of 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 at a high concentration of 5 mm to avoid competition to the target compounds for oh the calculated kobs values indicated a reduction of 25 28 33 and 35 for dpa dcf mef and fur respectively if compared to the values found in the non scavenged experiments these experiments confirmed the assumption that oh was not the most predominant radical specie involved in the degradation of secondary amines under uv c no3 irradiation no2 is also a generator of no under uv c irradiation but the contribution of n2o3 to the degradation of targeted compounds through no autooxidation was ruled out due to second order dependence on no in this latter reaction which implies that significant levels of n2o3 are only formed at high concentrations of no for validation of our assumptions transformation pathways of the selected secondary amine pharmaceuticals were established under uv c no3 irradiation see section 3 2 3 2 transformation pathways and degradation mechanisms of targeted pharmaceuticals under the hypothesis that onoo is the main reactive nitrogen specie in uv no3 system at 254 nm it has been acknowledged that reaction mechanisms of secondary amine with onoo mainly involve nitration nitrosation and hydroxylation reactions sun et al 2012 and imply radical mechanisms the contribution of electrophilic nitrosation processes through direct n2o3 attack cannot be ruled out but was supposed to be of minor importance mainly because the reaction between co2 hco3 and n2o3 occurred easily and this reaction leading to the formation of no2 ion served as an effective scavenger of the n2o3 nitrosating agent sun et al 2012 all identified tps during uv c no3 irradiation were cross checked with their respective negative control samples to eliminate potential false positive results the tentative structure of detected tps together with their accurate masses and retention time rt for dcf mef fur and dpa are reported in sm tables s1 s4 compounds which were also detected under direct uv c photolysis are marked with an asterisk most of tps included in these tables had been previously reported in the literature and consequently a confidence level l2b was assigned to each tp related extracted ion chromatograms eics obtained after 8 min treatment are shown in sm fig sm2 sm5 for illustration proposed transformation pathways for each targeted compound are presented in fig 1 a d and the time dependent evolution of tps during the degradation of dcf dpa mef and fur can be found in fig 2 a d where ordinates are expressed either in peak area or in concentration in case of dpa because tps were available as analytical standards using the response of the internal standards throughout the analysis the instrumental variation was approximately 20 which endorsed the quality of the data isomeric structures for certain tps were formed which were observed at different rt and denoted a and b when each isomer was clearly identified in this case each isomer was quantified separately otherwise the peak area was reported as the sum of the peak area of all the isomers the transformation of dcf see fig 1a could be attributable to direct uv c photolysis and this first pathway involved the formation of carbazole derivatives dcf258 and dcf254 by direct photolysis as previously reported keen et al 2013 surprisingly dcf254 might undergo nitrosation reactions dcf285 and the resulting nitroso compounds 3 isomers appeared to accumulate against time see fig 2a the second pathway consisted in the formation of c5 nitrodcf dcf338 confirmed by the availability of a synthesized analytical standard dcf338 concentration quickly leveled off at a value of 115 μg l after 5 min treatment the third pathway involved first hydroxylation leading to hydroxylated dcf derivatives dcf310 3 isomers including 4 and 5 hydroxydcf followed by n nitrosation n nitrosodcf could not be detected likely due to its instability under uv c irradiation however its transitional formation was indirectly evidenced by the detection of dcf67 and dcf66 indeed similarly to human metabolism by action of p450 enzymes n nitrosodcf likely underwent simultaneously to uv c degradation specific alpha hydroxylation mechanism mesic et al 2000 on the c located in position alpha to the nitroso group the resulting hydroxylated compound was not stable leading to c n bond cleavage this transformation pathway was supported by the release of dcf167 which was identified as 2 6 dichloroaniline with the use of an authentic standard and a quinone derivative dcf166 the degradation of dpa followed the same transformation pathways as dcf see fig 1b including i direct photolysis and the formation of related carbazole dpa167 and n nitrosocarbazole dpa195 ii hydroxylation dpa185 followed by n nitrosation reaction and by alpha hydroxylation reactions leading to the release of aniline dpa93 and p benzoquinone dpa108 or followed by nitrosation on the ortho position of the oh group on the aromatic ring dpa214b due to the electrophilic character of this position and iii nitration reaction leading to 4 nitrodpa dpa214a interestingly n nitrosodpa and n nitrodpa were never detected in our experiments even though these two compounds are stable since available as analytical standards this result is likely related to the strong photolability of n nitrosamines lee et al 2005 and n nitramines compounds mcquaid et al 1991 under uv c irradiation a previously suggested mechanism to account for dpa214a formation in presence of o2 tanikaga 1969 involved the formation of the unstable n nitrosodpa intermediate followed by the homolytic cleavage of the n n bond and an nitric oxide intramolecular attack to give a c nitroso derivative which was readily oxidized into a c nitrodpa however this mechanism is questionable in the absence of detection of n nitrosodpa a more reasonable mechanism might be the formation of an aminyl radical stabilized by resonance through one electron transfer oxidation processes involving co3 radical produced by the decomposition of onoocoo adducts followed by no2 reaction similarly to the formation of nitrophenols chiron et al 2010 an indirect evidence advocating in favor of this latter mechanism arose from an experiment with the addition of an oh scavenger isopropanol 10 mm limiting the decomposition of onoo into no see eq 3 but orienting its decomposition into no2 in presence of co2 sun et al 2011 in these conditions the 4 nitrodcf reached 312 μg l instead of 115 μg l without addition of isopropanol supporting the role of no2 in the nitration reaction after 5 min treatment four major tps of mef were detected and were assigned to mef254 mef302 3 isomers mef286 4 isomers and mef137 see fig 1c first mef underwent hydroxylation processes at the c located at position para of the amine group mef256 followed by either nitrosation reactions as previously reported under uv c no2 irradiation chen et al 2015 or nitration reactions however in our experiments mef137 was detected and probably resulted from alpha hydroxylation processes of a n nitroso intermediate all tps accumulated against time until 18 min of treatment and were then further transformed see fig 2c fur was selected because this compound is an alkyl aryl secondary amine in contrast to dcf and mef which are both di aryl secondary amines consequently fur might behave differently this was the case see fig 1d because nitration and nitrosation reactions were not observed while fur was phototransformed through hydroxylation fur346 and through the replacement of the chlorine atom by an hydroxyl group fur312 cleavage of the furanylmethyl group was easily observed with the release of fur250 probably following n nitrosation and alpha hydroxylation reactions similarly to dcf and mef all these tps were previously detected under simulated solar irradiation in river water jakimska et al 2014 and appeared to accumulate against time fig 2d supporting that the different transformation pathways were competitive between them and not consecutive as expected all investigated compounds were phototransformed following hydroxylation nitrosation and nitration reactions however an alpha hydroxylation pathway of unstable n nitrosamine intermediates was also common to all probe compounds and this specific transformation pathway albeit known in human metabolism was reported for the first time under photochemistry in this work to the best of our knowledge for a better understanding of the relative relevance of the different observed transformation pathways dpa was selected as a probe compound because most of reaction intermediates are commercially available enable their quantification the phototransformation of dpa was then investigated under different experimental conditions see section 3 3 3 3 relevance of n nitrosation processes and implication for effluent genotoxicity up to a uv c fluence value of 18 kj m2 a mass balance was nearly reached for dpa see fig 2b after this uv c fluence value the mass balance was not achieved as well because the detected tps likely underwent further transformations the most concentrated tps were dpa167 direct photolysis dpa214b hydroxylation followed by nitrosation dpa214a nitration and dpa93 alpha hydroxylation pathway accounting for 24 3 23 2 8 4 and 5 5 of the initial dpa concentration respectively on a molar basis dpa167 dpa214b and dpa93 appeared to be steadily degraded after 8 min treatment while dpa214a leveled off at a concentration value of 2 24 μm see fig 2b the relative relevance of the direct uv c photolysis pathway and the no3 induced photodegradation pathway could be assessed by the summing the specific tps concentrations related to each pathway for instance at a uv c fluence of 18 kj m2 the direct uv c photolysis pathway accounted for 32 8 of the total dpa degradation while the no3 induced dpa photodegradation pathway largely predominated 66 5 when adding 1 mg l h2o2 to be illustrative of an advanced uv c h2o2 oxidation system the direct photolysis pathway remained quantitatively unchanged while the alpha hydroxylation pathway was more relevant accounting for 18 1 dpa93 of the initial dpa concentration mainly at the expense of the nitration pathway due to an additional source of oh in the uv c no3 system results not shown the impact of the addition of hco3 ions was also investigated a dual effect of hco3 was anticipated first a significant positive influence of hco3 on the degradation of selected emerging contaminants mainly those with electron rich moieties including dcf in wastewater has been recently reported due to the oh scavenging by hco3 ions resulting in the preservation of radical nitrogen species e g onoo against oh attacks huang et al 2018 second nitration and nitrosation of secondary amines can be down modulated by hco3 and the equilibrated co2 due to the formation of carbamate amine adducts hco3 has even been postulated as a catalyzer of the formation of carbamate adducts sun et al 2012 by playing the role of an effective base that helps to subtract the h atom from the amine molecule and facilitates the attack of the co2 to the lone n electron pair fig 3 a shows the time evolution of dpa214a and dpa93 when uv c no3 experiments were carried out in presence of 200 mg l hco3 hco3 reduced the significance of the n nitrosation pathway and the formation of dpa93 while boosting the nitration pathway dpa214a to better clarify the dual effect of hco3 dpa phototransformation experiments were also carried out against a wide range of hco3 concentrations and the results are reported in fig 3b at low level of hco3 this latter promoted nitration and nitrosation pathways while an excess of hco3 above 300 mg l showed an inhibitory effect for these pathways in domestic wastewater where hco3 concentrations very often far exceed 300 mg l carbamate adducts should be a protecting entity against secondary amine oxidation processes in uv c no3 in addition hco3 may also serve as an effective scavenger of the nitrosating agent n2o3 since the reaction between hco3 and n2o3 readily occurs according to eq 5 and leading to its consumption 5 hco 3 n 2 o 3 co 2 hno 2 no 2 in any case the alpha hydroxylation mechanism of n nitroso compounds is of concern because it is the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity this toxicity results from the spontaneous decomposition of the hydroxylated intermediate to form diazohydroxides as well as diazonium ions which are electrophilic intermediates known to be good dna alkylating agents mesic et al 2000 uv c h2o2 treatment of no3 rich wastewater likely increase this genotoxic potential in comparison to uv c treatment since alpha hydroxylation processes are aggravated to check for the environmental significance of these transformation pathways of secondary amines the fate of dcf was investigated and confirmed during a pilot scale experiment involving uv c as a tertiary treatment of secondary treated domestic effluents with a hrt of 1 min the result of samples analysis by lc hrms after an spe extraction step is shown in fig 4 where dcf258 direct photolysis dcf285 nitrosation pathway dcf338 nitration pathway and dcf167 alpha hydroxylation pathway were detected 4 conclusions no3 ions are valuable nutrients in wastewater to be preserved as far as secondary treated wastewater reuse in crop irrigation is contemplated however their photoreactivity at 254 nm might be of concerned due to the formation of unwanted toxic by products and this point deserves to be investigated in this study we investigated the photo fate of the widely occurring secondary amine pharmaceuticals in wastewater by irradiated no3 ions our results have shown that 1 secondary amine pharmaceuticals were readily phototransformed in uv c no3 with kobs 2 6 min for dcf dpa and mef but toxic transient diazonium ions could be generated due to the decomposition of n nitroso intermediates 2 onoo was a key reactive nitrogen specie involved in the degradation of targeted compounds and was responsible of nitrosation and nitration reactions the different transformation routes of dcf were also validated under pilot scale uv c operation 3 n nitrosation was the transformation route of the highest concern because it was followed by a specific alpha hydroxylation mechanism taking place at the c located at the position alpha of the n nitroso group this latter transformation mechanism constitutes the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity and likely contributes to the increase in genotoxicity of the treated effluents after uv c treatment in addition to the well known formation of nitrophenols however this latter point requires further experimental evidences because the increase in genotoxicity might be also attributed to the changes in bulk dom 4 hco3 limits n nitrosation

constitutes the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity and may contribute to the increase in effluent genotoxicity under uv c treatment in addition to the formation of nitrophenols hydrogenocarbonate ions at concentration values higher than 300 mg l appeared to be a protective specie against nitrosation processes due to the formation of carbamate adducts but h2o2 in uv c h2o2 could be responsible for an exacerbation of the n nitrosation pathway due to an addition source of hydroxyl radical in the system the occurrence of major transformation products of diclofenac was

secondary amine pharmaceuticals in no3 rich wastewater under lp uv c irradiation by taking diclofenac dcf mefenamic acid mef furosemide fur and diphenylamine dpa as probe compounds dcf was selected as probe compound because the dcf cytotoxicity increased after uv c treatment huang et al 2018 a mutagenic potential was found for fur photoproducts compared to the parental compound under simulated solar irradiation isidori et al 2006 the uv photolysis of the non mutagenic nitrosodpa leads to the formation of mutagens detectable in the ta98 strain with and without the s9 mix addition mestankova et al 2016 while the formation of nitroso derivatives of mef has been already evidenced in presence of nitrite no2 ions under uv c irradiation chen et al 2015 the originality of the work was therefore to demonstrate the relevance of n nitrosation reactions in uv c treatment specific aims included i investigating the degradation kinetics of probe compounds under different experimental conditions ii the identification of pharmaceuticals transformation pathways by identifying stable intermediates by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms and iii a discussion on the relevance of nitrosation reactions and their potential implication in the genotoxicity of the treated wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals dcf 99 purity dpa 99 purity fur 99 purity mef 99

hydrogenocarbonate hco3na and hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 wt in h2o were obtained from sigma aldrich acetonitrile hplc grade and isopropanol hplc grade were obtained from carlo erba val de reuil france 2 2 photochemical experiments experiments were carried out with a 0 5 l cylindrical immersion type photoreactor heraeus tq 150 model equipped with a monochromatic low pressure mercury uv lamp λ 254 nm 15 w the radiation path length inside the reactor was 2 cm water samples were either distilled water spiked successively with no3 20 mg l no2 5 mg l with a mixture of no3 20 mg l hco3 200 mg l or no3 20 mg l h2o2 1 mg l or secondary treated domestic wastewater the major physico chemical characteristics of the investigated wastewater are reported in table 1 ph was adjusted at 7 5 by dropwise addition of h2so4 1 m or naoh solution 1 m because oh quantum yields ϕ oh for the photolysis of no3 are independent of ph between ph 4 and 9 zellner et al 1990 ph remained constant during experiments dcf dpa fur and mef stock solutions 1000 ppm were prepared in acetonitrile to avoid oh scavenging because acetonitrile shows a remarkably low reactivity with oh with a second order kinetic rate constant of 8 7 106 m 1s 1 brizzolari et al 2017 initial concentration of targeted compounds was 3 mg l the intensity of the emitted lamp was determined by chemical actinometry using o nitrobenzaldehyde and was found to be 30 2 mj cm2 willet and hites 2000 and see supplementary material sm for calculations uv fluence up to 250 j cm2 was applied starting from 30 mj cm2 the reactor solution was maintained at 23 c 1 atm using a water cooled quartz immersion well the content of the immersion reactor was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer bar 400 rpm two types of control samples were included in the experiments blank and zero samples blanks were prepared in the same way as the exposed samples only omitting the target compounds zero samples were prepared for each experiment in the same way as the samples but were not exposed to the uv light samples were taken every 1 or 2 min and were stored at 20 c prior to analysis after quenching with the addition of methanol a well known oh scanvenger at high concentration 5 mm to limit as much as possible side reactions with others reactive species than oh the samples were analyzed directly using lc hrms and immediately after sampling without additional sample preparation except filtration on 0 2 μm filter for kinetic studies and for identification of phototransformation products tps quantification was carried out by using deuterated internal standard calibration typical experiments consisted of pre heating the lamp for approximately 10 min 300 ml of aqueous solution were then charged into the reactor experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results are given as a mean of these three replicates for pilot scale experiments an uv c rw reactor from bio uv company lunel france with a capacity of 3 5 m3 h was used this reactor was equipped with 3 300 w monochromatic lp uv c lamps and with mechanical cleaning wipers to minimize the influence of deposits resulting in reduced intensity over time the uv c reactor was installed on site at the outlet of a biological wastewater treatment plant with a secondary effluent containing 12 7 mgc l of toc 514 mg l hco3 17 9 mg l no3 0 24 mg l no2 195 3 mg l cl and containing dcf at a concentration level of 455 36 ng l uv transmittance uvt254 was determined by a varian uv vis spectrometer and was found to be between 58 and 62 dpa mef and fur were not detected in influent prior to lc hrms analysis solid phase extraction was conducted on 200 mg oasis hlb cartridges waters 250 ml sample was loaded on spe cartridges which were eluted with 4 ml methanol influent and effluent samples were collected right before and after the reactor 2 3 analytical methodologies the concentration of no3 no2 and chloride ions were determined using a dionex ion chromatograph with ionpac as18 column 2 250 mm the mobile phase was comprised of 1 0 mm nahco3 and 3 5 mm na2co3 for dcf dpa mef fur and their tps samples were analyzed using an ultimate 3000 dionex lc system hyphenated to a thermoscientific exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer chromatographic separation was carried out on a xterra c 18 analytical column 150 2 1 mm 3 5 μm particle size using a mobile phase consisting of a water and b acetonitrile for negative electrospray ionization esi and a mobile phase consisting of a water 0 1 formic acid and b acetonitrile 0 1 formic acid for positive electrospray ionization esi at a 0 15 ml min 1 flow rate the run started isocratically with 5 b for 5 min a gradient was then applied to raise the percentage of b from 5 to 95 in 10 min this percentage remaining constant for 5 min the column was rinsed with 100 b during 5 min and then back to initial conditions the orbitrap ms was operated in the full scan mode with a mass range from m z 50 to 600 operating conditions were the followings electrospray voltage 4 0 kv sheath gas 35 arbitrary units esi or 55 au in esi auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units both in esi and esi tube lens 70 v esi and 100 v in esi skimmer 16 v both in esi and esi and capillary voltage 65 v esi and 50 v in esi the heater in the source was set to 200 c and the heated capillary in the mass spectrometer was operated at 300 c for data processing and analysis a suspect screening workflow was used a csv database was made up of a list of possible tps with their molecular formula exact mass and structure this list was generated from a literature search of tps of dcf dpa fur and mef generated during photochemical experiments others oxidative treatments and biodegradation metabolism experiments detection and differentiation of ms features in the samples were carried out in the following steps peak detection chromatogram building chromatogram deconvolution deisotoping filtering according to peak width 0 05 1 min and peak alignment ultimately any missed peaks were re iteratively extracted based on the rt the identification of potential tps resulting from implemented workflow was based on accurate mass and isotopic pattern in ms mode their tentative structures were postulated based on the mass shift of the tp in comparison to the mass of their respective parent compound their elemental formula a maximal mass variation of 5 ppm between the measured and theoretical parent ions was allowed when applicable the measured isotope pattern matched the predicted one with an isotope pattern score of at least 70 identified tps were not present in the respective blank samples and had to be present in at least two out of three replicates in addition the identification of nitrosated and nitrated tps was easily achieved because their ms ms spectra were characterized by losses of 30 and 46 amu corresponding to no and no2 losses respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 pharmaceuticals degradation kinetics all the degradation kinetics fitted pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 96 and the fluence based pseudo first order kinetic rate constants kobs and half lives were calculated accordingly in order to determine the kinetic profiles of dcf fur mef and dpa during photochemical degradation table 2 summarizes the different results obtained under different uv c irradiation conditions at ph 7 5 i e uv c no3 uv c no2 and uv c no3 rich wastewater and the degradation kinetics are shown in supplementary material fig sm 1 as expected all selected compounds underwent fast direct photolysis with kdcf kdpa kmef kfur however no3 ions 20 mg l were observed to promote degradation of all investigated compounds while degradation kinetic rates decreased in wastewater due to the shadowing and radical scavenging effects of dissolved organic matter surprisingly degradation kinetics slowed down in presence of no2 ions it is known that the production of oh is more favorable under no2 irradiation than in presence of no3 consequently it was assumed that the hydroxylation pathway was probably not the prevailing transformation pathway of targeted compounds at the beginning of the experiments the oh influence in the process of targeted compounds oxidation was assessed by the application of 2 propanol a well known oh scavenger with a second order rate constant for the reaction with oh of 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 at a high concentration of 5 mm to avoid competition to the target compounds for oh the calculated kobs values indicated a reduction of 25 28 33 and 35 for dpa dcf mef and fur respectively if compared to the values found in the non scavenged experiments these experiments confirmed the assumption that oh was not the most predominant radical specie involved in the degradation of secondary amines under uv c no3 irradiation no2 is also a generator of no under uv c irradiation but the contribution of n2o3 to the degradation of targeted compounds through no autooxidation was ruled out due to second order dependence on no in this latter reaction which implies that significant levels of n2o3 are only formed at high concentrations of no for validation of our assumptions transformation pathways of the selected secondary amine pharmaceuticals were established under uv c no3 irradiation see section 3 2 3 2 transformation pathways and degradation mechanisms of targeted pharmaceuticals under the hypothesis that onoo is the main reactive nitrogen specie in uv no3 system at 254 nm it has been acknowledged that reaction mechanisms of secondary amine with onoo mainly involve nitration nitrosation and hydroxylation reactions sun et al 2012 and imply radical mechanisms the contribution of electrophilic nitrosation processes through direct n2o3 attack cannot be ruled out but was supposed to be of minor importance mainly because the reaction between co2 hco3 and n2o3 occurred easily and this reaction leading to the formation of no2 ion served as an effective scavenger of the n2o3 nitrosating agent sun et al 2012 all identified tps during uv c no3 irradiation were cross checked with their respective negative control samples to eliminate potential false positive results the tentative structure of detected tps together with their accurate masses and retention time rt for dcf mef fur and dpa are reported in sm tables s1 s4 compounds which were also detected under direct uv c photolysis are marked with an asterisk most of tps included in these tables had been previously reported in the literature and consequently a confidence level l2b was assigned to each tp related extracted ion chromatograms eics obtained after 8 min treatment are shown in sm fig sm2 sm5 for illustration proposed transformation pathways for each targeted compound are presented in fig 1 a d and the time dependent evolution of tps during the degradation of dcf dpa mef and fur can be found in fig 2 a d where ordinates are expressed either in peak area or in concentration in case of dpa because tps were available as analytical standards using the response of the internal standards throughout the analysis the instrumental variation was approximately 20 which endorsed the quality of the data isomeric structures for certain tps were formed which were observed at different rt and denoted a and b when each isomer was clearly identified in this case each isomer was quantified separately otherwise the peak area was reported as the sum of the peak area of all the isomers the transformation of dcf see fig 1a could be attributable to direct uv c photolysis and this first pathway involved the formation of carbazole derivatives dcf258 and dcf254 by direct photolysis as previously reported keen et al 2013 surprisingly dcf254 might undergo nitrosation reactions dcf285 and the resulting nitroso compounds 3 isomers appeared to accumulate against time see fig 2a the second pathway consisted in the formation of c5 nitrodcf dcf338 confirmed by the availability of a synthesized analytical standard dcf338 concentration quickly leveled off at a value of 115 μg l after 5 min treatment the third pathway involved first hydroxylation leading to hydroxylated dcf derivatives dcf310 3 isomers including 4 and 5 hydroxydcf followed by n nitrosation n nitrosodcf could not be detected likely due to its instability under uv c irradiation however its transitional formation was indirectly evidenced by the detection of dcf67 and dcf66 indeed similarly to human metabolism by action of p450 enzymes n nitrosodcf likely underwent simultaneously to uv c degradation specific alpha hydroxylation mechanism mesic et al 2000 on the c located in position alpha to the nitroso group the resulting hydroxylated compound was not stable leading to c n bond cleavage this transformation pathway was supported by the release of dcf167 which was identified as 2 6 dichloroaniline with the use of an authentic standard and a quinone derivative dcf166 the degradation of dpa followed the same transformation pathways as dcf see fig 1b including i direct photolysis and the formation of related carbazole dpa167 and n nitrosocarbazole dpa195 ii hydroxylation dpa185 followed by n nitrosation reaction and by alpha hydroxylation reactions leading to the release of aniline dpa93 and p benzoquinone dpa108 or followed by nitrosation on the ortho position of the oh group on the aromatic ring dpa214b due to the electrophilic character of this position and iii nitration reaction leading to 4 nitrodpa dpa214a interestingly n nitrosodpa and n nitrodpa were never detected in our experiments even though these two compounds are stable since available as analytical standards this result is likely related to the strong photolability of n nitrosamines lee et al 2005 and n nitramines compounds mcquaid et al 1991 under uv c irradiation a previously suggested mechanism to account for dpa214a formation in presence of o2 tanikaga 1969 involved the formation of the unstable n nitrosodpa intermediate followed by the homolytic cleavage of the n n bond and an nitric oxide intramolecular attack to give a c nitroso derivative which was readily oxidized into a c nitrodpa however this mechanism is questionable in the absence of detection of n nitrosodpa a more reasonable mechanism might be the formation of an aminyl radical stabilized by resonance through one electron transfer oxidation processes involving co3 radical produced by the decomposition of onoocoo adducts followed by no2 reaction similarly to the formation of nitrophenols chiron et al 2010 an indirect evidence advocating in favor of this latter mechanism arose from an experiment with the addition of an oh scavenger isopropanol 10 mm limiting the decomposition of onoo into no see eq 3 but orienting its decomposition into no2 in presence of co2 sun et al 2011 in these conditions the 4 nitrodcf reached 312 μg l instead of 115 μg l without addition of isopropanol supporting the role of no2 in the nitration reaction after 5 min treatment four major tps of mef were detected and were assigned to mef254 mef302 3 isomers mef286 4 isomers and mef137 see fig 1c first mef underwent hydroxylation processes at the c located at position para of the amine group mef256 followed by either nitrosation reactions as previously reported under uv c no2 irradiation chen et al 2015 or nitration reactions however in our experiments mef137 was detected and probably resulted from alpha hydroxylation processes of a n nitroso intermediate all tps accumulated against time until 18 min of treatment and were then further transformed see fig 2c fur was selected because this compound is an alkyl aryl secondary amine in contrast to dcf and mef which are both di aryl secondary amines consequently fur might behave differently this was the case see fig 1d because nitration and nitrosation reactions were not observed while fur was phototransformed through hydroxylation fur346 and through the replacement of the chlorine atom by an hydroxyl group fur312 cleavage of the furanylmethyl group was easily observed with the release of fur250 probably following n nitrosation and alpha hydroxylation reactions similarly to dcf and mef all these tps were previously detected under simulated solar irradiation in river water jakimska et al 2014 and appeared to accumulate against time fig 2d supporting that the different transformation pathways were competitive between them and not consecutive as expected all investigated compounds were phototransformed following hydroxylation nitrosation and nitration reactions however an alpha hydroxylation pathway of unstable n nitrosamine intermediates was also common to all probe compounds and this specific transformation pathway albeit known in human metabolism was reported for the first time under photochemistry in this work to the best of our knowledge for a better understanding of the relative relevance of the different observed transformation pathways dpa was selected as a probe compound because most of reaction intermediates are commercially available enable their quantification the phototransformation of dpa was then investigated under different experimental conditions see section 3 3 3 3 relevance of n nitrosation processes and implication for effluent genotoxicity up to a uv c fluence value of 18 kj m2 a mass balance was nearly reached for dpa see fig 2b after this uv c fluence value the mass balance was not achieved as well because the detected tps likely underwent further transformations the most concentrated tps were dpa167 direct photolysis dpa214b hydroxylation followed by nitrosation dpa214a nitration and dpa93 alpha hydroxylation pathway accounting for 24 3 23 2 8 4 and 5 5 of the initial dpa concentration respectively on a molar basis dpa167 dpa214b and dpa93 appeared to be steadily degraded after 8 min treatment while dpa214a leveled off at a concentration value of 2 24 μm see fig 2b the relative relevance of the direct uv c photolysis pathway and the no3 induced photodegradation pathway could be assessed by the summing the specific tps concentrations related to each pathway for instance at a uv c fluence of 18 kj m2 the direct uv c photolysis pathway accounted for 32 8 of the total dpa degradation while the no3 induced dpa photodegradation pathway largely predominated 66 5 when adding 1 mg l h2o2 to be illustrative of an advanced uv c h2o2 oxidation system the direct photolysis pathway remained quantitatively unchanged while the alpha hydroxylation pathway was more relevant accounting for 18 1 dpa93 of the initial dpa concentration mainly at the expense of the nitration pathway due to an additional source of oh in the uv c no3 system results not shown the impact of the addition of hco3 ions was also investigated a dual effect of hco3 was anticipated first a significant positive influence of hco3 on the degradation of selected emerging contaminants mainly those with electron rich moieties including dcf in wastewater has been recently reported due to the oh scavenging by hco3 ions resulting in the preservation of radical nitrogen species e g onoo against oh attacks huang et al 2018 second nitration and nitrosation of secondary amines can be down modulated by hco3 and the equilibrated co2 due to the formation of carbamate amine adducts hco3 has even been postulated as a catalyzer of the formation of carbamate adducts sun et al 2012 by playing the role of an effective base that helps to subtract the h atom from the amine molecule and facilitates the attack of the co2 to the lone n electron pair fig 3 a shows the time evolution of dpa214a and dpa93 when uv c no3 experiments were carried out in presence of 200 mg l hco3 hco3 reduced the significance of the n nitrosation pathway and the formation of dpa93 while boosting the nitration pathway dpa214a to better clarify the dual effect of hco3 dpa phototransformation experiments were also carried out against a wide range of hco3 concentrations and the results are reported in fig 3b at low level of hco3 this latter promoted nitration and nitrosation pathways while an excess of hco3 above 300 mg l showed an inhibitory effect for these pathways in domestic wastewater where hco3 concentrations very often far exceed 300 mg l carbamate adducts should be a protecting entity against secondary amine oxidation processes in uv c no3 in addition hco3 may also serve as an effective scavenger of the nitrosating agent n2o3 since the reaction between hco3 and n2o3 readily occurs according to eq 5 and leading to its consumption 5 hco 3 n 2 o 3 co 2 hno 2 no 2 in any case the alpha hydroxylation mechanism of n nitroso compounds is of concern because it is the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity this toxicity results from the spontaneous decomposition of the hydroxylated intermediate to form diazohydroxides as well as diazonium ions which are electrophilic intermediates known to be good dna alkylating agents mesic et al 2000 uv c h2o2 treatment of no3 rich wastewater likely increase this genotoxic potential in comparison to uv c treatment since alpha hydroxylation processes are aggravated to check for the environmental significance of these transformation pathways of secondary amines the fate of dcf was investigated and confirmed during a pilot scale experiment involving uv c as a tertiary treatment of secondary treated domestic effluents with a hrt of 1 min the result of samples analysis by lc hrms after an spe extraction step is shown in fig 4 where dcf258 direct photolysis dcf285 nitrosation pathway dcf338 nitration pathway and dcf167 alpha hydroxylation pathway were detected 4 conclusions no3 ions are valuable nutrients in wastewater to be preserved as far as secondary treated wastewater reuse in crop irrigation is contemplated however their photoreactivity at 254 nm might be of concerned due to the formation of unwanted toxic by products and this point deserves to be investigated in this study we investigated the photo fate of the widely occurring secondary amine pharmaceuticals in wastewater by irradiated no3 ions our results have shown that 1 secondary amine pharmaceuticals were readily phototransformed in uv c no3 with kobs 2 6 min for dcf dpa and mef but toxic transient diazonium ions could be generated due to the decomposition of n nitroso intermediates 2 onoo was a key reactive nitrogen specie involved in the degradation of targeted compounds and was responsible of nitrosation and nitration reactions the different transformation routes of dcf were also validated under pilot scale uv c operation 3 n nitrosation was the transformation route of the highest concern because it was followed by a specific alpha hydroxylation mechanism taking place at the c located at the position alpha of the n nitroso group this latter transformation mechanism constitutes the molecular basis of n nitrosamine carcinogenicity and likely contributes to the increase in genotoxicity of the treated effluents after uv c treatment in addition to the well known formation of nitrophenols however this latter point requires further experimental evidences because the increase in genotoxicity might be also attributed to the changes in bulk dom 4 hco3 limits n nitrosation

18631,in situ sludge reduction can be achieved by inserting an anaerobic side stream reactor in the sludge return line of the conventional activated sludge cas process this modified oxic settling anaerobic osa process can reduce sludge production by 30 50 through feast fast alternating conditions this paper proposes a new bioprocess called the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process with osa configuration and the addition of sulfate in side stream reactor the new bioprocess augments the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic feast fast bioconversions with sulfur biochemical transformations i e sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification a lab scale sosa process was operated for 260 days in parallel with the anoxic oxic ao cas process and the conventional osa process as control systems based on the experimental results the feasibility of the new sosa process was evaluated and the effects of sulfur bioaugmentation on the effluent quality sludge reduction sludge physico chemical properties and microbial communities were examined the sosa process i removed 98 of the organics chemical oxygen demand cod and 99 of the ammonia present with a lower observed sludge yield 0 204 g tss g codremoved than those of the osa and ao processes 0 292 and 0 473 g tss g codremoved respectively ii denitrified 18 and 6 more nitrogen to dinitrogen gas than did the cas and osa processes respectively iii produced sludge with improved settleability and dewaterability iv encouraged sludge decomposition with greater destruction of extracellular polymeric substances and v enriched sulfur cycle related and hydrolytic fermentative bacteria the possible mechanisms of sulfur augmentation and limitations of the present study are also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ sludge reduction sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process sulfate reduction sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been widely employed for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment thanks to its high efficiency and ease of operation however the process produces a large amount of excess sludge which is undesirable inappropriate sludge disposal can cause environmental pollution and hygiene problems us epa 2007 while sludge handling may cost anywhere between 150 and 600 us ton of dried sludge ds batstone et al 2011 which is nearly 30 50 of the total operating cost of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp ferrentino et al 2016 currently the sludge production problem is particularly severe in china where approximately 60 million tons of excess sludge are produced annually yang et al 2016 treating this sludge is extremely costly up to 3 billion us year zhang et al 2017 to reduce the financial burden as well as the impact on the environment low cost and high efficiency sludge reduction technologies deserve research attention existing cas based secondary wastewater treatment units may be upgraded with in situ sludge reduction technologies carrère et al 2010 guo et al 2013 neumann et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the osa process which introduces an anaerobic side stream reactor ssr into the activated sludge return line as first proposed by westgarth et al 1964 is considered as one such technology the process recycles activated sludge through anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks to allow for energy uncoupling under feast fast alternating conditions chen et al 2003 which can reduce sludge production by about 30 50 novak et al 2007 chon et al 2011 shifting from the cas process to the osa process in the secondary wwtp requires a capital investment of only 100 160 us ton of ds and the energy input for operation is lower too 0 04 0 08 kwh per m3 of sewage treated velho et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 however the current osa technology still faces a number of technological challenges for example the anaerobic ssr with low anaerobic reaction and sludge decomposition rates requires a large amount of physical space and anaerobic treatment has a negative effect on the physico chemical properties of sludge flocs which causes a deterioration in effluent quality chon et al 2011 ferrentino et al 2016 recently the inhibitory chemicals such as free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa were found to effectively reduce sludge by 20 28 and cause no adverse impacts on mainstream performance and sludge properties wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 consequently augmentation of another inhibitory compounds sulfide in ssr might improve the sludge reduction performance therefore we propose inserting a sulfur cycle associated bioprocess into the conventional osa process and call it the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process fig 1 with appropriate utilization and well management of sulfate reduction bioprocess in environmental engineering projects a number of benefits can be expected under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria srb can use sulfate as electron acceptor to degrade organic compounds at a higher rate than that in the conventional anaerobic reaction this has been successfully demonstrated in both wastewater and sludge treatment in the full scale application of sani wu et al 2016 and biosure rose 2013 respectively the end product of anaerobic sulfate reduction sulfide dissolved in liquid is further used as electron donor to denitrify nitrogen oxidants thereby removing more nitrogen wu et al 2016 in addition the sulfide can trigger the decomposition and hydrolysis of activated sludge flocs as reported by chen et al 2018 and rose 2013 to realize such sulfur bioaugmentation in this study the anaerobic ssr was modified to a sulfidogenic ssr because of the sludge recycling between the sulfidogenic ssr and mainstream anoxic aerobic reactors the sosa process also transforms the wastewater treatment bacteria from conventional heterotrophs to low growth yield bacteria such as srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob and other facultative bacteria wu et al 2016 although the sosa process requires sulfate dosage it is still inexpensive because oxidized sulfur compounds e g sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and or elemental sulfur can be purchased at low cost from the market in this study three lab scale systems i e the proposed sosa a conventional osa and an anoxic oxic ao cas process were set up and operated in parallel for comparison purpose to evaluate the feasibility of the sosa process and the effects of the association of sulfur cycle the treatment performance and relevant biological conversions in both the mainstream reactors and the ssrs were monitored and the effects of the bioaugmentation by the sulfur cycle in sludge reduction nitrogen removal through denitrification and sludge properties including extracellular polymeric substances settleability and dewaterability were observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of lab scale ao osa and sosa systems for the ao osa and sosa systems fig 2 three 5 l sequencing batch reactors sbrs were adopted for mainstream organics cod and nitrogen removal these sbrs with identical configuration and named sbrao sbrosa sbrsosa were made of pvc and were circular with a diameter of 190 mm and a height of 250 mm all three sbrs were inoculated with the seeding sludge taken from a local wwtp and then operated in three steps step i consisted of a 1 h anoxic phase including feeding 1 25 l of synthetic sewage to the reactor for 8 min step ii involved a 2 h aerobic phase and step iii comprised settling for 0 75 h decanting for 8 min followed by an idle period of 7 min the three steps correspond to a 4 h cycle time a 25 volume exchange ratio volume of the influent per cycle volume of the sbr and a hydraulic retention time of 16 h 0 67 days a 70 mm disc diffuser was installed at the bottom of each sbr to provide air during the aerobic phase to maintain the dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 3 mg o2 l a mechanical mixer provided effective mixing 150 rpm during both anoxic and aerobic phases sbrosa and sbrsosa in the osa and sosa systems were each connected to a ssr with a liquid volume of 1 l and their ssrs were named the side stream anaerobic reactor ssrosa and the side stream sulfidogenic reactor ssrsosa respectively fig 2 a magnetic stirrer 300 rpm was applied to ensure sufficient mixing in each ssr the ssr was operated in a semi continuous mode see below no sludge produced by the osa and sosa systems was intentionally wasted the only sludge lost occurred via sampling and effluent discharge during the operation of the sbrao system 0 5 l of mixed liquor was wasted every day 83 ml cycle corresponding to a sludge retention time srt of 10 days and 7 0 l d of supernatants 1167 ml cycle were removed as effluent after settling before 7 5 l d of influent 1250 ml cycle were added the same volume of mixed liquor was removed from sbrosa and sbrsosa and 7 2 l d of supernatants 1200 ml cycle were removed as effluent after settling before 7 5 l d of influent 1250 ml cycle was added excess sludge was not wasted instead and 0 2 l d of sludge 33 ml cycle were removed from sbrosa and sbrsosa and added to ssrosa and ssrsosa after thickening the osa and sosa systems were fitted with additional sludge settlers to ensure an equivalent mixed liquor transfer between the mainstream reactors and ssrs the sludge thickening in the settler was identical to step iii in the sbrao operation the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to wang et al 2009 but without adding seawater having cod 50 of glucose and 50 of acetate nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations of 260 mg l 30 mg n l and 5 mg p l respectively the sewage temperature and ph were maintained at 22

methods are described in si 1 3 results 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 mainstream reactor performance the influent and effluent scod nh4 n no3 n tn tss and so4 2 s concentrations of the mainstream sbrs are shown in fig 3 a to f and summarized in si 2 table s2 the three mainstream sbrs of the ao osa sosa systems consistently showed high scod and ammonia removal efficiencies 98 the average scod concentrations in effluent were 3 86 3 18 2 92 3 50 and 5 30 4 57 mg o2 l in ao osa and sosa respectively the stressed conditions sulfidogenic nutrient deficiency environment in sosa induced more cell decay and caused higher soluble microbial products smp accumulation in the effluent which consequently attributed to slightly higher effluent cod the average concentrations of no3 n in the effluent of ao osa and sosa were 6 53 0 88 6 46 0 74 and 6 25 0 80 mg l with nearly no nitrite detected respectively fig 3c moreover the average tn concentrations in the effluent were 8 2 0 96 9 6 2 30 and 8 1 1 07 mg n l in the ao osa and sosa systems respectively fig 3d implying tn removal efficiencies of 67 72 osa showed a higher average effluent tss concentration 24 21 mg l than ao 12 7 mg l and sosa 13 7 mg l and was occasionally as high as 70 110 mg l fig 3e but the effluent tss of sosa was similar to that of ao and remained stable during the operating period owing to the sulfate addition from ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentration increased slightly in sosa effluent 11 13 1 87 mg s l compared to ao 4 75 1 34 mg s l fig 3f the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations in sbrosa and sbrsosa increased to 5650 180 mg l and 7600 360 mg l respectively during the stable period i e after day 140 for osa and after day 100 for sosa fig 3g but the mlss concentration in sbrao remained at around 1366 216 mg l due to the daily sludge wastage a solids balance analysis shows that the srt values of sbrosa and sbrsosa are about 148 6 and 354 16 days respectively therefore the sosa system containing the highest mass of sludge and with a longer srt could still achieve a better performance than the osa system the sulfidogenesis bioaugmentation in the sosa system did not appear to hinder the scod oxidation and nitrification denitrification bioprocesses 3 1 2 side stream reactor ssr performance the ssr inserted in the sludge return line induced sludge decay and destruction resulting in the release of secondary substrates in ssrosa and ssrsosa the operational performance of the ssrs is shown in fig 4 a to f and table s3 ssrosa and ssrsosa showed average filtered scod concentrations of 31 10 8 and 56 12 5 mg l respectively fig 4a the bulk liquid filtered scod levels in ssrs were higher than that of the system effluent which should be resulted from the sludge hydrolysis and solubilization moreover the successful enrichment of anaerobic bacteria including hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria was the other reasons the average influent nh4 n concentrations to ssrosa and ssrsosa fig 4b were low at 0 8 0 5 mg n l and 0 6 0 5 mg n l respectively due to the high nitrification efficiency in the respective sbrs the nh4 n concentration in the bulk liquid of ssrosa was stable at 30 4 7 mg l during the experimental period while the ammonia in ssrsosa increased and stabilized at 62 2 4 mg l after 131 days fig 4b these scod and nh4 n profiles confirm that activated sludge decay and hydrolysis took place in ssrosa and ssrsosa the sulfate values of the influent and effluent in ssrsosa were 259 28 2 and 184 49 9 mg s l respectively fig 4c producing approximately 75 11 mg s l of sulfide fig 4d this indicates that the srb grew on the decayed activated sludge which acted as a substrate electron donor in ssrsosa although about 40 80 mg scod l were still present in the bulk liquid no more sulfate was reduced under the designed operating conditions the exact reason is still elusive the benefit of this behavior is that relatively little sulfate is needed equivalent to requiring about 6 g so4 2 s to treat one cubic meter of sewage i e cost efficient and the mixture of scod and dissolved sulfide will provide greater denitrification potential as discussed in the next section the sludge loading rates of ssrosa and ssrsosa were increased along with the increase in the sbr sludge concentration until the mlss of ssrosa and ssrsosa became stable at about 10 and 12 g l respectively fig 4e 3 1 3 evaluation of the sludge reduction and total nitrogen denitrification the observed sludge yield yobs is represented by the slope of the cumulative sludge increase divided by the cumulative consumed substrate shown in fig 5 a which was determined by linear regression for ao the yobs of 0 473 g tss g cod was consistent with those in other studies of 0 37 0 6 g tss g cod huang et al 2014 huang and goel 2015 velho et al 2016 compared to ao osa reduced sludge production by 38 comparable to previous studies khursheed and kazmi 2011 chon et al 2011 wang et al 2017 velho et al 2016 a higher sludge reduction was achieved by sosa 57 compared with ao which indicates that sulfidogenesis bioaugmentation in the ssr intensified sludge destruction chen et al 2018 although ao osa and sosa have similar tn removal efficiencies in terms of mainstream bulk liquid removal we should note that the nitrogen removal through denitrification was different among the three systems the nitrogen mass balance in these three systems can be expressed as tn in influent tn in effluent organic n captured in activated sludge tn removal through denitrification to n2 from this equation tn removal through denitrification could be calculated the cumulative tn removal through denitrification is plotted against the cumulative tn introduction in fig 5b and the total nitrogen removal efficiency via denitrification is represented by the slope of the line which was also determined by linear regression all r2 0 995 from fig 5b the overall tn removal efficiencies through denitrification were about 67 79 and 85 in the ao osa and sosa systems respectively as a result the sosa process was 18 and 6 more efficient in terms of nitrogen denitrification than the conventional ao and osa processes this indicated that with a comparable tn concentration in the effluent but lower sludge production sosa removed more nitrogen than did ao and osa probably via autotrophic denitrification using sulfide as electron donor which should be verified in the future study 3 2 effect on sludge properties the sem images of sludge in the ao osa and sosa systems are shown in fig s1 it can be seen that all sludge aggregates were colonized by a large number of bacteria and embedded in eps and filamentous colloids to form a compact sludge structure the surface of the ao sludge flocs was rough and the cells had a regular spherical shape figs s1a and b with a heavy accumulation of eps eps are very important to activated sludge flocs and contains proteins polysaccharides and other organic matter they play key roles in cell adhesion communication and protection sheng et al 2010 in the osa system the sludge floc surface was partially fragmented and were irregular in shape the sludge flocs were also covered with eps or other precipitates figs s1c and d the sludge flocs in sosa are smaller with a smooth surface figs s1e and f which may indicate a much lower level of eps in ssrsosa than in ssrosa eps degradation is important for sludge reduction and system stability chon et al 2011 in this study the total amount of eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and the compositions of eps in term of proteins pn polysaccharides ps and humic like substances hs were measured for ao osa and sosa sludge samples see fig 6 a d and table s4 the total eps of the activated sludge in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa were 120 17 102 18 and 57 7 mg cod g vss respectively showing that sbrosa and sbrsosa sludge contained 15 and 53 less eps than did sbrao sludge moreover the total eps of ssrosa and ssrsosa sludge could be further reduced to 86 10 and 49 10 mg cod g vss respectively comparing to ao osa system only decomposed tb eps while sosa system decomposed both lb eps and tb eps corresponding to a relative high lb tb eps ratio 0 17 0 20 for osa but maintained at similar level of 0 12 0 15 to that of ao system 0 14 moreover we found the pn and ps of sosa were 23 89 27 50 mg g vss and 7 19 8 79 mg g vss respectively which only accounted for about 50 of the pn and ps levels in ao system eps reduction can affect the integrity of sludge flocs and consequently improve sludge settleability in mainstream sbrs sheng et al 2010 in this study sludge settleability was measured in terms of svi30 lower values mean better settleability as shown in fig 6e the average svi30 of sosa sludge was 129 20 ml g tss and slightly lower than that of ao sludge 136 32 ml g tss osa sludge had the worst settleability as the svi30 increased to 168 22 ml g tss which was close to that observed by velho et al 2016 therefore under sulfidogenic side stream conditions the sosa system did not show a poor sludge settleability like the osa system did indeed an improvement in svi30 was observed which was generally better than conventional activated sludge sludge dewaterability in the three systems was measured with the cst fig 6f dewaterability is an important factor governing the dosage of chemicals and energy consumption for sludge dewatering the cst values of sbrao and sbrsosa sludge were similar at 67 4 and 55 3 s respectively but the cst value of sbrosa sludge was the highest at 97 5 s these results confirm that the sludge from the sosa system with sulfidogenesis side stream bioaugmentation had better dewatering potential i e more energy efficient 3 3 effect on microbial communities 3 3 1 taxonomic complexity of the bacterial community sosa had a more diverse and evenly distributed microbial community than did ao and osa owing to the highest shannon indexes table s5 the relative abundance of microbial communities in the three systems is shown in fig s2 at the phylum level a total of 23 26 and 27 bacterial phyla were identified in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa respectively while 26 and 29 phyla were detected in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively proteobacteria as the dominant phylum decreased in the order of ao osa and sosa meanwhile the phyla of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi that related to eps degradation and carbohydrate degradation respectively were more abundant in sosa and osa than ao semblante et al 2017 weissbrodt et al 2014 the nitrifying bacteria nitrospirae were slightly more enriched in both sosa 3 2 and 1 7 in sbrsosa and ssrsosa respectively and osa 3 6 and 5 9 in sbrosa and ssrosa respectively than in ao only 1 0 in sbrao further comparison of the microbial community evolution in the three systems after ssr augmentation was carried out at the genus level shown in fig 7 raoultella as the most dominant genus in sbrao 21 9 and sbrosa 11 3 is affiliated to the enterobacteriaceae family and is able to carry out anoxic denitrification bao et al 2007 however it decreased to 4 7 in ssrosa and dropped even further in ssrsosa 2 3 and sbrsosa 1 9 the dominant denitrifying bacteria in sosa were paracoccus 8 5 in sbrsosa and 11 9 in ssrsosa while the relative abundance of this genus was much lower in ao and osa 0 5 0 8 ferruginibacter was enriched in osa and sosa especially in ssrosa 7 0 and ssrsosa 5 7 azospira as the second most dominant genus in ao 8 5 reduced to 3 5 4 6 in osa and dropped even further to 0 4 0 6 in sosa the relative abundance of ignavibacterium increased after ssr insertion a higher abundance was detected in sosa 4 0 7 5 but a lower abundance in osa 1 4 2 6 however the unclassified genus affiliated to the family ignavibacteriaceae in ao accounted for 19 6 the nitrifying bacteria nitrospira was particularly enriched in sbrosa 3 64 and sbrsosa 3 23 compared with sbrao 0 95 while this genus might be inhibited in sulfidogenic conditions as its abundance decreased from 5 95 to 1 69 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively other genera including zavarzinella 4 8 5 8 azonexus 5 8 aridibacter 2 6 4 0 leptolinea 1 6 4 2 and longilinea 1 3 2 2 were particularly enriched in sosa compared with ao and osa 0 2 0 7 0 6 1 2 0 6 0 8 0 0 2 and 0 0 3 respectively in addition to cod and nitrogen phosphorus was also removed through an enhanced biological phosphorus removal pathway this was verified in a typical cycle study whose results are shown in fig s4 therefore polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos were identified with sub databases of accumulibacter and competibacter defluvicoccus related tetrad forming organisms tfos two types of paos generally affiliated to the family rhodocyclaceae fig s3a were assigned to accumulibacter which is one of the most abundant paos in wwtps he et al 2008 mielczarek et al 2013 the level of azospira 3 45 8 22 the dominant accumulibacter in ao and osa systems was about two times higher in ao than in osa but less than 1 in sosa azonexus was only enriched in sbrsosa 5 76 and sbrosa 1 20 for the gao like bacteria no genes were similarities to defluvicoccus related tfos but two unclassified types generally affiliated to gammaproteobacteria were assigned to competibacter fig s3b the abundance of gaos was low in ao competibacter related to the unclassified gammaproteobacteria 2 was only enriched in ssrsosa at 2 05 and the other unclassified gammaproteobacteria 1 was only enriched in osa with a higher abundance of 7 20 7 89 both competibacter types were found in sbrsosa but at a lower abundance of just 1 3 3 2 predicted potential function of bacterial community the potential functional characteristics of the microbial community in ao osa and sosa were predicted with the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust based on the 16s high throughput sequencing kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg data fig 8 a the predicted genes fell into four major functional groups of the genes metabolism 53 3 54 6 genetic information processing 19 4 20 1 environmental information processing 12 2 13 7 and cellular processes 7 6 8 4 the highest abundance of genes in the metabolism category was for amino acid metabolism 10 2 10 8 followed by carbohydrate metabolism 10 2 10 7 and energy metabolism 6 3 6 5 the relative abundances for carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism in sosa were increased by 4 9 and 11 1 respectively compared with ao which indicates that the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in the sosa microbial community was enhanced the subgroup of energy production and conversion was further analyzed based on the kegg database fig 8b notably the relative abundance for phosphorus metabolism was higher in sosa 1 6 1 7 and osa 1 5 1 6 than in ao 1 4 the sulfur metabolism gene abundance in sosa was 0 4 the relative abundance of sulfur metabolism enzymes was also analyzed shown in fig 8c dsra achieved the highest value in ssrsosa and was 6 5 times higher in sosa than in ao as for the functional enzymes for phosphorus removal fig 8d polyphosphate kinase ppk and exopolypase ppx are two important ones in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system guo et al 2017 the sosa and osa microbial communities were predicted to have higher ppk abundance than the ao microbial community while the ppx abundance showed the opposite trend the abundance of poly 3 hydroxyalkanoate synthetase pha in ssrsosa was decreased by 33 37 compared with the other four samples which may indicate that the sulfidogenic conditions inhibit the poly hyddroxyalkanoates pha biosynthesis process the main nitrogen removal pathways were further investigated as shown in fig 8d a high abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification was detected in the sludge samples however a very low abundance of ammonia oxidation enzymes ammonia monooxygenase amo was found in all samples hence not shown in fig 8d which was also found in previous studies guo et al 2017 ye et al 2012 as the three systems showed good nitrification efficiencies during the experimental period the low abundance of amo might have resulted from the limited number of reference genes in the database 4 discussion 4 1 sulfur cycle bioaugmentation for sludge reduction the possible reasons for sludge reduction are further discussed eps destruction and degradation is considered to be one of the most important mechanisms in the osa process chon et al 2011 novak et al 2007 park 2007 in this study the activated sludge of sosa showed lower eps than those of ao and osa reductions of 53 and 45 respectively the intensified eps reduction probably resulted from the sulfidogenic bioaugmentation in ssrsosa sulfide as a strong reducing reagent could precipitate the metals in eps inducing sludge floc disintegration wilén et al 2000 nielsen and keiding 1998 moreover the intensified eps destruction in the sosa process could provide more secondary substrate total dissolved sulfide for mainstream autotrophic denitrification thereby enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency which was also coincident with the lowest sludge yield and the highest tn removal efficiency of the three systems the insertion of the ssrs in osa and sosa induced sludge decay resulting in the solubilization of low molecular weight cellular organics which is considered a further key step of in situ sludge reduction yang et al 2016 the scod in ssrsosa was always higher than that in ssrosa and the ammonia release was almost twice as high in ssrsosa which are good indicators of intensified sludge lysis and dissolved organic matter dom release in ssrsosa moreover sosa achieved almost double the decay rate of osa 0 041 0 0004 d 1 vs 0 021 0 0021 d 1 as observed in batch tests as described in si 7 sulfide in the bulk liquid can penetrate the cell walls of microorganisms thereby inhibiting cell metabolism and increasing the sludge decay rate rubio rincón et al 2017 vela et al 2018 sosa maintained an ultra long srt which is favorable for lower sludge production because more energy is required for cell maintenance van loosdrecht and henze 1999 massé et al 2006 chon et al 2011 kim et al 2012 however to directly extend the srt of the conventional ao process would require a much bigger reactor and degrade the effluent quality and in particular result in a high tss concentration in the effluent chon et al 2011 the sbr ssr configuration adopted in this study is the most used configuration in laboratory scale application with a closed sludge loop no intentional sludge wastage considering the practical application of sosa the potential configurations of sosa fig s5 could be realized by coupling sulfidogenic ssr with membrane bioreactor mbr modified ludzack ettinger mle process and so on the limitations of this study should be noted in particular we have not determined the oxygen utilization rate for mainstream sbr operation hence we could not analyze the cod distribution for the entire system and determine the oxygen demand this will be investigated in the near future based on the current evidence we speculate that the oxygen demand of the sosa process would be higher than that of the ao process because some of the sludge destroyed by anaerobic sulfur augmentation would be oxidized by nitrate nitrite i e oxidized from ammonia and dissolved oxygen rather than completely oxidized by sulfate this will also be further studied in the near future 4 2 dynamics of microbial communities the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria slow growing bacteria and predatory bacteria in osa sosa as well as unique sulfur related bacteria with slow growth in sosa is crucial for sludge reduction cheng et al 2017 ferrentino et al 2016 the dominant hydrolytic bacteria related to sludge reduction in the three systems included the phylum of unclassified bacteroidetes the families of xanthomonadaceae saprospiraceae and caldilineaceae the classes of bacteroidia and clostridia and the genus of haliangium cheng et al 2017 pang et al 2018 the total relative abundances of hydrolytic bacteria were 3 7 27 5 and 17 5 in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa while they accounted for 19 4 and 9 9 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively the results indicate that hydrolytic bacteria were more abundant in osa and sosa the starvation conditions provided by ssrosa and ssrsosa induced sludge decay lysis and particulate organic matter pom release which led to facultative hydrolysis bacteria proliferation in hydrolyzing pom and the products of dom were utilized for lysis cryptic growth higher hydrolytic bacteria activity in the mainstream sbrs resulting from the facultative ssr enriched hydrolytic bacteria augments utilization of substrates dissolved organics in the sbrs and assists the hydrolysis of particulate organics the fermentative bacteria enriched in reactors mainly included the families of anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae and verrucomicrobiaceae and the genus of trichococcus the total relative abundances of fermentative bacteria were 5 3 10 7 and 12 6 in the sbrs of the ao osa and sosa systems and 17 3 and 19 3 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively these results indicate that the sulfidogenic conditions could lead to higher growth of fermentative bacteria than the operating conditions in the ao and osa systems thus sosa achieved the highest sludge reduction efficiency the enrichment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in osa and sosa not only reduced sludge in situ but also benefitted the mainstream organic removal osa and sosa also selectively enriched the slow growing bacteria which could survive for a longer srt these bacteria include dechloromonas thauera nitrospira zavarzinella and azonexus the total abundances of these slow growing bacteria were 1 8 5 5 and 10 7 in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa respectively which corresponded with sludge reduction performance the srb syntrophobacteraceae desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae were only enriched in ssrsosa 2 1 but not in the other four reactors 0 1 0 7 srb were scarce in sbrsosa because they are strictly anaerobic and the compounds and conditions oxygen and nitrate in mainstream reactors are not conducive to srb growth rubio rincón et al 2017 the mixotrophic denitrifier paracoccus was only enriched in sbrsosa 8 47 and ssrsosa 11 86 but not in ao and osa 0 49 0 77 paracoccus is a slow growing bacterium that can utilize organic matter or reduced sulfur compounds to carry out denitrification kelly et al 2006 therefore the relative abundance of mixotrophic denitrifiers and the other slow growing bacteria in sosa was higher than that in ao and osa which could be beneficial for achieving lower sludge yield according to results on the microbial community in sosa it is obvious that the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria are not hindered by but instead work synergistically with the srb as they are less sensitive to sulfide than other microorganisms and even srb maillacheruvu et al 1993 reis et al 1991 4 3 implementation a sludge reduction of 57 was achieved by sosa compared to ao which is comparable to other in situ sludge treatment methods such as thermal and chemical treatment technologies saby et al 2002 dytczak et al 2007 however these methods always show high energy chemical demands or degrade the sludge properties these disadvantages impede their practical application in comparison sosa could not only enhance sludge reduction but also improve sludge properties by only adding 6 g s m3 sewage of sulfate chemicals it should also note that with the assumption of feeding the thickened was of sosa to the post treatment of anaerobic digestion the increase of total sulfide only 6 mg l is less than the low sulfur level 15 mg s l the effect of the yield of sulfide should be tolerable in sludge anaerobic digestion ge et al 2013 based on the sludge reduction performance acquired in this study the economic analysis table s6 was conducted by scaling up wastewater treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d the key operational parameters such as hrt of 0 67 d and side stream ratio of 20 were adopted resulting in the volume of ssr was 13 333 m3 this corresponds to us 2 266 667 in capital bioreactor investment consequently the annualized cost of investment could be us 244 577 over a 20 year period with an interest rate of 8 5 the annual cost for sulfate dosage in sosa was estimated to be us 67 119 based on the sulfate concentration in ssrsosa influent 259 mg so4 2 s l and unit price of sodium sulfate us 60 ton given respective 38 and 57 sludge reduction in osa and sosa the annualized cost saving for sludge treatment could be us 301 559 and us 448 009 respectively overall sosa would achieve a net economic benefit of us 136 313 per year compared with ao which is economically attractive nevertheless its technical and economic feasibilities under larger scale application still need to be further evaluated 5 conclusions in this study in situ sludge minimization and nitrogen removal were simultaneously achieved in a new sosa process through bioaugmentation with sulfur cycle micro organisms important findings were made as follows 1 the sosa process achieved an organics removal efficiency of around 98 and a nitrogen removal efficiency of 72 as well as less than 20 mg l tss in the effluent 2 the sludge yield in the sosa process was almost 57 and 30 lower than those in the conventional ao and osa processes respectively 3 the sosa process removed 18 and 6 more total nitrogen through denitrification than did the ao and osa processes respectively and 4 sulfidogenesis in sosa stimulated enrichment of slow growing bacteria including srb sob and hydrolytic fermentative bacteria in addition only about 6 g s m3 sewage of extra chemicals need to be added to trigger the sulfur augmentation in the sosa process declaration of interest none acknowledgements

18631,in situ sludge reduction can be achieved by inserting an anaerobic side stream reactor in the sludge return line of the conventional activated sludge cas process this modified oxic settling anaerobic osa process can reduce sludge production by 30 50 through feast fast alternating conditions this paper proposes a new bioprocess called the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process with osa configuration and the addition of sulfate in side stream reactor the new bioprocess augments the conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic feast fast bioconversions with sulfur biochemical transformations i e sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification a lab scale sosa process was operated for 260 days in parallel with the anoxic oxic ao cas process and the conventional osa process as control systems based on the experimental results the feasibility of the new sosa process was evaluated and the effects of sulfur bioaugmentation on the effluent quality sludge reduction sludge physico chemical properties and microbial communities were examined the sosa process i removed 98 of the organics chemical oxygen demand cod and 99 of the ammonia present with a lower observed sludge yield 0 204 g tss g codremoved than those of the osa and ao processes 0 292 and 0 473 g tss g codremoved respectively ii denitrified 18 and 6 more nitrogen to dinitrogen gas than did the cas and osa processes respectively iii produced sludge with improved settleability and dewaterability iv encouraged sludge decomposition with greater destruction of extracellular polymeric substances and v enriched sulfur cycle related and hydrolytic fermentative bacteria the possible mechanisms of sulfur augmentation and limitations of the present study are also discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ sludge reduction sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process sulfate reduction sulfur oxidizing autotrophic denitrification 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been widely employed for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment thanks to its high efficiency and ease of operation however the process produces a large amount of excess sludge which is undesirable inappropriate sludge disposal can cause environmental pollution and hygiene problems us epa 2007 while sludge handling may cost anywhere between 150 and 600 us ton of dried sludge ds batstone et al 2011 which is nearly 30 50 of the total operating cost of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp ferrentino et al 2016 currently the sludge production problem is particularly severe in china where approximately 60 million tons of excess sludge are produced annually yang et al 2016 treating this sludge is extremely costly up to 3 billion us year zhang et al 2017 to reduce the financial burden as well as the impact on the environment low cost and high efficiency sludge reduction technologies deserve research attention existing cas based secondary wastewater treatment units may be upgraded with in situ sludge reduction technologies carrère et al 2010 guo et al 2013 neumann et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the osa process which introduces an anaerobic side stream reactor ssr into the activated sludge return line as first proposed by westgarth et al 1964 is considered as one such technology the process recycles activated sludge through anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks to allow for energy uncoupling under feast fast alternating conditions chen et al 2003 which can reduce sludge production by about 30 50 novak et al 2007 chon et al 2011 shifting from the cas process to the osa process in the secondary wwtp requires a capital investment of only 100 160 us ton of ds and the energy input for operation is lower too 0 04 0 08 kwh per m3 of sewage treated velho et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 however the current osa technology still faces a number of technological challenges for example the anaerobic ssr with low anaerobic reaction and sludge decomposition rates requires a large amount of physical space and anaerobic treatment has a negative effect on the physico chemical properties of sludge flocs which causes a deterioration in effluent quality chon et al 2011 ferrentino et al 2016 recently the inhibitory chemicals such as free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa were found to effectively reduce sludge by 20 28 and cause no adverse impacts on mainstream performance and sludge properties wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 consequently augmentation of another inhibitory compounds sulfide in ssr might improve the sludge reduction performance therefore we propose inserting a sulfur cycle associated bioprocess into the conventional osa process and call it the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process fig 1 with appropriate utilization and well management of sulfate reduction bioprocess in environmental engineering projects a number of benefits can be expected under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria srb can use sulfate as electron acceptor to degrade organic compounds at a higher rate than that in the conventional anaerobic reaction this has been successfully demonstrated in both wastewater and sludge treatment in the full scale application of sani wu et al 2016 and biosure rose 2013 respectively the end product of anaerobic sulfate reduction sulfide dissolved in liquid is further used as electron donor to denitrify nitrogen oxidants thereby removing more nitrogen wu et al 2016 in addition the sulfide can trigger the decomposition and hydrolysis of activated sludge flocs as reported by chen et al 2018 and rose 2013 to realize such sulfur bioaugmentation in this study the anaerobic ssr was modified to a sulfidogenic ssr because of the sludge recycling between the sulfidogenic ssr and mainstream anoxic aerobic reactors the sosa process also transforms the wastewater treatment bacteria from conventional heterotrophs to low growth yield bacteria such as srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob and other facultative bacteria wu et al 2016 although the sosa process requires sulfate dosage it is still inexpensive because oxidized sulfur compounds e g sulfate sulfite thiosulfate and or elemental sulfur can be purchased at low cost from the market in this study three lab scale systems i e the proposed sosa a conventional osa and an anoxic oxic ao cas process were set up and operated in parallel for comparison purpose to evaluate the feasibility of the sosa process and the effects of the association of sulfur cycle the treatment performance and relevant biological conversions in both the mainstream reactors and the ssrs were monitored and the effects of the bioaugmentation by the sulfur cycle in sludge reduction nitrogen removal through denitrification and sludge properties including extracellular polymeric substances settleability and dewaterability were observed 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of lab scale ao osa and sosa systems for the ao osa and sosa systems fig 2 three 5 l sequencing batch reactors sbrs were adopted for mainstream organics cod and nitrogen removal these sbrs with identical configuration and named sbrao sbrosa sbrsosa were made of pvc and were circular with a diameter of 190 mm and a height of 250 mm all three sbrs were inoculated with the seeding sludge taken from a local wwtp and then operated in three steps step i consisted of a 1 h anoxic phase including feeding 1 25 l of synthetic sewage to the reactor for 8 min step ii involved a 2 h aerobic phase and step iii comprised settling for 0 75 h decanting for 8 min followed by an idle period of 7 min the three steps correspond to a 4 h cycle time a 25 volume exchange ratio volume of the influent per cycle volume of the sbr and a hydraulic retention time of 16 h 0 67 days a 70 mm disc diffuser was installed at the bottom of each sbr to provide air during the aerobic phase to maintain the dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 3 mg o2 l a mechanical mixer provided effective mixing 150 rpm during both anoxic and aerobic phases sbrosa and sbrsosa in the osa and sosa systems were each connected to a ssr with a liquid volume of 1 l and their ssrs were named the side stream anaerobic reactor ssrosa and the side stream sulfidogenic reactor ssrsosa respectively fig 2 a magnetic stirrer 300 rpm was applied to ensure sufficient mixing in each ssr the ssr was operated in a semi continuous mode see below no sludge produced by the osa and sosa systems was intentionally wasted the only sludge lost occurred via sampling and effluent discharge during the operation of the sbrao system 0 5 l of mixed liquor was wasted every day 83 ml cycle corresponding to a sludge retention time srt of 10 days and 7 0 l d of supernatants 1167 ml cycle were removed as effluent after settling before 7 5 l d of influent 1250 ml cycle were added the same volume of mixed liquor was removed from sbrosa and sbrsosa and 7 2 l d of supernatants 1200 ml cycle were removed as effluent after settling before 7 5 l d of influent 1250 ml cycle was added excess sludge was not wasted instead and 0 2 l d of sludge 33 ml cycle were removed from sbrosa and sbrsosa and added to ssrosa and ssrsosa after thickening the osa and sosa systems were fitted with additional sludge settlers to ensure an equivalent mixed liquor transfer between the mainstream reactors and ssrs the sludge thickening in the settler was identical to step iii in the sbrao operation the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to wang et al 2009 but without adding seawater having cod 50 of glucose and 50 of acetate nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations of 260 mg l 30 mg n l and 5 mg p l respectively the sewage temperature and ph were maintained at 22 1 c and 7 2 7 5 respectively in addition for triggering sulfur cycle bioprocesses in the ssr of the sosa system the sludge inflow of ssrsosa was dosed with a concentrated sodium sulfate solution as

information si 1 the physico chemical and biological sludge properties were evaluated by i measuring the extracellular polymeric substances eps and sludge dewaterability via the capillary suction time cst ii visualizing the sludge morphology with a scanning electron microscope sem and iii identifying microbial communities via 16s rrna high throughput sequencing analysis the detailed analytical methods are described in si 1 3 results 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 mainstream reactor performance the influent and effluent scod nh4 n no3 n tn tss and so4 2 s concentrations of the mainstream sbrs are shown in fig 3 a to f and summarized in si 2 table s2 the three mainstream sbrs of the ao osa sosa systems consistently showed high scod and ammonia removal efficiencies 98 the average scod concentrations in effluent were 3 86 3 18 2 92 3 50 and 5 30 4 57 mg o2 l in ao osa and sosa respectively the stressed conditions sulfidogenic nutrient deficiency environment in sosa induced more cell decay and caused higher soluble microbial products smp accumulation in the effluent which consequently attributed to slightly higher effluent cod the average concentrations of no3 n in the effluent of ao osa and sosa were 6 53 0 88 6 46 0 74 and 6 25 0 80 mg l with nearly no nitrite detected respectively fig 3c moreover the average tn concentrations in the effluent were 8 2 0 96 9 6 2 30 and 8 1 1 07 mg n l in the ao osa and sosa systems respectively fig 3d implying tn removal efficiencies of 67 72 osa showed a higher average effluent tss concentration 24 21 mg l than ao 12 7 mg l and sosa 13 7 mg l and was occasionally as high as 70 110 mg l fig 3e but the effluent tss of sosa was similar to that of ao and remained stable during the operating period owing to the sulfate addition from ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentration increased slightly in sosa effluent 11 13 1 87 mg s l compared to ao 4 75 1 34 mg s l fig 3f the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations in sbrosa and sbrsosa increased to 5650 180 mg l and 7600 360 mg l respectively during the stable period i e after day 140 for osa and after day 100 for sosa fig 3g but the mlss concentration in sbrao remained at around 1366 216 mg l due to the daily sludge wastage a solids balance analysis shows that the srt values of sbrosa and sbrsosa are about 148 6 and 354 16 days respectively therefore the sosa system containing the highest mass of sludge and with a longer srt could still achieve a better performance than the osa system the sulfidogenesis bioaugmentation in the sosa system did not appear to hinder the scod oxidation and nitrification denitrification bioprocesses 3 1 2 side stream reactor ssr performance the ssr inserted in the sludge return line induced sludge decay and destruction resulting in the release of secondary substrates in ssrosa and ssrsosa the operational performance of the ssrs is shown in fig 4 a to f and table s3 ssrosa and ssrsosa showed average filtered scod concentrations of 31 10 8 and 56 12 5 mg l respectively fig 4a the bulk liquid filtered scod levels in ssrs were higher than that of the system effluent which should be resulted from the sludge hydrolysis and solubilization moreover the successful enrichment of anaerobic bacteria including hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria was the other reasons the average influent nh4 n concentrations to ssrosa and ssrsosa fig 4b were low at 0 8 0 5 mg n l and 0 6 0 5 mg n l respectively due to the high nitrification efficiency in the respective sbrs the nh4 n concentration in the bulk liquid of ssrosa was stable at 30 4 7 mg l during the experimental period while the ammonia in ssrsosa increased and stabilized at 62 2 4 mg l after 131 days fig 4b these scod and nh4 n profiles confirm that activated sludge decay and hydrolysis took place in ssrosa and ssrsosa the sulfate values of the influent and effluent in ssrsosa were 259 28 2 and 184 49 9 mg s l respectively fig 4c producing approximately 75 11 mg s l of sulfide fig 4d this indicates that the srb grew on the decayed activated sludge which acted as a substrate electron donor in ssrsosa although about 40 80 mg scod l were still present in the bulk liquid no more sulfate was reduced under the designed operating conditions the exact reason is still elusive the benefit of this behavior is that relatively little sulfate is needed equivalent to requiring about 6 g so4 2 s to treat one cubic meter of sewage i e cost efficient and the mixture of scod and dissolved sulfide will provide greater denitrification potential as discussed in the next section the sludge loading rates of ssrosa and ssrsosa were increased along with the increase in the sbr sludge concentration until the mlss of ssrosa and ssrsosa became stable at about 10 and 12 g l respectively fig 4e 3 1 3 evaluation of the sludge reduction and total nitrogen denitrification the observed sludge yield yobs is represented by the slope of the cumulative sludge increase divided by the cumulative consumed substrate shown in fig 5 a which was determined by linear regression for ao the yobs of 0 473 g tss g cod was consistent with those in other studies of 0 37 0 6 g tss g cod huang et al 2014 huang and goel 2015 velho et al 2016 compared to ao osa reduced sludge production by 38 comparable to previous studies khursheed and kazmi 2011 chon et al 2011 wang et al 2017 velho et al 2016 a higher sludge reduction was achieved by sosa 57 compared with ao which indicates that sulfidogenesis bioaugmentation in the ssr intensified sludge destruction chen et al 2018 although ao osa and sosa have similar tn removal efficiencies in terms of mainstream bulk liquid removal we should note that the nitrogen removal through denitrification was different among the three systems the nitrogen mass balance in these three systems can be expressed as tn in influent tn in effluent organic n captured in activated sludge tn removal through denitrification to n2 from this equation tn removal through denitrification could be calculated the cumulative tn removal through denitrification is plotted against the cumulative tn introduction in fig 5b and the total nitrogen removal efficiency via denitrification is represented by the slope of the line which was also determined by linear regression all r2 0 995 from fig 5b the overall tn removal efficiencies through denitrification were about 67 79 and 85 in the ao osa and sosa systems respectively as a result the sosa process was 18 and 6 more efficient in terms of nitrogen denitrification than the conventional ao and osa processes this indicated that with a comparable tn concentration in the effluent but lower sludge production sosa removed more nitrogen than did ao and osa probably via autotrophic denitrification using sulfide as electron donor which should be verified in the future study 3 2 effect on sludge properties the sem images of sludge in the ao osa and sosa systems are shown in fig s1 it can be seen that all sludge aggregates were colonized by a large number of bacteria and embedded in eps and filamentous colloids to form a compact sludge structure the surface of the ao sludge flocs was rough and the cells had a regular spherical shape figs s1a and b with a heavy accumulation of eps eps are very important to activated sludge flocs and contains proteins polysaccharides and other organic matter they play key roles in cell adhesion communication and protection sheng et al 2010 in the osa system the sludge floc surface was partially fragmented and were irregular in shape the sludge flocs were also covered with eps or other precipitates figs s1c and d the sludge flocs in sosa are smaller with a smooth surface figs s1e and f which may indicate a much lower level of eps in ssrsosa than in ssrosa eps degradation is important for sludge reduction and system stability chon et al 2011 in this study the total amount of eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps and the compositions of eps in term of proteins pn polysaccharides ps and humic like substances hs were measured for ao osa and sosa sludge samples see fig 6 a d and table s4 the total eps of the activated sludge in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa were 120 17 102 18 and 57 7 mg cod g vss respectively showing that sbrosa and sbrsosa sludge contained 15 and 53 less eps than did sbrao sludge moreover the total eps of ssrosa and ssrsosa sludge could be further reduced to 86 10 and 49 10 mg cod g vss respectively comparing to ao osa system only decomposed tb eps while sosa system decomposed both lb eps and tb eps corresponding to a relative high lb tb eps ratio 0 17 0 20 for osa but maintained at similar level of 0 12 0 15 to that of ao system 0 14 moreover we found the pn and ps of sosa were 23 89 27 50 mg g vss and 7 19 8 79 mg g vss respectively which only accounted for about 50 of the pn and ps levels in ao system eps reduction can affect the integrity of sludge flocs and consequently improve sludge settleability in mainstream sbrs sheng et al 2010 in this study sludge settleability was measured in terms of svi30 lower values mean better settleability as shown in fig 6e the average svi30 of sosa sludge was 129 20 ml g tss and slightly lower than that of ao sludge 136 32 ml g tss osa sludge had the worst settleability as the svi30 increased to 168 22 ml g tss which was close to that observed by velho et al 2016 therefore under sulfidogenic side stream conditions the sosa system did not show a poor sludge settleability like the osa system did indeed an improvement in svi30 was observed which was generally better than conventional activated sludge sludge dewaterability in the three systems was measured with the cst fig 6f dewaterability is an important factor governing the dosage of chemicals and energy consumption for sludge dewatering the cst values of sbrao and sbrsosa sludge were similar at 67 4 and 55 3 s respectively but the cst value of sbrosa sludge was the highest at 97 5 s these results confirm that the sludge from the sosa system with sulfidogenesis side stream bioaugmentation had better dewatering potential i e more energy efficient 3 3 effect on microbial communities 3 3 1 taxonomic complexity of the bacterial community sosa had a more diverse and evenly distributed microbial community than did ao and osa owing to the highest shannon indexes table s5 the relative abundance of microbial communities in the three systems is shown in fig s2 at the phylum level a total of 23 26 and 27 bacterial phyla were identified in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa respectively while 26 and 29 phyla were detected in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively proteobacteria as the dominant phylum decreased in the order of ao osa and sosa meanwhile the phyla of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi that related to eps degradation and carbohydrate degradation respectively were more abundant in sosa and osa than ao semblante et al 2017 weissbrodt et al 2014 the nitrifying bacteria nitrospirae were slightly more enriched in both sosa 3 2 and 1 7 in sbrsosa and ssrsosa respectively and osa 3 6 and 5 9 in sbrosa and ssrosa respectively than in ao only 1 0 in sbrao further comparison of the microbial community evolution in the three systems after ssr augmentation was carried out at the genus level shown in fig 7 raoultella as the most dominant genus in sbrao 21 9 and sbrosa 11 3 is affiliated to the enterobacteriaceae family and is able to carry out anoxic denitrification bao et al 2007 however it decreased to 4 7 in ssrosa and dropped even further in ssrsosa 2 3 and sbrsosa 1 9 the dominant denitrifying bacteria in sosa were paracoccus 8 5 in sbrsosa and 11 9 in ssrsosa while the relative abundance of this genus was much lower in ao and osa 0 5 0 8 ferruginibacter was enriched in osa and sosa especially in ssrosa 7 0 and ssrsosa 5 7 azospira as the second most dominant genus in ao 8 5 reduced to 3 5 4 6 in osa and dropped even further to 0 4 0 6 in sosa the relative abundance of ignavibacterium increased after ssr insertion a higher abundance was detected in sosa 4 0 7 5 but a lower abundance in osa 1 4 2 6 however the unclassified genus affiliated to the family ignavibacteriaceae in ao accounted for 19 6 the nitrifying bacteria nitrospira was particularly enriched in sbrosa 3 64 and sbrsosa 3 23 compared with sbrao 0 95 while this genus might be inhibited in sulfidogenic conditions as its abundance decreased from 5 95 to 1 69 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively other genera including zavarzinella 4 8 5 8 azonexus 5 8 aridibacter 2 6 4 0 leptolinea 1 6 4 2 and longilinea 1 3 2 2 were particularly enriched in sosa compared with ao and osa 0 2 0 7 0 6 1 2 0 6 0 8 0 0 2 and 0 0 3 respectively in addition to cod and nitrogen phosphorus was also removed through an enhanced biological phosphorus removal pathway this was verified in a typical cycle study whose results are shown in fig s4 therefore polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos were identified with sub databases of accumulibacter and competibacter defluvicoccus related tetrad forming organisms tfos two types of paos generally affiliated to the family rhodocyclaceae fig s3a were assigned to accumulibacter which is one of the most abundant paos in wwtps he et al 2008 mielczarek et al 2013 the level of azospira 3 45 8 22 the dominant accumulibacter in ao and osa systems was about two times higher in ao than in osa but less than 1 in sosa azonexus was only enriched in sbrsosa 5 76 and sbrosa 1 20 for the gao like bacteria no genes were similarities to defluvicoccus related tfos but two unclassified types generally affiliated to gammaproteobacteria were assigned to competibacter fig s3b the abundance of gaos was low in ao competibacter related to the unclassified gammaproteobacteria 2 was only enriched in ssrsosa at 2 05 and the other unclassified gammaproteobacteria 1 was only enriched in osa with a higher abundance of 7 20 7 89 both competibacter types were found in sbrsosa but at a lower abundance of just 1 3 3 2 predicted potential function of bacterial community the potential functional characteristics of the microbial community in ao osa and sosa were predicted with the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust based on the 16s high throughput sequencing kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg data fig 8 a the predicted genes fell into four major functional groups of the genes metabolism 53 3 54 6 genetic information processing 19 4 20 1 environmental information processing 12 2 13 7 and cellular processes 7 6 8 4 the highest abundance of genes in the metabolism category was for amino acid metabolism 10 2 10 8 followed by carbohydrate metabolism 10 2 10 7 and energy metabolism 6 3 6 5 the relative abundances for carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism in sosa were increased by 4 9 and 11 1 respectively compared with ao which indicates that the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids in the sosa microbial community was enhanced the subgroup of energy production and conversion was further analyzed based on the kegg database fig 8b notably the relative abundance for phosphorus metabolism was higher in sosa 1 6 1 7 and osa 1 5 1 6 than in ao 1 4 the sulfur metabolism gene abundance in sosa was 0 4 the relative abundance of sulfur metabolism enzymes was also analyzed shown in fig 8c dsra achieved the highest value in ssrsosa and was 6 5 times higher in sosa than in ao as for the functional enzymes for phosphorus removal fig 8d polyphosphate kinase ppk and exopolypase ppx are two important ones in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system guo et al 2017 the sosa and osa microbial communities were predicted to have higher ppk abundance than the ao microbial community while the ppx abundance showed the opposite trend the abundance of poly 3 hydroxyalkanoate synthetase pha in ssrsosa was decreased by 33 37 compared with the other four samples which may indicate that the sulfidogenic conditions inhibit the poly hyddroxyalkanoates pha biosynthesis process the main nitrogen removal pathways were further investigated as shown in fig 8d a high abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation nitrification and denitrification was detected in the sludge samples however a very low abundance of ammonia oxidation enzymes ammonia monooxygenase amo was found in all samples hence not shown in fig 8d which was also found in previous studies guo et al 2017 ye et al 2012 as the three systems showed good nitrification efficiencies during the experimental period the low abundance of amo might have resulted from the limited number of reference genes in the database 4 discussion 4 1 sulfur cycle bioaugmentation for sludge reduction the possible reasons for sludge reduction are further discussed eps destruction and degradation is considered to be one of the most important mechanisms in the osa process chon et al 2011 novak et al 2007 park 2007 in this study the activated sludge of sosa showed lower eps than those of ao and osa reductions of 53 and 45 respectively the intensified eps reduction probably resulted from the sulfidogenic bioaugmentation in ssrsosa sulfide as a strong reducing reagent could precipitate the metals in eps inducing sludge floc disintegration wilén et al 2000 nielsen and keiding 1998 moreover the intensified eps destruction in the sosa process could provide more secondary substrate total dissolved sulfide for mainstream autotrophic denitrification thereby enhancing the nitrogen removal efficiency which was also coincident with the lowest sludge yield and the highest tn removal efficiency of the three systems the insertion of the ssrs in osa and sosa induced sludge decay resulting in the solubilization of low molecular weight cellular organics which is considered a further key step of in situ sludge reduction yang et al 2016 the scod in ssrsosa was always higher than that in ssrosa and the ammonia release was almost twice as high in ssrsosa which are good indicators of intensified sludge lysis and dissolved organic matter dom release in ssrsosa moreover sosa achieved almost double the decay rate of osa 0 041 0 0004 d 1 vs 0 021 0 0021 d 1 as observed in batch tests as described in si 7 sulfide in the bulk liquid can penetrate the cell walls of microorganisms thereby inhibiting cell metabolism and increasing the sludge decay rate rubio rincón et al 2017 vela et al 2018 sosa maintained an ultra long srt which is favorable for lower sludge production because more energy is required for cell maintenance van loosdrecht and henze 1999 massé et al 2006 chon et al 2011 kim et al 2012 however to directly extend the srt of the conventional ao process would require a much bigger reactor and degrade the effluent quality and in particular result in a high tss concentration in the effluent chon et al 2011 the sbr ssr configuration adopted in this study is the most used configuration in laboratory scale application with a closed sludge loop no intentional sludge wastage considering the practical application of sosa the potential configurations of sosa fig s5 could be realized by coupling sulfidogenic ssr with membrane bioreactor mbr modified ludzack ettinger mle process and so on the limitations of this study should be noted in particular we have not determined the oxygen utilization rate for mainstream sbr operation hence we could not analyze the cod distribution for the entire system and determine the oxygen demand this will be investigated in the near future based on the current evidence we speculate that the oxygen demand of the sosa process would be higher than that of the ao process because some of the sludge destroyed by anaerobic sulfur augmentation would be oxidized by nitrate nitrite i e oxidized from ammonia and dissolved oxygen rather than completely oxidized by sulfate this will also be further studied in the near future 4 2 dynamics of microbial communities the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria slow growing bacteria and predatory bacteria in osa sosa as well as unique sulfur related bacteria with slow growth in sosa is crucial for sludge reduction cheng et al 2017 ferrentino et al 2016 the dominant hydrolytic bacteria related to sludge reduction in the three systems included the phylum of unclassified bacteroidetes the families of xanthomonadaceae saprospiraceae and caldilineaceae the classes of bacteroidia and clostridia and the genus of haliangium cheng et al 2017 pang et al 2018 the total relative abundances of hydrolytic bacteria were 3 7 27 5 and 17 5 in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa while they accounted for 19 4 and 9 9 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively the results indicate that hydrolytic bacteria were more abundant in osa and sosa the starvation conditions provided by ssrosa and ssrsosa induced sludge decay lysis and particulate organic matter pom release which led to facultative hydrolysis bacteria proliferation in hydrolyzing pom and the products of dom were utilized for lysis cryptic growth higher hydrolytic bacteria activity in the mainstream sbrs resulting from the facultative ssr enriched hydrolytic bacteria augments utilization of substrates dissolved organics in the sbrs and assists the hydrolysis of particulate organics the fermentative bacteria enriched in reactors mainly included the families of anaerolineaceae comamonadaceae chitinophagaceae and verrucomicrobiaceae and the genus of trichococcus the total relative abundances of fermentative bacteria were 5 3 10 7 and 12 6 in the sbrs of the ao osa and sosa systems and 17 3 and 19 3 in ssrosa and ssrsosa respectively these results indicate that the sulfidogenic conditions could lead to higher growth of fermentative bacteria than the operating conditions in the ao and osa systems thus sosa achieved the highest sludge reduction efficiency the enrichment of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in osa and sosa not only reduced sludge in situ but also benefitted the mainstream organic removal osa and sosa also selectively enriched the slow growing bacteria which could survive for a longer srt these bacteria include dechloromonas thauera nitrospira zavarzinella and azonexus the total abundances of these slow growing bacteria were 1 8 5 5 and 10 7 in sbrao sbrosa and sbrsosa respectively which corresponded with sludge reduction performance the srb syntrophobacteraceae desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae were only enriched in ssrsosa 2 1 but not in the other four reactors 0 1 0 7 srb were scarce in sbrsosa because they are strictly anaerobic and the compounds and conditions oxygen and nitrate in mainstream reactors are not conducive to srb growth rubio rincón et al 2017 the mixotrophic denitrifier paracoccus was only enriched in sbrsosa 8 47 and ssrsosa 11 86 but not in ao and osa 0 49 0 77 paracoccus is a slow growing bacterium that can utilize organic matter or reduced sulfur compounds to carry out denitrification kelly et al 2006 therefore the relative abundance of mixotrophic denitrifiers and the other slow growing bacteria in sosa was higher than that in ao and osa which could be beneficial for achieving lower sludge yield according to results on the microbial community in sosa it is obvious that the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria are not hindered by but instead work synergistically with the srb as they are less sensitive to sulfide than other microorganisms and even srb maillacheruvu et al 1993 reis et al 1991 4 3 implementation a sludge reduction of 57 was achieved by sosa compared to ao which is comparable to other in situ sludge treatment methods such as thermal and chemical treatment technologies saby et al 2002 dytczak et al 2007 however these methods always show high energy chemical demands or degrade the sludge properties these disadvantages impede their practical application in comparison sosa could not only enhance sludge reduction but also improve sludge properties by only adding 6 g s m3 sewage of sulfate chemicals it should also note that with the assumption of feeding the thickened was of sosa to the post treatment of anaerobic digestion the increase of total sulfide only 6 mg l is less than the low sulfur level 15 mg s l the effect of the yield of sulfide should be tolerable in sludge anaerobic digestion ge et al 2013 based on the sludge reduction performance acquired in this study the economic analysis table s6 was conducted by scaling up wastewater treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d the key operational parameters such as hrt of 0 67 d and side stream ratio of 20 were adopted resulting in the volume of ssr was 13 333 m3 this corresponds to us 2 266 667 in capital bioreactor investment consequently the annualized cost of investment could be us 244 577 over a 20 year period with an interest rate of 8 5 the annual cost for sulfate dosage in sosa was estimated to be us 67 119 based on the sulfate concentration in ssrsosa influent 259 mg so4 2 s l and unit price of sodium sulfate us 60 ton given respective 38 and 57 sludge reduction in osa and sosa the annualized cost saving for sludge treatment could be us 301 559 and us 448 009 respectively overall sosa would achieve a net economic benefit of us 136 313 per year compared with ao which is economically attractive nevertheless its technical and economic feasibilities under larger scale application still need to be further evaluated 5 conclusions in this study in situ sludge minimization and nitrogen removal were simultaneously achieved in a new sosa process through bioaugmentation with sulfur cycle micro organisms important findings were made as follows 1 the sosa process achieved an organics removal efficiency of around 98 and a nitrogen removal efficiency of 72 as well as less than 20 mg l tss in the effluent 2 the sludge yield in the sosa process was almost 57 and 30 lower than those in the conventional ao and osa processes respectively 3 the sosa process removed 18 and 6 more total nitrogen through denitrification than did the ao and osa processes respectively and 4 sulfidogenesis in sosa stimulated enrichment of slow growing bacteria including srb sob and hydrolytic fermentative bacteria in addition only about 6 g s m3 sewage of extra chemicals need to be added to trigger the sulfur augmentation in the sosa process declaration of interest none acknowledgements

18632,ozonation is widely used in wastewater treatment but the associated byproduct formation is a concern when ozonation is used in the presence of bromide bromate is generally considered as a major byproduct and few studies have examined the toxicity of organic byproducts this study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and dna rna oxidative damage to chinese hamster ovary cho cells of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater in the absence or presence of bromide ozonation effectively detoxified secondary effluents containing no bromide however ozonation significantly increased the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the effluents spiked with a bromide concentration as low as 100 μg l compared with the bromide free effluent when the bromide concentration in the effluent was increased to 2000 μg l ozonation resulted in 1 4 1 5 times the cytotoxicity and 1 5 5 0 times the genotoxicity of the non ozonated secondary effluent besides the oxidative stress

et al 2016 wildhaber et al 2015 yang et al 2015 bromate has been considered as the major byproduct during ozonation and its toxic effects have been well studied bromate can cause salmonella strains ta102 and ta104 to mutate levin et al 1982 it can also cause chromosomal aberrations and dna damage in mammalian cells plewa et al 2002 richardson et al 2007 previous in vivo assay showed that bromate induced the micronuclei in mice bone marrow and caused oxidative damage and chromosomal mutations in rat kidneys iarc 1999 umemura and kurokawa 2006 bromate is classified as a 2b possible carcinogen by the international cancer research center iarc 1999 the world health organization who the european union eu and the united states have all set a limit of 10 μg l for bromate in drinking water european council 1998 usepa 2006 who 2005 much effort has been paid to the formation risk and control of bromate during water ozonation chon et al 2015 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 but only a few studies have focused on the influence of bromide on the toxicity induced by organic extracts dong et al 2017 han and zhang 2018 during ozonation of water containing br hypobromous acid hobr and its conjugate base bro are the key intermediates von gunten and hoigne 1994 the final product bro3 is mainly formed by hydroxyl radicals oxidizing hobr bro via the different formation pathways von gunten and hoigne 1994 dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater can scavenge hydroxyl radicals thereby inhibiting the formation of bromate but it may lead to more hobr bro reacting with dom to form organic byproducts although the reaction rate constant between dom in wastewater and hobr is rarely reported hobr reacts quickly with the natural organic matter nom in surface water with an apparent rate constant of 1 64 1 93 109 m 1 h 1 at 25 c at a ph of 7 6 duirk and valentine 2007 and typical organic compounds such as phloroglucinol and tannic acid with an apparent rate constant between 104 and 108 m 1 s 1 at 24 c at a ph of 7 criquet et al 2015 thus dom may compete with o3 oh strongly to react with hobr bro hobr bro can be reduced to br by electron transfer between hobr bro and dom but it forms toxic organic brominated byproducts through electrophilic substitution wenk et al 2013 the electrophilic substitution ratios of hobr bro and nom in the suwannee river and a nordic reservoir were about 20 criquet et al 2015 all these studies strongly suggest that organic brominated byproducts may be formed during ozonation of bromide containing wastewater studies have reported the formation of some individual organic brominated byproducts such as bromoform bromoacetic acid and dibromoacetonitrile during the ozonation of bromide containing water legube 1996 zhang et al 2005 concentrations of these byproducts were as low as several μg l far below the standard of usepa total trihalomethane 80 μg l total haloacetic acid 60 μg l usepa 2006 however the cytotoxicity of bromoacetic acid lc50 1 2 mg l or dibromoacetonitrile lc50 0 6 mg l in chinese hamster ovary cho cells was much higher than that of bromate lc50 123 3 mg l muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2002 suggesting the toxicity of organic byproducts may not be negligible furthermore in the presence of bromide many other organic byproducts may form during ozonation yet their toxicity is unclear because they are unidentified and unquantified therefore the risk of byproducts may be seriously underestimated if we only focus on the bromate formation during ozonation it is necessary to understand the influence of bromide on the toxicity of organic byproducts formed during ozonation this study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cho cells of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater in the absence or presence of bromide oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage in cho cells induced by the byproducts were also evaluated besides the influence of bromate on the toxicity induced by organic byproducts was investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples a and b collected on different dates were acquired from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in shenzhen china samples were collected from the clarifier after secondary treatment via the anaerobic anoxic oxic process water samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory and stored at 2 4 c samples were passed through a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm before any water quality analyses and the subsequent experiments the basic water analyses were conducted within 48 h after sampling the dissolved organic carbon doc value was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the ph value was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius design germany the bromide and bromate concentrations were measured with an ion chromatograph equipped with an ionpac as19 analytical column and a conductivity detector dionex aquion thermo scientific u s the quantitation limits in secondary effluent matrices for bromide and bromate were approximately 10 and 5 μg l respectively the ammonia nitrogen concentration was measured with an ammonia photometer hi96700 hanna instruments italy details of the water quality are shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation ozonation experiment was conducted in a 0 6 m deep glass reactor containing 1000 ml of the water sample ozone gas from an ozone generator ozocenter china was introduced to the sample the water sample came into full contact with ozone by using a magnetic stirrer the concentration of the ozone gas was determined with an ozone analyzer ideal 2000 ozone analyzer zibo china the flow rate of the ozone gas was regulated by a rotameter the added dose of ozone was determined by the difference in ozone dose at the inlet and outlet of the reactor after ozonation all the water samples were fully shaken to completely evaporate the residual ozone the hobr residual was quenched with 105 stoichiometric amounts of sodium thiosulfate 2 3 solid phase extraction water samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe according to previous studies du et al 2017 kadmi et al 2014a b before they were passed through the extraction cartridges oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance 500 mg 6 ml waters u s a water samples were adjusted to ph 2 00 0 05 with h2so4 2 mol l the extraction speed was approximately 5 ml min after that the cartridge was completely dried by nitrogen stream for around 1 h then eluted successively with 5 ml of methanol 2 ml of acetone and 2 ml of dichloromethane the spe eluate containing organic extracts was completely dried under nitrogen flow organic extracts were then dissolved in 0 5 2 0 ml culture medium according to the required concentration factor for toxicity assay the doc recovery rate of spe was approximately 80 85 2 4 cell culture a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line obtained from the american type culture collection was used to perform the toxicity assay cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle medium nutrition mixture f 12 dmem f12 1 1 gibco u s a supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs gibco 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg l streptomycin gibco u s a cells in culture dishes corning u s a were placed in a sterile incubator with 5 co2 gas at 37 c under saturated humidity cell passaging was performed every two days cells undergoing 2 5 passages were used for the cytotoxicity assay 2 5 cytotoxicity assay cell viability was measured based on the adenosine triphosphate atp assay using the celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay kit promega usa according to previous studies du et al 2018a the luciferase and luciferin in the kit react to emit photons in the presence of the atp released by viable cells while the luminescent signal is proportional to the number of viable cells a phenol solution was used as the positive control to quantify the cytotoxicity equivalent therefore cytotoxicity in this study was expressed in mg phenol l cell viability tests were performed in 4 6 replicates the protocol of the atp assay and the calculation of cytotoxicity equivalents are detailed in text s1 2 6 genotoxicity assay the double strand break dsb in genomic dna was adopted to test the genotoxicity of water samples the dsb site was measured by the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax assay when a dsb occurs the histone h2ax is phosphorylated at ser 139 to form ph2ax foci which further recruit proteins to repair the damaged dna kang et al 2013 the number of dsb can be measured by the number of ph2ax foci due to the one to one correspondence after cells were treated with samples for 24 h the ph2ax foci were measured by the method of immunofluorescence the reagent and protocol are described in the si cell viability was determined at the same time only cells with viability exceeding 70 were used for genotoxicity assay plewa et al 2010 a 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo solution was used as the positive control to quantify the genotoxicity equivalent the method for genotoxicity equivalent quantification is described in text s2 the genotoxicity tests were performed in 4 6 replicates 2 7 oxidative stress assay reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns were measured according to a previous study du et al 2018a b ros was measured with the intracellular total ros assay kit ka4075 abnova after cells were exposed to the samples for 12 h the culture medium was removed then the cell permeable and non fluorescent ros probe in the kit was added and incubated for 1 h after that the cell image was recorded using a high content analysis system hca imagexpress micro molecular devices usa with a 10 objective lens via the tetramethylrhodamine tritc channel the fluorescence intensity of cells was calculated using the software metaxpress that came with the hca system meanwhile cell nuclei were stained by hoechst sigma usa and photographed using the 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride dapi channel similar to the ros measurement rns was determined with an intracellular rns assay kit sta 800 oxiselect while the fluorescent signal was recorded through the fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc channel of the hca system both the ros and rns levels were calculated by dividing the total fluorescence intensity by the cell number ros and rns levels of each sample were measured in 4 6 replicates 2 8 measurement of oxidative damage markers of dna and rna 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine 8 ohdg and 8 hydroxy guanosine 8 ohg are base modification products when hydroxyl radicals attack the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine causing dna and rna damage respectively col et al 2010 the 8 oh d g level was used as a marker to characterize the oxidative damage to dna and rna shi et al 2012 the total 8 ohdg and 8 ohg 8 oh d g contents were measured by the immunofluorescence method the steps of fixation membrane permeation as well as blocking are identical to the determination with ph2ax assay as detailed in section 2 6 cells were then incubated with a primary antibody dna rna oxidative damage markers thermo for 1 h before they were stained with a secondary antibody alexa fluor plus 555 thermo and hoechst sigma for another 1 h the 8 oh d g and cell nuclei were recorded via the tritc and dapi channels respectively the fluorescence intensity of 8 oh d g and the number of nuclei were calculated using the software metaxpress the 8 oh d g level was quantified by the total fluorescence intensity divided by the cell number the 8 oh d g level of each sample was measured in 4 6 replicates the 8 oh d g content in the nucleus and that in the cytoplasm were differentiated by the metaxpress software 2 9 measurement of total organic halogen tox the total organic chlorine tocl and total organic bromine tobr were measured the tox measurement mostly followed the standard method 5320b apha et al 2012 except that an off line ion chromatograph was used to detect chloride and bromide from pyrolysis of tocl and tobr respectively jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 the practical quantitation limits for tocl and tobr were 2 μg l as cl and 4 μg l as br respectively according to the standard method apha et al 2012 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp and 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp were used as the standard compounds to generate calibration curves for tocl and tobr respectively the protocol of tox measurement has been described elsewhere li et al 2011 2 10 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova tests were conducted to determine if a sample caused a significant level of toxicity if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a post hoc test of holm sidak multiple comparison versus the negative control analysis was then performed to identify the lowest toxicity concentration the power of the test statistic 1 β was set to 0 8 at α 0 05 yang et al 2014 the two tailed t test was applied to analyze the significance of the toxicity difference between the organic samples with and without bromate addition after testing for homogeneity of variance for the cytotoxicity assay the sample concentration at which the relative cell viability is 50 over the negative control is defined as the lc50 for the genotoxicity assay the sample concentration at which the ph2ax induction ratio is 1 5 over the negative control is defined as the ir1 5 cytotoxicity and genotoxicity equivalents are obtained as described in the si one way anova tests were performed to determine significant difference between toxicity equivalents 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity reduction by ozonation in the absence of bromide secondary effluent samples from the wwtp containing no br or below the quantitation limit were specifically collected for sample a adding 5 mg l o3 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts from 8 2 mg phenol l to 5 0 mg phenol l p 0 05 fig 1 increasing the ozone dose to 20 mg l further decreased the cytotoxicity to 3 2 mg phenol l cytotoxicity represents the changes of cell viability it is the comprehensive and final results when cells are exposed to harmful pollutants but gives limited information about the specific toxic effects on other endpoints genotoxicity in this study was characterized by the dna dsbs and measured by the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax foci stiff et al 2004 dsbs can activate oncogenes inactivate tumor suppressors and change the modifier proteins that influence chemosensitivity and tumor progression so that organisms are more susceptible to cancers and other diseases kang et al 2013 adding 20 mg l o3 substantially reduced the genotoxicity from 1 6 μg 4 nqo l to 0 8 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 fig 1 similar reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were observed in sample b fig s1a fig s1b also gives the changes of doc during ozonation influence of ozonation on the oxidative stress in cho cells by organic extracts sample a was also studied ozonation could lower the levels of both intracellular ros and intracellular rns induced by the organic extracts fig 2 a and b as the intracellular ros and rns concentrations were attenuated when the cells were exposed to ozonated organic extracts the total 8 oh d g levels attributed to the organic extracts dropped as well with the increase of ozone dose fig 2c the 8 oh d g contents in the nucleus and the cytoplasm were differentiated using the metaxpress software both the nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g shared the same decreasing trend figs s2a and s2b these results demonstrate that in the absence of bromide in real wastewater ozonation can effectively reduce the toxicity of organic extracts to cho cells the toxicity of organic matter obtained from spe mainly resulted from various hazardous pollutants in the real wastewater degradation and detoxification of specific pollutants occurring in wastewater by ozonation have been well studied van aken et al 2015 the detoxification effects of ozonation on real wastewater such as acute toxicity and endocrine disrupting activity has also been reported punzi et al 2015 tang et al 2014 although ozonation of wastewater also forms toxic organic byproducts like aldehydes and ketones tentscher et al 2018 the spe pretreatment cannot retain the volatile byproducts to be more precise in the absence of bromide ozonation can effectively reduce the toxicity of non volatile organic extracts from real wastewater which might be because of the transformation of toxic pollutants into non toxic or low toxic products 3 2 influence of bromide on the toxicity changes during ozonation water samples were spiked with bromide at concentrations ranging from 100 to 2000 μg l and then 10 mg l o3 was dosed the ozonated organic matter was thereafter extracted by spe and used for toxicity assays fig 3 and fig s3 show the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the organic extracts from ozonated samples a and b containing bromide respectively after ozonation compared with the sample without bromide cytotoxicity of organic extracts from samples spiked 100 μg l bromide increased from 4 1 to 4 6 mg phenol l p 0 05 for sample a and from 4 6 to 5 6 mg phenol l p 0 05 for sample b raising the bromide concentration in the secondary effluents increased the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts of the ozonated samples when 2000 μg l bromide was spiked the cytotoxicity of ozonated samples a and b reached 12 4 and 10 7 mg phenol l respectively which were even higher than the cytotoxicity of the secondary effluent without ozonation 1 5 times higher for sample a and 1 4 times higher for sample b compared with the sample without bromide after ozonation genotoxicity of organic extracts from secondary effluents spiked 100 μg l bromide increased from 1 0 to 1 2 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 for sample a and from 2 0 to 2 7 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 for sample b the existence of 500 μg l bromide increased the genotoxicity of the organic extract of ozonated sample a to 2 3 μg 4 nqo l fig 3 surpassing the genotoxicity of the secondary effluent without ozonation p 0 05 further increasing the bromide concentration led to a much higher genotoxicity equivalent when 2000 μg l bromide was spiked in the secondary effluents the genotoxicity of ozonated samples a and b rose up to 5 0 times and 1 5 times of the genotoxicity of samples a and b without ozonation respectively these results demonstrate that the toxic effects of organic byproducts formed during ozonation in the presence of bromide would offset or even overtake the detoxification effects of ozonation described in section 3 1 when cells were exposed to the organic byproducts intracellular oxidative stress such as ros and rns may rises to eliminate the xenobiotic toxic chemicals boonstra and post 2004 however the excessive accumulation of oxidative stress may cause adverse effects to cells shi et al 2012 which is considered as one of the causes of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity du et al 2018b li et al 2016 compared with the sample containing no bromide the sample spiked with 100 μg l bromide induced similar level of ros or rns after ozonation fig 4 a and b however with further increasing the bromide concentration in the secondary effluent after ozonation organic extracts substantially increased the ros and rns levels in cho cells for the ozonated sample containing 500 μg l bromide both the ros and rns levels were much higher than those in the secondary effluent before ozonation indicating that the organic byproducts formed in the presence of bromide showed a strong ability to induce oxidative stress ros and rns can react with or modify biomolecules in cells du et al 2013 balanced oxidative stress plays a critical role in many intracellular signal transduction pathways but excessive accumulation can lead to irreversible oxidative damage to biomolecules pals et al 2013 hence 8 oh d g which characterizes dna and rna oxidative damage was further measured similar to oxidative stress accumulation after ozonation organic extracts from the sample containing 100 μg l bromide did not cause the total 8 oh d g level to change much compared with the sample without bromide however further increasing the bromide concentration in water sample substantially enhanced the ability of organic byproducts to induce 8 oh d g fig 5 a during dna replication 8 ohdg and adenine are mismatched resulting in gene mutation col et al 2010 the 8 ohdg in dna is considered to play a part in the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis and so it is used as a biomarker of various cancers and degenerative diseases valavanidis et al 2009 the 8 ohg in rna also interferes with the normal expression of proteins shi et al 2012 these results suggest that the organic byproducts formed during ozonation in the presence of bromide are a potential risk when the cho cells were exposed to the organic extracts of the ozonated sample containing bromide the nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g showed similar change patterns to the total 8 oh d g figs s4a and s4b by combining the results shown in figs s2a and s2b the distribution of nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g induced by the organic extracts of the ozonated samples in the absence or presence of bromide is plotted in fig 5b it is interesting to see that the organic byproducts of samples containing bromide induced higher nucleus 8 oh d g than samples containing no bromide did rna and dna in the cytoplasm might be oxidized by ros more easily than those in the nucleus as they are located closer to the mitochondria which produce the majority of the ros boonstra and post 2004 when samples contained bromide the organic extracts induced much higher levels of oxidative stress this enabled more ros to be accessed by the nucleus resulting in the formation of more nucleus 8 oh d g dna mainly exists in chromosomes in the nucleus with a small amount in mitochondria while rna mainly exists in the cytoplasm huang and zhang 2003 the much higher levels of oxidative stress that were induced by the organic extracts of the ozonated samples containing bromide might cause greater oxidative damage to dna 3 3 byproduct formation during ozonation in the presence of bromide the toxicity of organic extracts increased during ozonation might be attributed to the byproduct formation typical indices of organic byproducts including tocl and tobr of sample b were therefore investigated besides the bromate formation was also measured before ozonation the secondary effluent contained certain levels of organic halogen with 47 6 μg l tocl as cl and 4 6 μg l tobr as br ozonation did not increase the tocl concentration because the reaction between chloride and o3 oh was negligible von gunten 2003 on the contrary tocl was degraded to 29 3 μg l after 10 mg l ozone was added fig 6 a this also partially explains the detoxification effects of ozonation in the absence of bromide as the organic chlorine pollutants in the secondary effluent might be toxic after bromide addition the tocl concentration remained stable but tobr and bromate rose substantially when the initial bromide concentration was 500 μg l the concentrations of tobr and bromate were 26 4 μg l and 25 0 μg l as br respectively the yields of tobr and bromate were comparable to those in previous studies huang et al 2003 soltermann et al 2017 zhang et al 2005 increasing the bromide concentration to 2000 μg l further enhanced the formation of tobr and bromate resulting in a tobr concentration of 226 3 μg l higher than the bromate concentration of 90 0 μg l the mass of different bromine species balanced well in this study fig s5 the formation mechanisms of intermediate hobr obr and final product bromate have been well clarified in previous study von sonntag c and von gunten 2012 which are described as eqs 1 and 2 1 b r o h b r o 3 b r o o 3 b r o 3 2 b r o 3 h o b r o b r o 3 o h b r o 3 bromate is mainly formed via eq 1 during ozonation soltermann et al 2017 that means both molecular o3 and oh contribute to the bromate formation the organic bromine is resulted from hobr obr while hobr obr is mainly generated by molecular o3 eq 2 thus molecular o3 might be responsible for the formation of organic bromine hobr reacts quickly with the nom in surface water with a rate constant of 1 64 1 93 109 m 1 h 1 at 25 c at a ph of 7 6 duirk and valentine 2007 and typical phenolic compounds with a rate constant of 104 108 m 1 s 1 at 24 c at a ph of 7 criquet et al 2015 organic matter has been reported to reduce bromate formation during ozonation due to the inhibited reaction between o3 oh and hobr obr moslemi et al 2014 however the toxicity of the formed tobr seems to be non negligible changes in cytotoxicity genotoxicity and tobr of the ozonated samples containing bromide are plotted in fig 6b under different bromide concentrations cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were found to increase with the tobr formation previous studies also reported the formation of several brominated byproducts during ozonation such as bromoform dibromoacetonitrile and dibromoacetic acid huang et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 which are all cytotoxic and genotoxic because tobr is difficult to be separated from the organic extracts the toxicity of tobr was not directly verified in this study the contribution of tobr to the toxicity increase needs further research in the future 3 4 toxicity evaluation of bromate bromate has been considered an important byproduct during ozonation previous in vivo assay showed that bromate induced the micronuclei in mice bone marrow and caused oxidative damage and chromosomal mutations in rat kidneys when it was present at relatively high concentrations 250 and 500 mg l and long exposure time more than 100 weeks iarc 1999 umemura and kurokawa 2006 the in vitro cytotoxicity genotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by bromate were measured in this study figs s6a s6c show the concentration response curve of each toxic endpoint and the lowest toxicity concentrations are given in table s2 generally the lowest toxicity concentrations were from tens of mg l to more than one hundred mg l the lc50 of cytotoxicity and ir1 5 of genotoxicity were 219 3 mg l and 172 2 mg l respectively comparable to those in vitro assays in previous studies plewa et al 2002 poul et al 2004 3 5 toxicity of exposure to both organic byproducts and bromate section 3 2 showed that in the presence of bromide in secondary effluents organic byproducts formed during ozonation were rather toxic but the toxicity of bromate was not considered because spe pretreatment cannot retain the inorganic components toxicity to cho cells when exposed to both organic byproducts and bromate was therefore investigated byproducts formed under 500 and 2000 μg l bromide were used for the toxicity test bromate was added to the organic extracts from spe its concentration was the measured value multiplied by the concentration factor influence of bromate on the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and 8 oh d g induced by the organic products are shown in fig 7 a c see figs s7a and s7b for results of ros and rns statistical analysis shows that for cytotoxicity the toxicity difference of organic byproducts with and without bromate addition was not significant even though the bromate concentration as br was as high as 10 8 mg l tables s3 s4 similarly for genotoxicity significant difference was not observed the maximum bromate concentration as br was 1 5 mg l however for ros rns and 8 oh d g formation bromate enhanced the toxicity at the concentration around 1 2 mg l as br tables s5 s7 suggesting bromate formed during ozonation can also partially contribute to toxicity increase previous studies generally focused on the risk of bromate during ozonation as it was demonstrated to be genotoxic and carcinogenic this study found that the toxicity of organic byproducts is not negligible during the ozonation of bromide containing wastewater some individual organic brominated byproducts like bromoform and bromoacetic acid were found at very low concentrations several μg l during water ozonation in previous studies legube 1996 zhang et al 2005 but the toxicity of the overall organic byproduct mixture is non negligible because many of the organic byproducts formed have not been identified and quantified yet considering the simultaneous increase in tobr formation and toxicity the organic brominated byproducts are strongly speculated to be responsible for the toxicity increase for example some brominated aromatic dbps and brominated benzoquinones were recently found to be rather toxic li et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 in the future apart from focusing on bromate much work is needed to identify the highly toxic organic brominated byproducts in ozonated water 4 conclusions the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and oxidative damage to cho cells of the organic byproducts that were formed during ozonation of wastewater effluent in the absence or presence of bromide were evaluated the organic and inorganic byproducts were also measured the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the absence of bromide ozonation could effectively reduce the cytotoxicity genotoxicity oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage induced by the organic extracts from wastewater 2 toxicity of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater containing bromide significantly increased bromide at a concentration of only 100 μg l caused a higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the ozonated sample without bromide both oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage substantially increased when cho cells were exposed to the organic extracts from ozonated wastewater containing more than 500 μg l bromide 3 an increase in bromide concentration in the secondary effluent resulted in increased tobr and bromate formation during ozonation cytotoxicity and genotoxicity increased with the tobr formation which is speculated to be responsible for the toxicity increase 4 both organic byproducts and bromate contributed to the toxicity increase bromate induced toxicity to cho cells at relatively high concentration during ozonation of wastewater containing bromide particular attention should be paid to the organic byproducts such as tobr acknowledgments this study was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51738005 51678332 the shenzhen science

18632,ozonation is widely used in wastewater treatment but the associated byproduct formation is a concern when ozonation is used in the presence of bromide bromate is generally considered as a major byproduct and few studies have examined the toxicity of organic byproducts this study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and dna rna oxidative damage to chinese hamster ovary cho cells of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater in the absence or presence of bromide ozonation effectively detoxified secondary effluents containing no bromide however ozonation significantly increased the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the effluents spiked with a bromide concentration as low as 100 μg l compared with the bromide free effluent when the bromide concentration in the effluent was increased to 2000 μg l ozonation resulted in 1 4 1 5 times the cytotoxicity and 1 5 5 0 times the genotoxicity of the non ozonated secondary effluent besides the oxidative stress including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species and dna rna oxidative damage also became more severe and a high level of 8 hydroxy deoxy guanosine was detected in the cho cell nucleus in the presence of bromide cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were found to increase with the formation of total organic bromine tobr when the cho cells were exposed to both the organic byproducts and bromate formed from wastewater containing 500 and 2000 μg l bromide bromate significantly increased oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage at relatively high concentration factors suggesting both organic byproduct and bromate can contribute to toxicity increase during ozonation of the effluent containing bromide particular attention should be paid to the organic byproducts such as tobr

european council 1998 usepa 2006 who 2005 much effort has been paid to the formation risk and control of bromate during water ozonation chon et al 2015 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 soltermann et al 2017 but only a few studies have focused on the influence of bromide on the toxicity induced by organic extracts dong et al 2017 han and zhang 2018 during ozonation of water containing br hypobromous acid hobr and its conjugate base bro are the key intermediates von gunten and hoigne 1994 the final product bro3 is mainly formed by hydroxyl radicals oxidizing hobr bro via the different formation pathways von gunten and hoigne 1994 dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater can scavenge hydroxyl radicals thereby inhibiting the formation of bromate but it may lead to more hobr bro reacting with dom to form organic byproducts although the reaction rate constant between dom in wastewater and hobr is rarely reported hobr reacts quickly with the natural organic matter nom in surface water with an apparent rate constant of 1 64 1 93 109 m 1 h 1 at 25 c at a ph of 7 6 duirk and valentine 2007 and typical organic compounds such as phloroglucinol and tannic acid with an apparent rate constant between 104 and 108 m 1 s 1 at 24 c at a ph of 7 criquet et al 2015 thus dom may compete with o3 oh strongly to react with hobr bro hobr bro can be reduced to br by electron transfer between hobr bro and dom but it forms toxic organic brominated byproducts through electrophilic substitution wenk et al 2013 the electrophilic substitution ratios of hobr bro and nom in the suwannee river and a nordic reservoir were about 20 criquet et al 2015 all these studies strongly suggest that organic brominated byproducts may be formed during ozonation of bromide containing wastewater studies have reported the formation of some individual organic brominated byproducts such as bromoform bromoacetic acid and dibromoacetonitrile during the ozonation of bromide containing water legube 1996 zhang et al 2005 concentrations of these byproducts were as low as several μg l far below the standard of usepa total trihalomethane 80 μg l total haloacetic acid 60 μg l usepa 2006 however the cytotoxicity of bromoacetic acid lc50 1 2 mg l or dibromoacetonitrile lc50 0 6 mg l in chinese hamster ovary cho cells was much higher than that of bromate lc50 123 3 mg l muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2002 suggesting the toxicity of organic byproducts may not be negligible furthermore in the presence of bromide many other organic byproducts may form during ozonation yet their toxicity is unclear because they are unidentified and unquantified therefore the risk of byproducts may be seriously underestimated if we only focus on the bromate formation during ozonation it is necessary to understand the influence of bromide on the toxicity of organic byproducts formed during ozonation this study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity to cho cells of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater in the absence or presence of bromide oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage in cho cells induced by the byproducts were also evaluated besides the influence of bromate on the toxicity induced by organic byproducts was investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples a and b collected on different dates were acquired from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in shenzhen china samples were collected from the clarifier after secondary treatment via the anaerobic anoxic oxic process water samples were immediately transferred to the laboratory and stored at 2 4 c samples were passed through a cellulose acetate membrane 0 45 μm before any water quality analyses and the subsequent experiments the basic water analyses were conducted within 48 h after sampling the dissolved organic carbon doc value was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the ph value was measured using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius design germany the bromide and bromate concentrations were measured with an ion chromatograph equipped with an ionpac as19 analytical column and a conductivity detector dionex aquion thermo scientific u s the quantitation limits in secondary effluent matrices for bromide and bromate were approximately 10 and 5 μg l respectively the ammonia nitrogen concentration was measured with an ammonia photometer hi96700 hanna instruments italy details of the water quality are shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation ozonation experiment was conducted in a 0 6 m deep glass reactor containing 1000 ml of the water sample ozone gas from an ozone generator ozocenter china was introduced to the sample the water sample came into full contact with ozone by using a magnetic stirrer the concentration of the ozone gas was determined with an ozone analyzer ideal 2000 ozone analyzer zibo china the flow rate of the ozone gas was regulated by a rotameter the added dose of ozone was determined by the difference in ozone dose at the inlet and outlet of the reactor after ozonation all the water samples were fully shaken to completely evaporate the residual ozone the hobr residual was quenched with 105 stoichiometric amounts of sodium thiosulfate 2 3 solid phase extraction water samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe according to previous studies du et al 2017 kadmi et al 2014a b before they were passed through the extraction cartridges oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance 500 mg 6 ml waters u s a water samples were adjusted to ph 2 00 0 05 with h2so4 2 mol l the extraction speed was approximately 5 ml min after that the cartridge was completely dried by nitrogen stream for around 1 h then eluted successively with 5 ml of methanol 2 ml of acetone and 2 ml of dichloromethane the spe eluate containing organic extracts was completely dried under nitrogen flow organic extracts were then dissolved in 0 5 2 0 ml culture medium according to the required concentration factor for toxicity assay the doc recovery rate of spe was approximately 80 85 2 4 cell culture a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line obtained from the american type culture collection was used to perform the toxicity assay cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle medium nutrition mixture f 12 dmem f12 1 1 gibco u s a supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs gibco 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg l streptomycin gibco u s a cells in culture dishes corning u s a were placed in a sterile incubator with 5 co2 gas at 37 c under saturated humidity cell passaging was performed every two days cells undergoing 2 5 passages were used for the cytotoxicity assay 2 5 cytotoxicity assay cell viability was measured based on the adenosine triphosphate atp assay using the celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay kit promega usa according to previous studies du et al 2018a the luciferase and luciferin in the kit react to emit photons in the presence of the atp released by viable cells while the luminescent signal is proportional to the number of viable cells a phenol solution was used as the positive control to quantify the cytotoxicity equivalent therefore cytotoxicity in this study was expressed in mg phenol l cell viability tests were performed in 4 6 replicates the protocol of the atp assay and the calculation of cytotoxicity equivalents are detailed in text s1 2 6 genotoxicity assay the double strand break dsb in genomic dna was adopted to test the genotoxicity of water samples the dsb site was measured by the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax assay when a dsb occurs the histone h2ax is phosphorylated at ser 139 to form ph2ax foci which further recruit proteins to repair the damaged dna kang et al 2013 the number of dsb can be measured by the number of ph2ax foci due to the one to one correspondence after cells were treated with samples for 24 h the ph2ax foci were measured by the method of immunofluorescence the reagent and protocol are described in the si cell viability was determined at the same time only cells with viability exceeding 70 were used for genotoxicity assay plewa et al 2010 a 4 nitroquinoline n oxide 4 nqo solution was used as the positive control to quantify the genotoxicity equivalent the method for genotoxicity equivalent quantification is described in text s2 the genotoxicity tests were performed in 4 6 replicates 2 7 oxidative stress assay reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns were measured according to a previous study du et al 2018a b ros was measured with the intracellular total ros assay kit ka4075 abnova after cells were exposed to the samples for 12 h the culture medium was removed then the cell permeable and non fluorescent ros probe in the kit was added and incubated for 1 h after that the cell image was recorded using a high content analysis system hca imagexpress micro molecular devices usa with a 10 objective lens via the tetramethylrhodamine tritc channel the fluorescence intensity of cells was calculated using the software metaxpress that came with the hca system meanwhile cell nuclei were stained by hoechst sigma usa and photographed using the 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride dapi channel similar to the ros measurement rns was determined with an intracellular rns assay kit sta 800 oxiselect while the fluorescent signal was recorded through the fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc channel of the hca system both the ros and rns levels were calculated by dividing the total fluorescence intensity by the cell number ros and rns levels of each sample were measured in 4 6 replicates 2 8 measurement of oxidative damage markers of dna and rna 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine 8 ohdg and 8 hydroxy guanosine 8 ohg are base modification products when hydroxyl radicals attack the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine causing dna and rna damage respectively col et al 2010 the 8 oh d g level was used as a marker to characterize the oxidative damage to dna and rna shi et al 2012 the total 8 ohdg and 8 ohg 8 oh d g contents were measured by the immunofluorescence method the steps of fixation membrane permeation as well as blocking are identical to the determination with ph2ax assay as detailed in section 2 6 cells were then incubated with a primary antibody dna rna oxidative damage markers thermo for 1 h before they were stained with a secondary antibody alexa fluor plus 555 thermo and hoechst sigma for another 1 h the 8 oh d g and cell nuclei were recorded via the tritc and dapi channels respectively the fluorescence intensity of 8 oh d g and the number of nuclei were calculated using the software metaxpress the 8 oh d g level was quantified by the total fluorescence intensity divided by the cell number the 8 oh d g level of each sample was measured in 4 6 replicates the 8 oh d g content in the nucleus and that in the cytoplasm were differentiated by the metaxpress software 2 9 measurement of total organic halogen tox the total organic chlorine tocl and total organic bromine tobr were measured the tox measurement mostly followed the standard method 5320b apha et al 2012 except that an off line ion chromatograph was used to detect chloride and bromide from pyrolysis of tocl and tobr respectively jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 the practical quantitation limits for tocl and tobr were 2 μg l as cl and 4 μg l as br respectively according to the standard method apha et al 2012 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp and 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp were used as the standard compounds to generate calibration curves for tocl and tobr respectively the protocol of tox measurement has been described elsewhere li et al 2011 2 10 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova tests were conducted to determine if a sample caused a significant level of toxicity if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a post hoc test of holm sidak multiple comparison versus the negative control analysis was then performed to identify the lowest toxicity concentration the power of the test statistic 1 β was set to 0 8 at α 0 05 yang et al 2014 the two tailed t test was applied to analyze the significance of the toxicity difference between the organic samples with and without bromate addition after testing for homogeneity of variance for the cytotoxicity assay the sample concentration at which the relative cell viability is 50 over the negative control is defined as the lc50 for the genotoxicity assay the sample concentration at which the ph2ax induction ratio is 1 5 over the negative control is defined as the ir1 5 cytotoxicity and genotoxicity equivalents are obtained as described in the si one way anova tests were performed to determine significant difference between toxicity equivalents 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity reduction by ozonation in the absence of bromide secondary effluent samples from the wwtp containing no br or below the quantitation limit were specifically collected for sample a adding 5 mg l o3 significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts from 8 2 mg phenol l to 5 0 mg phenol l p 0 05 fig 1 increasing the ozone dose to 20 mg l further decreased the cytotoxicity to 3 2 mg phenol l cytotoxicity represents the changes of cell viability it is the comprehensive and final results when cells are exposed to harmful pollutants but gives limited information about the specific toxic effects on other endpoints genotoxicity in this study was characterized by the dna dsbs and measured by the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax foci stiff et al 2004 dsbs can activate oncogenes inactivate tumor suppressors and change the modifier proteins that influence chemosensitivity and tumor progression so that organisms are more susceptible to cancers and other diseases kang et al 2013 adding 20 mg l o3 substantially reduced the genotoxicity from 1 6 μg 4 nqo l to 0 8 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 fig 1 similar reductions in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were observed in sample b fig s1a fig s1b also gives the changes of doc during ozonation influence of ozonation on the oxidative stress in cho cells by organic extracts sample a was also studied ozonation could lower the levels of both intracellular ros and intracellular rns induced by the organic extracts fig 2 a and b as the intracellular ros and rns concentrations were attenuated when the cells were exposed to ozonated organic extracts the total 8 oh d g levels attributed to the organic extracts dropped as well with the increase of ozone dose fig 2c the 8 oh d g contents in the nucleus and the cytoplasm were differentiated using the metaxpress software both the nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g shared the same decreasing trend figs s2a and s2b these results demonstrate that in the absence of bromide in real wastewater ozonation can effectively reduce the toxicity of organic extracts to cho cells the toxicity of organic matter obtained from spe mainly resulted from various hazardous pollutants in the real wastewater degradation and detoxification of specific pollutants occurring in wastewater by ozonation have been well studied van aken et al 2015 the detoxification effects of ozonation on real wastewater such as acute toxicity and endocrine disrupting activity has also been reported punzi et al 2015 tang et al 2014 although ozonation of wastewater also forms toxic organic byproducts like aldehydes and ketones tentscher et al 2018 the spe pretreatment cannot retain the volatile byproducts to be more precise in the absence of bromide ozonation can effectively reduce the toxicity of non volatile organic extracts from real wastewater which might be because of the transformation of toxic pollutants into non toxic or low toxic products 3 2 influence of bromide on the toxicity changes during ozonation water samples were spiked with bromide at concentrations ranging from 100 to 2000 μg l and then 10 mg l o3 was dosed the ozonated organic matter was thereafter extracted by spe and used for toxicity assays fig 3 and fig s3 show the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the organic extracts from ozonated samples a and b containing bromide respectively after ozonation compared with the sample without bromide cytotoxicity of organic extracts from samples spiked 100 μg l bromide increased from 4 1 to 4 6 mg phenol l p 0 05 for sample a and from 4 6 to 5 6 mg phenol l p 0 05 for sample b raising the bromide concentration in the secondary effluents increased the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts of the ozonated samples when 2000 μg l bromide was spiked the cytotoxicity of ozonated samples a and b reached 12 4 and 10 7 mg phenol l respectively which were even higher than the cytotoxicity of the secondary effluent without ozonation 1 5 times higher for sample a and 1 4 times higher for sample b compared with the sample without bromide after ozonation genotoxicity of organic extracts from secondary effluents spiked 100 μg l bromide increased from 1 0 to 1 2 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 for sample a and from 2 0 to 2 7 μg 4 nqo l p 0 05 for sample b the existence of 500 μg l bromide increased the genotoxicity of the organic extract of ozonated sample a to 2 3 μg 4 nqo l fig 3 surpassing the genotoxicity of the secondary effluent without ozonation p 0 05 further increasing the bromide concentration led to a much higher genotoxicity equivalent when 2000 μg l bromide was spiked in the secondary effluents the genotoxicity of ozonated samples a and b rose up to 5 0 times and 1 5 times of the genotoxicity of samples a and b without ozonation respectively these results demonstrate that the toxic effects of organic byproducts formed during ozonation in the presence of bromide would offset or even overtake the detoxification effects of ozonation described in section 3 1 when cells were exposed to the organic byproducts intracellular oxidative stress such as ros and rns may rises to eliminate the xenobiotic toxic chemicals boonstra and post 2004 however the excessive accumulation of oxidative stress may cause adverse effects to cells shi et al 2012 which is considered as one of the causes of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity du et al 2018b li et al 2016 compared with the sample containing no bromide the sample spiked with 100 μg l bromide induced similar level of ros or rns after ozonation fig 4 a and b however with further increasing the bromide concentration in the secondary effluent after ozonation organic extracts substantially increased the ros and rns levels in cho cells for the ozonated sample containing 500 μg l bromide both the ros and rns levels were much higher than those in the secondary effluent before ozonation indicating that the organic byproducts formed in the presence of bromide showed a strong ability to induce oxidative stress ros and rns can react with or modify biomolecules in cells du et al 2013 balanced oxidative stress plays a critical role in many intracellular signal transduction pathways but excessive accumulation can lead to irreversible oxidative damage to biomolecules pals et al 2013 hence 8 oh d g which characterizes dna and rna oxidative damage was further measured similar to oxidative stress accumulation after ozonation organic extracts from the sample containing 100 μg l bromide did not cause the total 8 oh d g level to change much compared with the sample without bromide however further increasing the bromide concentration in water sample substantially enhanced the ability of organic byproducts to induce 8 oh d g fig 5 a during dna replication 8 ohdg and adenine are mismatched resulting in gene mutation col et al 2010 the 8 ohdg in dna is considered to play a part in the initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis and so it is used as a biomarker of various cancers and degenerative diseases valavanidis et al 2009 the 8 ohg in rna also interferes with the normal expression of proteins shi et al 2012 these results suggest that the organic byproducts formed during ozonation in the presence of bromide are a potential risk when the cho cells were exposed to the organic extracts of the ozonated sample containing bromide the nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g showed similar change patterns to the total 8 oh d g figs s4a and s4b by combining the results shown in figs s2a and s2b the distribution of nucleus 8 oh d g and cytoplasm 8 oh d g induced by the organic extracts of the ozonated samples in the absence or presence of bromide is plotted in fig 5b it is interesting to see that the organic byproducts of samples containing bromide induced higher nucleus 8 oh d g than samples containing no bromide did rna and dna in the cytoplasm might be oxidized by ros more easily than those in the nucleus as they are located closer to the mitochondria which produce the majority of the ros boonstra and post 2004 when samples contained bromide the organic extracts induced much higher levels of oxidative stress this enabled more ros to be accessed by the nucleus resulting in the formation of more nucleus 8 oh d g dna mainly exists in chromosomes in the nucleus with a small amount in mitochondria while rna mainly exists in the cytoplasm huang and zhang 2003 the much higher levels of oxidative stress that were induced by the organic extracts of the ozonated samples containing bromide might cause greater oxidative damage to dna 3 3 byproduct formation during ozonation in the presence of bromide the toxicity of organic extracts increased during ozonation might be attributed to the byproduct formation typical indices of organic byproducts including tocl and tobr of sample b were therefore investigated besides the bromate formation was also measured before ozonation the secondary effluent contained certain levels of organic halogen with 47 6 μg l tocl as cl and 4 6 μg l tobr as br ozonation did not increase the tocl concentration because the reaction between chloride and o3 oh was negligible von gunten 2003 on the contrary tocl was degraded to 29 3 μg l after 10 mg l ozone was added fig 6 a this also partially explains the detoxification effects of ozonation in the absence of bromide as the organic chlorine pollutants in the secondary effluent might be toxic after bromide addition the tocl concentration remained stable but tobr and bromate rose substantially when the initial bromide concentration was 500 μg l the concentrations of tobr and bromate were 26 4 μg l and 25 0 μg l as br respectively the yields of tobr and bromate were comparable to those in previous studies huang et al 2003 soltermann et al 2017 zhang et al 2005 increasing the bromide concentration to 2000 μg l further enhanced the formation of tobr and bromate resulting in a tobr concentration of 226 3 μg l higher than the bromate concentration of 90 0 μg l the mass of different bromine species balanced well in this study fig s5 the formation mechanisms of intermediate hobr obr and final product bromate have been well clarified in previous study von sonntag c and von gunten 2012 which are described as eqs 1 and 2 1 b r o h b r o 3 b r o o 3 b r o 3 2 b r o 3 h o b r o b r o 3 o h b r o 3 bromate is mainly formed via eq 1 during ozonation soltermann et al 2017 that means both molecular o3 and oh contribute to the bromate formation the organic bromine is resulted from hobr obr while hobr obr is mainly generated by molecular o3 eq 2 thus molecular o3 might be responsible for the formation of organic bromine hobr reacts quickly with the nom in surface water with a rate constant of 1 64 1 93 109 m 1 h 1 at 25 c at a ph of 7 6 duirk and valentine 2007 and typical phenolic compounds with a rate constant of 104 108 m 1 s 1 at 24 c at a ph of 7 criquet et al 2015 organic matter has been reported to reduce bromate formation during ozonation due to the inhibited reaction between o3 oh and hobr obr moslemi et al 2014 however the toxicity of the formed tobr seems to be non negligible changes in cytotoxicity genotoxicity and tobr of the ozonated samples containing bromide are plotted in fig 6b under different bromide concentrations cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were found to increase with the tobr formation previous studies also reported the formation of several brominated byproducts during ozonation such as bromoform dibromoacetonitrile and dibromoacetic acid huang et al 2003 zhang et al 2005 which are all cytotoxic and genotoxic because tobr is difficult to be separated from the organic extracts the toxicity of tobr was not directly verified in this study the contribution of tobr to the toxicity increase needs further research in the future 3 4 toxicity evaluation of bromate bromate has been considered an important byproduct during ozonation previous in vivo assay showed that bromate induced the micronuclei in mice bone marrow and caused oxidative damage and chromosomal mutations in rat kidneys when it was present at relatively high concentrations 250 and 500 mg l and long exposure time more than 100 weeks iarc 1999 umemura and kurokawa 2006 the in vitro cytotoxicity genotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by bromate were measured in this study figs s6a s6c show the concentration response curve of each toxic endpoint and the lowest toxicity concentrations are given in table s2 generally the lowest toxicity concentrations were from tens of mg l to more than one hundred mg l the lc50 of cytotoxicity and ir1 5 of genotoxicity were 219 3 mg l and 172 2 mg l respectively comparable to those in vitro assays in previous studies plewa et al 2002 poul et al 2004 3 5 toxicity of exposure to both organic byproducts and bromate section 3 2 showed that in the presence of bromide in secondary effluents organic byproducts formed during ozonation were rather toxic but the toxicity of bromate was not considered because spe pretreatment cannot retain the inorganic components toxicity to cho cells when exposed to both organic byproducts and bromate was therefore investigated byproducts formed under 500 and 2000 μg l bromide were used for the toxicity test bromate was added to the organic extracts from spe its concentration was the measured value multiplied by the concentration factor influence of bromate on the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and 8 oh d g induced by the organic products are shown in fig 7 a c see figs s7a and s7b for results of ros and rns statistical analysis shows that for cytotoxicity the toxicity difference of organic byproducts with and without bromate addition was not significant even though the bromate concentration as br was as high as 10 8 mg l tables s3 s4 similarly for genotoxicity significant difference was not observed the maximum bromate concentration as br was 1 5 mg l however for ros rns and 8 oh d g formation bromate enhanced the toxicity at the concentration around 1 2 mg l as br tables s5 s7 suggesting bromate formed during ozonation can also partially contribute to toxicity increase previous studies generally focused on the risk of bromate during ozonation as it was demonstrated to be genotoxic and carcinogenic this study found that the toxicity of organic byproducts is not negligible during the ozonation of bromide containing wastewater some individual organic brominated byproducts like bromoform and bromoacetic acid were found at very low concentrations several μg l during water ozonation in previous studies legube 1996 zhang et al 2005 but the toxicity of the overall organic byproduct mixture is non negligible because many of the organic byproducts formed have not been identified and quantified yet considering the simultaneous increase in tobr formation and toxicity the organic brominated byproducts are strongly speculated to be responsible for the toxicity increase for example some brominated aromatic dbps and brominated benzoquinones were recently found to be rather toxic li et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 in the future apart from focusing on bromate much work is needed to identify the highly toxic organic brominated byproducts in ozonated water 4 conclusions the cytotoxicity genotoxicity and oxidative damage to cho cells of the organic byproducts that were formed during ozonation of wastewater effluent in the absence or presence of bromide were evaluated the organic and inorganic byproducts were also measured the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the absence of bromide ozonation could effectively reduce the cytotoxicity genotoxicity oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage induced by the organic extracts from wastewater 2 toxicity of organic extracts from ozonated wastewater containing bromide significantly increased bromide at a concentration of only 100 μg l caused a higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the ozonated sample without bromide both oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage substantially increased when cho cells were exposed to the organic extracts from ozonated wastewater containing more than 500 μg l bromide 3 an increase in bromide concentration in the secondary effluent resulted in increased tobr and bromate formation during ozonation cytotoxicity and genotoxicity increased with the tobr formation which is speculated to be responsible for the toxicity increase 4 both organic byproducts and bromate contributed to the toxicity increase bromate induced toxicity to cho cells at relatively high concentration during ozonation of wastewater containing bromide particular attention should be paid to the organic byproducts such as tobr acknowledgments this study was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51738005 51678332 the shenzhen science

18633,nitrous oxide n2o emitted from biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems contributes significantly to the total carbon footprint of modern wastewater treatment plants in the present study n2o production and emissions were experimentally determined in a large scale plant 220 000 pe employing combined nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal as a modelling tool the activated sludge model 2d asm2d was extended with modules describing multiple n2o production pathways and n2o liquid gas transfers the new model was calibrated and validated using the results of laboratory experiments and full scale measurements different operational strategies were evaluated following the proposed model based procedure heterotrophic denitrification was found to be the predominant pathway of n2o production under both anoxic and aerobic conditions this behaviour could primarily be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers over nitrifiers simulations revealed that the optimal solution for minimizing liquid n2o production is to set the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic zone from 1 to 2 mg o2 l and to enhance the mixed liquor recirculation rate mlr 500 of the influent flowrate while not compromising effluent standards regarding the actual conditions the potential reduction in the carbon footprint was estimated to be 10 by applying the proposed operational strategy the results suggest that considerable improvements can be achieved without substantial upgrades and increased costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon footprint full scale plant nitrous oxide n2o mitigation modelling 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o emissions from anthropogenic sources have received special attention in recent years as it is reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 the global warming potential gwp of n2o is 265 times greater than that of carbon dioxide co2 in modern wastewater treatment plants wwtps up to 90 of n2o can be produced and subsequently emitted in the biological steps via the nitrification and denitrification processes campos et al 2016 recent investigations have identified three microbial pathways for n2o production schreiber et al 2012 tallec et al 2006 wunderlin et al 2012 two pathways are mediated by autotrophic nitrifiers specifically ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob including the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation and autotrophic denitrification the third pathway is related to heterotrophic denitrification with n2o as an intermediate product the conditions favouring n2o production consist of low dissolved oxygen do levels during nitrification low carbon to nitrogen c n ratios during heterotrophic denitrification and elevated nitrite no2 n levels during both nitrification and denitrification flores alsina et al 2011 mannina et al 2017 massara et al 2018 ni et al 2011 peng et al 2014 tallec et al 2008 in general aerobic conditions contribute to higher n2o production through the nitrification related pathways and to higher n2o emissions due to stripping furthermore intensive aerobic conditions are also responsible for increased energy requirements and an increased carbon footprint kim et al 2015 massara et al 2018 mikosz 2016 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 numerous full scale measurements on n2o emissions have been conducted worldwide table s1 but considerable variations one order of magnitude have been observed both across different plants and temporarily within one plant daelman et al 2015 ni et al 2015 pan et al 2016 several measures for mitigating n2o emissions have been proposed including the step aeration mode wang et al 2016 distribution of the return activated sludge between compartments pan et al 2016 controlling the do concentrations sun et al 2015 and cancelling the anaerobic phase and extending the idle phase in a sequencing batch reactor chen et al 2014 it should be emphasized that n2o emissions need to be accurately estimated due to the potential impact on the total carbon footprint of a wwtp de haas and hartley 2004 estimated that just 1 of the removed n load emitted as n2o would increase the carbon footprint of a plant by approximately 30 the reported contributions of n2o emissions to the total carbon footprint ranged from 60 to 80 daelman et al 2013 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 regardless of these differences mitigating n2o emissions and decreasing the carbon footprint of wwtps is strongly linked to the energy consuming processes in the bioreactors such as aeration and pumping marques et al 2016 pan et al 2016 modification of the operational conditions of existing plants is thus the most economical way to decrease greenhouse gas ghg emissions provided that the effluent quality is not degraded campos et al 2016 kim et al 2015 mikosz 2016 selection of the optimal operational conditions in bioreactors with respect to ghg emissions energy and effluent quality becomes a complex multivariable optimization problem kim et al 2015 that can be solved by model based analysis multi pathway n2o production models have been developed and evaluated under laboratory conditions including identification of the dominant n2o production pathways massara et al 2017 ni and yuan 2015 however for practical applications in full scale bioreactors it has been postulated that these models should be extended by considering the liquid gas transfers of n2o to predict n2o emissions massara et al 2017 only in a few studies ni et al 2013 2015 blomberg et al 2018 conducted in n removal nitrification denitrification activated sludge as systems comprehensive full scale monitoring data have been used to evaluate the n2o production and emission models until now no modelling studies have been performed for full scale combined n and p removal systems which are most commonly employed in modern wwtps mathematical models describing n2o production during the enhanced biological p removal ebpr process have recently been proposed liu et al 2015 massara et al 2018 wisniewski et al 2018 but these models have not yet been evaluated against the full scale experimental data in the present study n2o production and emissions were experimentally determined and predicted for a large scale municipal wwtp located in the city of slupsk northern poland employing combined n and p removal in the modelling part of the study the activated sludge model 2d asm2d henze et al 2000 was extended with modules describing multi pathway n2o production and n2o liquid gas transfers the new model was then calibrated and validated using the results of extensive laboratory scale experiments and full scale measurement campaigns performed in different periods in the studied facility for the model based evaluation of n2o production and emission a standardized procedure was proposed including the analysis of n2o mitigation strategies and carbon footprint calculation following that procedure the optimal operational parameters were determined with respect to both direct and indirect ghg emissions at the studied plant the model developed in the present study combines and evaluates against the

returned from the last aerobic compartment ae2 to the second or the third compartment in the bioreactor ao1 or ao2 respectively depending on the actual operating conditions the return activated sludge ras flow from the secondary clarifier is returned to the inlet of the bioreactor 2 2 general procedure a general procedure for model based evaluation of n2o production and emissions was developed and applied specifically to the studied wwtp fig s1 in the supporting information si the procedure tailored for the plant to maximize use of available data incorporates the sequential steps from the full scale and laboratory scale trials no 1 and 2 data collection through model development calibration and validation to the model based evaluation of strategies for mitigating n2o production and decreasing the carbon footprint a two step calibration was specifically applied for the n2o data i e calibration of n2o production after achieving good fits for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n as proposed by ni et al 2015 and domingo félez et al 2017 2 3 collection of experimental data 2 3 1 full scale measurements to maximize the use of available data for the studied plant the results from two measurement campaigns were used for simulations the campaigns were performed in the summer periods of different years namely 2012 and 2016 but the process conditions in terms of wastewater characteristics and aeration control were similar in those periods table s2 in the si the average nominal hydraulic retention times in the bioreactor were 1 5 d and 1 7 d respectively in summer 2012 and summer 2016 with this approach it could be confirmed if the model was capable of predicting performance for different periods with one set of parameters the first 4 day measurement campaign was performed in the biological reactor of the slupsk wwtp in august 2012 at t 20 c and total solids retention time srt 26 d grab samples were withdrawn every 2 h from the following sampling locations primary effluent and the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic compartments in the bioreactor the samples were analysed for several parameters including i chemical oxygen demand cod scod soluble fraction of cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp for the primary effluent only and ii ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n and soluble ortho phosphate po4 3 p for all sampling points the first 4 day campaign trial no 1 full scale was used for model calibration without consideration of n2o data as n2o was not measured during that campaign more details about that measurement campaign can be found in zaborowska et al 2017 the second 4 day measurement campaign was conducted in the slupsk wwtp in september 2016 at t 21 c grab samples were withdrawn every 2 h from the following sampling points plant influent anaerobic anoxic and aerobic compartments of the bioreactor the plant influent was analysed for cod scod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nh4 n po4 3 p and tp the filtered samples of the mixed liquor from the bioreactors were analysed for nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p moreover average daily samples were also collected from the plant influent and from the primary and secondary effluents the samples were analysed for a number of parameters including cod scod tss vss tp po4 3 p tn tkn nh4 n and no3 n only in the secondary effluent the liquid and gaseous n2o concentrations were continuously monitored during the campaign the influent and effluent flowrates and do concentrations in the first and the second aerobic zones ae1 and ae2 were continuously measured and recorded every 10 min the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and its volatile fraction mlvss concentrations were measured once per day from grab samples withdrawn from ae2 the second measurement campaign involving the liquid and gaseous n2o measurements trial no 2 full scale was used for the full scale model validation 2 3 2 laboratory measurements a few accompanying laboratory scale experiments were performed by using the biomass from the slupsk wwtp in a 4 l laboratory scale batch reactor at the controlled temperature t 20 0 5 c during the course of the experiments the do concentrations and temperatures were continuously monitored using a cellox 325 probe wtw germany and were recorded every 20 s the mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured at both the beginning and end of each experiment details on the analytical methods used in the experiments can be found in the si one phase anoxic and two phase anaerobic aerobic anoxic experiments one one phase anoxic and two two phase anaerobic aerobic anoxic experiments accompanied the first full scale measurement campaign trial no 1 full scale more details about these experiments can be found in zaborowska et al 2017 these experimental data trial no 1 laboratory scale were used for the model calibration without consideration of n2o data one phase aerobic experiments with the liquid n 2 o measurements two aerobic experiments extended with the continuous liquid n2o monitoring accompanied the second full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 full scale the 6 h experiments were conducted at two different do levels do 1 0 mg o2 l and do 0 5 mg o2 l to minimize the influence of denitrification the remaining nitrate in the mixed liquor was reduced before the experiments by adding sodium acetate ch3coona at 6 gcod gn only nh4 n and nahco3 2 mol nahco3 per mole nh4 n were supplied at the beginning of the experiment during the experiments nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured at a frequency of 30 60 min the n2o n concentrations in the liquid phase were continuously monitored every 20s these experimental data trial no 2 laboratory scale were used for model recalibration with consideration of n2o data 2 3 3 measurements of n2o concentration during the laboratory experiments and the full scale measurement campaign during the laboratory scale experiments trial no 2 a clark type n2o microsensor unisense environment a s denmark was placed in the batch reactor during the second full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 the same n2o microsensor was placed in a closed mobile reactor v 3 l equipped with a mixer the off line location protected the sensor from undesirable displacements and ensured stable operation for the course of the experiment the reactor was permanently fully filled to avoid additional stripping effects and was continuously fed with the mixed liquor by a lifting pump submerged 1 m below the water level during the 4 day campaign the sampling point was located in ae1 the liquid n2o n concentrations were continuously monitored and recorded every 20s the basic characteristics of the microsensor and the temperature correction formula for the microsensor signal are described in detail in the si the n2o concentrations in the off gas were measured by fourier transform infrared ftir gas analyser gasmet cx 4000 coupled with a flow meter and a floating hood located at the same sampling point as for the liquid n2o the frequency of sampling was set to 20 s data reported in the literature ni et al 2015 pan et al 2016 rodriguez caballero et al 2014 revealed different longitudinal n2o profiles along the aerobic compartment the highest n2o emissions correlated with either high nh4 n and no2 n concentrations or were attributed to process disturbances such as no aeration periods or nitrification instability in the present study the selected location was assumed based on the results of both preliminary simulations and short term n2o measurements in different points in the bioreactor the simulations revealed that approximately 70 of the total n2o emissions from the bioreactor occurred in ae1 moreover in the field off gas measurements the n2o concentrations 14 8 1 4 mg n m3 in ae1 were approximately 3 times greater when compared to those in ae2 2 4 development of a biokinetic model describing n2o production and liquid gas transfers the standard asm2d henze et al 2000 calibrated and validated by zaborowska et al 2017 was used as a core model and was extended in the present study with the additional processes specifically related to n2o n2o production consumption transformations of n compounds no3 n to no2 n by dpaos air stripped n2o emissions and saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o these extensions were integrated into the new asm2d n2o model two n2o production pathways by aob and n2o production and consumption by denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos were incorporated into the model following the concept of lu et al 2018 dpaos were assumed to reduce no3 n only to no2 n following the concept of wisniewski et al 2018 the air stripped n2o emissions and saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o were introduced into the model by adding a new state variable the n2o emission rates in the anoxic and aerobic zones were calculated based on mathematical models baresel et al 2016 marques et al 2016 that described the n2o liquid gas transfers and the air stripping processes equation s1 s5 further details regarding the model development can be found in the si including the definitions of the state variables stoichiometric matrices and process rate equations tables s3 s9 a full list of the model parameters in the asm2d n2o can be found in table s14 2 5 calibration and validation of the biokinetic model to reduce the model uncertainty and minimize the number of the adjusted parameters domingo félez et al 2017 proposed a three step procedure model calibration recalibration and validation in the present study a similar approach was adopted with details shown in fig 2 i model calibration without consideration of the n2o data trial no 1 laboratory scale and full scale focusing

production iii model validation with consideration of the n2o data trial no 2 full scale focusing on the liquid n2o production and gaseous n2o emissions a sensitivity analysis identified the relative importance of different model parameters on the model outputs nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p scod and n2o n a one variable at a time sensitivity analysis was applied using a special gps x 7 0 hydromantis canada utility called the phase dynamic sensitivity analyser and a relative uncertainty of 20 specifically 10 of the adjusted value was assigned to each model parameter equation s6 the parameter estimation was performed using a gps x utility called optimizer using the nelder mead simplex method with the maximum likelihood objective function the average values from the dynamic simulations were compared with steady state predictions to evaluate the accuracy of steady state predictions and their applicability in the model based analysis of strategies for mitigation of n2o production 2 6 model based evaluation of n2o production and emission strategies for the mitigation of n2o production at the studied wwtp were analysed with the validated model by changing input variables such as the do concentration in the aerated zones and the mlr ratio the aim of the analysis was to investigate the interactions between n2o production and emissions tn removal efficiencies and energy consumption the do concentrations and mlr ratios were selected as examples of the most influential manipulated variables affecting wwtp performance these variables were investigated in several previous theoretical simulation studies to quantify ghg emissions at different control strategies flores alsina et al 2011 kim et al 2015 massara et al 2018 mikosz 2016 sweetapple et al 2014 and in a laboratory scale reactor yan et al 2016 a series of steady state simulations were conducted for a wide range of the two variables i e 0 1 3 5 mg o2 l with a step of 0 1 mg o2 l for the do concentration and 340 1000 with a step of 30 of the influent flowrates for the mlr ratio the steady state simulations 252 runs were conducted automatically using the analyze tool in gps x the 3 d graphs were developed in the surfer software golden software llc usa and the kriging method was used for interpolation of the data based on the results of all 252 runs the optimal points minima were searched with respect to n2o emissions from the specific compartments and the minimal carbon footprint for the entire bioreactor the average operational parameters and wastewater characteristics for the summer of 2016 table s2 in the si were used to obtain results at the reference state the considered total energy demand comprised the energy related to the manipulated variables i e electric energy for aeration and mlr pumping the power consumption by the fine bubble diffused aeration system was calculated based on the physical characteristics of the aeration system and the volumetric air flowrate imposed by the do control system table s10 in the si equations s7 s10 were used to calculate the wire power consumption by the blowers and by the mlr pumps the dynamic predictions of wire power consumption by the blowers were validated using the data from electricity meters in the full scale measurement campaign 2 7 evaluation of the carbon footprint the carbon footprint was expressed in co2 equivalents co2e with respect to direct emissions related to the biochemical processes in the bioreactor and indirect emissions related to the electricity consumption in the processes the considered total carbon footprint was composed of the co2e related to n2o emissions from the specific compartments anaerobic anoxic and aerobic of the bioreactor and the overall energy demand for aeration and mlr pumping the direct co2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the predicted fluxes of gaseous n2o emitted from the bioreactor by gwp 265 co2e ipcc 2014 predictions of the aeration and pumping wire power in kw were multiplied by the time period under consideration to obtain the daily energy consumption in kwh it was assumed that electricity was imported to the studied wwtp from the external grid thus the indirect co2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the electricity consumption by the default amount of co2 0 8 kg co2 kwh that was emitted during electricity generation by the industrial power plants in poland kobize 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration without consideration of n2o data trial no 1 laboratory scale and full scale the iterative model calibration without consideration of the n2o data was based on the results of the laboratory experiments in trial no 1 nh4 n no3 n po4 3 p and scod model predictions were first fitted to the measured data by adjusting

figure s2 d g and table s11 si regarding the full scale campaign the model predictions of asm2d n2o and asm2d figs s3d f were also consistent r2 0 65 for po4 3 p and no3 n the predictions even improved in the present study in comparison with the previous study zaborowska et al 2017 table s12 3 2 model recalibration with consideration of n2o data trial no 2 laboratory scale model recalibration with consideration of the n2o data was based on the results of the laboratory experiments in trial no 2 liquid n2o production the model predictions were fitted to the measured data first by adjusting only the parameters sensitive to n2o and not directly affecting the four target variables in the first step calibration i e the additional key parameters for the n2o production by both aob η 1 aob and η 2 aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers η no2 h η n2o h k no2 h and k n2o h the parameters most sensitive to n2o η no3 h and μ aob which were obtained from the first step calibration were also taken into account during the recalibration a list of all adjusted parameters along with their sensitivities is presented in table s13 and further discussed in the si among the sensitive parameters adjusted in the present study the parameters for n2o production and consumption pathways were consistent with the literature values apart from the nitrite reduction factor for heterotrophs η n o 2 h the adjusted η n o 2 h 0 60 mg n l was higher than the literature values η n o 2 h 0 35 mg n l lu et al 2018 which indicated the predominance of heterotrophic denitrification pathway the remaining parameters were adopted from asm2d 24 asm2d defaults and 12 from zaborowska et al 2017 and additionally from literature the n2o production consumption the transformations of n compounds no3 n to no2 n by dpao the air stripped n2o emissions and the saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o table s14 the values of these parameters were generally close to the asm2d defaults or within the ranges reported in the literature the model predictions and measured data of the laboratory scale tests are presented in fig 3 r 0 94 in both experiments the presence of do induced nitrification leading to no3 n accumulation while no2 n levels remained significantly lower 0 6 mg n l fig 3a d during the aerobic test at do 0 5 mg o2 l fig 3a c the highest liquid n2o concentrations 0 06 mg n l were observed after 2 h of the reaction phase fig 3b the simulation results suggested that heterotrophic denitrification made a significantly higher contribution to the n2o production in comparison with the nh2oh oxidation pathway when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs fig 3c whereas the estimated contribution from autotrophic denitrification was negligible in that experiment the dominant contribution of the heterotrophic pathway could be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophs over nitrifiers in the studied system in the experiment at do 1 0 mg o2 l fig 3d f a two fold lower liquid n2o concentration 0 03 mg n l was observed fig 3e partially due to higher aeration intensities resulting in a stronger n2o stripping effect 0 018 g n d at do 1 0 mg o2 l vs 0 003 g n d at do 0 5 mg o2 l at the higher do concentration the anoxic activity of heterotrophs was significantly inhibited and the estimated contributions of heterotrophic denitrification and of the nh2oh oxidation pathways became comparable in terms of n2o production when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs the autotrophic denitrification pathway was once again marginal fig 3f in the present study the adjusted oxygen half saturation coefficient k o h was within the range presented in the literature 0 01 0 5 mg o2 l mannina et al 2012 by changing k o h from 0 13 domingo félez et al 2017 to 0 3 this study the estimated anoxic activity of denitrifying heterotrophs approximately doubled for the actual aerobic conditions do 1 0 mg o2 l these results suggest that n2o may be explicitly produced by both aob nh2oh oxidation and heterotrophic denitrifiers it should also be emphasized that the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs significantly reduced their net contribution to n2o accumulation fig 3c f various dominant pathways of n2o production and emissions under aerobic conditions have been reported in other studies tallec et al 2008 found that below 0 3 mg o2 l heterotrophic denitrification was the major process responsible for n2o emissions in a denitrifying as system however the authors suggested that in the do range of 0 4 1 1 mg o2 l n2o production resulted from two processes including autotrophic 60 and heterotrophic 40 denitrification shen et al 2015 demonstrated that heterotrophic activities significantly affected n2o emission during nitrification in recent studies heterotrophic denitrifiers were found to be the key contributors to n2o production in as under aerobic conditions do 0 2 6 5 mg o2 l at low c n ratios domingo félez et al 2017 whereas the predominance of the nh2oh pathway was shown for either low or very high no2 n concentrations e g 3 5 and 700 1120 mg n l and do concentrations from 0 5 to 2 0 mg o2 l ni et al 2014 aob were identified as the major n2o producers by guo 2014 however assuming considerable consumption of n2o by heterotrophs the net n2o production by heterotrophs 3 3 model validation trial no 2 full scale model validation was performed based on the full scale test in trial no 2 including liquid n2o production and gaseous n2o emissions fig 4 shows the dynamic output predictions and measurements in the full scale bioreactor the model accurately predicted the behaviour of the n compounds nh4 n and no3 n r 0 83 and po4 3 p r 0 64 in both the anaerobic and aerobic compartments of the bioreactor fig 4a c the diurnal variability in n2o emitted from the aerobic zones to the gas phase fig 4d followed the diurnal trends of the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations the predicted liquid n2o concentrations revealed a smaller variability in comparison with the gaseous n2o emissions fig 4e the n2o emissions coincided with the diurnal variations in nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations fig s4 daelman et al 2015 also found that the n2o emissions from a carrousel reactor coincided with the diurnal variations in no2 n and no3 n concentrations and nh4 n loading rates a conjunction between the maximum n2o emissions and high nh4 n concentrations was found in an aerobic compartment of the ludzack ettinger process configuration operated at do 2 5 mg o2 l guo 2014 in the full scale bioreactor at the slupsk wwtp the nh4 n concentrations in the aerobic compartments were low 2 1 1 2 mg n l in ae1 and 0 2 0 1 mg n l in ae2 effluent the n2o heterotrophic production rates in ae1 and ae2 for do 2 25 0 5 mg o2 l were reduced by 96 and 98 respectively in comparison with the rates in ao1 due to do inhibition and carbon substrate limitation the contribution from nh2oh oxidation was significant in ae1 2 but was still lower than the heterotrophic denitrification pathway 72 in ae1 and 81 in ae2 despite the predominance of different n2o production pathways the results of the present study are consistent with the results of previous studies massara et al 2018 ni et al 2015 peng et al 2014 pocquet et al 2016 demonstrating that the nh2oh oxidation and autotrophic denitrification pathways were enhanced when increasing and decreasing respectively the do concentrations a comparison between the mean values predicted from the dynamic simulations the steady state predictions and the measurements for the second full scale campaign is shown in table s15 si both dynamic predictions mean values and steady state predictions were consistent and comparable with the measured data the relative differences ranged from 0 to 8 2 therefore it was shown that steady state predictions could be reliable and useful for the analysis of strategies for mitigating n2o production in the full scale bioreactor section 3 5 and for decreasing the carbon footprint of the studied plant section 3 6 3 4 advantages and novelty of the model developed in this study in comparison with previous full scale n2o modelling studies limited to n removal systems without ebpr the present model revealed some important advantages and novel aspects the results presented in the previous studies showed discrepancies between the measured data and model predictions in the benchmark simulation model incorporating ghg bsm2g arnell et al 2017 considered only nitrogen n transformation and n2o production via the autotrophic denitrification pathway the results showed that the average levels of the modelled emissions were in agreement with the measured values however the full dynamics of the measured emissions were not well predicted by the model the extended asm3 model presented by blomberg et al 2018 was able to capture the dynamics of the liquid phase n2o transfer in the aeration tank however the model could predict only the variations in n2o emissions while the base levels of the modelled values were notably higher when compared to the measured emissions the discrepancies were partially attributed to the imperfections in the models describing the n2o stripping effect an oxidation ditch and an sbr plant were investigated by ni et al 2013 although n2o production from autotrophic denitrification was not considered in that model good agreement was found between model simulations and measured n2o levels as well as with other n compounds possibly due to predomination of the nh2oh oxidation pathway a study on a step feed bioreactor ni et al 2015 is an example of implementation and validation of a multi pathway n2o model in a full scale n removal system dominated by aob mediated transformations those results showed the importance of a comprehensive approach to correctly identify the n2o production pathways and accurately predict n2o behaviour the novelty of the model in the present study lies in the description of all n2o production pathways in the combined n and p removal system and evaluation of the integrated model against the full scale experimental data from such a system the model covers all known aspects related to n2o behaviour in bnr wwtps including the three known pathways of n2o production in n transformations the role of dpao in denitrification and n2o liquid gas transfer the model was successfully calibrated and validated with respect to the behaviour of n2o and other important state variables no3 n nh4 n and po4 3 p both in the full scale bnr bioreactor and in the laboratory experiments focused on specific biochemical processes maximization of the available data for the plant was proven to be an effective approach to constrain the effort made for extending the standardized models to include the module describing n2o the validated model can thus become a tool for developing n2o mitigation strategies and for carbon footprint analysis 3 5 analysis of strategies for mitigation of n2o production fig 5 a b shows the combined effects of the do concentrations in the aerobic zones and the mlr on n2o production in the ae1 and ae2 compartments respectively the predicted total n2o emission rates from the bioreactor are shown in fig 5c the reference state represents the current operational conditions do 2 5 mg o2 l mlr 500 and the average wastewater characteristics in the summer period within the analysed ranges the liquid n2o predictions in ae2 were generally independent of the mlr ratios n2o decreasing with increasing do whereas the minimum n2o value in ae1 0 05 mg n l was obtained at the region close to mlr 600 and do 3 5 mg o2 l fig 5a b a sudden accumulation of n2o was observed in both ae1 and ae2 under do limiting conditions 1 0 mg o2 l which reduced the efficiency of nitrification and favoured the anoxic activity of heterotrophs a peak n2o concentration in the liquid phase 0 27 mg n l was found in ae2 at do 0 4 mg o2 l under these conditions partial nitrification nitritation was favoured at the highest no2 n concentrations 2 1 mg n l in both aerobic compartments at do 0 3 mg o2 l aob and nob activities suddenly dropped and subsequent production of no2 n no3 n and n2o was severely restrained similar relationships were found in other simulation studies investigating models of a modified ludzack ettinger mle configuration mikosz 2016 and of an a2o bioreactor massara et al 2018 the increased n2o production via nitrification inhibition and no2 n accumulation under do concentrations 1 5 mg o2 l was also demonstrated by ni et al 2011 and peng et al 2014 the similarity of the literature data to results obtained in this study may suggest that dpaos do not play a significant role in n2o production in combined n and p removal systems the increase in the n2o concentrations in ae1 observed at mlr 800 and do 2 mg o2 l was significantly lower in comparison with the accumulation at do 1 mg o2 l however these results are still important due to the combined influence of do and mlr on n2o in both aerobic and anoxic compartments and further influence on the total carbon footprint of the bioreactor fig 6 a in fact the accumulation of no3 n and denitrification intermediates no2 n and n2o can occur for different mlrs depending on the local conditions e g process configuration mixing conditions and influent characteristics cod n ratio for example yan et al 2016 observed a similar phenomenon with mlr increasing from 100 to 300 in a laboratory scale a2o reactor operated at do 2 mg o2 l in the aerobic compartment that behaviour was also attributed to the increased concentrations of no3 n and do transferred to the anoxic zone however a low influent ratio of cod nh4 n 4 5 resulted in poor tn removal rates 46 62 and enhanced n2o production at lower mlr ratios in comparison with the present study influent cod nh4 n 16 tn removal 90 regarding the gaseous n2o emissions from the studied bioreactor the aerated compartments were the dominant contributors primarily due to the air stripping effect in the anoxic zone most of the produced n2o was simultaneously consumed in heterotrophic denitrification within the range of the investigated do and mlrs the anoxic zone contributed only to 0 8 11 of the total gaseous n2o emissions from the bioreactor for comparison a low contribution from the anoxic zones 1 5 was observed in a full scale wwtp employing the as process blomberg et al 2018 in contrast in a laboratory scale a2o configuration the anoxic section contributed to over 20 of the total n2o emissions yan et al 2016 possibly due to the relatively high n2o concentration in that section and intensive stirring it should be emphasized that the effects of stirring are not taken into consideration in the equation describing n2o liquid gas transfers in anoxic zones equation s3 in the si the emission rates from the studied aerobic zone were affected by both liquid n2o concentrations in ae1 2 and by air flowrate stripping the operational strategy of maintaining do 1 2 mg o2 l in the aerobic zones and increasing the mlr ratio 500 resulted in lower n2o emissions the optimal state represented by the opt point referred to the following set points do 1 5 mg o2 l and mlr 730 fig 5c at that state the lowest n2o emissions from the bioreactor were predicted 5 8 kg d without compromising the effluent tn limit of 10 mg n l when applying the optimal do and mlr set points under the dynamic conditions of the full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 the predicted mean n2o emission was 5 9 2 0 kg d vs 5 6 kg d under the steady state conditions the modification of the operational variables affected the energy balance of the studied plant fig 5d shows that the do set point was more significant than mlr and determined the total energy consumption due to higher blower wire power in comparison to the pump wire power the decreased aeration intensity resulted in lower energy consumption but an excessive reduction do 1 0 mg o2 l significantly enhanced n2o emissions by increasing the mlr the effluent tn concentrations decreased but the energy consumption simultaneously increased reducing the do concentration from 2 5 mg o2 l to 1 5 mg o2 l and increasing the mlr from 500 to 730 resulted in decrease in the total energy demand by 7 4 calculated based on the assumptions given in section 2 6 this positive effect was obtained as the energy savings for aeration exceeded the increased energy consumption for mlr pumping this aspect is further discussed with respect to the total carbon footprint of the studied bioreactor 3 6 carbon footprint analysis predicted co2e emissions under varying do concentrations and mlr are shown in fig 6a at the reference state the ghg emissions from the bioreactor reached 3 2 mg co2e d but this value can be reduced by applying the proposed strategies for mitigation of n2o production the do concentrations in the aerated zones were found to be the most significant factors affecting total ghg emissions taking advantage of the synergy between the reduction in gaseous n2o emissions and energy consumption at the optimal state for the carbon footprint do 1 3 mg o2 l mlr 730 the predicted energy consumption was reduced by approximately 9 5 in comparison with the reference state following the energy savings and reduction in n2o emissions the total carbon footprint was decreased by 10 3 regarding the potential reduction in the carbon footprint and the operational cost the simulation results suggest that the studied wwtp can achieve better performance by applying reasonable measures with respect to the relative energy savings the results of the present study are consistent with the findings of the theoretical modelling studies table s16 in the si the potential reductions in ghg emissions found in this study and in the literature emphasize the significance of either indirect or direct co2e emissions their contributions to the total carbon footprint can substantially differ among the plants moreover the relative benefits to the ghg emissions reduction are affected by the conditions assumed at the reference state a contribution of the n2o equivalent emissions to the total carbon footprint of the bioreactor is shown in fig 6b within the range of analysed do and mlrs the share of n2o was in the range 51 80 for comparison a contribution of 78 was reported for a full scale bnr wwtp daelman et al 2013 in an sbr plant rodriguez caballero et al 2015 estimated that the contribution of n2o emissions was in the range of 24 80 under different cycle configurations in contrast aboobakar et al 2013 reported that n2o emissions added only 13 to the carbon footprint associated with the energy requirements apart from specific plant configurations and operational conditions these differences can also be attributed to the co2e emission factor related to the assumed energy source renewable vs non renewable while mitigating n2o emission and decreasing the carbon footprint a potential trade off with other objectives of plant performance such as the effluent quality needs to be considered the simulation results revealed that at the optimal state with respect to the total carbon footprint tn concentrations were 20 lower in comparison with the reference state as a result of the proposed strategy an increasing trend in the effluent liquid n2o concentrations was observed however the predicted value 0 026 mg n l was as low as 0 3 of the effluent tn concentration at the optimal state it should also be noted that n2o has a relatively high solubility in water and accumulations of n2o in the liquid phase may not directly result in emissions to the atmosphere the overall environmental impact including the eutrophication potential remains out of the scope of the present study but could be part of a life cycle analysis as an extension of the carbon footprint analysis 4 conclusions the model developed and validated in this study could be a useful tool for analysing the multivariable problem of mitigation of n2o production in combined n p activated sludge systems to minimize n2o production in a full scale bioreactor without compromising the effluent tn standards the do concentrations in the aerobic zone should be decreased and maintained at 1 2 mg o2 l and the mlr should exceed 500 of the influent flowrate the lower energy consumption for aeration would result in an energy credit exceeding the higher energy consumption for pumping in the validation phase heterotrophic denitrification was found to be the main pathway of n2o production under both anoxic 99 and aerobic conditions 72 81 when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophic denitrifiers this behaviour could primarily be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers over aob even though the estimated denitrification rates under aerobic conditions were reduced by 94 98 in comparison with the anoxic rates within the range of manipulated do and mlrs n2o emissions from the bioreactor were responsible for over 50 of the total carbon footprint despite a high co2e emission factor related to the non renewable energy source used in the external power plant the potential reduction in the total carbon footprint was estimated at 10 in comparison with the current operational conditions by applying the recommended strategy of reducing do concentrations and enhancing mlr ratios for mitigating n2o production and emissions these results suggest that considerable improvements with respect to the carbon footprint of bnr wwtps can be achieved without substantial upgrades and increased costs declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18633,nitrous oxide n2o emitted from biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems contributes significantly to the total carbon footprint of modern wastewater treatment plants in the present study n2o production and emissions were experimentally determined in a large scale plant 220 000 pe employing combined nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal as a modelling tool the activated sludge model 2d asm2d was extended with modules describing multiple n2o production pathways and n2o liquid gas transfers the new model was calibrated and validated using the results of laboratory experiments and full scale measurements different operational strategies were evaluated following the proposed model based procedure heterotrophic denitrification was found to be the predominant pathway of n2o production under both anoxic and aerobic conditions this behaviour could primarily be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers over nitrifiers simulations revealed that the optimal solution for minimizing liquid n2o production is to set the dissolved oxygen concentration in the aerobic zone from 1 to 2 mg o2 l and to enhance the mixed liquor recirculation rate mlr 500 of the influent flowrate while not compromising effluent standards regarding the actual conditions the potential reduction in the carbon footprint was estimated to be 10 by applying the proposed operational strategy the results suggest that considerable improvements can be achieved without substantial upgrades and increased costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon footprint full scale plant nitrous oxide n2o mitigation modelling 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o emissions from anthropogenic sources have received special attention in recent years as it is reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 the global warming potential gwp of n2o is 265 times greater than that of carbon dioxide co2 in modern wastewater treatment plants wwtps up to 90 of n2o can be produced and subsequently emitted in the biological steps via the nitrification and denitrification processes campos et al 2016 recent investigations have identified three microbial pathways for n2o production schreiber et al 2012 tallec et al 2006 wunderlin et al 2012 two pathways are mediated by autotrophic nitrifiers specifically ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob including the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation and autotrophic denitrification the third pathway is related to heterotrophic denitrification with n2o as an intermediate product the conditions favouring n2o production consist of low dissolved oxygen do levels during nitrification low carbon to nitrogen c n ratios during heterotrophic denitrification and elevated nitrite no2 n levels during both nitrification and denitrification flores alsina et al 2011 mannina et al 2017 massara et al 2018 ni et al 2011 peng et al 2014 tallec et al 2008 in general aerobic conditions contribute to higher n2o production through the nitrification related pathways and to higher n2o emissions due to stripping furthermore intensive aerobic conditions are also responsible for increased energy requirements and an increased carbon footprint kim et al 2015 massara et al 2018 mikosz 2016 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 numerous full scale measurements on n2o emissions have been conducted worldwide table s1 but considerable variations one order of magnitude have been observed both across different plants and temporarily within one plant daelman et al 2015 ni et al 2015 pan et al 2016 several measures for mitigating n2o emissions have been proposed including the step aeration mode wang et al 2016 distribution of the return activated sludge between compartments pan et al 2016 controlling the do concentrations sun et al 2015 and cancelling the anaerobic phase and extending the idle phase in a sequencing batch reactor chen et al 2014 it should be emphasized that n2o emissions need to be accurately estimated due to the potential impact on the total carbon footprint of a wwtp de haas and hartley 2004 estimated that just 1 of the removed n load emitted as n2o would increase the carbon footprint of a plant by approximately 30 the reported contributions of n2o emissions to the total carbon footprint ranged from 60 to 80 daelman et al 2013 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 regardless of these differences mitigating n2o emissions and decreasing the carbon footprint of wwtps is strongly linked to the energy consuming processes in the bioreactors such as aeration and pumping marques et al 2016 pan et al 2016 modification of the operational conditions of existing plants is thus the most economical way to decrease greenhouse gas ghg emissions provided that the effluent quality is not degraded campos et al 2016 kim et al 2015 mikosz 2016 selection of the optimal operational conditions in bioreactors with respect to ghg emissions energy and effluent quality becomes a complex multivariable optimization problem kim et al 2015 that can be solved by model based analysis multi pathway n2o production models have been developed and evaluated under laboratory conditions including identification of the dominant n2o production pathways massara et al 2017 ni and yuan 2015 however for practical applications in full scale bioreactors it has been postulated that these models should be extended by considering the liquid gas transfers of n2o to predict n2o emissions massara et al 2017 only in a few studies ni et al 2013 2015 blomberg et al 2018 conducted in n removal nitrification denitrification activated sludge as systems comprehensive full scale monitoring data have been used to evaluate the n2o production and emission models until now no modelling studies have been performed for full scale combined n and p removal systems which are most commonly employed in modern wwtps mathematical models describing n2o production during the enhanced biological p removal ebpr process have recently been proposed liu et al 2015 massara et al 2018 wisniewski et al 2018 but these models have not yet been evaluated against the full scale experimental data in the present study n2o production and emissions were experimentally determined and predicted for a large scale municipal wwtp located in the city of slupsk northern poland employing combined n and p removal in the modelling part of the study the activated sludge model 2d asm2d henze et al 2000 was extended with modules describing multi pathway n2o production and n2o liquid gas transfers the new model was then calibrated and validated using the results of extensive laboratory scale experiments and full scale measurement campaigns performed in different periods in the studied facility for the model based evaluation of n2o production and emission a standardized procedure was proposed including the analysis of n2o mitigation strategies and carbon footprint calculation following that procedure the optimal operational parameters were determined with respect to both direct and indirect ghg emissions at the studied plant the model developed in the present study combines and evaluates against the full scale experimental data all known aspects related to n2o behaviour in biological nutrient removal bnr wwtps including the three known pathways of n2o production for n transformations the role of denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpao in denitrification and n2o liquid gas transfers 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the study site the studied wwtp is a large facility 220 000 pe treating municipal wastewater from the city of slupsk northern poland and surrounding communities the biological step of the studied plant consists of three parallel lines operated in an a2o anaerobic anoxic oxic configuration a simplified schematic layout of a single line and the dimensions of each compartment are shown in fig 1 the internal mixed liquor recirculation mlr is returned from the last aerobic compartment ae2 to the second or the third compartment in the bioreactor ao1 or ao2 respectively depending on the actual operating conditions the return activated sludge ras flow from the secondary clarifier is returned to the inlet of the bioreactor 2 2 general procedure a general procedure for model based evaluation of n2o production and emissions was developed and applied specifically to the studied wwtp fig s1 in the supporting information si the procedure tailored for the plant to maximize use of available data incorporates the sequential steps from the full scale and laboratory scale trials no 1 and 2 data collection through model development calibration and validation to the model based evaluation of strategies for mitigating n2o production and decreasing the carbon footprint a two step calibration was specifically applied for the n2o data i e calibration of n2o production after achieving good fits for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n as proposed by ni et al 2015 and domingo félez et al 2017 2 3 collection of experimental data 2 3 1 full scale measurements to maximize the use of available data for the studied plant the results from two measurement campaigns were used for simulations the campaigns were performed in the summer periods of different years namely 2012 and 2016 but the process conditions in terms of wastewater characteristics and aeration control were similar in those periods table s2 in the si the average nominal hydraulic retention times in the bioreactor were 1 5 d and 1 7 d respectively in summer 2012 and summer 2016 with this approach it could be confirmed if the model was capable of predicting performance for different periods with one set of parameters the first 4 day measurement campaign was performed in the biological reactor of the slupsk wwtp in august 2012 at t 20 c and total solids retention time srt 26 d grab samples were withdrawn every 2 h from the following sampling locations primary effluent and the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic compartments in the bioreactor the samples were analysed for several parameters including i chemical oxygen demand cod scod soluble fraction of cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp for the primary effluent only and ii ammonia nh4 n nitrate no3 n and soluble ortho phosphate po4 3 p for all sampling points the first 4 day campaign trial no 1 full scale was used for model calibration without consideration of n2o data as n2o was not measured during that campaign more details about that measurement campaign can be found in zaborowska et al 2017 the second 4 day measurement campaign was conducted in the slupsk wwtp in september 2016 at t 21 c grab samples were withdrawn every 2 h from the following sampling points plant influent anaerobic anoxic and aerobic compartments of the bioreactor the plant influent was analysed for cod scod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss tn total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nh4 n po4 3 p and tp the filtered samples of the mixed liquor from the bioreactors were analysed for nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p moreover average daily samples were also collected from the plant influent and from the primary and secondary effluents the samples were analysed for a number of parameters including cod scod tss vss tp po4 3 p tn tkn nh4 n and no3 n only in the secondary effluent the liquid and gaseous n2o concentrations were continuously monitored during the campaign the influent and effluent flowrates and do concentrations in the first and the second aerobic zones ae1 and ae2 were continuously measured and recorded every 10 min the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and its volatile fraction mlvss concentrations were measured once per day from grab samples withdrawn from ae2 the second measurement campaign involving the liquid and gaseous n2o measurements trial no 2 full scale was used for the full scale model validation 2 3 2 laboratory measurements a few accompanying laboratory scale experiments were performed by using the biomass from the slupsk wwtp in a 4 l laboratory scale batch reactor at the controlled temperature t 20 0 5 c during the course of the experiments the do concentrations and temperatures were continuously monitored using a cellox 325 probe wtw germany and were recorded every 20 s the mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured at both the beginning and end of each experiment details on the analytical methods used in the experiments can be found in the si one phase anoxic and two phase anaerobic aerobic anoxic experiments one one phase anoxic and two two phase anaerobic aerobic anoxic experiments accompanied the first full scale measurement campaign trial no 1 full scale more details about these experiments can be found in zaborowska et al 2017 these experimental data trial no 1 laboratory scale were used for the model calibration without consideration of n2o data one phase aerobic experiments with the liquid n 2 o measurements two aerobic experiments extended with the continuous liquid n2o monitoring accompanied the second full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 full scale the 6 h experiments were conducted at two different do levels do 1 0 mg o2 l and do 0 5 mg o2 l to minimize the influence of denitrification the remaining nitrate in the mixed liquor was reduced before the experiments by adding sodium acetate ch3coona at 6 gcod gn only nh4 n and nahco3 2 mol nahco3 per mole nh4 n were supplied at the beginning of the experiment during the experiments nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured at a frequency of 30 60 min the n2o n concentrations in the liquid phase were continuously monitored every 20s these experimental data trial no 2 laboratory scale were used for model recalibration with consideration of n2o data 2 3 3 measurements of n2o concentration during the laboratory experiments and the full scale measurement campaign during the laboratory scale experiments trial no 2 a clark type n2o microsensor unisense environment a s denmark was placed in the batch reactor during the second full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 the same n2o microsensor was placed in a closed mobile reactor v 3 l equipped with a mixer the off line location protected the sensor from undesirable displacements and ensured stable operation for the course of the experiment the reactor was permanently fully filled to avoid additional stripping effects and was continuously fed with the mixed liquor by a lifting pump submerged 1 m below the water level during the 4 day campaign the sampling point was located in ae1 the liquid n2o n concentrations were continuously monitored and recorded every 20s the basic characteristics of the microsensor and the temperature correction formula for the microsensor signal are described in detail in the si the n2o concentrations in the off gas were measured by fourier transform infrared ftir gas analyser gasmet cx 4000 coupled with a flow meter and a floating hood located at the same sampling point as for the liquid n2o the frequency of sampling was set to 20 s data reported in the literature ni et al 2015 pan et al 2016 rodriguez caballero et al 2014 revealed different longitudinal n2o profiles along the aerobic compartment the highest n2o emissions correlated with either high nh4 n and no2 n concentrations or were attributed to process disturbances such as no aeration periods or nitrification instability in the present study the selected location was assumed based on the results of both preliminary simulations and short term n2o measurements in different points in the bioreactor the simulations revealed that approximately 70 of the total n2o emissions from the bioreactor occurred in ae1 moreover in the field off gas measurements the n2o concentrations 14 8 1 4 mg n m3 in ae1 were approximately 3 times greater when compared to those in ae2 2 4 development of a biokinetic model describing n2o production and liquid gas transfers the standard asm2d henze et al 2000 calibrated and validated by zaborowska et al 2017 was used as a core model and was extended in the present study with the additional processes specifically related to n2o n2o production consumption transformations of n compounds no3 n to no2 n by dpaos air stripped n2o emissions and saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o these extensions were integrated into the new asm2d n2o model two n2o production pathways by aob and n2o production and consumption by denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos were incorporated into the model following the concept of lu et al 2018 dpaos were assumed to reduce no3 n only to no2 n following the concept of wisniewski et al 2018 the air stripped n2o emissions and saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o were introduced into the model by adding a new state variable the n2o emission rates in the anoxic and aerobic zones were calculated based on mathematical models baresel et al 2016 marques et al 2016 that described the n2o liquid gas transfers and the air stripping processes equation s1 s5 further details regarding the model development can be found in the si including the definitions of the state variables stoichiometric matrices and process rate equations tables s3 s9 a full list of the model parameters in the asm2d n2o can be found in table s14 2 5 calibration and validation of the biokinetic model to reduce the model uncertainty and minimize the number of the adjusted parameters domingo félez et al 2017 proposed a three step procedure model calibration recalibration and validation in the present study a similar approach was adopted with details shown in fig 2 i model calibration without consideration of the n2o data trial no 1 laboratory scale and full scale focusing

production iii model validation with consideration of the n2o data trial no 2 full scale focusing on the liquid n2o production and gaseous n2o emissions a sensitivity analysis identified the relative importance of different model parameters on the model outputs nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p scod and n2o n a one variable at a time sensitivity analysis was applied using a special gps x 7 0 hydromantis canada utility called the phase dynamic sensitivity analyser and a relative uncertainty of 20 specifically 10 of the adjusted value was assigned to each model parameter equation s6 the parameter estimation was performed using a gps x utility called optimizer using the nelder mead simplex method with the maximum likelihood objective function the average values from the dynamic simulations were compared with steady state predictions to evaluate the accuracy of steady state predictions and their applicability in the model based analysis of strategies for mitigation of n2o production 2 6 model based evaluation of n2o production and emission strategies for the mitigation of n2o production at the studied wwtp were analysed with the validated model by changing input variables such as the do concentration in the aerated zones and the mlr ratio the aim of the analysis was to investigate the interactions between n2o production and emissions tn removal efficiencies and energy consumption the do concentrations and mlr ratios were selected as examples of the most influential manipulated variables affecting wwtp performance these variables were investigated in several previous theoretical simulation studies to quantify ghg emissions at different control strategies flores alsina et al 2011 kim et al 2015 massara et al 2018 mikosz 2016 sweetapple et al 2014 and in a laboratory scale reactor yan et al 2016 a series of steady state simulations were conducted for a wide range of the two variables i e 0 1 3 5 mg o2 l with a step of 0 1 mg o2 l for the do concentration and 340 1000 with a step of 30 of the influent flowrates for the mlr ratio the steady state simulations 252 runs were conducted automatically using the analyze tool in gps x the 3 d graphs were developed in the surfer software golden software llc usa and the kriging method was used for interpolation of the data based on the results of all 252 runs the optimal points minima were searched with respect to n2o emissions from the specific compartments and the minimal carbon footprint for the entire bioreactor the average operational parameters and wastewater characteristics for the summer of 2016 table s2 in the si were used to obtain results at the reference state the considered total energy demand comprised the energy related to the manipulated variables i e electric energy for aeration and mlr pumping the power consumption by the fine bubble diffused aeration system was calculated based on the physical characteristics of the aeration system and the volumetric air flowrate imposed by the do control system table s10 in the si equations s7 s10 were used to calculate the wire power consumption by the blowers and by the mlr pumps the dynamic predictions of wire power consumption by the blowers were validated using the data from electricity meters in the full scale measurement campaign 2 7 evaluation of the carbon footprint the carbon footprint was expressed in co2 equivalents co2e with respect to direct emissions related to the biochemical processes in the bioreactor and indirect emissions related to the electricity consumption in the processes the considered total carbon footprint was composed of the co2e related to n2o emissions from the specific compartments anaerobic anoxic and aerobic of the bioreactor and the overall energy demand for aeration and mlr pumping the direct co2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the predicted fluxes of gaseous n2o emitted from the bioreactor by gwp 265 co2e ipcc 2014 predictions of the aeration and pumping wire power in kw were multiplied by the time period under consideration to obtain the daily energy consumption in kwh it was assumed that electricity was imported to the studied wwtp from the external grid thus the indirect co2e emissions were calculated by multiplying the electricity consumption by the default amount of co2 0 8 kg co2 kwh that was emitted during electricity generation by the industrial power plants in poland kobize 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration without consideration of n2o data trial no 1 laboratory scale and full scale the iterative model calibration without

figure s2 d g and table s11 si regarding the full scale campaign the model predictions of asm2d n2o and asm2d figs s3d f were also consistent r2 0 65 for po4 3 p and no3 n the predictions even improved in the present study in comparison with the previous study zaborowska et al 2017 table s12 3 2 model recalibration with consideration of n2o data trial no 2 laboratory scale model recalibration with consideration of the n2o data was based on the results of the laboratory experiments in trial no 2 liquid n2o production the model predictions were fitted to the measured data first by adjusting only the parameters sensitive to n2o and not directly affecting the four target variables in the first step calibration i e the additional key parameters for the n2o production by both aob η 1 aob and η 2 aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers η no2 h η n2o h k no2 h and k n2o h the parameters most sensitive to n2o η no3 h and μ aob which were obtained from the first step calibration were also taken into account during the recalibration a list of all adjusted parameters along with their sensitivities is presented in table s13 and further discussed in the si among the sensitive parameters adjusted in the present study the parameters for n2o production and consumption pathways were consistent with the literature values apart from the nitrite reduction factor for heterotrophs η n o 2 h the adjusted η n o 2 h 0 60 mg n l was higher than the literature values η n o 2 h 0 35 mg n l lu et al 2018 which indicated the predominance of heterotrophic denitrification pathway the remaining parameters were adopted from asm2d 24 asm2d defaults and 12 from zaborowska et al 2017 and additionally from literature the n2o production consumption the transformations of n compounds no3 n to no2 n by dpao the air stripped n2o emissions and the saturation induced liquid gas transfers for n2o table s14 the values of these parameters were generally close to the asm2d defaults or within the ranges reported in the literature the model predictions and measured data of the laboratory scale tests are presented in fig 3 r 0 94 in both experiments the presence of do induced nitrification leading to no3 n accumulation while no2 n levels remained significantly lower 0 6 mg n l fig 3a d during the aerobic test at do 0 5 mg o2 l fig 3a c the highest liquid n2o concentrations 0 06 mg n l were observed after 2 h of the reaction phase fig 3b the simulation results suggested that heterotrophic denitrification made a significantly higher contribution to the n2o production in comparison with the nh2oh oxidation pathway when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs fig 3c whereas the estimated contribution from autotrophic denitrification was negligible in that experiment the dominant contribution of the heterotrophic pathway could be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophs over nitrifiers in the studied system in the experiment at do 1 0 mg o2 l fig 3d f a two fold lower liquid n2o concentration 0 03 mg n l was observed fig 3e partially due to higher aeration intensities resulting in a stronger n2o stripping effect 0 018 g n d at do 1 0 mg o2 l vs 0 003 g n d at do 0 5 mg o2 l at the higher do concentration the anoxic activity of heterotrophs was significantly inhibited and the estimated contributions of heterotrophic denitrification and of the nh2oh oxidation pathways became comparable in terms of n2o production when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs the autotrophic denitrification pathway was once again marginal fig 3f in the present study the adjusted oxygen half saturation coefficient k o h was within the range presented in the literature 0 01 0 5 mg o2 l mannina et al 2012 by changing k o h from 0 13 domingo félez et al 2017 to 0 3 this study the estimated anoxic activity of denitrifying heterotrophs approximately doubled for the actual aerobic conditions do 1 0 mg o2 l these results suggest that n2o may be explicitly produced by both aob nh2oh oxidation and heterotrophic denitrifiers it should also be emphasized that the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophs significantly reduced their net contribution to n2o accumulation fig 3c f various dominant pathways of n2o production and emissions under aerobic conditions have been reported in other studies tallec et al 2008 found that below 0 3 mg o2 l heterotrophic denitrification was the major process responsible for n2o emissions in a denitrifying as system however the authors suggested that in the do range of 0 4 1 1 mg o2 l n2o production resulted from two processes including autotrophic 60 and heterotrophic 40 denitrification shen et al 2015 demonstrated that heterotrophic activities significantly affected n2o emission during nitrification in recent studies heterotrophic denitrifiers were found to be the key contributors to n2o production in as under aerobic conditions do 0 2 6 5 mg o2 l at low c n ratios domingo félez et al 2017 whereas the predominance of the nh2oh pathway was shown for either low or very high no2 n concentrations e g 3 5 and 700 1120 mg n l and do concentrations from 0 5 to 2 0 mg o2 l ni et al 2014 aob were identified as the major n2o producers by guo 2014 however assuming considerable consumption of n2o by heterotrophs the net n2o production by heterotrophs 3 3 model validation trial no 2 full scale model validation was performed based on the full scale test in trial no 2 including liquid n2o production and gaseous n2o emissions fig 4 shows the dynamic output predictions and measurements in the full scale bioreactor the model accurately predicted the behaviour of the n compounds nh4 n and no3 n r 0 83 and po4 3 p r 0 64 in both the anaerobic and aerobic compartments of the bioreactor fig 4a c the diurnal variability in n2o emitted from the aerobic zones to the gas phase fig 4d followed the diurnal trends of the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations the predicted liquid n2o concentrations revealed a smaller variability in comparison with the gaseous n2o emissions fig 4e the n2o emissions coincided with the diurnal variations in nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations fig s4 daelman et al 2015 also found that the n2o emissions from a carrousel reactor coincided with the diurnal variations in no2 n and no3 n concentrations and nh4 n loading rates a conjunction between the maximum n2o emissions and high nh4 n concentrations was found in an aerobic compartment of the ludzack ettinger process configuration operated at do 2 5 mg o2 l guo 2014 in the full scale bioreactor at the slupsk wwtp the nh4 n concentrations in the aerobic compartments were low 2 1 1 2 mg n l in ae1 and 0 2 0 1 mg n l in ae2 effluent the n2o heterotrophic production rates in ae1 and ae2 for do 2 25 0 5 mg o2 l were reduced by 96 and 98 respectively in comparison with the rates in ao1 due to do inhibition and carbon substrate limitation the contribution from nh2oh oxidation was significant in ae1 2 but was still lower than the heterotrophic denitrification pathway 72 in ae1 and 81 in ae2 despite the predominance of different n2o production pathways the results of the present study are consistent with the results of previous studies massara et al 2018 ni et al 2015 peng et al 2014 pocquet et al 2016 demonstrating that the nh2oh oxidation and autotrophic denitrification pathways were enhanced when increasing and decreasing respectively the do concentrations a comparison between the mean values predicted from the dynamic simulations the steady state predictions and the measurements for the second full scale campaign is shown in table s15 si both dynamic predictions mean values and steady state predictions were consistent and comparable with the measured data the relative differences ranged from 0 to 8 2 therefore it was shown that steady state predictions could be reliable and useful for the analysis of strategies for mitigating n2o production in the full scale bioreactor section 3 5 and for decreasing the carbon footprint of the studied plant section 3 6 3 4 advantages and novelty of the model developed in this study in comparison with previous full scale n2o modelling studies limited to n removal systems without ebpr the present model revealed some important advantages and novel aspects the results presented in the previous studies showed discrepancies between the measured data and model predictions in the benchmark simulation model incorporating ghg bsm2g arnell et al 2017 considered only nitrogen n transformation and n2o production via the autotrophic denitrification pathway the results showed that the average levels of the modelled emissions were in agreement with the measured values however the full dynamics of the measured emissions were not well predicted by the model the extended asm3 model presented by blomberg et al 2018 was able to capture the dynamics of the liquid phase n2o transfer in the aeration tank however the model could predict only the variations in n2o emissions while the base levels of the modelled values were notably higher when compared to the measured emissions the discrepancies were partially attributed to the imperfections in the models describing the n2o stripping effect an oxidation ditch and an sbr plant were investigated by ni et al 2013 although n2o production from autotrophic denitrification was not considered in that model good agreement was found between model simulations and measured n2o levels as well as with other n compounds possibly due to predomination of the nh2oh oxidation pathway a study on a step feed bioreactor ni et al 2015 is an example of implementation and validation of a multi pathway n2o model in a full scale n removal system dominated by aob mediated transformations those results showed the importance of a comprehensive approach to correctly identify the n2o production pathways and accurately predict n2o behaviour the novelty of the model in the present study lies in the description of all n2o production pathways in the combined n and p removal system and evaluation of the integrated model against the full scale experimental data from such a system the model covers all known aspects related to n2o behaviour in bnr wwtps including the three known pathways of n2o production in n transformations the role of dpao in denitrification and n2o liquid gas transfer the model was successfully calibrated and validated with respect to the behaviour of n2o and other important state variables no3 n nh4 n and po4 3 p both in the full scale bnr bioreactor and in the laboratory experiments focused on specific biochemical processes maximization of the available data for the plant was proven to be an effective approach to constrain the effort made for extending the standardized models to include the module describing n2o the validated model can thus become a tool for developing n2o mitigation strategies and for carbon footprint analysis 3 5 analysis of strategies for mitigation of n2o production fig 5 a b shows the combined effects of the do concentrations in the aerobic zones and the mlr on n2o production in the ae1 and ae2 compartments respectively the predicted total n2o emission rates from the bioreactor are shown in fig 5c the reference state represents the current operational conditions do 2 5 mg o2 l mlr 500 and the average wastewater characteristics in the summer period within the analysed ranges the liquid n2o predictions in ae2 were generally independent of the mlr ratios n2o decreasing with increasing do whereas the minimum n2o value in ae1 0 05 mg n l was obtained at the region close to mlr 600 and do 3 5 mg o2 l fig 5a b a sudden accumulation of n2o was observed in both ae1 and ae2 under do limiting conditions 1 0 mg o2 l which reduced the efficiency of nitrification and favoured the anoxic activity of heterotrophs a peak n2o concentration in the liquid phase 0 27 mg n l was found in ae2 at do 0 4 mg o2 l under these conditions partial nitrification nitritation was favoured at the highest no2 n concentrations 2 1 mg n l in both aerobic compartments at do 0 3 mg o2 l aob and nob activities suddenly dropped and subsequent production of no2 n no3 n and n2o was severely restrained similar relationships were found in other simulation studies investigating models of a modified ludzack ettinger mle configuration mikosz 2016 and of an a2o bioreactor massara et al 2018 the increased n2o production via nitrification inhibition and no2 n accumulation under do concentrations 1 5 mg o2 l was also demonstrated by ni et al 2011 and peng et al 2014 the similarity of the literature data to results obtained in this study may suggest that dpaos do not play a significant role in n2o production in combined n and p removal systems the increase in the n2o concentrations in ae1 observed at mlr 800 and do 2 mg o2 l was significantly lower in comparison with the accumulation at do 1 mg o2 l however these results are still important due to the combined influence of do and mlr on n2o in both aerobic and anoxic compartments and further influence on the total carbon footprint of the bioreactor fig 6 a in fact the accumulation of no3 n and denitrification intermediates no2 n and n2o can occur for different mlrs depending on the local conditions e g process configuration mixing conditions and influent characteristics cod n ratio for example yan et al 2016 observed a similar phenomenon with mlr increasing from 100 to 300 in a laboratory scale a2o reactor operated at do 2 mg o2 l in the aerobic compartment that behaviour was also attributed to the increased concentrations of no3 n and do transferred to the anoxic zone however a low influent ratio of cod nh4 n 4 5 resulted in poor tn removal rates 46 62 and enhanced n2o production at lower mlr ratios in comparison with the present study influent cod nh4 n 16 tn removal 90 regarding the gaseous n2o emissions from the studied bioreactor the aerated compartments were the dominant contributors primarily due to the air stripping effect in the anoxic zone most of the produced n2o was simultaneously consumed in heterotrophic denitrification within the range of the investigated do and mlrs the anoxic zone contributed only to 0 8 11 of the total gaseous n2o emissions from the bioreactor for comparison a low contribution from the anoxic zones 1 5 was observed in a full scale wwtp employing the as process blomberg et al 2018 in contrast in a laboratory scale a2o configuration the anoxic section contributed to over 20 of the total n2o emissions yan et al 2016 possibly due to the relatively high n2o concentration in that section and intensive stirring it should be emphasized that the effects of stirring are not taken into consideration in the equation describing n2o liquid gas transfers in anoxic zones equation s3 in the si the emission rates from the studied aerobic zone were affected by both liquid n2o concentrations in ae1 2 and by air flowrate stripping the operational strategy of maintaining do 1 2 mg o2 l in the aerobic zones and increasing the mlr ratio 500 resulted in lower n2o emissions the optimal state represented by the opt point referred to the following set points do 1 5 mg o2 l and mlr 730 fig 5c at that state the lowest n2o emissions from the bioreactor were predicted 5 8 kg d without compromising the effluent tn limit of 10 mg n l when applying the optimal do and mlr set points under the dynamic conditions of the full scale measurement campaign trial no 2 the predicted mean n2o emission was 5 9 2 0 kg d vs 5 6 kg d under the steady state conditions the modification of the operational variables affected the energy balance of the studied plant fig 5d shows that the do set point was more significant than mlr and determined the total energy consumption due to higher blower wire power in comparison to the pump wire power the decreased aeration intensity resulted in lower energy consumption but an excessive reduction do 1 0 mg o2 l significantly enhanced n2o emissions by increasing the mlr the effluent tn concentrations decreased but the energy consumption simultaneously increased reducing the do concentration from 2 5 mg o2 l to 1 5 mg o2 l and increasing the mlr from 500 to 730 resulted in decrease in the total energy demand by 7 4 calculated based on the assumptions given in section 2 6 this positive effect was obtained as the energy savings for aeration exceeded the increased energy consumption for mlr pumping this aspect is further discussed with respect to the total carbon footprint of the studied bioreactor 3 6 carbon footprint analysis predicted co2e emissions under varying do concentrations and mlr are shown in fig 6a at the reference state the ghg emissions from the bioreactor reached 3 2 mg co2e d but this value can be reduced by applying the proposed strategies for mitigation of n2o production the do concentrations in the aerated zones were found to be the most significant factors affecting total ghg emissions taking advantage of the synergy between the reduction in gaseous n2o emissions and energy consumption at the optimal state for the carbon footprint do 1 3 mg o2 l mlr 730 the predicted energy consumption was reduced by approximately 9 5 in comparison with the reference state following the energy savings and reduction in n2o emissions the total carbon footprint was decreased by 10 3 regarding the potential reduction in the carbon footprint and the operational cost the simulation results suggest that the studied wwtp can achieve better performance by applying reasonable measures with respect to the relative energy savings the results of the present study are consistent with the findings of the theoretical modelling studies table s16 in the si the potential reductions in ghg emissions found in this study and in the literature emphasize the significance of either indirect or direct co2e emissions their contributions to the total carbon footprint can substantially differ among the plants moreover the relative benefits to the ghg emissions reduction are affected by the conditions assumed at the reference state a contribution of the n2o equivalent emissions to the total carbon footprint of the bioreactor is shown in fig 6b within the range of analysed do and mlrs the share of n2o was in the range 51 80 for comparison a contribution of 78 was reported for a full scale bnr wwtp daelman et al 2013 in an sbr plant rodriguez caballero et al 2015 estimated that the contribution of n2o emissions was in the range of 24 80 under different cycle configurations in contrast aboobakar et al 2013 reported that n2o emissions added only 13 to the carbon footprint associated with the energy requirements apart from specific plant configurations and operational conditions these differences can also be attributed to the co2e emission factor related to the assumed energy source renewable vs non renewable while mitigating n2o emission and decreasing the carbon footprint a potential trade off with other objectives of plant performance such as the effluent quality needs to be considered the simulation results revealed that at the optimal state with respect to the total carbon footprint tn concentrations were 20 lower in comparison with the reference state as a result of the proposed strategy an increasing trend in the effluent liquid n2o concentrations was observed however the predicted value 0 026 mg n l was as low as 0 3 of the effluent tn concentration at the optimal state it should also be noted that n2o has a relatively high solubility in water and accumulations of n2o in the liquid phase may not directly result in emissions to the atmosphere the overall environmental impact including the eutrophication potential remains out of the scope of the present study but could be part of a life cycle analysis as an extension of the carbon footprint analysis 4 conclusions the model developed and validated in this study could be a useful tool for analysing the multivariable problem of mitigation of n2o production in combined n p activated sludge systems to minimize n2o production in a full scale bioreactor without compromising the effluent tn standards the do concentrations in the aerobic zone should be decreased and maintained at 1 2 mg o2 l and the mlr should exceed 500 of the influent flowrate the lower energy consumption for aeration would result in an energy credit exceeding the higher energy consumption for pumping in the validation phase heterotrophic denitrification was found to be the main pathway of n2o production under both anoxic 99 and aerobic conditions 72 81 when excluding the simultaneous n2o consumption by heterotrophic denitrifiers this behaviour could primarily be attributed to the predominant abundance of heterotrophic denitrifiers over aob even though the estimated denitrification rates under aerobic conditions were reduced by 94 98 in comparison with the anoxic rates within the range of manipulated do and mlrs n2o emissions from the bioreactor were responsible for over 50 of the total carbon footprint despite a high co2e emission factor related to the non renewable energy source used in the external power plant the potential reduction in the total carbon footprint was estimated at 10 in comparison with the current operational conditions by applying the recommended strategy of reducing do concentrations and enhancing mlr ratios for mitigating n2o production and emissions these results suggest that considerable improvements with respect to the carbon footprint of bnr wwtps can be achieved without substantial upgrades and increased costs declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18634,the oxidation of chlorendic acid ca a polychlorinated recalcitrant contaminant by heat mineral and base activated persulfate was investigated in ph 3 12 homogeneous i e solid free solutions ca was oxidized by oh and so4 radicals resulting in a nearly stoichiometric production of cl the rate constants for the reaction between these radicals and ca were measured at different temperatures by electron pulse radiolysis and were found to be koh 8 71 0 17 107 m 1s 1 and kso4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1s 1 at 24 5 c for oh and so4 respectively ca was oxidized at much slower rates in solutions containing iron oxyhydroxide or aquifer soils partially due to the adsorption of ca on these solids to gain further insight into the effect of solids during in situ remediation of ca the adsorption of ca onto iron hydr oxide manganese dioxide silica alumina and aquifer soils was investigated the fraction of ca that was adsorbed on these materials increased as the solution ph decreased given that the solution ph can decrease dramatically in persulfate based remedial systems adsorption may reduce the ability of persulfate to oxidize ca overall the results of this study provide important information about how persulfate can be used to remediate ca contaminated sites the results also indicate that the groundwater ph and geology of the subsurface can have a significant influence on the mobility of ca graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorendic acid in situ remediation in situ chemical oxidation persulfate advanced oxidation process 1 introduction chlorendic acid 1 4 5 6 7 7 hexachlorobicyclo 2 2 1 hept 5 ene 2 3 dicarboxylic acid is a polychlorinated organic compound used in multiple applications including as a flame retardant an intermediate in the synthesis of polymeric resins and corrosion resistant materials and an additive in extreme pressure lubricants ntp 1987 ipcs 1996 commercially known as het acid chlorendic acid ca is synthesized via a diels alder reaction between hexachloropentadiene and maleic anhydride with a bridged ring and six cl atoms fig s1 in the supporting information si ca is structurally similar to the norbornene pesticides and flame retardants such as dieldrin heptachlor endosulfan and dechlorane plus some of these compounds particularly dechlorane plus have recently gained great attention based on their widespread presence in the environment sverko et al 2011 ca can enter the environment either via disposal of ca containing wastes or as a transformation byproduct of chlorinated norbornenes cochrane and forbes 1974 ying et al 1986 1988 oman and hynning 1993 while the fate of ca in the environment is not well understood the compound is potentially more mobile than its norbornene counterparts owing to its higher aqueous solubility c w s 3 5 g l ipcs 1996 relatively hydrophilic nature log k ow 2 3 ipcs 1996 and negative molecular charge at environmentally relevant ph values the pk a1 and pk a2 of ca are 3 1 and 4 6 respectively hendrix et al 1983 the mobility of ca however can be influenced by its adsorption onto surfaces a process that appears to be strongly controlled by the solution ph and surface properties it has been observed that iron hydr oxide can adsorb ca that more ca was adsorbed at ph 3 3 than at ph 7 and that the freshly formed iron hydr oxide precipitates were better at adsorbing ca than the aged precipitates ying et al 1988 bench scale tests have shown that ca is very resistant to biodegradation suggesting that the natural attenuation of this compound in the environment would not occur to any appreciable extent hendrix et al 1983 ying et al 1986 considering ca s mobility and persistence together with its potential toxicity ipcs 1996 remedial actions may be required for sites contaminated with ca this study investigates the degradation of ca by persulfate s2o8 2 an oxidant that is being increasingly used in advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment and in situ chemical oxidation isco for groundwater remediation huling and pivetz 2006 tsitonaki et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 drzewicz et al 2012 lutze et al 2015 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 currently there is very little information about the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca a few studies suggested that ca can be destroyed by ozone o3 stowell and jensen 1991 peroxymonosulfate hso5 and s2o8 2 shah et al 2016 tio2 uv boisa 2013 and electrochemical based advanced oxidation hermes and knupp 2015 the transformation of ca in those studies were attributed to reactions with hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 radicals suggesting that an activated persulfate based process could be employed to treat ca contaminated sites we note that except for the tio2 uv system the ca transformation in those studies took place in homogeneous i e solid free solutions it is thus unclear how this transformation would have been affected by the presence of surfaces particularly iron containing surfaces e g fe containing suspended solids soils sediments because ca has a higher affinity toward iron surfaces at acidic ph ying et al 1988 adsorptive removal rather than oxidative transformation could be especially significant in persulfate based treatment systems in which the solution ph decreases dramatically due to the decomposition of s2o8 2 as such after persulfate treatment the concentration of ca might rebound once the solution ph increases to the pre treatment condition and ca desorbs from the minerals the overall objective of this study was to evaluate whether s2o8 2 based isco could be effectively employed to remediate ca contaminated sites first we assessed the reactivity of chlorendic acid with oh and so4 radicals by measuring their absolute reaction rate constants koh and kso4 using electron pulse radiolysis we then studied the degradation of ca by s2o8 2 in solid free and solid containing solutions employing either synthetic materials or authentic groundwater and aquifer soils to differentiate between the ca loss by adsorption and by transformation the concentration of ca remained in the solution the amount of ca adsorbed on the solid and the production of chloride cl were carefully monitored the adsorption of ca on model minerals and an authentic aquifer soil was also investigated to gain insights into how adsorption can influence the fate of ca oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals silica sio2 35 60 mesh aluminum oxide al2o3 ca 150 mesh iron iii oxyhydroxide feiii ox 30 50 mesh and manganese oxide mno2 were obtained from sigma aldrich potassium persulfate k2s2o8 was purchased from vwr all other chemicals purchased from either fisher scientific or sigma aldrich were of reagent grade and were used without further purification all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm water from a millipore system 2 2 determination of reaction rate constants koh and kso4 the absolute rate constants for the reactions between ca and oh and so4 radicals at different temperatures were obtained using the linear accelerator linac electron pulse radiolysis system at the radiation laboratory university of notre dame this approach has the advantage of generating specific isolated radicals through deposition energy into the solvent under well established chemical conditions the irradiation and transient absorption detection system has been described previously whitman et al 1996 hug et al 1999 absolute radical yields dosimetry were determined using nitrogen oxide n2o saturated solutions of 1 00 10 2 m potassium thiocyanate kscn at λ 475 nm gε 5 2 10 4 m2 j 1 with average doses of 3 8 gy per 2 10 ns pulse buxton and stuart 1995 giving initial radical concentrations in the 2 6 μm range for the room temperature and 40 c measurements irradiations were performed on continuously flowed solutions that were first passed through a temperature controlled condenser by placing a thermocouple in the direct flow after irradiation the solution temperature was continuously measured and found to be stable to 0 3 c gleason et al 2017 for the 70 c measurements static solutions in a temperature controlled sealed cuvette were irradiated by the electron beam the temperature was stable to 0 2 c but only a few kinetic traces could be obtained before interference from irradiation products became significant for all oh radical irradiation experiments solutions were pre saturated with n2o gas to prevent air ingress and to quantitatively convert the hydrogen atom and hydrated electrons initially formed to the desired oh radicals buxton et al 1988 spinks and woods 1990 since the direct reaction of the oh radical with ca did not give any suitable absorbance change across the uv visible spectrum competition kinetics method based on scn was utilized the reaction of oh with scn proceeds according to 1 oh scn scn oh scn 2 k1 1 05 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 which will occur in competition with this radical s reaction with chlorendic acid ca 2 oh ca products k2 this competition can be directly solved to give the following analytical expression 3 a b s o s c n 2 a b s s c n 2 1 k 2 c a k 1 s c n where abso scn 2 is the scn 2 yield transient absorbance peak at 475 nm in the absence of any chlorendic acid and abs scn 2 is the reduced yield when chlorendic acid is present by creating a transformed plot of the ratio of these absorbance intensities against the ratio of concentrations for the competitors ca scn the second order rate constant ratio k2 k1 can be readily determined for so4 radical generation aerated solutions containing 0 10 m k2s2o8 were used at the desired ph the fast reduction of s2o8 2 by the hydrated electron under these conditions ensures quantitative production of so4 even in the presence of ambient dissolved oxygen 250 μm buxton et al 1988 by directly observing the change in the rate of decay of so4 radical s absorbance at 450 nm the kinetics of reaction 4 can be directly measured 4 so4 ca products k4 these kinetics were found to be pseudo first order and therefore fitted with a single exponential decay function 5 a b s a b s o e k t b where k k4 ca is the pseudo first order rate constant fitted and b is a baseline adjustable parameter the fitted k values were plotted against the ca concentration with the fitted line corresponding to the second order rate constant of k4 2 3 treatment of chlorendic acid by heat activated persulfate the experiments investigating the degradation of ca by heat activated s2o8 2 were carried out in the dark employing 16 ml test tubes that contained 10 ml of reaction solution each solution initially contained 1 mm s2o8 2 50 mm na2so4 background electrolyte and 0 1 mm ca the concentration of ca in this study was similar to those employed by others stowell and jensen 1991 boisa 2013 hermes and knupp 2015 and was representative of the ca concentrations that could be found at ca impacted sites ying et al 1986 1988 some test tubes also contained 50 g l feiii ox solutions with initial ph values of 8 3 8 4 were buffered by 20 mm borate whereas solutions with initial ph values of 3 8 or 12 2 were unbuffered the thermal activation of s2o8 2 was initiated by placing the test tubes in a water bath at t 70 c at pre determined time intervals 3 test tubes were sacrificed and reactions were immediately quenched in an ice bath subsequently the samples were filtered through a 0 2 μm filter membrane and analyzed for ph s2o8 ca and chloride cl concentrations to account for the fraction of ca that was lost due to adsorption in the experiments involving feiii ox the filtered feiii ox particles were collected and added to a separate test tube containing 10 ml of ph 12 aqueous solution this tube then was mixed end over end for 45 min subsequently an aliquot was subsampled from the tube filtered and analyzed for ca control experiments indicated that this extraction procedure usually recovered more than 90 of the ca that was pre adsorbed onto feiii ox surface 2 4 adsorption of chlorendic acid onto minerals to gain insight into how aquifer minerals may affect the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco the interaction between ca and feiii ox mno2 sio2 and al2o3 was investigated these solids were chosen to represent the fe mn si and al containing minerals in the subsurface e g aluminosilicates ferrihydrite fe and mn containing sands and clays in the adsorption experiments reaction solutions contained 50 g l of a single type of solid 0 1 mm ca and 10 mm na2so4 background electrolyte the adsorption of ca in solution containing a lower concentration of feiii ox 5 g l was also investigated aliquots of 1m naoh or 1m h2so4 were added to each test tube to obtain different initial phs these solutions did not contain any ph buffer and the test tubes were mixed end over end at room temperature 22 1 c after 30 min the ph of the suspension was measured and an aliquot was taken out and filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter subsequently the amount of ca in the filtrate was quantified although adsorption equilibrium may not have been attained within 30 min the objective of this experiment was simply to examine how the solution ph influences adsorption affinity investigating adsorption kinetics developing adsorption isotherm or comparing the adsorption capacity among the solids were not the focus of this study 2 5 experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil experiments employing authentic samples of groundwater and aquifer soil were also conducted to further investigate the utility of s2o8 2 for in situ treatment of ca the aquifer soils used in this study consisted mainly of sandy soils with the concentration of total iron fe and organic carbon oc of approximately 10 g kg and 4 g kg respectively the groundwater contained approximately 55 mg l of cl 30 mg l of sulfate so4 2 20 mg l of calcium ca2 3 mg l of magnesium mg2 10 mg l of total dissolved iron and 5 mg l total organic carbon toc the ph of the groundwater was 5 8 the groundwater was amended with ca to obtain an initial concentration of 0 05 mm to evaluate the affinity of ca towards the surface of the aquifer soils an adsorption experiment similar to that described in section 2 4 was conducted batch reactors for the oxidation tests were constructed by filling 110 ml amber glass bottles with 40 g of moist aquifer soil and 80 ml of ca amended groundwater the treatment of ca was initiated by adding to each reactor either s2o8 2 or s2o8 2 and naoh the initial concentration of s2o8 2 in each reactor was approximately 85 mm in the experiments with feiii ox described in section 2 3 although iron hydr oxides can activate persulfate siegrist et al 2011 it was found that the activation of s2o8 2 by feiii ox did not occur appreciably at room temperature therefore s2o8 2 in those experiments was activated by heat in contrast the aquifer soil was found to be very reactive with s2o8 2 even at room temperature presumably due to the presence of reactive iron mineral phases therefore the experiments with the aquifer soil were conducted at 22 1 c the reactors to which only s2o8 2 was added were denoted as the matrix activated s2o8 2 reactors i e the persulfate activators in these reactors were those already present in the soil and groundwater matrix the initial solution ph in these reactors were between 5 and 6 the reactors that had both s2o8 2 and naoh were denoted as base activated persulfate reactors the initial ph in these reactors were between 12 and 12 5 the reactors were mixed end over end every few hours throughout the course of the experiment at predetermined time intervals a 3 ml aliquot was subsampled from the reactors filtered and analyzed for ph persulfate and chlorendic acid the experiment was terminated when more than 95 of the initial persulfate was consumed 2 6 analytical methods filtered samples were acidified to ph 2 and immediately analyzed for chlorendic acid using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatograph uhplc the stationary phase was a c18 column thermo scientific while the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 1 mm h2so4 which passed through the column at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the uhplc was equipped with a uv vis photodiode array detector and chlorendic acid was detected using uv absorbance at 220 nm quantitation of ca in each sample was based on a 5 point calibration curve r2 0 99 established by employing 1 100 μm ca standard solutions toc was measured on a shimadzu organic carbon analyzer chloride cl was analyzed on a thermo aquion ion chromatograph equipped with a suppressed conductivity detector persulfate was measured spectrophotometrically using the kolthoff potassium iodide method kolthoff and belcher 1957 all experiments were conducted at least in triplicate and average values with one standard deviation are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of ca with oh and so4 radicals typical kinetic data obtained from the electron pulse radiolysis experiments are presented in figs 1 and 2 based upon the known temperature dependent value of k1 ea 15 80 kj mol 1 gleason et al 2017 we can calculate the temperature dependent k2 values of interest as shown in the inset of fig 1a our calculated rate constant of k2 8 71 0 17 107 m 1 s 1 at 24 5 c is over an order of magnitude lower than previously reported by shah et al who obtained k 1 75 109 m 1 s 1 through measurement of ca loss using para chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a stable product competitor for the oh radical shah et al 2016 however this previous approach does not account for any secondary reactions of formed transient species that could also degrade chlorendic acid which would give an artificially high apparent rate constant the lower k2 value of this study is consistent with other oh radical reactions with highly chlorinated species reported in the literature e g the rate constant between endrin and oh is k 2 7 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 haag and yao 1992 mechanistically it is believed that the oxidation of ca by oh would take place via h atom abstraction from the highly sterically hindered c h moieties from the ring joining carbon atoms for the reaction between ca and so4 our calculated rate constant at 24 5 c is k4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1 s 1 which is also over an order of magnitude lower than the value measured by shah et al k 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 shah et al 2016 the so4 radical reaction could again occur by h atom abstraction from the same c h bonds as for oh but there might be some additional reactivity by electron abstraction from the negative deprotonated carboxylic acid groups in ca the reaction rate constant values measured in the temperature range 24 5 70 0 c were used to generate the arrhenius plots insets of figs 1a and 2a from which the activation energies for reactions 2 and 4 can be obtained e2 25 43 0 36 and e4 37 66 0 33 kj mol 1 respectively all our kinetic data are summarized in table 1 to our knowledge our study is the first that has measured so4 radical kinetics at these elevated temperatures the experimental setup that we developed see section 2 2 can be used to generate temperature dependent rate constants for the reactions between so4 radical and other contaminants and solutes and this information will be invaluable for understanding and designing heat activated persulfate treatment systems 3 2 chlorendic acid oxidation in homogeneous system in homogeneous solutions containing s2o8 2 and ca the most rapid removal of ca was observed at ph 3 6 while the removal at ph 12 2 was the slowest fig 3 after 10 h over 95 of the initial ca was destroyed at ph 3 6 55 60 at ph 8 3 and 25 at ph 12 2 toc decreased by approximately 25 at ph 8 3 fig s2 no ca loss was observed in the absence of s2o8 2 data not shown therefore the ca loss in the presence of s2o8 2 was attributable to reactions with so4 and oh which were produced from the thermal activation of s2o8 2 both so4 and oh radicals have been shown to be capable of oxidizing ca shah et al 2016 stowell and jensen 1991 hermes and knupp 2015 according to liang and su 2009 who investigated the activation of persulfate at 70 c so4 was the predominant oxidant at acidic ph both oh and so4 were important at neutral ph and oh was the predominant oxidant at alkaline ph therefore in the current study it is believed that the predominant oxidant responsible for the ca oxidation would be so4 in the ph 3 6 solution oh in the ph 12 2 solution and both so4 and oh in the ph 8 3 solution as with the ca loss rate the s2o8 2 utilization efficiency i e e δ ca δ s2o8 2 100 also decreased with increasing ph table 2 possible explanation for the trends between the solution ph and the rate and efficiency include 1 ca is more reactive with so4 than with oh note that at 70 c so4 is only slightly more reactive than oh as can be seen from table 1 2 ca is more amenable to oxidation at acidic ph and 3 the scavenging of so4 and oh by other solutes in the solution e g s2o8 2 the byproducts of ca oxidation such as cl and other lower molecular weight compounds is more pronounced under circumneutral and alkaline conditions as the degradation of ca proceeded the concentration of cl in the solution gradually increased fig 3 the production of cl from the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh was also observed in previous studies since each ca molecule contains 6 cl atoms the maximum possible value for the ratio δcl δ ca should be 6 in our study this ratio was always greater than 5 and approached 6 by the end of the experiment table 2 in the ph 8 3 and 12 2 solutions the δcl δ ca ratios were also approaching 6 even though over 60 of ca remained in the solution at the end of the experiment jensen and coworkers investigated the degradation of ca by ozone o3 in two separate studies we calculated the δcl δ ca ratio in these studies using fig 6 in stowell and jensen 1991 and fig 2 in sebastian et al 1996 in the first study δcl δ ca gradually increased and was 5 5 when 85 of the initial ca was removed whereas in the second study δcl δ ca increased to 5 5 when the removal of ca was only 26 these results and ours suggest that the cl containing intermediates produced from the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh must have been further transformed via the same reaction mechanisms that liberated most of the cl into the solution as free cl although cl ions can be further oxidized into clo3 by so4 and oh lutze et al 2015 no clo3 was detected in our experiments currently there is very little information about the mechanisms of ca transformation shah et al proposed that the first step of the transformation of ca by so4 and oh would generate chlorendic anhydride shah et al 2016 however the presence of chlorendic anhydride in their gas chromatography analysis is more likely the result of the thermal dehydration of ca in the gc injection port which was set at t 250 c the mechanism through which so4 and oh react with ca and the byproducts produced are interesting research topics which merit further investigation 3 3 chlorendic acid oxidation and adsorption in the presence of feiii ox a previous study reported that ca could be adsorbed by iron hydroxide precipitates ying et al 1988 the adsorption of ca on iron containing minerals could significantly influence the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco because so4 and oh are generally not effective at reacting with adsorbed species fig 4 a and c presents the fractions of ca in the solution and on the feiii ox surface 50 g l during the treatment with persufate at t 70 c as with the homogeneous experiment our intention was to investigate the removal of ca under acidic circumneutral and alkaline conditions however in the experiment with initial ph of 4 the ph of the solution quickly increased to ph 6 after 1 h and from there gradually increased to ph 7 1 by the end of the experiment because the decomposition of s2o8 2 produces h which should have caused the ph of the solution to decrease the ph increase in this experiment was attributable to the ability of feiii ox to buffer the solution in the circumneutral ph range therefore although the solution in this experiment was initially acidic the experiment is referred to as the circumneutral ph experiment in the subsequent discussion under the circumneutral ph condition except for t 0 h the adsorbed fraction accounted for over 50 of the total ca in the system fig 4a in contrast only less than 5 of the ca in the ph 12 2 experiment was associated with feiii ox fig 4c under both ph regimes the total concentration of ca decreased over time fig 4b and d although the rates of decrease were slower than those in the respective ph regime of the homogeneous systems fig 3b and c the stoichiometric efficiencies e in the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems were comparable at circumneutral ph whereas at alkaline ph the efficiency in the heterogeneous system was almost three times lower than that in the homogeneous system table 2 it is noted that since only approximately 90 of the ca adsorbed on feiii ox could be recovered by extraction see section 2 4 the actual e in the heterogeneous system could be slightly lower than the values reported in table 2 it is also noted that although cl was measured in the heterogeneous experiment fig 4b and d the concentration at each sampling point represented the total cl released from ca and the cl leached from impurities in feiii ox the presence of cl containing impurities in feiii ox was confirmed by washing feiii ox particles and measuring cl in the spent solution the contribution of cl by the impurities explains why some δcl δ ca values were greater than 6 table 2 the slower ca oxidation and lower e in the heterogeneous system are attributable to 1 the slower rate of s2o8 2 decomposition compare the inset of fig 3b vs 3b and 3c vs 4d which resulted in the slower rates of so4 and oh production 2 the scavenging of so4 and oh by the feiii ox surface since ca is only moderately reactive with so4 and oh koh and kso4 5 108 m 1s 1 introducing any scavenger into the system feiii ox in this case would have appreciably slowed the oxidation of ca and 3 the adsorption of ca on feiii ox which would reduce the amount of dissolved ca available for reacting with so4 and oh in the ph 12 2 experiment the adsorption should not appreciably affect ca oxidation since most ca remained in the solution in the circumneutral ph experiment since over 50 of the ca in the system was associated with feiii ox the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh must have been influenced at least in part by the adsorption desorption of ca 3 4 effect of ph on ca adsorption on model minerals to further investigate the influence of adsorption on the fate of ca the affinity of ca to feiii ox as well as to other model minerals such as mno2 al2o3 and sio2 was investigated in solutions with phs ranging from 2 to 12 the fraction of ca that adsorbed onto feiii ox decreased with increasing ph fig 5 at ph 2 5 essentially all ca in the system was associated with feiii ox regardless of the solid concentration i e 5 g l vs 50 g l in contrast over 95 of ca remained in the solution when ph was greater than 10 not surprisingly in the ph range 2 5 10 more ca was adsorbed by 50 g l feiii ox than by 5 g l feiii ox a similar trend between ph and ca adsorption was also observed by ying et al who reported that more ca was adsorbed on ferric hydroxide precipitates at ph 3 3 than at ph 7 ying et al 1988 in the presence of 50 g l of feiii ox the fraction of ca associated with feiii ox at ph 8 3 was approximately 20 25 in the oxidation experiment conducted at the same ph the fraction of ca associated with feiii ox was 10 at t 0 h and was over 50 at the other time points fig 4a however direct comparison of the fraction of ca adsorbed in these two experiments is not possible since the experiments were conducted at different temperature i e t 22 c in the adsorption experiment vs t 70 c in the oxidation experiment and employed solutions with different composition i e the solutions in the adsorption experiment did not contain s2o8 2 similar trends between ph and ca adsorption were observed with sio2 mno2 and al2o3 although compared to the adsorption edges of feiii ox and al2o3 those of sio2 and mno2 were displaced toward more acidic ph fig 6 in the case of al2o3 the decrease in adsorption between ph 2 5 and 4 5 was attributable to the dissolution of al2o3 in this ph range based on the adsorption edge trends among the solids and the trend between adsorption and ph it is hypothesized that the adsorption of ca is controlled by electrostatic interactions between the surface and ca molecules above the point of zero charge pzc of each solid i e 2 5 for sio2 3 6 for mno2 and 7 5 9 for al2o3 and iron oxides sverjensky and sahai 1996 sahai and sverjensky 1997 cristiano et al 2011 both ca pka1 3 1 pka2 4 6 and the surface are negatively charged as the ph increased the surface becomes more negatively charged resulting in an increase in repulsion between ca and the surface and therefore a decrease in ca adsorption in the ph range between pka1 and pzc the negatively charged ca molecule would be attracted to the positively charge surface at ph pka1 the ca molecules that are negatively charged would be electrostatically attracted to the positively charged surface whereas the ca molecules that are neutrally charged could have some affinity towards the surface due to the non specific interaction i e hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction overall the results described above indicate that the groundwater ph and the geology of the subsurface could have significant influence on the mobility of ca in the subsurface as well as the ability of activated s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco 3 5 experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil in the homogeneous and heterogeneous experiments sections 3 2 and 3 3 the initial concentration of s2o8 2 was 1 mm 0 192 g l as s2o8 2 this concentration is relatively low compared to the concentrations of s2o8 2 solutions used in remedial systems which typically ranges between low and high tens of grams per liter of s2o8 2 once introduced into the subsurface s2o8 2 will be activated into so4 and oh by aquifer soil or by solutions containing dissolved metals or a strong base that are co injected with s2o8 2 s2o8 2 can also be activated in situ by heat via steam injection addition of h2o2 the decomposition of h2o2 liberates heat or electrical resistance heating tsitonaki et al 2010 reynolds 2014 with base activation the solution ph usually remains at above ph 10 whereas with the other activation techniques the solution ph can decrease to as low as ph 2 3 once the natural buffering capacity of the subsurface is depleted this is because the decomposition of each s2o8 2 molecule generates two h ions because ca adsorption is influenced by the solution ph figs 5 and 6 the fluctuation of ph in s2o8 2 based remedial systems can significantly affect the oxidative treatment of ca to further examine the utility of s2o8 2 for in situ treatment of ca the degradation of ca in reactors containing authentic samples of groundwater and aquifer soils was conducted a preliminary experiment conducted at 70 c showed that the combination of heat and matrix activations resulted in a rapid ph decrease to 2 and a 100 loss of ca due to adsorption within only 15 min data not shown as such all experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil were conducted at 22 1 c and not at elevated temperature as in the experiments with feiii ox in the matrix activated persulfate reactors as the decomposition of persulfate took place the solution ph dropped from 5 5 to 1 7 within the first 18 h of the experiment concurrently ca levels dropped below our detection limit 1 μm fig 7 however ca concentrations rebounded to near baseline conditions when the ph of the solution was adjusted back to ph 6 a similar ca concentration ph trend was observed in the subsequent 50 h with ca concentrations decreasing in the solution as the ph decreased but increasing again as the ph was raised this ca concentration trend is attributable to the ca adsorption on and desorption from the aquifer soils this hypothesis is supported by an adsorption test which revealed that all ca was associated with the aquifer soils at ph below 2 5 whereas over 90 ca remained in the solution at ph above 6 fig 8 in the reactors containing s2o8 2 the oxidation of ca did not occur to an appreciable extent fig 7 in fact only less than 3 of ca was oxidized after more than 95 of s2o8 2 was consumed e 0 003 neither adsorption nor oxidative transformation of ca occurred appreciably in the base activated s2o8 2 reactors fig 7b the adsorption of ca did not take place as the ph of the solution in these reactors was maintained at above 12 throughout the experiment whereas the lack of oxidative transformation is attributable to the radical scavenging by the aquifer soil surface the aquifer soil contained 4 g kg of organic carbon as well as by groundwater solutes such as co3 2 cl and dissolved organic matter 4 conclusions and implications for the remediation of ca by s2o8 2 based on the findings described above the following conclusions can be made about the in situ remediation of ca firstly due to the affinity of ca toward surfaces the groundwater ph and the geology of the subsurface could have a significant influence on the mobility of ca and the extent of the ca plume secondly activated persulfate can be used to oxidize ca however given the moderate reactivity of ca with so4 and oh radicals kso4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1s 1 and koh 8 71 0 17 107 m 1s 1 at 24 5 c the oxidation of ca will only occur appreciably when radical scavengers such as background solutes dissolved organic matter and co contaminants are not present in significant quantities thirdly in the presence of a surface adsorption is expected to be the predominant mechanism of ca removal under acidic conditions as such the disappearance of ca if observed following the injection of s2o8 2 should be carefully scrutinized because such disappearance could be the result of adsorption rather than oxidative transformation the adsorption of ca on aquifer soils can be particularly significant in systems with low ph buffering capacity where the ph can drop dramatically as s2o8 2 decomposes when adsorption is the primary removal mechanism the concentration of ca in the groundwater is expected to rebound once ph increases and desorption starts to occur while monitoring the concentration of cl in the groundwater may help determine if oxidative transformation is occurring since the transformation of ca generates cl it will be difficult to detect changes in systems containing a high concentration of background cl fourthly the transformation of ca could take place in systems where the solution ph remains neutral throughout the treatment such as in systems containing excess buffering capacity e g fig 3b however such systems will likely contain high concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate which can compete with ca for oh and so4 finally under alkaline conditions typical of remedial systems in which s2o8 2 is activated by a base ca would remain in the solution and would be available for reacting with oh and so4 however as in the circumneutral systems the ca transformation rate and efficiency are expected to be low due to the scavenging of the radicals by aquifer soils and the solutes present in the groundwater when s2o8 2 is deemed to be ineffective other remedial options for ca could potentially be in situ transformation by a strong reductant e g zero valent iron or adsorptive ex situ treatment i e pump and treat the ability of zero valent iron

18634,the oxidation of chlorendic acid ca a polychlorinated recalcitrant contaminant by heat mineral and base activated persulfate was investigated in ph 3 12 homogeneous i e solid free solutions ca was oxidized by oh and so4 radicals resulting in a nearly stoichiometric production of cl the rate constants for the reaction between these radicals and ca were measured at different temperatures by electron pulse radiolysis and were found to be koh 8 71 0 17 107 m 1s 1 and kso4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1s 1 at 24 5 c for oh and so4 respectively ca was oxidized at much slower rates in solutions containing iron oxyhydroxide or aquifer soils partially due to the adsorption of ca on these solids to gain further insight into the effect of solids during in situ remediation of ca the adsorption of ca onto iron hydr oxide manganese dioxide silica alumina and aquifer soils was investigated the fraction of ca that was adsorbed on these materials increased as the solution ph decreased given that the solution ph can decrease dramatically in persulfate based remedial systems adsorption may reduce the ability of persulfate to oxidize ca overall the results of this study provide important information about how persulfate can be used to remediate ca contaminated sites the results also indicate that the groundwater ph and geology of the subsurface can have a significant influence on the mobility of ca graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorendic acid in situ remediation in situ chemical oxidation persulfate advanced oxidation process 1 introduction chlorendic acid 1 4 5 6 7 7 hexachlorobicyclo 2 2 1 hept 5 ene 2 3 dicarboxylic acid is a polychlorinated organic compound used in multiple applications including as a flame retardant an intermediate in the synthesis of polymeric resins and corrosion resistant materials and an additive in extreme pressure lubricants ntp 1987 ipcs 1996 commercially known as het acid chlorendic acid ca is synthesized via a diels alder reaction between hexachloropentadiene and maleic anhydride with a bridged ring and six cl atoms fig s1 in the supporting information si ca is structurally similar to the norbornene pesticides and flame retardants such as dieldrin heptachlor endosulfan and dechlorane plus some of these compounds particularly dechlorane plus have recently gained great attention based on their widespread presence in the environment sverko et al 2011 ca can enter the environment either via disposal of ca containing wastes or as a transformation byproduct of chlorinated norbornenes cochrane and forbes 1974 ying et al 1986 1988 oman and hynning 1993 while the fate of ca in the environment is not well understood the compound is potentially more mobile than its norbornene counterparts owing to its higher aqueous solubility c w s 3 5 g l ipcs 1996 relatively hydrophilic nature log k ow 2 3 ipcs 1996 and negative molecular charge at environmentally relevant ph values the pk a1 and pk a2 of ca are 3 1 and 4 6 respectively hendrix et al 1983 the mobility of ca however can be influenced by its adsorption onto surfaces a process that appears to be strongly controlled by the solution ph and surface properties it has been observed that iron hydr oxide can adsorb ca that more ca was adsorbed at ph 3 3 than at ph 7 and that the freshly formed iron hydr oxide precipitates were better at adsorbing ca than the aged precipitates ying et al 1988 bench scale tests have shown that ca is very resistant to biodegradation suggesting that the natural attenuation of this compound in the environment would not occur to any appreciable extent hendrix et al 1983 ying et al 1986 considering ca s mobility and persistence together with its potential toxicity ipcs 1996 remedial actions may be required for sites contaminated with ca this study investigates the degradation of ca by persulfate s2o8 2 an oxidant that is being increasingly used in advanced oxidation processes for water and wastewater treatment and in situ chemical oxidation isco for groundwater remediation huling and pivetz 2006 tsitonaki et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 drzewicz et al 2012 lutze et al 2015 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 currently there is very little information about the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca a few studies suggested that ca can be destroyed by ozone o3 stowell and jensen 1991 peroxymonosulfate hso5 and s2o8 2 shah et al 2016 tio2 uv boisa 2013 and electrochemical based advanced oxidation hermes and knupp 2015 the transformation of ca in those studies were attributed to reactions with hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 radicals suggesting that an activated persulfate based process could be employed to treat ca contaminated sites we note that except for the tio2 uv system the ca transformation in those studies took place in homogeneous i e solid free solutions it is thus unclear how this transformation would have been affected by the presence of surfaces particularly iron containing surfaces e g fe containing suspended solids soils sediments because ca has a higher affinity toward iron surfaces at acidic ph ying et al 1988 adsorptive removal rather than oxidative transformation could be especially significant in persulfate based treatment systems in which the solution ph decreases dramatically due to the decomposition of s2o8 2 as such after persulfate treatment the concentration of ca might rebound once the solution ph increases to the pre treatment condition and ca desorbs from the minerals the overall objective of this study was to evaluate whether s2o8 2 based isco could be effectively employed to remediate ca contaminated sites first we assessed the reactivity of chlorendic acid with oh and so4 radicals by measuring their absolute reaction rate constants koh and kso4 using electron pulse radiolysis we then studied the degradation of ca by s2o8 2 in solid free and solid containing solutions employing either synthetic materials or authentic groundwater and aquifer soils to differentiate between the ca loss by adsorption and by transformation the concentration of ca remained in the solution the amount of ca adsorbed on the solid and the production of chloride cl were carefully monitored the adsorption of ca on model minerals and an authentic aquifer soil was also investigated to gain insights into how adsorption can influence the fate of ca oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals silica sio2 35 60 mesh aluminum oxide al2o3 ca 150 mesh iron iii oxyhydroxide feiii ox 30 50 mesh and manganese oxide mno2 were obtained from sigma aldrich potassium persulfate k2s2o8 was purchased from vwr all other chemicals purchased from either fisher scientific or sigma aldrich were of reagent grade and were used without further purification all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm water from a millipore system 2 2 determination of reaction rate constants koh and kso4 the absolute rate constants for the reactions between ca and oh and so4 radicals at different temperatures were obtained using the linear accelerator linac electron pulse radiolysis system at the radiation laboratory university of notre dame this approach has the advantage of generating specific isolated radicals through deposition energy into the solvent under well established chemical conditions the irradiation and transient absorption detection system has been described previously whitman et al 1996 hug et al 1999 absolute radical yields dosimetry were determined using nitrogen oxide n2o saturated solutions of 1 00 10 2 m potassium thiocyanate kscn at λ 475 nm gε 5 2 10 4 m2 j 1 with average doses of 3 8 gy per 2 10 ns pulse buxton and stuart 1995 giving initial radical concentrations in the 2 6 μm range for the room temperature and 40 c measurements irradiations were performed on continuously flowed solutions that were first passed through a temperature controlled condenser by placing a thermocouple in the direct flow after irradiation the solution temperature was continuously measured and found to be stable to 0 3 c gleason et al 2017 for the 70 c measurements static solutions in a temperature controlled sealed cuvette were irradiated by the electron beam the temperature was stable to 0 2 c but only a few kinetic traces could be obtained before interference from irradiation products became significant for all oh radical irradiation experiments solutions were pre saturated with n2o gas to prevent air ingress and to quantitatively convert the hydrogen atom and hydrated electrons initially formed to the desired oh radicals buxton et al 1988 spinks and woods 1990 since the direct reaction of the oh radical with ca did not give any suitable absorbance change across the uv visible spectrum competition kinetics method based on scn was utilized the reaction of oh with scn proceeds according to 1 oh scn scn oh scn 2 k1 1 05 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 which will occur in competition with this radical s reaction with chlorendic acid ca 2 oh ca products k2 this competition can be directly solved to give the following analytical expression 3 a b s o s c n 2 a b s s c n 2 1 k 2 c a k 1 s c n where abso scn 2 is the scn 2 yield transient absorbance peak at 475 nm in the absence of any chlorendic acid and abs scn 2 is the reduced yield when chlorendic acid is present by creating a transformed plot of the ratio of these absorbance intensities against the ratio of concentrations for the competitors ca scn the second order rate constant ratio k2 k1 can be readily determined for so4 radical generation aerated solutions containing 0 10 m k2s2o8 were used at the desired ph the fast reduction of s2o8 2 by the hydrated electron under these conditions ensures quantitative production of so4 even in the presence of ambient dissolved oxygen 250 μm buxton et al 1988 by directly observing the change in the rate of decay of so4 radical s absorbance at 450 nm the kinetics of reaction 4 can be directly measured 4 so4 ca products k4 these kinetics were found to be pseudo first order and therefore fitted with a single exponential decay function 5 a b s a b s o e k t b where k k4 ca is the pseudo first order rate constant fitted and b is a baseline adjustable parameter the fitted k values were plotted against the ca concentration with the fitted line corresponding to the second order rate constant of k4 2 3 treatment of chlorendic acid by heat activated persulfate the experiments investigating the degradation of ca by heat activated s2o8 2 were carried out in the dark employing 16 ml test tubes that contained 10 ml of reaction solution each solution initially contained 1 mm s2o8 2 50 mm na2so4 background electrolyte and 0 1 mm ca the concentration of ca in this study was similar to those employed by others stowell and jensen 1991 boisa 2013 hermes and knupp 2015 and was representative of the ca concentrations that could be found at ca impacted sites ying et al 1986 1988 some test tubes also contained 50 g l feiii ox solutions with initial ph values of 8 3 8 4 were buffered by 20 mm borate whereas solutions with initial ph values of 3 8 or 12 2 were unbuffered the thermal activation of s2o8 2 was initiated by placing the test tubes in a water bath at t 70 c at pre determined time intervals 3 test tubes were sacrificed and reactions were immediately quenched in an ice bath subsequently the samples were filtered through a 0 2 μm filter membrane and analyzed for ph s2o8 ca and chloride cl concentrations to account for the fraction of ca that was lost due to adsorption in the experiments involving feiii ox the filtered feiii ox particles were collected and added to a separate test tube containing 10 ml of ph 12 aqueous solution this tube then was mixed end over end for 45 min subsequently an aliquot was subsampled from the tube filtered and analyzed for ca control experiments indicated that this extraction procedure usually recovered more than 90 of the ca that was pre adsorbed onto feiii ox surface 2 4 adsorption of chlorendic acid onto minerals to gain insight into how aquifer minerals may affect the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco the interaction between ca and feiii ox mno2 sio2 and al2o3 was investigated these solids were chosen to represent the fe mn si and al containing minerals in the subsurface e g aluminosilicates ferrihydrite fe and mn containing sands and clays in the adsorption experiments reaction solutions contained 50 g l of a single type of solid 0 1 mm ca and 10 mm na2so4 background electrolyte the adsorption of ca in solution containing a lower concentration of feiii ox 5 g l was also investigated aliquots of 1m naoh or 1m h2so4 were added to each test tube to obtain different initial phs these solutions did not contain any ph buffer and the test tubes were mixed end over end at room temperature 22 1 c after 30 min the ph of the suspension was measured and an aliquot was taken out and filtered through a 0 2 μm syringe filter subsequently the amount of ca in the filtrate was quantified although adsorption equilibrium may not have been attained within 30 min the objective of this experiment was simply to examine how the solution ph influences adsorption affinity investigating adsorption kinetics developing adsorption isotherm or comparing the adsorption capacity among the solids were not the focus of this study 2 5 experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil experiments employing authentic samples of groundwater and aquifer soil were also conducted to further investigate the utility of s2o8 2 for in situ treatment of ca the aquifer soils used in this study consisted mainly of sandy soils with the concentration of total iron fe and organic carbon oc of approximately 10 g kg and 4 g kg respectively the groundwater contained approximately 55 mg l of cl 30 mg l of sulfate so4 2 20 mg l of calcium ca2 3 mg l of magnesium mg2 10 mg l of total dissolved iron and 5 mg l total organic carbon toc the ph of the groundwater was 5 8 the groundwater was amended with ca to obtain an initial concentration of 0 05 mm to evaluate the affinity of ca towards the surface of the aquifer soils an adsorption experiment similar to that described in section 2 4 was conducted batch reactors for the oxidation tests were constructed by filling 110 ml amber glass bottles with 40 g of moist aquifer soil and 80 ml of ca amended groundwater the treatment of ca was initiated by adding to each reactor either s2o8 2 or s2o8 2 and naoh the initial concentration of s2o8 2 in each reactor was approximately 85 mm in the experiments with feiii ox described in section 2 3 although iron hydr oxides can activate persulfate siegrist et al 2011 it was found that the activation of s2o8 2 by feiii ox did not occur appreciably at room temperature therefore s2o8 2 in those experiments was activated by heat in contrast the aquifer soil was found to be very reactive with s2o8 2 even at room temperature presumably due to the presence of reactive iron mineral phases therefore the experiments with the aquifer soil were conducted at 22 1 c the reactors to which only s2o8 2 was added were denoted as the matrix activated s2o8 2 reactors i e the persulfate activators in these reactors were those already present in the soil and groundwater matrix the initial solution ph in these reactors were between 5 and 6 the reactors that had both s2o8 2 and naoh were denoted as base activated persulfate reactors the initial ph in these reactors were between 12 and 12 5 the reactors were mixed end over end every few hours throughout the course of the experiment at predetermined time intervals a 3 ml aliquot was subsampled from the reactors filtered and analyzed for ph persulfate and chlorendic acid the experiment was terminated when more than 95 of the initial persulfate was consumed 2 6 analytical methods filtered samples were acidified to ph 2 and immediately analyzed for chlorendic acid using a thermo scientific ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatograph uhplc the stationary phase was a c18 column thermo scientific while the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 1 mm h2so4 which passed through the column at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min the uhplc was equipped with a uv vis photodiode array detector and chlorendic acid was detected using uv absorbance at 220 nm quantitation of ca in each sample was based on a 5 point calibration curve r2 0 99 established by employing 1 100 μm ca standard solutions toc was measured on a shimadzu organic carbon analyzer chloride cl was analyzed on a thermo aquion ion chromatograph equipped with a suppressed conductivity detector persulfate was measured spectrophotometrically using the kolthoff potassium iodide method kolthoff and belcher 1957 all experiments were conducted at least in triplicate and average values with one standard deviation are reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of ca with oh and so4 radicals typical kinetic data obtained from the electron pulse radiolysis experiments are presented in figs 1 and 2 based upon the known temperature dependent value of k1 ea 15 80 kj mol 1 gleason et al 2017 we can calculate the temperature dependent k2 values of interest as shown in the inset of fig 1a our calculated rate constant of k2 8 71 0 17 107 m 1 s 1 at 24 5 c is over an order of magnitude lower than previously reported by shah et al who obtained k 1 75 109 m 1 s 1 through measurement of ca loss using para chlorobenzoic acid pcba as a stable product competitor for the oh radical shah et al 2016 however this previous approach does not account for any secondary reactions of formed transient species that could also degrade chlorendic acid which would give an artificially high apparent rate constant the lower k2 value of this study is consistent with other oh radical reactions with highly chlorinated species reported in the literature e g the rate constant between endrin and oh is k 2 7 0 7 108 m 1 s 1 haag and yao 1992 mechanistically it is believed that the oxidation of ca by oh would take place via h atom abstraction from the highly sterically hindered c h moieties from the ring joining carbon atoms for the reaction between ca and so4 our calculated rate constant at 24 5 c is k4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1 s 1 which is also over an order of magnitude lower than the value measured by shah et al k 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 shah et al 2016 the so4 radical reaction could again occur by h atom abstraction from the same c h bonds as for oh but there might be some additional reactivity by electron abstraction from the negative deprotonated carboxylic acid groups in ca the reaction rate constant values measured in the temperature range 24 5 70 0 c were used to generate the arrhenius plots insets of figs 1a and 2a from which the activation energies for reactions 2 and 4 can be obtained e2 25 43 0 36 and e4 37 66 0 33 kj mol 1 respectively all our kinetic data are summarized in table 1 to our knowledge our study is the first that has measured so4 radical kinetics at these elevated temperatures the experimental setup that we developed see section 2 2 can be used to generate temperature dependent rate constants for the reactions between so4 radical and other contaminants and solutes and this information will be invaluable for understanding and designing heat activated persulfate treatment systems 3 2 chlorendic acid oxidation in homogeneous system in homogeneous solutions containing s2o8 2 and ca the most rapid removal of ca was observed at ph 3 6 while the removal at ph 12 2 was the slowest fig 3 after 10 h over 95 of the initial ca was destroyed at ph 3 6 55 60 at ph 8 3 and 25 at ph 12 2 toc decreased by approximately 25 at ph 8 3 fig s2 no ca loss was observed in the absence of s2o8 2 data not shown therefore the ca loss in the presence of s2o8 2 was attributable to reactions with so4 and oh which were produced from the thermal activation of s2o8 2 both so4 and oh radicals have been shown to be capable of oxidizing ca shah et al 2016 stowell and jensen 1991 hermes and knupp 2015 according to liang and su 2009 who investigated the activation of persulfate at 70 c so4 was the predominant oxidant at acidic ph both oh and so4 were important at neutral ph and oh was the predominant oxidant at alkaline ph therefore in the current study it is believed that the predominant oxidant responsible for the ca oxidation would be so4 in the ph 3 6 solution oh in the ph 12 2 solution and both so4 and oh in the ph 8 3 solution as with the ca loss rate the s2o8 2 utilization efficiency i e e δ ca δ s2o8 2 100 also decreased with increasing ph table 2 possible explanation for the trends between the solution ph and the rate and efficiency include 1 ca is more reactive with so4 than with oh note that at 70 c so4 is only slightly more reactive than oh as can be seen from table 1 2 ca is more amenable to oxidation at acidic ph and 3 the scavenging of so4 and oh by other solutes in the solution e g s2o8 2 the byproducts of ca oxidation such as cl and other lower molecular weight compounds is more pronounced under circumneutral and alkaline conditions as the degradation of ca proceeded the concentration of cl in the solution gradually increased fig 3 the production of cl from the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh was also observed in previous studies since each ca molecule contains 6 cl atoms the maximum possible value for the ratio δcl δ ca should be 6 in our study this ratio was always greater than 5 and approached 6 by the end of the experiment table 2 in the ph 8 3 and 12 2 solutions the δcl δ ca ratios were also approaching 6 even though over 60 of ca remained in the solution at the end of the experiment jensen and coworkers investigated the degradation of ca by ozone o3 in two separate studies we calculated the δcl δ ca ratio in these studies using fig 6 in stowell and jensen 1991 and fig 2 in sebastian et al 1996 in the first study δcl δ ca gradually increased and was 5 5 when 85 of the initial ca was removed whereas in the second study δcl δ ca increased to 5 5 when the removal of ca was only 26 these results and ours suggest that the cl containing intermediates produced from the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh must have been further transformed via the same reaction mechanisms that liberated most of the cl into the solution as free cl although cl ions can be further oxidized into clo3 by so4 and oh lutze et al 2015 no clo3 was detected in our experiments currently there is very little information about the mechanisms of ca transformation shah et al proposed that the first step of the transformation of ca by so4 and oh would generate chlorendic anhydride shah et al 2016 however the presence of chlorendic anhydride in their gas chromatography analysis is more likely the result of the thermal dehydration of ca in the gc injection port which was set at t 250 c the mechanism through which so4 and oh react with ca and the byproducts produced are interesting research topics which merit further investigation 3 3 chlorendic acid oxidation and adsorption in the presence of feiii ox a previous study reported that ca could be adsorbed by iron hydroxide precipitates ying et al 1988 the adsorption of ca on iron containing minerals could significantly influence the ability of s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco because so4 and oh are generally not effective at reacting with adsorbed species fig 4 a and c presents the fractions of ca in the solution and on the feiii ox surface 50 g l during the treatment with persufate at t 70 c as with the homogeneous experiment our intention was to investigate the removal of ca under acidic circumneutral and alkaline conditions however in the experiment with initial ph of 4 the ph of the solution quickly increased to ph 6 after 1 h and from there gradually increased to ph 7 1 by the end of the experiment because the decomposition of s2o8 2 produces h which should have caused the ph of the solution to decrease the ph increase in this experiment was attributable to the ability of feiii ox to buffer the solution in the circumneutral ph range therefore although the solution in this experiment was initially acidic the experiment is referred to as the circumneutral ph experiment in the subsequent discussion under the circumneutral ph condition except for t 0 h the adsorbed fraction accounted for over 50 of the total ca in the system fig 4a in contrast only less than 5 of the ca in the ph 12 2 experiment was associated with feiii ox fig 4c under both ph regimes the total concentration of ca decreased over time fig 4b and d although the rates of decrease were slower than those in the respective ph regime of the homogeneous systems fig 3b and c the stoichiometric efficiencies e in the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems were comparable at circumneutral ph whereas at alkaline ph the efficiency in the heterogeneous system was almost three times lower than that in the homogeneous system table 2 it is noted that since only approximately 90 of the ca adsorbed on feiii ox could be recovered by extraction see section 2 4 the actual e in the heterogeneous system could be slightly lower than the values reported in table 2 it is also noted that although cl was measured in the heterogeneous experiment fig 4b and d the concentration at each sampling point represented the total cl released from ca and the cl leached from impurities in feiii ox the presence of cl containing impurities in feiii ox was confirmed by washing feiii ox particles and measuring cl in the spent solution the contribution of cl by the impurities explains why some δcl δ ca values were greater than 6 table 2 the slower ca oxidation and lower e in the heterogeneous system are attributable to 1 the slower rate of s2o8 2 decomposition compare the inset of fig 3b vs 3b and 3c vs 4d which resulted in the slower rates of so4 and oh production 2 the scavenging of so4 and oh by the feiii ox surface since ca is only moderately reactive with so4 and oh koh and kso4 5 108 m 1s 1 introducing any scavenger into the system feiii ox in this case would have appreciably slowed the oxidation of ca and 3 the adsorption of ca on feiii ox which would reduce the amount of dissolved ca available for reacting with so4 and oh in the ph 12 2 experiment the adsorption should not appreciably affect ca oxidation since most ca remained in the solution in the circumneutral ph experiment since over 50 of the ca in the system was associated with feiii ox the oxidation of ca by so4 and oh must have been influenced at least in part by the adsorption desorption of ca 3 4 effect of ph on ca adsorption on model minerals to further investigate the influence of adsorption on the fate of ca the affinity of ca to feiii ox as well as to other model minerals such as mno2 al2o3 and sio2 was investigated in solutions with phs ranging from 2 to 12 the fraction of ca that adsorbed onto feiii ox decreased with increasing ph fig 5 at ph 2 5 essentially all ca in the system was associated with feiii ox regardless of the solid concentration i e 5 g l vs 50 g l in contrast over 95 of ca remained in the solution when ph was greater than 10 not surprisingly in the ph range 2 5 10 more ca was adsorbed by 50 g l feiii ox than by 5 g l feiii ox a similar trend between ph and ca adsorption was also observed by ying et al who reported that more ca was adsorbed on ferric hydroxide precipitates at ph 3 3 than at ph 7 ying et al 1988 in the presence of 50 g l of feiii ox the fraction of ca associated with feiii ox at ph 8 3 was approximately 20 25 in the oxidation experiment conducted at the same ph the fraction of ca associated with feiii ox was 10 at t 0 h and was over 50 at the other time points fig 4a however direct comparison of the fraction of ca adsorbed in these two experiments is not possible since the experiments were conducted at different temperature i e t 22 c in the adsorption experiment vs t 70 c in the oxidation experiment and employed solutions with different composition i e the solutions in the adsorption experiment did not contain s2o8 2 similar trends between ph and ca adsorption were observed with sio2 mno2 and al2o3 although compared to the adsorption edges of feiii ox and al2o3 those of sio2 and mno2 were displaced toward more acidic ph fig 6 in the case of al2o3 the decrease in adsorption between ph 2 5 and 4 5 was attributable to the dissolution of al2o3 in this ph range based on the adsorption edge trends among the solids and the trend between adsorption and ph it is hypothesized that the adsorption of ca is controlled by electrostatic interactions between the surface and ca molecules above the point of zero charge pzc of each solid i e 2 5 for sio2 3 6 for mno2 and 7 5 9 for al2o3 and iron oxides sverjensky and sahai 1996 sahai and sverjensky 1997 cristiano et al 2011 both ca pka1 3 1 pka2 4 6 and the surface are negatively charged as the ph increased the surface becomes more negatively charged resulting in an increase in repulsion between ca and the surface and therefore a decrease in ca adsorption in the ph range between pka1 and pzc the negatively charged ca molecule would be attracted to the positively charge surface at ph pka1 the ca molecules that are negatively charged would be electrostatically attracted to the positively charged surface whereas the ca molecules that are neutrally charged could have some affinity towards the surface due to the non specific interaction i e hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction overall the results described above indicate that the groundwater ph and the geology of the subsurface could have significant influence on the mobility of ca in the subsurface as well as the ability of activated s2o8 2 to destroy ca during isco 3 5 experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil in the homogeneous and heterogeneous experiments sections 3 2 and 3 3 the initial concentration of s2o8 2 was 1 mm 0 192 g l as s2o8 2 this concentration is relatively low compared to the concentrations of s2o8 2 solutions used in remedial systems which typically ranges between low and high tens of grams per liter of s2o8 2 once introduced into the subsurface s2o8 2 will be activated into so4 and oh by aquifer soil or by solutions containing dissolved metals or a strong base that are co injected with s2o8 2 s2o8 2 can also be activated in situ by heat via steam injection addition of h2o2 the decomposition of h2o2 liberates heat or electrical resistance heating tsitonaki et al 2010 reynolds 2014 with base activation the solution ph usually remains at above ph 10 whereas with the other activation techniques the solution ph can decrease to as low as ph 2 3 once the natural buffering capacity of the subsurface is depleted this is because the decomposition of each s2o8 2 molecule generates two h ions because ca adsorption is influenced by the solution ph figs 5 and 6 the fluctuation of ph in s2o8 2 based remedial systems can significantly affect the oxidative treatment of ca to further examine the utility of s2o8 2 for in situ treatment of ca the degradation of ca in reactors containing authentic samples of groundwater and aquifer soils was conducted a preliminary experiment conducted at 70 c showed that the combination of heat and matrix activations resulted in a rapid ph decrease to 2 and a 100 loss of ca due to adsorption within only 15 min data not shown as such all experiments with groundwater and aquifer soil were conducted at 22 1 c and not at elevated temperature as in the experiments with feiii ox in the matrix activated persulfate reactors as the decomposition of persulfate took place the solution ph dropped from 5 5 to 1 7 within the first 18 h of the experiment concurrently ca levels dropped below our detection limit 1 μm fig 7 however ca concentrations rebounded to near baseline conditions when the ph of the solution was adjusted back to ph 6 a similar ca concentration ph trend was observed in the subsequent 50 h with ca concentrations decreasing in the solution as the ph decreased but increasing again as the ph was raised this ca concentration trend is attributable to the ca adsorption on and desorption from the aquifer soils this hypothesis is supported by an adsorption test which revealed that all ca was associated with the aquifer soils at ph below 2 5 whereas over 90 ca remained in the solution at ph above 6 fig 8 in the reactors containing s2o8 2 the oxidation of ca did not occur to an appreciable extent fig 7 in fact only less than 3 of ca was oxidized after more than 95 of s2o8 2 was consumed e 0 003 neither adsorption nor oxidative transformation of ca occurred appreciably in the base activated s2o8 2 reactors fig 7b the adsorption of ca did not take place as the ph of the solution in these reactors was maintained at above 12 throughout the experiment whereas the lack of oxidative transformation is attributable to the radical scavenging by the aquifer soil surface the aquifer soil contained 4 g kg of organic carbon as well as by groundwater solutes such as co3 2 cl and dissolved organic matter 4 conclusions and implications for the remediation of ca by s2o8 2 based on the findings described above the following conclusions can be made about the in situ remediation of ca firstly due to the affinity of ca toward surfaces the groundwater ph and the geology of the subsurface could have a significant influence on the mobility of ca and the extent of the ca plume secondly activated persulfate can be used to oxidize ca however given the moderate reactivity of ca with so4 and oh radicals kso4 6 57 0 83 107 m 1s 1 and koh 8 71 0 17 107 m 1s 1 at 24 5 c the oxidation of ca will only occur appreciably when radical scavengers such as background solutes dissolved organic matter and co contaminants are not present in significant quantities thirdly in the presence of a surface adsorption is expected to be the predominant mechanism of ca removal under acidic conditions as such the disappearance of ca if observed following the injection of s2o8 2 should be carefully scrutinized because such disappearance could be the result of adsorption rather than oxidative transformation the adsorption of ca on aquifer soils can be particularly significant in systems with low ph buffering capacity where the ph can drop dramatically as s2o8 2 decomposes when adsorption is the primary removal mechanism the concentration of ca in the groundwater is expected to rebound once ph increases and desorption starts to occur while monitoring the concentration of cl in the groundwater may help determine if oxidative transformation is occurring since the transformation of ca generates cl it will be difficult to detect changes in systems containing a high concentration of background cl fourthly the transformation of ca could take place in systems where the solution ph remains neutral throughout the treatment such as in systems containing excess buffering capacity e g fig 3b however such systems will likely contain high concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate which can compete with ca for oh and so4 finally under alkaline conditions typical of remedial systems in which s2o8 2 is activated by a base ca would remain in the solution and would be available for reacting with oh and so4 however as in the circumneutral systems the ca transformation rate and efficiency are expected to be low due to the scavenging of the radicals by aquifer soils and the solutes present in the groundwater when s2o8 2 is deemed to be ineffective other remedial options for ca could potentially be in situ transformation by a strong reductant e g zero valent iron or adsorptive ex situ treatment i e pump and treat the ability of zero valent iron
