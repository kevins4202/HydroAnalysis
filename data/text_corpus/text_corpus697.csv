3485,this study investigated the variability of intermittency with dry spells delineated using various definitions based on fixed minimum rainfall thresholds dynamic thresholds using daily evapotranspiration rates accumulated rainfall thresholds or detrimental climatic conditions that coincided with consecutive dry spell days the different spell definitions clearly effected the magnitude and timing of the average and extreme behaviour of the spell lengths for a temperate climate in central north europe although high synchronicity for dry spells was found for some definitions detected dry spells frequently fell into very different time periods which was particularly pronounced for the annual maximum spells it was concluded that there is not a common or correct dry spell definition but that any intermittency analysis requires a clear definition of the purpose of the study a priori whether it is zero rainfall or requirements for plant water supplies rainwater harvesting or pollution control the spell definition must be set accordingly similarly there can be no consistent definition for a long or rare dry spell besides the effects of the geographic setting the absolute differences between spell definitions are larger than differences due to various return intervals keywords intermittency dry spells flash droughts climatic circulation patterns 1 introduction analysing rainfall variability is a core task for hydrological science whereas the analysis of intermittency that is dry spells with minimal or no rain between rain events is often neglected schleiss smith 2016 intermittency analysis leans on the findings of croston 1972 who suggested dividing series that contain many continuous sections of zero values interspersed by occasional non zero values into two entities which are likely to exhibit very different behaviours in this study we investigate intermittency variability by examining dry spells as defined by various definitions currently the terminology and principles for intermittency analysis are poorly defined with no consistent definitions for threshold values or minimum and maximum dry spell lengths the lack of definitions is partly due to the variable nature of dry spell dynamics which depend highly on regional climatology topography and orography and prevailing atmospheric circulation patterns here it is to differentiate if dry spell studies refer to the analysis of variations of long dry periods outside or inside monsoon seasons for example the dry spell change studies by bichet and diedhiou 2018 or by cunningham 2020 in the monsoon or rainy seasons in the west african sahel and in southern brazil respectively dry spell studies in temperate or transitional regions which are not characterised by distinct monsoon seasons may focus either on the dry summer seasons or wet winter seasons as the studies in the mediterranean region by caloiero and coscarelli 2020 and in spain by raymonds et al 2016 the study by oikonomou et al 2010 has stressed the importance of orography for the generation of prolonged dry spells over greece as diverse the effects of regional climatology and orography on dry spell delineation are the corresponding atmospheric conditions and weather regimes that prevail during prolonged dry spells with a tendency of reinforced anticyclonic conditions or centre of high pressure high zones as reported in the studies of raymond et al 2018 and tramblay hertig 2017 confusion regarding dry spell definitions is also partly due to different mechanistic understandings of what a dry spell might entail the plainest meaning of a dry spell in a physical sense is a string of consecutive days with zero rainfall other interpretations may include days in which daily rainfall is less than the depression storage and interception loss or the potential daily evapotranspiration which controls plant water availability rivoire et al 2019 dry spells may also consider the accumulation time for contaminants on urban surfaces thus determining the first flush concentrations of pollutants from sealed urban surfaces into the drainage and river networks if the end of a dry spell coincides with a large rainfall event that generates significant overland flow schiff et al 2016 pitt et al 2004a b finally a dry spell may be considered equivalent to drought conditions if either the dry spell has an unusually long duration or begins during a period that was already characterised by prolonged rainfall deficit or coincided with other extreme climatic conditions such as high temperature manning et al 2019 or evapotranspiration rates that could lead to flash drought conditions otkin et al 2018 as diverse as this mechanistic understanding of dry spells is the threshold methods employed to delineate dry spells are just as diverse recent dry spell studies often used a fixed daily rainfall threshold of 0 1 mm to account for measurement errors e g breinl et al 2020 caloiero and coscarelli 2020 or pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 or 1 mm to distinguish days with significant precipitation e g zolina et al 2013 bichet and diedhiou 2018 rivoire et al 2019 others analysed in parallel the dry spell characteristics for different daily rainfall thresholds which varied between 0 1 and 10 mm day serra et al 2014 lana et al 2008 sirangelo et al 2019 to incorporate varying degrees of interception loss rivoire et al 2019 employed a time varying threshold estimated from reference evapotranspiration to account for rainfall losses as a function of atmospheric evaporation demand besides the analysis of hot dry spells by manning et al 2019 little is known on dry spells as a function of concurrent climatic extreme conditions recent dry spell studies have evaluated the annual and seasonal time trends in the number average length average maximum length and derivation of return periods of dry spells with a strong regional focus e g sirangelo et al 2019 pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 or for large land masses in europe serra et al 2014 zolina et al 2013 russia ye 2018 or globally breinl et al 2020 currently no study is available that analyse the timing and magnitude of dry spells as a function of different spell definitions in temperate central europe which is characterised by a homogenous rain distribution throughout the year this study examines how different definitions of dry spells affected the magnitude and timing of the detected spells and which prevailing atmospheric circulation patterns or concurrent climatic extremes co occurred it is hypothesised that dry spells of different definitions do not co occur per se in time to answer these questions this study developed methods that derived dry spells using various definitions and compared their distributions and synchronicity this included special types of dry spells that co occurred with particularly adverse climatic extremes at the beginning during or at the end of dry spells resulting in detrimental conditions related to water availability flash drought conditions or pollution transport additionally this study evaluated the prevailing circulation patterns during the dry spells the methods considered the period 1921 2020 at the saecular station in potsdam known for its optimal and consistent climate data coverage for the entire period in central east germany which is a temperate region characterised by homogeneous rainfall distribution throughout the year and no recurrent seasonal dry periods 2 methods 2 1 fixed and variable threshold definitions for dry spells dry spells are commonly defined as a period of consecutive days during which the daily rain total is below a fixed or variable threshold in this study we extended the common definition using certain accumulated thresholds and special dry spell definitions fig 1 as follows first five fixed daily rainfall thresholds of 0 0 1 1 2 and 5 mm were used to filter small to medium rainfall events as was done e g in the studies by lana et al 2008 cindric 2010 or sirangelo et al 2019 second two thresholds using a fixed threshold of 1 mm with an additional accumulated threshold of 5 mm or 10 mm over three consecutive days to mark the end of the dry spell were employed the accumulated thresholds were introduce as a measure to avoid the misidentification of an entire period of wet days as a long dry spell for the 5 mm fixed threshold third a dynamic time varying threshold estimated from the daily grass reference evapotranspiration et0 as previously employed by rivoire et al 2019 was employed which considered that significantly more water evaporates during days with large atmospheric demand with values reaching up to 7 mm per day for the dynamic et0 threshold a dry spell ended when the daily rainfall was larger than the daily et0 the r package evapotranspiration by guo et al 2020 was used to calculate et0 with the function et penmanmonteith fourth three new special dry spells definitions were stipulated a long dry spell alone might not be a calamity however if it co occurs with other adverse climatic extremes a single dry spell may cause exceptionally severe drought or water stress conditions otkin et al 2018 mo lettenmaier 2016 or result in increased urban pollution transport pitt et al 2004a b because of the long period of contaminant accumulation on sealed surfaces the first special dry spell definition addresses severe drought conditions which may arise when the dry spell commences during a period of rainfall deficit which we quantified with the daily antecedent precipitation index api heggen 2001 the api was preferred over other commonly used drought indicators such as the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 due to mismatched time resolutions monthly rainfall deficit but daily identification of dry spells the api is a running daily measure of recent moisture levels based on the rainfall that occurred over preceding weeks or days thus estimating moisture conditions or the wetness of a catchment based on previous rainfall amounts the api is calculated with a simple mapping equation describing either decline of moisture conditions of each day without rainfall or increase of moisture conditions if rainfall occurred as a function of moisture condition from the previous day apid k api d 1 pd where k is an empirical decay factor set to 0 95 after hill et al 2014 and pd is the rainfall for day d heggen 2001 fedora beschta 1989 the dry spell with rainfall deficit at the start is defined with api values below the 20th percentile of all api values 1921 2020 on the first day of the dry spell the second special dry spell definition addresses flash drought conditions which may arise if an above normal number of heat days occurs during a dry spell a heat day is defined here as a day with a maximum temperature above the 95th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution for a 10 day window centred on that day which was calculated using the r cran package heatwaver by schlegel and smit 2018 the third special dry spell definition addresses a particularly large pollution transport occurrence that may arise when a long dry spell called accumulation time in drainage terminology pitt et al 2004a b is followed by a large rain event within three days after the end of the dry spell resulting in a large first flush of contaminants from sealed surfaces toward surface waters a large rainfall event that could generate substantial overland flow was defined as a daily rainfall sum larger than 20 mm as derived from the recent study on urban pluvial flooding by guierreiro et al 2017 the occurrence of all three special dry spells was evaluated for a fixed daily rainfall threshold of 1 mm variant 3 2 2 climate data and the study area the time series data from the synoptic weather station in potsdam 52 3812 n 13 0622 e 81 m above mean sea level were used to compare the definitions for a one hundred year period 1921 2020 the station is located on top of the telegraphenberg in a suburban portion of potsdam approximately 35 km southwest of berlin in central east germany the region is characterised by homogenous seasonal rainfall wherein all months generate substantial rainfall with slightly higher values in the months may to august and lower values in february to april minimal and maximal monthly rain of 37 mm in april and 66 mm in july respectively fig 2 a moreover no specific months or seasons are characterised by extended dry spells annual rainfall shows no trend over the last 100 years as calculated with the mann kendall test p 0 81 s 79 calculated with the wql package in r cran although a recent reduction in spring rain has been reported for the region ionita et al 2020 the station is part of the saecular station in potsdam which has used the same monitoring practices since 1893 and is renowned for its high data consistency for a detailed site description see fenner et al 2019 daily rainfall sums were used to delineate the dry spells daily maximum and minimum temperature and average humidity sunshine duration cloud cover and wind data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration with the r cran package evapotranspiration by guo et al 2020 an r cran script was developed to identify the yearly monthly and long dry spells using different definitions and is available from the author the selected station at potsdam did not include missing rainfall values however for most climate stations adequate treatment of missing values is considered critical to avoid overestimating dry spells in the development of the r cran script particular attention was given to missing values as data gaps could be erroneously identified as dry spells rather than replacing missing values with zero all data values between a missing value and the next rainfall event would be set to na excluded from the gap identification process and clearly marked in any visualisations for clarity the analysis and method development are presented for only one station the analysis of spatial variations in the timing and magnitude of dry spells are beyond the scope of this study 2 3 derivation of long dry spells as no formal definition exists for long dry spells the annual maximum amax dry spells were used to assess differences in long dry spell identification between the threshold variants we decided against a percentile approach as the large number of very short dry spells was likely to bias a coherent mapping across different spell definitions an additional way of identifying long and infrequent dry spells is examining dry spells with large return periods dry spell return periods were derived based on pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 who applied the extreme values theory to express probability in terms of the return period t x which for a particular value of x is the average interval in years in which the extreme value reaches or exceeds x only once the return period is calculated using t n 1 m where n is the number of years and m is the rank of the observed dry spells when arranged in descending order 2 4 circulation patterns the timing of the dry spells and circulation patterns was assessed for all threshold variants circulation patterns describe the atmospheric processes that link large scale atmospheric conditions with near surface climate phenomena by summarising the wind direction humidity pressure and thermal properties of air masses ghada et al 2019 here the classification of circulation patterns for central europe as given in table 1 was based on hess and brezowsky 1977 fully described by gerstengarbe and werner 1990 circulation patterns are associated with typical rainfall regimes several patterns such as anticyclonic patterns or those with a centre of high pressure or zonal ridge over central europe are characterised by a below normal rainfall regime table 1 includes the typical rainfall regimes associated with each circulation pattern as derived by werner and gerstengarbe 2010 the entire duration of dry spells longer than seven days was assigned to the prevailing atmospheric patterns and associated rainfall regimes julian day to year segment plots were used to compare the timing of dry spells with different spell definitions 3 results 3 1 magnitude and timing of dry spells using different definitions to compare different dry spell definitions the derived dry spell distributions were compared with each other in terms of their magnitude considering average and maximum behaviour and in terms of their synchronicity large differences existed between the 11 definitions regarding span widths of lengths average and maximum lengths annual maximum amax lengths and corresponding empirical density distribution functions fig 3 these differences increased with increasing fixed thresholds and accumulated rain thresholds the dry spell distribution derived with the dynamic et0 threshold showed a similar magnitude to the 2 mm and slightly less to the 1 mm fixed threshold variant regarding magnitudes percentiles and density functions fig 3 a b the median values of dry spell durations varied from 9 fixed threshold of 0 and 0 1 mm to 17 days accumulated rain threshold of 10 mm the absolute maximum values varied considerably between 28 days special dry spell with low api and 141 days accumulated rain threshold of 10 mm the special dry spells were characterised by comparably low median values of 10 days moreover they occurred considerably less frequently than the other dry spell variants 39 176 special dry spells versus 811 1494 other dry spells over the entire study period large differences existed between the median amax values ranging from 15 to 52 days for the fixed threshold definitions 0 to 5 mm 34 to 52 days for the accumulated rain thresholds and 11 to 13 days for the three special dry spell definitions the amax derived using the dynamic et0 threshold was 27 days which was similar to that derived from the fixed thresholds of 1 mm 22 days and 2 mm 28 days additionally the 5 mm fixed threshold and the 10 mm accumulated rain threshold had strikingly similar amax empirical distribution functions as did the 2 mm fixed threshold and the dynamic et0 the average annual number of dry spells longer than 7 days varied between 1 and 15 decreasing to 0 to 3 for spells longer than 28 days fig 4 the largest differences were again between the smaller fixed threshold variants and the larger and accumulated ones the smaller the rainfall threshold the smaller the number of dry spells and dry spell days the three special dry spell variants showed significantly smaller numbers in all categories than the others the et0 dynamic threshold variant showed similar average numbers of spells and dry spell days as the 1 mm and 2 mm fixed threshold variants the total number of dry spells larger than 7 days was homogeneously distributed over all months fig 5 a b for all variants longer dry spells and annual maximum dry spells fig 5 c d occurred more frequently in march april may and october and less frequently in january february june and july for all variants however some of the longest dry spells were detected from december to january this behaviour was more pronounced for the 5 mm threshold and both accumulated rain variants there is some correspondence of the rather homogenous distribution of average monthly rainfall fig 2 and the total number of dry spells over the course of the year the relatively smaller monthly rainfall in march to may coincides with more frequent longer spells and the relatively larger summer rainfall with less frequent longer spells this correspondence is not so clear for the months october december and january with concurrent medium monthly rainfall rates fig 2 and long dry spells fig 6 visualises the synchronicity of the variants of all dry spells larger 7 days and the annual maximum dry spells with julian day to year segment plots to improve readability for a 20 year subset synchronicity is used here to describe the simultaneous occurrence of dry spells detected with different spell definitions over at a period of at least seven days they did not have to have the same length the plots show a large degree of synchronicity between many dry spells from all variants all through the year fig 6a whereby the variants with the lower minimum thresholds generally detected shorter dry spells but with the same timing as the other variants at the same time in many cases only one or a few of the variants detected dry spells while the other variants did not the inherent variability of synchronicity as indicated in fig 6a thus supporting the hypothesis that dry spells of different definitions frequently do not have the same timing extreme years are interesting such as the dry years 2003 and 2018 during which repeated dry spells were detected by all fixed and variable threshold definitions rarely none of the variants identified any dry spell over long periods for example in the summer of 2012 julian day 160 200 the annual maximum spells showed a considerably smaller degree of synchronicity fig 6b for 2000 2020 and appendix a for the remaining study period co occurrences of spells were counted for each year when there was an overlap of dry spell lengths from different definition of at least seven days in the last twenty years only one dry spell was detected by all variants in 2005 fig 6b during 1921 2020 only seven annual maximum values were detected by all variants appendix a simultaneous detection by fixed thresholds 1 and 2 mm and by fixed threshold 5 mm and accumulated threshold 10 mm occurred most often 61 and 68 times over 100 years respectively the et0 dynamic variant co occurred with the 1 mm and 2 mm variants in about 34 of 100 years fig 6b appendix a the three special dry spell variants 9 11 are a subset of variant 3 fixed threshold of 1 mm however comparing their temporal occurrences in the julian day plots in fig 7 very different dry spells become apparent a seasonal perspective becomes important the detected dry spells with low initial api values fig 7a occurred mostly during spring and late autumn but rarely during summer even for the particularly dry years 2003 and 2018 dry and hot spells fig 7b occurred in summer spring and early autumn the percentile approach also identifies unusually warm days outside the summer months with a noticeable frequency increase over the last 20 years dry spells followed by a large rain fig 7c were comparatively rare and only occurred during the spring and summer months with a gap between 1965 and 1990 3 2 analysis of the dominant atmospheric circulation patterns during long dry spells the dry spells derived using all 11 definitions can co occur with any atmospheric circulation patterns as were listed in table 1 of which dry spells with hm and bm patterns characterised by a high pressure centre over central europe were the most frequent 5 17 and 10 13 of dry spell days respectively fig 8 a followed by the westerly wa and wz patterns 3 6 5 and 3 13 and the scandinavian high with a ridge over central europe hfa 3 7 dry spells co occurred with all circulation patterns but the northern patterns na nz and nez and tm low over central europe co occurred rarely 2 of dry spell days the threshold variants showed a similar distribution across the circulation patterns except that the variants with smaller fixed thresholds of 0 and 0 1 mm occurred more frequently during the easterly patterns hfa sea sa and variants with higher threshold of 5 to 10 mm more frequently occurred during the westerly wz pattern than other variants the special dry spells with heat days and large rainstorms at the end were dominated by the trw the former was also dominated by swa and swz and the later by the hfz however all the other variants rarely co occurred the julian day to year segment plots of prevailing circulation patterns during dry spells fig 9 a indicate that most if not all dry spells were dominated by more than one circulation pattern rather than a single stable circulation pattern several circulation patterns commonly occurred successively during longer dry spells the two dominant high pressure patterns bm and hm with the highest percentage of dry spell days up to 13 17 highlighted in red and pink respectively in fig 9a co occurred in most seasons and with any variants but were hardly solely responsible for the longer dry spells approximately 34 to 77 of the dry spell days occurred during circulation patterns that are characterised by a below normal rainfall regime whereas 13 to 38 of dry spell days occurred during above normal rainfall patterns fig 8b and corresponding segment plot in fig 9b although composed of different circulation patterns long spells with below normal rainfall regimes can be identified during the spring 2007 2012 and 2020 or the autumn of 2011 and 2018 for example in contrast some long dry periods such as during summer 2008 occurred entirely during circulation patterns that are known to have above normal rainfall fig 9b again the special dry spell variants behaved differently than the threshold variants as they showed the highest relative occurrence in the rather unusual regime classes characterised by above normal and mixed rainfall patterns 4 discussion 4 1 magnitude and timing the dry spell analysis over 100 years showed that different dry spell definitions clearly affect the magnitude of derived spell lengths with substantial differences between definitions regarding their empirical distribution functions and dry spell maxima however some such as the 1 mm and 2 mm fixed thresholds and the dynamic et0 definitions showed relatively small differences in maximal and monthly spell distributions suggesting that evapotranspiration has little effect on dry spell lengths the latter contradicts a recent study by rivoire et al 2019 who found that a 1 mm fixed threshold strongly underestimated dry spells in comparison with a dynamic et0 threshold during the summer season they conducted their study in the mediterranean region which has a considerably warmer climate resulting in a larger impact from evapotranspiration processes during the summer months in a future study it might be of interest to evaluate if dry spells of the dynamic et0 definitions occur more often or become longer due to increasing frequency and severity of heat periods in the study region fenner et al 2019 previous studies where several fixed thresholds between 0 1 and 10 mm were investigated serra et al 2014 lana et al 2008 sirangelo et al 2019 had similar findings to this study and showed that large absolute differences existed in corresponding maximum dry spell spells and their return periods lana et al 2008 analysed the relationship between geographic setting and long dry spells derived using various threshold values whereas serra et al 2014 compared the trend behaviour of long spells as a function of threshold value however none of the studies analysed how different definitions affected the timing of individual spells over the year here a large synchronicity was found for dry spells of some definitions however the various definitions just as frequently detected dry spells during significantly different time periods especially for the annual maximum dry spell occurrences the discrepancies in magnitude and timing underline the fact that there is no common dry spell definition which could have been the case if the detected spells of all definitions were similar thus if there is no common definition there is also not a correct definition of dry spells hence all dry spell studies must define the purpose of the intermittency study first and then choose the relevant variant the purpose can be as diverse as investigating water supply for plants reliability of rainwater harvesting or accumulation time for contaminants and then define dry spells accordingly as all these intentions may be considered relevant environmental issues for the study area potsdam germany or central europe one may even conclude that there is not one but several correct dry spell definitions for any location however one must be cautious the results of any study for one purpose using one dry spell definition should be interpreted with care and are unlikely to be transferable to any other dry spell types and purposes 4 2 defining long dry spells there is no generally accepted definition for a long dry spell which is sensible considering the large variations in the maximum spells of different definitions as shown in fig 3c and the effects of differing geography on dry spell dynamics worldwide as e g reported in the studies by serra et al 2014 zolina et al 2013 or ye 2018 a more standardised approach may be appropriate for the derivation of long and rare spells by identifying the return periods similar to rainfall or discharge extremes for a specific geographic location such as was conducted by sirangelo et al 2019 for southern italy again different dry spell definitions show a larger quantitative impact on dry spell lengths than different return years fig 10 depicts the return periods empirically derived for the eleven dry spell definitions showing the expected large deviations for example for a return period of 20 years spell lengths differ between 17 and 95 days however the difference between various return periods for one definition is much smaller for example between 20 and 30 years variant 1 is 25 and 26 days and variant 7 is 95 and 110 days respectively 4 3 the special dry spells the three special dry spell distributions are essentially subsets of dry spells derived with the 1 mm fixed threshold value their analysis extends beyond intermittency toward a compound analysis in which one potentially detrimental climatic condition coincides or overlaps with another zscheischler et al 2020 hence the method employed here enables the identification and time series analysis of particularly hazardous dry spells which has rarely been done in the study by manning et al 2019 long dry spells that co occurred with extremely high temperatures were analysed for june to august using a copula based approach and were found to have increased throughout europe they found that dry periods were becoming hotter which was driven by rising summer temperatures that caused soil moisture drought events to begin rapidly and become more severe a similar trend was detected in this study with the number of hot dry spells increasing throughout the spring and summer over the last 20 years to the author s knowledge no other studies have evaluated any other compound dry spell events the list of special dry spells is far from complete and could be expanded in future studies to include dry spells with particularly high evapotranspiration rates thus including abnormal values not only for temperature but also other key climatic variables such as humidity radiation and wind additionally dry spells during key vegetation growth phases with high water demand or dry spells with wildfire onsets could be examined 4 4 dry spells and circulation patterns this study analysed the alignment between dry spells and their associated circulation patterns and rainfall regimes most dry spells of any definition were controlled by two typical anticyclonic conditions hm and bm which are favourable for dry spell occurrence as they are characterised by low amounts of water vapour due to non saturated air masses leading to clear skies and long rainfall intermittencies raymond et al 2018 however this study also showed that 20 to 40 of dry spell days co occurred with circulation patterns typically associated with above normal rainfall regimes most of them under cyclonic conditions werner and gerstengarbe 2010 table 1 and fig 8b the few studies that have investigated the atmospheric conditions that control dry spell patterns for europe concentrated mostly on the mediterranean region for example the studies by raymond et al 2018 and tramblay and hertig 2017 raymond et al 2018 found that long sequences of anticyclonic conditions are more favourable for long dry spells a finding that was only partly confirmed by this study however individual long dry spells were frequently detected that were associated not with one prevailing circulation pattern but with several sequential cyclonic anticyclonic and mixed conditions currently several studies such as werner et al 2008 hoy et al 2013 and caspary 2012 reported a significant recent increase in high pressure circulation patterns such as the hm and bm over central europe which may have considerable effects on dry spell dynamics in the near future 4 5 uncertainty and future directions the spell magnitude and timing for the different spell definitions are presented here for just one station however in a pilot study for this manuscript similar behaviour was detected for stations across germany with different climatic and orographic settings an analysis of multiple settings and definitions is pending and was considered too messy to be included in one article in the next step a thorough analysis is required to assess the spatio temporal synchronicity of long and special dry spells as well as trend analysis regarding their number severity and timing during the year the recent study by ye and fetzer 2019 already detected an significant increase in 7 day or longer dry spells in combination with hotter summers across continental russia a preliminary trend analysis in this study for the temperate region of europe showed a clear increase in dry spell events derived with the et0 dynamic threshold during summer and for heat day special spells however the other definitions showed no clear trend behaviour for this station 5 conclusions this study proposed various dry spell definitions which were not only based on fixed minimum rainfall thresholds but also considered a dynamic threshold based on daily evapotranspiration rates accumulated rainfall thresholds to mark the end of a spell or detrimental climatic conditions that coincided with dry days thus shifting the focus from intermittency toward a compound analysis julian day to year plots of delineated dry spells for different definitions allowed the assessment of spell synchronicity highlighted the specific seasonal occurrence of the special dry spells and identified the controlling circulation patterns and rainfall regimes different definitions had a clear effect on the magnitude and timing of the average and extreme spell lengths although large synchronicity between dry spells was found for some definitions dry spells often fell into noticeably different time periods which was particularly pronounced for the annual maximum spells therefore no common or correct dry spell definition exists as we did not find temporal patterns that most definitions followed similarly there can be no consistent definition for a long or rare dry spell besides the effects of geographic setting the absolute differences between different spell definitions were larger than differences due to various return intervals the synchronicity of dry spells with prevailing circulation patterns remains to some extent inconclusive although a majority of all spells co occurred with typical anticyclonic conditions known to produce long rainless periods a significant part of dry spells of any definition co occurred during circulation patterns characterised by above normal rainfall regimes or several sequential cyclonic and anticyclonic conditions hence there appears to be no simple relationship between one spell definition and prevailing atmospheric patterns in conclusion any intermittency analysis requires a clear definition of the purpose of the study a priori whether it is zero rainfall or requirements for plant water supply rainwater harvesting or pollution control the spell definition must be set accordingly moreover results derived with one dry spell definition are unlikely to be directly transferable to other intermittency studies carried out with another spell definition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the research was carried out within th

3485,this study investigated the variability of intermittency with dry spells delineated using various definitions based on fixed minimum rainfall thresholds dynamic thresholds using daily evapotranspiration rates accumulated rainfall thresholds or detrimental climatic conditions that coincided with consecutive dry spell days the different spell definitions clearly effected the magnitude and timing of the average and extreme behaviour of the spell lengths for a temperate climate in central north europe although high synchronicity for dry spells was found for some definitions detected dry spells frequently fell into very different time periods which was particularly pronounced for the annual maximum spells it was concluded that there is not a common or correct dry spell definition but that any intermittency analysis requires a clear definition of the purpose of the study a priori whether it is zero rainfall or requirements for plant water supplies rainwater harvesting or pollution control the spell definition must be set accordingly similarly there can be no consistent definition for a long or rare dry spell besides the effects of the geographic setting the absolute differences between spell definitions are larger than differences due to various return intervals keywords intermittency dry spells flash droughts climatic circulation patterns 1 introduction analysing rainfall variability is a core task for hydrological science whereas the analysis of intermittency that is dry spells with minimal or no rain between rain events is often neglected schleiss smith 2016 intermittency analysis leans on the findings of croston 1972 who suggested dividing series that contain many continuous sections of zero values interspersed by occasional non zero values into two entities which are likely to exhibit very different behaviours in this study we investigate intermittency variability by examining dry spells as defined by various definitions currently the terminology and principles for intermittency analysis are poorly defined with no consistent definitions for threshold values or minimum and maximum dry spell lengths the lack of definitions is partly due to the variable nature of dry spell dynamics which depend highly on regional climatology topography and orography and prevailing atmospheric circulation patterns here it is to differentiate if dry spell studies refer to the analysis of variations of long dry periods outside or inside monsoon seasons for example the dry spell change studies by bichet and diedhiou 2018 or by cunningham 2020 in the monsoon or rainy seasons in the west african sahel and in southern brazil respectively dry spell studies in temperate or transitional regions which are not characterised by distinct monsoon seasons may focus either on the dry summer seasons or wet winter seasons as the studies in the mediterranean region by caloiero and coscarelli 2020 and in spain by raymonds et al 2016 the study by oikonomou et al 2010 has stressed the importance of orography for the generation of prolonged dry spells over greece as diverse the effects of regional climatology and orography on dry spell delineation are the corresponding atmospheric conditions and weather regimes that prevail during prolonged dry spells with a tendency of reinforced anticyclonic conditions or centre of high pressure high zones as reported in the studies of raymond et al 2018 and tramblay hertig 2017 confusion regarding dry spell definitions is also partly due to different mechanistic understandings of what a dry spell might entail the plainest meaning of a dry spell in a physical sense is a string of consecutive days with zero rainfall other interpretations may include days in which daily rainfall is less than the depression storage and interception loss or the potential daily evapotranspiration which controls plant water availability rivoire et al 2019 dry spells may also consider the accumulation time for contaminants on urban surfaces thus determining the first flush concentrations of pollutants from sealed urban surfaces into the drainage and river networks if the end of a dry spell coincides with a large rainfall event that generates significant overland flow schiff et al 2016 pitt et al 2004a b finally a dry spell may be considered equivalent to drought conditions if either the dry spell has an unusually long duration or begins during a period that was already characterised by prolonged rainfall deficit or coincided with other extreme climatic conditions such as high temperature manning et al 2019 or evapotranspiration rates that could lead to flash drought conditions otkin et al 2018 as diverse as this mechanistic understanding of dry spells is the threshold methods employed to delineate dry spells are just as diverse recent dry spell studies often used a fixed daily rainfall threshold of 0 1 mm to account for measurement errors e g breinl et al 2020 caloiero and coscarelli 2020 or pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 or 1 mm to distinguish days with significant precipitation e g zolina et al 2013 bichet and diedhiou 2018 rivoire et al 2019 others analysed in parallel the dry spell characteristics for different daily rainfall thresholds which varied between 0 1 and 10 mm day serra et al 2014 lana et al 2008 sirangelo et al 2019 to incorporate varying degrees of interception loss rivoire et al 2019 employed a time varying threshold estimated from reference evapotranspiration to account for rainfall losses as a function of atmospheric evaporation demand besides the analysis of hot dry spells by manning et al 2019 little is known on dry spells as a function of concurrent climatic extreme conditions recent dry spell studies have evaluated the annual and seasonal time trends in the number average length average maximum length and derivation of return periods of dry spells with a strong regional focus e g sirangelo et al 2019 pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 or for large land masses in europe serra et al 2014 zolina et al 2013 russia ye 2018 or globally breinl et al 2020 currently no study is available that analyse the timing and magnitude of dry spells as a function of different spell definitions in temperate central europe which is characterised by a homogenous rain distribution throughout the year this study examines how different definitions of dry spells affected the magnitude and timing of the detected spells and which prevailing atmospheric circulation patterns or concurrent climatic extremes co occurred it is hypothesised that dry spells of different definitions do not co occur per se in time to answer these questions this study developed methods that derived dry spells using various definitions and compared their distributions and synchronicity this included special types of dry spells that co occurred with particularly adverse climatic extremes at the beginning during or at the end of dry spells resulting in detrimental conditions related to water availability flash drought conditions or pollution transport additionally this study evaluated the prevailing circulation patterns during the dry spells the methods considered the period 1921 2020 at the saecular station in potsdam known for its optimal and consistent climate data coverage for the entire period in central east germany which is a temperate region characterised by homogeneous rainfall distribution throughout the year and no recurrent seasonal dry periods 2 methods 2 1 fixed and variable threshold definitions for dry spells dry spells are commonly defined as a period of consecutive days during which the daily rain total is below a fixed or variable threshold in this study we extended the common definition using certain accumulated thresholds and special dry spell definitions fig 1 as follows first five fixed daily rainfall thresholds of 0 0 1 1 2 and 5 mm were used to filter small to medium rainfall events as was done e g in the studies by lana et al 2008 cindric 2010 or sirangelo et al 2019 second two thresholds using a fixed threshold of 1 mm with an additional accumulated threshold of 5 mm or 10 mm over three consecutive days to mark the end of the dry spell were employed the accumulated thresholds were introduce as a measure to avoid the misidentification of an entire period of wet days as a long dry spell for the 5 mm fixed threshold third a dynamic time varying threshold estimated from the daily grass reference evapotranspiration et0 as previously employed by rivoire et al 2019 was employed which considered that significantly more water evaporates during days with large atmospheric demand with values reaching up to 7 mm per day for the dynamic et0 threshold a dry spell ended when the daily rainfall was larger than the daily et0 the r package evapotranspiration by guo et al 2020 was used to calculate et0 with the function et penmanmonteith fourth three new special dry spells definitions were stipulated a long dry spell alone might not be a calamity however if it co occurs with other adverse climatic extremes a single dry spell may cause exceptionally severe drought or water stress conditions otkin et al 2018 mo lettenmaier 2016 or result in increased urban pollution transport pitt et al 2004a b because of the long period of contaminant accumulation on sealed surfaces the first special dry spell definition addresses severe drought conditions which may arise when the dry spell commences during a period of rainfall deficit which we quantified with the daily antecedent precipitation index api heggen 2001 the api was preferred over other commonly used drought indicators such as the standardised precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 due to mismatched time resolutions monthly rainfall deficit but daily identification of dry spells the api is a running daily measure of recent moisture levels based on the rainfall that occurred over preceding weeks or days thus estimating moisture conditions or the wetness of a catchment based on previous rainfall amounts the api is calculated with a simple mapping equation describing either decline of moisture conditions of each day without rainfall or increase of moisture conditions if rainfall occurred as a function of moisture condition from the previous day apid k api d 1 pd where k is an empirical decay factor set to 0 95 after hill et al 2014 and pd is the rainfall for day d heggen 2001 fedora beschta 1989 the dry spell with rainfall deficit at the start is defined with api values below the 20th percentile of all api values 1921 2020 on the first day of the dry spell the second special dry spell definition addresses flash drought conditions which may arise if an above normal number of heat days occurs during a dry spell a heat day is defined here as a day with a maximum temperature above the 95th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution for a 10 day window centred on that day which was calculated using the r cran package heatwaver by schlegel and smit 2018 the third special dry spell definition addresses a particularly large pollution transport occurrence that may arise when a long dry spell called accumulation time in drainage terminology pitt et al 2004a b is followed by a large rain event within three days after the end of the dry spell resulting in a large first flush of contaminants from sealed surfaces toward surface waters a large rainfall event that could generate substantial overland flow was defined as a daily rainfall sum larger than 20 mm as derived from the recent study on urban pluvial flooding by guierreiro et al 2017 the occurrence of all three special dry spells was evaluated for a fixed daily rainfall threshold of 1 mm variant 3 2 2 climate data and the study area the time series data from the synoptic weather station in potsdam 52 3812 n 13 0622 e 81 m above mean sea level were used to compare the definitions for a one hundred year period 1921 2020 the station is located on top of the telegraphenberg in a suburban portion of potsdam approximately 35 km southwest of berlin in central east germany the region is characterised by homogenous seasonal rainfall wherein all months generate substantial rainfall with slightly higher values in the months may to august and lower values in february to april minimal and maximal monthly rain of 37 mm in april and 66 mm in july respectively fig 2 a moreover no specific months or seasons are characterised by extended dry spells annual rainfall shows no trend over the last 100 years as calculated with the mann kendall test p 0 81 s 79 calculated with the wql package in r cran although a recent reduction in spring rain has been reported for the region ionita et al 2020 the station is part of the saecular station in potsdam which has used the same monitoring practices since 1893 and is renowned for its high data consistency for a detailed site description see fenner et al 2019 daily rainfall sums were used to delineate the dry spells daily maximum and minimum temperature and average humidity sunshine duration cloud cover and wind data were used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration with the r cran package evapotranspiration by guo et al 2020 an r cran script was developed to identify the yearly monthly and long dry spells using different definitions and is available from the author the selected station at potsdam did not include missing rainfall values however for most climate stations adequate treatment of missing values is considered critical to avoid overestimating dry spells in the development of the r cran script particular attention was given to missing values as data gaps could be erroneously identified as dry spells rather than replacing missing values with zero all data values between a missing value and the next rainfall event would be set to na excluded from the gap identification process and clearly marked in any visualisations for clarity the analysis and method development are presented for only one station the analysis of spatial variations in the timing and magnitude of dry spells are beyond the scope of this study 2 3 derivation of long dry spells as no formal definition exists for long dry spells the annual maximum amax dry spells were used to assess differences in long dry spell identification between the threshold variants we decided against a percentile approach as the large number of very short dry spells was likely to bias a coherent mapping across different spell definitions an additional way of identifying long and infrequent dry spells is examining dry spells with large return periods dry spell return periods were derived based on pérez sánchez and senent aparicio 2018 who applied the extreme values theory to express probability in terms of the return period t x which for a particular value of x is the average interval in years in which the extreme value reaches or exceeds x only once the return period is calculated using t n 1 m where n is the number of years and m is the rank of the observed dry spells when arranged in descending order 2 4 circulation patterns the timing of the dry spells and circulation patterns was assessed for all threshold variants circulation patterns describe the atmospheric processes that link large scale atmospheric conditions with near surface climate phenomena by summarising the wind direction humidity pressure and thermal properties of air masses ghada et al 2019 here the classification of circulation patterns for central europe as given in table 1 was based on hess and brezowsky 1977 fully described by gerstengarbe and werner 1990 circulation patterns are associated with typical rainfall regimes several patterns such as anticyclonic patterns or those with a centre of high pressure or zonal ridge over central europe are characterised by a below normal rainfall regime table 1 includes the typical rainfall regimes associated with each circulation pattern as derived by werner and gerstengarbe 2010 the entire duration of dry spells longer than seven days was assigned to the prevailing atmospheric patterns and associated rainfall regimes julian day to year segment plots were used to compare the timing of dry spells with different spell definitions 3 results 3 1 magnitude and timing of dry spells using different definitions to compare different dry spell definitions the derived dry spell distributions were compared with each other in terms of their magnitude considering average and maximum behaviour and in terms of their synchronicity large differences existed between the 11 definitions regarding span widths of lengths average and maximum lengths annual maximum amax lengths and corresponding empirical density distribution functions fig 3 these differences increased with increasing fixed thresholds and accumulated rain thresholds the dry spell distribution derived with the dynamic et0 threshold showed a similar magnitude to the 2 mm and slightly less to the 1 mm fixed threshold variant regarding magnitudes percentiles and density functions fig 3 a b the median values of dry spell durations varied from 9 fixed threshold of 0 and 0 1 mm to 17 days accumulated rain threshold of 10 mm the absolute maximum values varied considerably between 28 days special dry spell with low api and 141 days accumulated rain threshold of 10 mm the special dry spells were characterised by comparably low median values of 10 days moreover they occurred considerably less frequently than the other dry spell variants 39 176 special dry spells versus 811 1494 other dry spells over the entire study period large differences existed between the median amax values ranging from 15 to 52 days for the fixed threshold definitions 0 to 5 mm 34 to 52 days for the accumulated rain thresholds and 11 to 13 days for the three special dry spell definitions the amax derived using the dynamic et0 threshold was 27 days which was similar to that derived from the fixed thresholds of 1 mm 22 days and 2 mm 28 days additionally the 5 mm fixed threshold and the 10 mm accumulated rain threshold had strikingly similar amax empirical distribution functions as did the 2 mm fixed threshold and the dynamic et0 the average annual number of dry spells longer than 7 days varied between 1 and 15 decreasing to 0 to 3 for spells longer than 28 days fig 4 the largest differences were again between the smaller fixed threshold variants and the larger and accumulated ones the smaller the rainfall threshold the smaller the number of dry spells and dry spell days the three special dry spell variants showed significantly smaller numbers in all categories than the others the et0 dynamic threshold variant showed similar average numbers of spells and dry spell days as the 1 mm and 2 mm fixed threshold variants the total number of dry spells larger than 7 days was homogeneously distributed over all months fig 5 a b for all variants longer dry spells and annual maximum dry spells fig 5 c d occurred more frequently in march april may and october and less frequently in january february june and july for all variants however some of the longest dry spells were detected from december to january this behaviour was more pronounced for the 5 mm threshold and both accumulated rain variants there is some correspondence of the rather homogenous distribution of average monthly rainfall fig 2 and the total number of dry spells over the course of the year the relatively smaller monthly rainfall in march to may coincides with more frequent longer spells and the relatively larger summer rainfall with less frequent longer spells this correspondence is not so clear for the months october december and january with concurrent medium monthly rainfall rates fig 2 and long dry spells fig 6 visualises the synchronicity of the variants of all dry spells larger 7 days and the annual maximum dry spells with julian day to year segment plots to improve readability for a 20 year subset synchronicity is used here to describe the simultaneous occurrence of dry spells detected with different spell definitions over at a period of at least seven days they did not have to have the same length the plots show a large degree of synchronicity between many dry spells from all variants all through the year fig 6a whereby the variants with the lower minimum thresholds generally detected shorter dry spells but with the same timing as the other variants at the same time in many cases only one or a few of the variants detected dry spells while the other variants did not the inherent variability of synchronicity as indicated in fig 6a thus supporting the hypothesis that dry spells of different definitions frequently do not have the same timing extreme years are interesting such as the dry years 2003 and 2018 during which repeated dry spells were detected by all fixed and variable threshold definitions rarely none of the variants identified any dry spell over long periods for example in the summer of 2012 julian day 160 200 the annual maximum spells showed a considerably smaller degree of synchronicity fig 6b for 2000 2020 and appendix a for the remaining study period co occurrences of spells were counted for each year when there was an overlap of dry spell lengths from different definition of at least seven days in the last twenty years only one dry spell was detected by all variants in 2005 fig 6b during 1921 2020 only seven annual maximum values were detected by all variants appendix a simultaneous detection by fixed thresholds 1 and 2 mm and by fixed threshold 5 mm and accumulated threshold 10 mm occurred most often 61 and 68 times over 100 years respectively the et0 dynamic variant co occurred with the 1 mm and 2 mm variants in about 34 of 100 years fig 6b appendix a the three special dry spell variants 9 11 are a subset of variant 3 fixed threshold of 1 mm however comparing their temporal occurrences in the julian day plots in fig 7 very different dry spells become apparent a seasonal perspective becomes important the detected dry spells with low initial api values fig 7a occurred mostly during spring and late autumn but rarely during summer even for the particularly dry years 2003 and 2018 dry and hot spells fig 7b occurred in summer spring and early autumn the percentile approach also identifies unusually warm days outside the summer months with a noticeable frequency increase over the last 20 years dry spells followed by a large rain fig 7c were comparatively rare and only occurred during the spring and summer months with a gap between 1965 and 1990 3 2 analysis of the dominant atmospheric circulation patterns during long dry spells the dry spells derived using all 11 definitions can co occur with any atmospheric circulation patterns as were listed in table 1 of which dry spells with hm and bm patterns characterised by a high pressure centre over central europe were the most frequent 5 17 and 10 13 of dry spell days respectively fig 8 a followed by the westerly wa and wz patterns 3 6 5 and 3 13 and the scandinavian high with a ridge over central europe hfa 3 7 dry spells co occurred with all circulation patterns but the northern patterns na nz and nez and tm low over central europe co occurred rarely 2 of dry spell days the threshold variants showed a similar distribution across the circulation patterns except that the variants with smaller fixed thresholds of 0 and 0 1 mm occurred more frequently during the easterly patterns hfa sea sa and variants with higher threshold of 5 to 10 mm more frequently occurred during the westerly wz pattern than other variants the special dry spells with heat days and large rainstorms at the end were dominated by the trw the former was also dominated by swa and swz and the later by the hfz however all the other variants rarely co occurred the julian day to year segment plots of prevailing circulation patterns during dry spells fig 9 a indicate that most if not all dry spells were dominated by more than one circulation pattern rather than a single stable circulation pattern several circulation patterns commonly occurred successively during longer dry spells the two dominant high pressure patterns bm and hm with the highest percentage of dry spell days up to 13 17 highlighted in red and pink respectively in fig 9a co occurred in most seasons and with any variants but were hardly solely responsible for the longer dry spells approximately 34 to 77 of the dry spell days occurred during circulation patterns that are characterised by a below normal rainfall regime whereas 13 to 38 of dry spell days occurred during above normal rainfall patterns fig 8b and corresponding segment plot in fig 9b although composed of different circulation patterns long spells with below normal rainfall regimes can be identified during the spring 2007 2012 and 2020 or the autumn of 2011 and 2018 for example in contrast some long dry periods such as during summer 2008 occurred entirely during circulation patterns that are known to have above normal rainfall fig 9b again the special dry spell variants behaved differently than the threshold variants as they showed the highest relative occurrence in the rather unusual regime classes characterised by above normal and mixed rainfall patterns 4 discussion 4 1 magnitude and timing the dry spell analysis over 100 years showed that different dry spell definitions clearly affect the magnitude of derived spell lengths with substantial differences between definitions regarding their empirical distribution functions and dry spell maxima however some such as the 1 mm and 2 mm fixed thresholds and the dynamic et0 definitions showed relatively small differences in maximal and monthly spell distributions suggesting that evapotranspiration has little effect on dry spell lengths the latter contradicts a recent study by rivoire et al 2019 who found that a 1 mm fixed threshold strongly underestimated dry spells in comparison with a dynamic et0 threshold during the summer season they conducted their study in the mediterranean region which has a considerably warmer climate resulting in a larger impact from evapotranspiration processes during the summer months in a future study it might be of interest to evaluate if dry spells of the dynamic et0 definitions occur more often or become longer due to increasing frequency and severity of heat periods in the study region fenner et al 2019 previous studies where several fixed thresholds between 0 1 and 10 mm were investigated serra et al 2014 lana et al 2008 sirangelo et al 2019 had similar findings to this study and showed that large absolute differences existed in corresponding maximum dry spell spells and their return periods lana et al 2008 analysed the relationship between geographic setting and long dry spells derived using various threshold values whereas serra et al 2014 compared the trend behaviour of long spells as a function of threshold value however none of the studies analysed how different definitions affected the timing of individual spells over the year here a large synchronicity was found for dry spells of some definitions however the various definitions just as frequently detected dry spells during significantly different time periods especially for the annual maximum dry spell occurrences the discrepancies in magnitude and timing underline the fact that there is no common dry spell definition which could have been the case if the detected spells of all definitions were similar thus if there is no common definition there is also not a correct definition of dry spells hence all dry spell studies must define the purpose of the intermittency study first and then choose the relevant variant the purpose can be as diverse as investigating water supply for plants reliability of rainwater harvesting or accumulation time for contaminants and then define dry spells accordingly as all these intentions may be considered relevant environmental issues for the study area potsdam germany or central europe one may even conclude that there is not one but several correct dry spell definitions for any location however one must be cautious the results of any study for one purpose using one dry spell definition should be interpreted with care and are unlikely to be transferable to any other dry spell types and purposes 4 2 defining long dry spells there is no generally accepted definition for a long dry spell which is sensible considering the large variations in the maximum spells of different definitions as shown in fig 3c and the effects of differing geography on dry spell dynamics worldwide as e g reported in the studies by serra et al 2014 zolina et al 2013 or ye 2018 a more standardised approach may be appropriate for the derivation of long and rare spells by identifying the return periods similar to rainfall or discharge extremes for a specific geographic location such as was conducted by sirangelo et al 2019 for southern italy again different dry spell definitions show a larger quantitative impact on dry spell lengths than different return years fig 10 depicts the return periods empirically derived for the eleven dry spell definitions showing the expected large deviations for example for a return period of 20 years spell lengths differ between 17 and 95 days however the difference between various return periods for one definition is much smaller for example between 20 and 30 years variant 1 is 25 and 26 days and variant 7 is 95 and 110 days respectively 4 3 the special dry spells the three special dry spell distributions are essentially subsets of dry spells derived with the 1 mm fixed threshold value their analysis extends beyond intermittency toward a compound analysis in which one potentially detrimental climatic condition coincides or overlaps with another zscheischler et al 2020 hence the method employed here enables the identification and time series analysis of particularly hazardous dry spells which has rarely been done in the study by manning et al 2019 long dry spells that co occurred with extremely high temperatures were analysed for june to august using a copula based approach and were found to have increased throughout europe they found that dry periods were becoming hotter which was driven by rising summer temperatures that caused soil moisture drought events to begin rapidly and become more severe a similar trend was detected in this study with the number of hot dry spells increasing throughout the spring and summer over the last 20 years to the author s knowledge no other studies have evaluated any other compound dry spell events the list of special dry spells is far from complete and could be expanded in future studies to include dry spells with particularly high evapotranspiration rates thus including abnormal values not only for temperature but also other key climatic variables such as humidity radiation and wind additionally dry spells during key vegetation growth phases with high water demand or dry spells with wildfire onsets could be examined 4 4 dry spells and circulation patterns this study analysed the alignment between dry spells and their associated circulation patterns and rainfall regimes most dry spells of any definition were controlled by two typical anticyclonic conditions hm and bm which are favourable for dry spell occurrence as they are characterised by low amounts of water vapour due to non saturated air masses leading to clear skies and long rainfall intermittencies raymond et al 2018 however this study also showed that 20 to 40 of dry spell days co occurred with circulation patterns typically associated with above normal rainfall regimes most of them under cyclonic conditions werner and gerstengarbe 2010 table 1 and fig 8b the few studies that have investigated the atmospheric conditions that control dry spell patterns for europe concentrated mostly on the mediterranean region for example the studies by raymond et al 2018 and tramblay and hertig 2017 raymond et al 2018 found that long sequences of anticyclonic conditions are more favourable for long dry spells a finding that was only partly confirmed by this study however individual long dry spells were frequently detected that were associated not with one prevailing circulation pattern but with several sequential cyclonic anticyclonic and mixed conditions currently several studies such as werner et al 2008 hoy et al 2013 and caspary 2012 reported a significant recent increase in high pressure circulation patterns such as the hm and bm over central europe which may have considerable effects on dry spell dynamics in the near future 4 5 uncertainty and future directions the spell magnitude and timing for the different spell definitions are presented here for just one station however in a pilot study for this manuscript similar behaviour was detected for stations across germany with different climatic and orographic settings an analysis of multiple settings and definitions is pending and was considered too messy to be included in one article in the next step a thorough analysis is required to assess the spatio temporal synchronicity of long and special dry spells as well as trend analysis regarding their number severity and timing during the year the recent study by ye and fetzer 2019 already detected an significant increase in 7 day or longer dry spells in combination with hotter summers across continental russia a preliminary trend analysis in this study for the temperate region of europe showed a clear increase in dry spell events derived with the et0 dynamic threshold during summer and for heat day special spells however the other definitions showed no clear trend behaviour for this station 5 conclusions this study proposed various dry spell definitions which were not only based on fixed minimum rainfall thresholds but also considered a dynamic threshold based on daily evapotranspiration rates accumulated rainfall thresholds to mark the end of a spell or detrimental climatic conditions that coincided with dry days thus shifting the focus from intermittency toward a compound analysis julian day to year plots of delineated dry spells for different definitions allowed the assessment of spell synchronicity highlighted the specific seasonal occurrence of the special dry spells and identified the controlling circulation patterns and rainfall regimes different definitions had a clear effect on the magnitude and timing of the average and extreme spell lengths although large synchronicity between dry spells was found for some definitions dry spells often fell into noticeably different time periods which was particularly pronounced for the annual maximum spells therefore no common or correct dry spell definition exists as we did not find temporal patterns that most definitions followed similarly there can be no consistent definition for a long or rare dry spell besides the effects of geographic setting the absolute differences between different spell definitions were larger than differences due to various return intervals the synchronicity of dry spells with prevailing circulation patterns remains to some extent inconclusive although a majority of all spells co occurred with typical anticyclonic conditions known to produce long rainless periods a significant part of dry spells of any definition co occurred during circulation patterns characterised by above normal rainfall regimes or several sequential cyclonic and anticyclonic conditions hence there appears to be no simple relationship between one spell definition and prevailing atmospheric patterns in conclusion any intermittency analysis requires a clear definition of the purpose of the study a priori whether it is zero rainfall or requirements for plant water supply rainwater harvesting or pollution control the spell definition must be set accordingly moreover results derived with one dry spell definition are unlikely to be directly transferable to other intermittency studies carried out with another spell definition declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the research was carried out within th

3486,the duration of the seasonal snowpack determines numerous aspects of the water cycle ecology and the economy in cold and mountainous regions and is a balance between the magnitude of accumulated snow and the rate of melt the contribution of each component has not been well quantified under contrasting topography and climatological conditions although this may provide useful insights into how snow cover duration could respond to climate change here we examined the contribution of the annual peak snow water equivalent swe and the seasonal melt rate to define the duration of the snowpack over temperate mountains using snow data for mountain areas with different climatological characteristics across the iberian peninsula we used a daily snowpack database for the period 1980 2014 over iberia to derive the seasonal peak swe melt rate and season snow cover duration the influence of peak swe and melt rates on seasonal snow cover duration was estimated using a stepwise linear model approach the stepwise linear models showed high r adjusted values average r adjusted 0 7 without any clear dependence on the elevation or geographical location in general the peak swe influenced the snow cover duration over all of the mountain areas analysed to a greater extent than the melt rates 89 1 89 2 81 6 93 2 and 95 5 in the areas for the cantabrian central iberian pyrenees and sierra nevada mountain ranges respectively at these colder sites the melt season occurs mostly in the spring and tends to occur very fast in contrast the areas where the melt rates dominated snow cover duration were located systematically at lower elevations due to the high interannual variability in the occurrence of annual peak swe in winter or early spring yielding highly variable melt rates however in colder sites the melt season occurs mostly in spring and it is very fast in most of the years the results highlight the control that the seasonal precipitation patterns in combination with temperature exert on the seasonal snow cover duration by influencing the peak swe and suggest a future increased importance of melt rates as temperatures increase despite the high climatological variability of the iberian mountain ranges the results showed a consistent behaviour along the different mountain ranges indicating that the methods and results may be transferrable to other temperate mountain areas of the world keywords snowpack mountains peak swe snow cover duration melt rate 1 introduction snowpack quantity and snow cover duration determine the annual freshwater budget and its seasonalityfor mountain regions barnett et al 2005 in addition snow cover duration directly affects plant and animal phenology especially the timing and annual magnitude of forest growth as sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 demonstrated in iberia for the pinus uncinata forests of the pyrenees furthermore snow dictates the duration and success of winter tourism which is becoming one of the main sources of income for many mountain regions of the world gilaberte búrdalo et al 2017 steiger et al 2019 the snowpack over temperate mountain ranges exhibits unique characteristics compared with other mountain areas of the world despite the relatively mild winter temperatures the snowpack tends to be deeper than at higher latitudes it also exhibits rapid densification thus being an effective freshwater storage system fayad et al 2017 the snowpack has nearly isothermal conditions for most of the snow season receiving abundant incoming solar radiation due to the latitude of the temperate mountain ranges between 30 and 40 in the northern and southern hemispheres and high sublimation rates herrero and polo 2016 the snowpack exhibits a high interannual variability due to spatial differences in precipitation and large elevation gradients alonso gonzález et al 2020a 2020b as a consequence of their lack of cold content and their sensitivity to precipitation phase partitioning the snowpacks over temperate mountain ranges are highly vulnerable to the ongoing climate warming alonso gonzález et al 2020c evan and eisenman 2021 lópez moreno et al 2017a yilmaz et al 2019 a major risk of decline in snow cover duration over these temperate regions exists which endangers the availability of freshwater resources during the long dry months garcía ruiz et al 2011 all these changes are being observed across the iberian peninsula where its mountainous terrain leads to a well developed seasonal snowpack in various mountain ranges cantabrian central iberian pyrenees and sierra nevada mountain ranges alonso gonzález et al 2020b however the snowpack exhibits high variability in terms of duration and amount especially at the lower elevations such variability is explained by the high climatological diversity of the iberian mountain ranges and the seasonal synoptic conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020a snowpack magnitude which is often quantified by the peak snow water equivalent swe or accumulated swe fassnacht and lópez moreno 2020 strongly controls the amount of water available during the melting period however the duration of snow cover dictates many of the biochemical processes controlled by the snowpack such as soil temperature bender et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 microbial activity zhang et al 2014 vegetation growth sanmiguel vallelado et al 2019 and animal phenology robinson and merrill 2012 in addition the snow cover duration determines the seasonality of different hydrological processes such as soil moisture williams et al 2009 hydrograph depletion julander and clayton 2018 and the occurrence of rain on snow events morán tejeda et al 2016 snow cover duration can be more accurately derived from remote sensing products gascoin et al 2020 compared to swe or snow depth that require direct observations or modelling approaches painter et al 2016 revuelto et al 2016 thus it is important to study the relation between the snow cover and the amount of snow as it provides an interesting basis for future studies the duration of the snow cover over the ground at a given location and in a given year depends on the combination of the amount and timing of snowfall and the seasonal melt rate after the occurrence of peak swe harpold et al 2017 in other words the duration of the snow cover depends on the maximum amount of snow to be melted and the rate of said melt the quantification of the contribution of the two factors namely peak swe and melt rate is relevant in understanding the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover duration and more importantly to consider how climate change could impact snow cover duration at any given location previous research has revealed that the effect of temperature or precipitation on snow cover durations changes over space with a marked elevational pattern temperature is the main control at low elevations whereas the main control in terms of accumulation shifts to precipitation at high elevations morán tejeda et al 2013 sospedra alfonso and merryfield 2017 illustrating the correlation between faster melt rates and lower snow accumulations however if snow cover duration mostly depends on accumulated snow the response of snow cover duration to a climate warming will be strongly influenced by the seasonal timing of the precipitation the seasonal differences in projected precipitation changes and the timing of peak swe notably the projected changes in precipitation are highly uncertain in most mountainous areas nogués bravo et al 2008 if peak swe generally occurs at the end of the coldest period of the year the effect of warmer temperatures might be dampened conversely for locations where peak swe occurs later in the season because of snowfall during the spring caesar et al 2006 snow cover duration might be strongly affected by higher temperatures since the occurrence of rainfall will be much higher than snowfall lópez moreno et al 2020a in addition if melt rates dominate snow cover duration the latter will be controlled more by temperature changes in this case melt rates might be less intense as the climate warms due to an earlier occurrence of melting and thus less solar loading alonso gonzález et al 2020c musselman et al 2017 wu et al 2018 in the present study we use a long term 1980 2014 gridded snow database for the mountains of the iberian peninsula alonso gonzález et al 2018 the iberian peninsula exhibits large climatological variability with its mountain ranges being a good representation of the temperate mountains of the world to investigate whether seasonal snow cover duration interannual variability is controlled more by the amount of snow accumulation peak swe or by the intensity of the melt rate we tried to find differences among different analysed mountain ranges since they exhibit contrasting climatic and snow conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020b such differences may provide useful information to foresee how projected climate change might affect and with what uncertainty snow cover duration at different areas of temperate mountain ranges thereby helping to anticipate the related effects on different environmental and socioeconomic sectors 2 study area the iberian peninsula is located at the southwestern edge of europe its climatology is strongly influenced by its complex topography and proximity to both the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean covering a full transition from mediterranean to oceanic climates and therefore being one of the areas of europe with high climatological variability peel et al 2007 although some locations in iberia can receive large amounts of annual precipitation precipitation exhibits high interannual variability and iberia is generally considered a water scarce region moreover large areas of the peninsula are highly dependent on water resources from mountain areas and much of this water comes from the snowpack total precipitation varies from less than 300 mm yr 1 to more than 1500 mm yr 1 and may exceed 2500 mm yr 1 locally in specific locations palacios and de marcos 1998 in the mediterranean climate where most precipitation occurs during the winter months lópez moreno et al 2011 2017a the snowpack becomes critical because it breaks the strong seasonality of the available freshwater resources resulting in a better synchronization of the water availability with the high demand during the dry and warm season lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 atmospheric circulation controls the interannual variability of the precipitation trigo et al 2004 droughts are frequent and affect the streamflow of the main iberian basins lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 this large precipitation and streamflow variability makes iberia highly dependent on the water management and spain is one of the countries with the most hydrological regulation berga casafont 2003 snow is common over iberia including some snowfall events at lower elevations aran et al 2010 mora et al 2016 snowfalls are common every year over wide areas of iberia due to the presence of a central plateau with an average elevation of 650 m above sea level in addition there are five main mountain systems that exceed 2000 m a s l ranging from west to east across iberia two of them pyrenees and sierra nevada surpass 3000 m a s l fig 1 mountain ranges exhibit seasonal long lasting and deep snowpacks whose characteristics differ due to the climatological particularities of each region alonso gonzález et al 2020b specifically in iberia snow has important implications in different key features of the region including its hydrology lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2017 ecology sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 economy lasanta et al 2007 and risk management muntán et al 2009 3 data and methods we used a daily gridded snowpack database covering the entire iberian peninsula for the period from 1980 to 2014 alonso gonzález et al 2018 the database was developed using a regional atmospheric simulation garcía valdecasas ojeda et al 2017 from the weather research and forecast wrf model version 3 8 skamarock et al 2008 at a 10 km spatial resolution as the meteorological forcing for the factorial snow model fsm 1 0 essery 2015 given the coarse spatial resolution 10 km wrf outputs were corrected from the elevation of the native grid of the simulation to different elevation bands at 100 m intervals for each simulated grid cell using a combination of radiative barometric and psychrometric formulae as well as lapse rates thus the simulated 2 m temperature of the wrf was corrected using the standard air temperature lapse rate β 0 0065 k m 1 and the surface pressure was adjusted using the barometric formula the long wave radiation was estimated according to the stefan boltzmann law using an all sky conditions parametrization of the emissivity based on the relative humidity rh at the elevation of 700 mb to estimate the cloud cover the rh was projected by correcting the dew point temperature for the elevation both the rh and long wave radiation parametrizations have been widely used in the literature and have also been implemented in meteorological distribution models liston and elder 2006 finally the precipitation phase partitioning was calculated on the basis of the estimated temperature of the surface of the hydrometeors using the equations proposed by harder and pomeroy 2013 a detailed description of the mathematical formulae as well as a graphical scheme can be found in alonso gonzález et al 2018 to disaggregate the semi distributed fashion i e elevation bands distribution of the snowpack database we interpolated the snowpack series over a dem of 1 km resolution the distributed snow series over each objective cell of the 1 km dem was generated by the weighted average of eight neighbour cells in the nearest two elevation bands directly higher and lower the distance between each objective cell and four cells in the nearest two elevation bands inside the three dimensional space of the semi distributed database was used to generate the new series from the weighted average of the semi distributed series alonso gonzález et al 2018 compared the database with both remote sensing imagery and in situ observations of snow height hs and swe and illustrated the database s spatial and temporal consistency a comparison with modis gap filled snow cover products showed a mean absolute error of 6 07 and a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 76 in addition the available swe and hs series for the iberian peninsula were used to validate the intra annual patterns of accumulation at different percentiles with coheńs kappa value k greater than 0 6 the database has been used for different studies over iberia including climatology alonso gonzález et al 2020b 2020a hydrology morán tejeda et al 2019 and ecology sanmiguel vallelado et al 2019 an example of a time series of swe for a single cell red circle in fig 1 across different elevation bands retrieved from the database is shown in fig 2 to remove ephemeral snowpacks for any year we only considered snow as seasonal when more than 30 mm of swe remained for more than 30 consecutive days these thresholds were selected on the basis of sturm et al 1995 but were adapted to the study area on the basis of the snow climatology created by alonso gonzález et al 2020b this processing was performed for each season for each cell cells having less five snow season respecting the above mentioned criteria swe greater than 30 mm for more than 30 consecutive days where removed from the analysis for each year and for each cell in we calculated the peak swe mm the snow cover duration days and the seasonal melt rate mm day 1 the seasonal melt rate was computed in millimetres per day as the peak swe divided by the time from the date of peak swe to the date of the end of the snow season or snow disappearance the duration was defined as the number of days with continuous snow cover thus no early or late season accumulation and complete melt events were considered in addition in the rare case of a complete mid season melt the latest snow season was used to determine the relative influence of the peak swe and the melt rate independent variables to explain the duration of snow cover dependent variable fig 3 we used a backward stepwise linear regression model in the form d β 0 βp p βm m where β 0 is the y intercept βp is the coefficient associated with peak swe p and βm is the coefficient associated with the seasonal melt rate m since the regression was stepwise the best fitting independent variable i e either the peak swe or the melt rate was chosen first iteratively each variable was considered for removal addition on the basis of the variations of the akaike information criterion aic the coefficients were then standardized by multiplying the regression based coefficient by the ratio of the standard deviation of the dependent variable d by the standard deviation of the independent variable p or m providing a simple quantification of the weight of each independent variable on the duration of snow cover we then evaluated how βp and βm were distributed along the elevations in the main mountain ranges of iberia we then extracted the elevation values of the dem using the βp and βm values to evaluate the β coefficients variation with the elevation thus we studied the elevations where one of the β coefficients was greater than the other or only one variable was selected by the stepwise approach all the calculations were performed using the r programming language r core team 2020 at the supercomputing facilities of the spanish research council we use one location in the pyrenees as an example the same location indicated in fig 2 to illustrate the specific results and then provide the results of the distributed analyses over the iberian mountains 4 results and discussion the main temporal patterns and the relationship with elevation of the three snow indexes fig 4 can be exemplificated by a single cell of the pyrenees red dot in fig 1 peak swe exhibits noticeable temporal variability at all elevations but with a decrease with increasing elevation coefficient of variation cv of 0 48 0 30 and 0 23 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively this result is mainly attributed to the snowpacks in temperate regions being consistently close to the zero degree isotherm since they are highly sensitive to the precipitation partition phase fayad and gascoin 2020 thus the elevation ensures colder temperatures and more constant peak swe values which are mostly regulated by the precipitation which is why several studies have found the higher areas or colder locations of mountain ranges to be less affected by climate warming worldwide alonso gonzález et al 2020c marty et al 2017 matiu et al 2021 pierce and cayan 2013 sproles et al 2013 as in the case of peak swe an obvious relation exists between the duration of the snow cover and the elevation with longer durations at higher elevations fig 4 the interannual variability of the snow cover duration also decreases with increasing elevation cv of 0 33 0 11 and 0 09 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively in this particular example the melt rates showed a more complex spatial and temporal behaviour the lower cv for the snow cover duration compared with that for the peak swe might explain the inversions in the relation of the melt rates with the elevation in some particular years the seasons with thicker shallower snowpacks do not increase decrease linearly with the snow cover duration since the melt rates show different values as the snow season progresses on average the melt rates tend to increase with increasing elevation average of 14 1 19 5 and 19 0 mm day 1 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively in this particular example however this relation is not as clear as that observed for the peak swe and the snow cover duration this pattern occurs because an effective melt not only requires temperature warmer than 0 c but also a considerable increase in incoming solar radiation and decreased albedo at the end of the winter musselman et al 2017 at the sample location in the pyrenees figs 1 and 4 the β coefficients of the peak swe and melt rate as well as the adjusted r 2 of the stepwise regression model are correlated with the elevation fig 5 most likely due to local particularities of this specific location the peak swe exhibited a higher β coefficient than the melt rates at all elevation bands at the 1400 1800 and 2400 2900 m elevation bands the melt rate was not even included in the model by the stepwise algorithm as a predictor variable thus the model suggests that for this single cell example fig 4 the peak swe exerts greater control of the snow cover duration than the melt rates here the maximum explained variance of the model is found at low and medium elevations and the overall evolution of adjusted r 2 follows the evolution of the β coefficients of peak swe with a negligible effect when the melt rate is also included in the model as a predictor variable we extended the previously methodology described for a single cell fig 5 to the all study area a large spatial variability is observed in the peak swe melt rate and the snow cover duration over iberia fig 6 with strong differences also observed within the same mountain ranges even at similar elevations as reported in previous studies alonso gonzález et al 2020b among the five main mountain ranges of iberia the pyrenees and cantabrian mountains receive the most snow with a maximum swe approaching 2000 mm and a snow cover duration as long as 290 days in the most favourable locations fig 6 by contrast the sierra nevada exhibited lower values when similar elevation bands were compared a complete description of the snow climatology and the differences between mountain ranges can be found in the work of alonso gonzález et al 2020b as expected the snow season duration and peak swe are mostly controlled by elevation in addition melt rates tend to be faster at the higher elevations fig 6 consistent with other studies that found faster melt rates occurring later in the snow season under conditions of greater incoming radiation musselman et al 2017 wu et al 2018 peak swe is more variable at lower than at higher elevation leading to very different melt rates having a significant influence on the snow cover duration the interannual cv estimated for the snow cover duration and peak swe follows a similar spatial pattern with a clear decrease with increasing elevation fig 6 this effect might be a consequence of the low values of each index low elevations that can lead to extremely large cv values however the preprocessing of the snow series where each snow season must meet the minimum accumulation and duration criteria prevents the standard deviation from being divided by small mean values differences in cv values were observed between the three snow indexes the cv values for the mean season duration were lower than for the peak swe whose cv values were in turn lower than those for the melt rates the stepwise models used to predict the snow cover duration from the peak swe and the melt rate showed an average coefficient of determination r 2 adjust of 0 5 the adjusted r 2 values of the models showed no clear dependence on the elevation or differences between mountain ranges although the highest determination coefficients were found in the band between 1500 and 2000 m a s l and the variability of the adjusted r 2 values tended to decrease with increasing elevation supplementary fig 1 this greater variability at the lower elevations was likely caused by the fact that there were more cases at the lower elevations in addition to a higher variability in the snow indexes focusing on the pyrenees modelling results showed that snow cover duration is more sensitive to peal swe than to melt rates fig 7 the peak swe was excluded by the stepwise approach fig 7 left panel in only 2 4 of the cells moreover considering the subset of cells where either peak swe and melt rate p m or only melt rate m were selected by the stepwise model melt rate β coefficients were higher than peak swe one in only 6 8 of the cases fig 7 right panel by contrast the cases where the model considered only the peak swe represented 35 6 of cells fig 7a increasing to 93 2 of cells when both indexes were included and the peak swe exhibited higher β coefficients fig 7 right panel in addition the cells where the melt rates exhibited a higher influence were concentrated at the lower elevations with an average elevation of 1180 m a s l in contrast with the 1740 m a s l elevation in the cells where the peak swe exhibited a higher β coefficient fig 7 right panel surprisingly despite the strongly contrasting climatological characteristics of the five iberian mountain ranges alonso gonzález et al 2020b this spatial pattern of the β coefficient of the peak swe β p and melt rate β m is similar over the other iberian mountain ranges table 1 and supplementary fig 2 slight differences are observed in the average elevation values as a consequence of the different hypsography of each range table 1 this finding is consistent with the results of similar studies developed in the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 where deeper snowpacks lead to longer snow seasons and higher melt rates thus the relative areas where the β m is higher than the β p decrease regularly from the lower iberian central and cantabrian ranges with 81 6 89 2 and 89 1 respectively to the higher pyrenees and sierra nevada with 93 2 and 95 5 respectively elevation mountain ranges independently from the elevation the accumulation i e peak swe dominates the snow cover duration however at the lower areas the melt rates increase its importance in controlling the snow cover duration this result is particularly relevant as the iberian snowpacks have shown contrasting behaviours due to the climatological variability of the iberian peninsula alonso gonzález et al 2020b thus this finding suggests that the results of the present study could be extrapolated to other regions of the planet at comparable latitudes where the peak swe is reached with a low cold content because the pattern remains similar over the different mountain ranges however snowpacks over high latitude sites may present different behaviours because of different partitioning of the energy and mass balance of the snowpacks including a completely different seasonal distribution of the incoming solar radiation combined with in general a shallower snowpack the greater dependency of the snow season duration on the peak swe than on the melt rate table 1 indicates that the precipitation is a mayor driver of the snow season duration as despite the whole energy balance has its own influence the peak swe is mostly controlled by precipitation especially at the higher elevations morán tejeda et al 2013 musselman et al 2021 at high elevation snow melts late in spring and the depletion curve rather steep as consequence of the rise of shortwave radiation at lower elevations melting occurs earlier and is a function of the date of peak swe thus the melt rates in the areas where the peak swe occurs earlier tends to be more variable than in the areas where the peak swe occurs latter i e the higher and colder areas despite most atmospheric models showing a high consensus to project a generalized warming the climate change projections show large disagreements and uncertainties about how the precipitation could evolve in the next decades kharin et al 2013 in addition the sensitivity to warming of the snow accumulation may be different even in areas with comparable climatological characteristics due to local effects lópez moreno et al 2017a the seasonal precipitation patterns will play a key role as the peak swe is affected by the winter and spring precipitation and the surface temperatures of the iberian peninsula are expected to increase similarly for the winter and spring seasons carvalho et al 2020 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 have reported differences in the future seasonal precipitation patterns of iberia estimated from high resolution atmospheric simulations extracted from the euro cordex project their results highlight the uncertainty of the projections to simulate the future evolution of the precipitation and the spatial variability of the accumulated precipitation changes nevertheless they show a general increase in the total winter precipitation of approximately 15 with a decrease as large as 20 in the spring total precipitation these results suggest that the areas where the peak swe is controlled by the total winter precipitation warmer areas will exhibit a different evolution than those controlled by the spring precipitation colder areas however even under scenarios of substantial precipitation increases the sensitivity of the peak swe has proven to be negative in iberia under warmer conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020c including in the higher elevations or colder areas these results are consistent with a sensitivity analysis performed for most of the mountain climates of the world lópez moreno et al 2020a where consistent projected climate warming led to a decrease in both the peak swe and the snow cover duration in most of the mountains of the planet thus a generalized decrease in the length of the snow seasons is expected on the basis of the decline of the peak swe as a consequence of warming providing continuity with the reported ongoing trend estimated from long term reanalysis simulations in the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2020b the results presented here suggest that the areas where the melt rates play a key role in controlling the snow seasonal duration are located at the lower elevations these results are consistent for the different mountain ranges despite their climatological differences the average elevations where the melt rates dependency dominates the peak swe dependency were similar in all the investigated mountain ranges with larger differences in the pyrenees this effect is caused by the hypsometry of each mountain ranges in most of the areas the duration of the snow cover is controlled by the peak swe making the average elevation between both cases similar as there are many more areas at low elevations than at high elevations the slight differences between mountain ranges in the percentage of area where the melt rates exert greater control of the snow season duration can be easily explained by the differences in the hypsography of the mountain ranges i e a higher percentage of the total area is at a low elevation this difference in hypsography likely explains why the pyrenees and sierra nevada exhibit a higher percentage of their area where the snow cover seasonal duration is controlled by the peak swe 93 2 and 95 5 respectively as they have the higher elevational ranges among the iberian mountain ranges our results may indicate that the control exerted by the melt rates over the snow cover seasonal duration could increase in the future because of the rise of the winter zero degree isotherm this finding is relevant as previous studies have reported a generalized negative sensitivity of the melt rates to warming alonso gonzález et al 2020c musselman et al 2017 however despite the lower melt rates a generalized decrease in the snow cover duration as a consequence of the lower peak swe values is expected the lower melt rates will not compensate for lower peak swe values as they are the result of a different level of decrease in the peak swe and the snow season length the available projections for precipitation and temperature show different seasonal patterns in their expected future evolution and different increases in the role of the melt rate at the lower elevations the snow cover duration at high elevations greater than 2000 2200 m a s l could be more strongly influenced by climate change than those at medium and low elevations a result already observed in the pyrenees over the last decades lópez moreno et al 2020b despite the relatively high r2 adjusted values found in the models supplementary fig 1 there is an important part of the variance that it is unexplained by the models it is obvious that other factors different form the melt rates and the peak swe could condition the duration of the snow cover for example some winters may influence the shape of the daily snowpack time series introducing some uncertainties in the models specifically the accumulation and melt are often not linear fig 3 it is possible to find some seasons where exceptionally dry periods followed by an intense precipitation period lead to a secondary but relevant peak swe during the spring these situations may delay the melt out day increasing the impact on the length of the snow season duration in addition it may be possible to find seasons where the exact day of occurrence of the peak swe could be difficult to identify because numerous days have the same swe peak this could have some influence in the estimation of the melt rates in those seasons however these situations are rare due to the regional nature of the timeseries of the snowpack database thus despite the uncertainties the results of the present study are easy to generalize being transferrable to other temperate climate mountain ranges of the world the results presented here cannot be extrapolated to small spatial scales where the local climatology characteristics explain an important part of the spatial variability of the snowpack lópez moreno et al 2017b revuelto et al 2020 fassnacht 2021 such an effect is relevant even under warmer conditions where slope and aspect could lead to more spatially variable snowpacks lópez moreno et al 2013 because of the control of the topography over the radiative surface fluxes accumulation patterns and wind redistribution in addition the correlation between melt rates and peak swe might be different at the wind redistribution scales due to the local interactions with vegetation and landscape pomeroy et al 2004 5 conclusions we analysed the roles of the peak swe and melt rates to explain the temporal and spatial variability of snow cover duration we used a daily gridded snowpack database derived from numerical simulations this database has proven to be consistent with both in situ measurements and remote sensing snow cover products the long term average and the interannual variability exhibited by the peak swe melt rate and snow cover duration highlight the varied conditions of the snowpack existing across the iberian peninsula giving the results of the present study a wider geographical entity as this snowpack is representative of many other snowpacks over temperate mountain ranges using the combination of peak swe and melt rates to explain the snow cover duration resulted in on average an adjusted r 2 of 0 5 we did not find a clear relation between different levels of explained variance with the geographical location mountain range or elevation range we found that in most of the areas of the main mountain ranges of iberia 90 of the total area the peak swe exerts greater control than the melt rates to explain the interannual variability of the snow cover duration the areas where the melt rates exerted greater control of the snow season duration were located at lower elevations given the key role of the total precipitation in controlling the interannual variability of the peak swe the results presented here indicate notable uncertainty in the projections for the future evolution of the snow cover duration the snow cover duration in colder areas mostly at higher elevations where the spring precipitations control much of the seasonal peak swe might be particularly uncertain compared with that in warmer areas where the peak swe is controlled by the wintertime accumulated precipitation nonetheless the confidence of climate projections toward a warmer climate will lead to a clear generalized decrease of snow cover duration in all mountains of iberia and most of the mountains of the world snow cover duration could be particularly reduced at mid and high elevations the role of melt rates in controlling the snow seasonal duration may gain importance in the next few decades as a consequence of the rise of the winter zero degree isotherm credit authorship contribution statement esteban alonso gonzález conceptualization methodology software data curation writing

3486,the duration of the seasonal snowpack determines numerous aspects of the water cycle ecology and the economy in cold and mountainous regions and is a balance between the magnitude of accumulated snow and the rate of melt the contribution of each component has not been well quantified under contrasting topography and climatological conditions although this may provide useful insights into how snow cover duration could respond to climate change here we examined the contribution of the annual peak snow water equivalent swe and the seasonal melt rate to define the duration of the snowpack over temperate mountains using snow data for mountain areas with different climatological characteristics across the iberian peninsula we used a daily snowpack database for the period 1980 2014 over iberia to derive the seasonal peak swe melt rate and season snow cover duration the influence of peak swe and melt rates on seasonal snow cover duration was estimated using a stepwise linear model approach the stepwise linear models showed high r adjusted values average r adjusted 0 7 without any clear dependence on the elevation or geographical location in general the peak swe influenced the snow cover duration over all of the mountain areas analysed to a greater extent than the melt rates 89 1 89 2 81 6 93 2 and 95 5 in the areas for the cantabrian central iberian pyrenees and sierra nevada mountain ranges respectively at these colder sites the melt season occurs mostly in the spring and tends to occur very fast in contrast the areas where the melt rates dominated snow cover duration were located systematically at lower elevations due to the high interannual variability in the occurrence of annual peak swe in winter or early spring yielding highly variable melt rates however in colder sites the melt season occurs mostly in spring and it is very fast in most of the years the results highlight the control that the seasonal precipitation patterns in combination with temperature exert on the seasonal snow cover duration by influencing the peak swe and suggest a future increased importance of melt rates as temperatures increase despite the high climatological variability of the iberian mountain ranges the results showed a consistent behaviour along the different mountain ranges indicating that the methods and results may be transferrable to other temperate mountain areas of the world keywords snowpack mountains peak swe snow cover duration melt rate 1 introduction snowpack quantity and snow cover duration determine the annual freshwater budget and its seasonalityfor mountain regions barnett et al 2005 in addition snow cover duration directly affects plant and animal phenology especially the timing and annual magnitude of forest growth as sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 demonstrated in iberia for the pinus uncinata forests of the pyrenees furthermore snow dictates the duration and success of winter tourism which is becoming one of the main sources of income for many mountain regions of the world gilaberte búrdalo et al 2017 steiger et al 2019 the snowpack over temperate mountain ranges exhibits unique characteristics compared with other mountain areas of the world despite the relatively mild winter temperatures the snowpack tends to be deeper than at higher latitudes it also exhibits rapid densification thus being an effective freshwater storage system fayad et al 2017 the snowpack has nearly isothermal conditions for most of the snow season receiving abundant incoming solar radiation due to the latitude of the temperate mountain ranges between 30 and 40 in the northern and southern hemispheres and high sublimation rates herrero and polo 2016 the snowpack exhibits a high interannual variability due to spatial differences in precipitation and large elevation gradients alonso gonzález et al 2020a 2020b as a consequence of their lack of cold content and their sensitivity to precipitation phase partitioning the snowpacks over temperate mountain ranges are highly vulnerable to the ongoing climate warming alonso gonzález et al 2020c evan and eisenman 2021 lópez moreno et al 2017a yilmaz et al 2019 a major risk of decline in snow cover duration over these temperate regions exists which endangers the availability of freshwater resources during the long dry months garcía ruiz et al 2011 all these changes are being observed across the iberian peninsula where its mountainous terrain leads to a well developed seasonal snowpack in various mountain ranges cantabrian central iberian pyrenees and sierra nevada mountain ranges alonso gonzález et al 2020b however the snowpack exhibits high variability in terms of duration and amount especially at the lower elevations such variability is explained by the high climatological diversity of the iberian mountain ranges and the seasonal synoptic conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020a snowpack magnitude which is often quantified by the peak snow water equivalent swe or accumulated swe fassnacht and lópez moreno 2020 strongly controls the amount of water available during the melting period however the duration of snow cover dictates many of the biochemical processes controlled by the snowpack such as soil temperature bender et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 microbial activity zhang et al 2014 vegetation growth sanmiguel vallelado et al 2019 and animal phenology robinson and merrill 2012 in addition the snow cover duration determines the seasonality of different hydrological processes such as soil moisture williams et al 2009 hydrograph depletion julander and clayton 2018 and the occurrence of rain on snow events morán tejeda et al 2016 snow cover duration can be more accurately derived from remote sensing products gascoin et al 2020 compared to swe or snow depth that require direct observations or modelling approaches painter et al 2016 revuelto et al 2016 thus it is important to study the relation between the snow cover and the amount of snow as it provides an interesting basis for future studies the duration of the snow cover over the ground at a given location and in a given year depends on the combination of the amount and timing of snowfall and the seasonal melt rate after the occurrence of peak swe harpold et al 2017 in other words the duration of the snow cover depends on the maximum amount of snow to be melted and the rate of said melt the quantification of the contribution of the two factors namely peak swe and melt rate is relevant in understanding the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover duration and more importantly to consider how climate change could impact snow cover duration at any given location previous research has revealed that the effect of temperature or precipitation on snow cover durations changes over space with a marked elevational pattern temperature is the main control at low elevations whereas the main control in terms of accumulation shifts to precipitation at high elevations morán tejeda et al 2013 sospedra alfonso and merryfield 2017 illustrating the correlation between faster melt rates and lower snow accumulations however if snow cover duration mostly depends on accumulated snow the response of snow cover duration to a climate warming will be strongly influenced by the seasonal timing of the precipitation the seasonal differences in projected precipitation changes and the timing of peak swe notably the projected changes in precipitation are highly uncertain in most mountainous areas nogués bravo et al 2008 if peak swe generally occurs at the end of the coldest period of the year the effect of warmer temperatures might be dampened conversely for locations where peak swe occurs later in the season because of snowfall during the spring caesar et al 2006 snow cover duration might be strongly affected by higher temperatures since the occurrence of rainfall will be much higher than snowfall lópez moreno et al 2020a in addition if melt rates dominate snow cover duration the latter will be controlled more by temperature changes in this case melt rates might be less intense as the climate warms due to an earlier occurrence of melting and thus less solar loading alonso gonzález et al 2020c musselman et al 2017 wu et al 2018 in the present study we use a long term 1980 2014 gridded snow database for the mountains of the iberian peninsula alonso gonzález et al 2018 the iberian peninsula exhibits large climatological variability with its mountain ranges being a good representation of the temperate mountains of the world to investigate whether seasonal snow cover duration interannual variability is controlled more by the amount of snow accumulation peak swe or by the intensity of the melt rate we tried to find differences among different analysed mountain ranges since they exhibit contrasting climatic and snow conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020b such differences may provide useful information to foresee how projected climate change might affect and with what uncertainty snow cover duration at different areas of temperate mountain ranges thereby helping to anticipate the related effects on different environmental and socioeconomic sectors 2 study area the iberian peninsula is located at the southwestern edge of europe its climatology is strongly influenced by its complex topography and proximity to both the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean covering a full transition from mediterranean to oceanic climates and therefore being one of the areas of europe with high climatological variability peel et al 2007 although some locations in iberia can receive large amounts of annual precipitation precipitation exhibits high interannual variability and iberia is generally considered a water scarce region moreover large areas of the peninsula are highly dependent on water resources from mountain areas and much of this water comes from the snowpack total precipitation varies from less than 300 mm yr 1 to more than 1500 mm yr 1 and may exceed 2500 mm yr 1 locally in specific locations palacios and de marcos 1998 in the mediterranean climate where most precipitation occurs during the winter months lópez moreno et al 2011 2017a the snowpack becomes critical because it breaks the strong seasonality of the available freshwater resources resulting in a better synchronization of the water availability with the high demand during the dry and warm season lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 atmospheric circulation controls the interannual variability of the precipitation trigo et al 2004 droughts are frequent and affect the streamflow of the main iberian basins lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 this large precipitation and streamflow variability makes iberia highly dependent on the water management and spain is one of the countries with the most hydrological regulation berga casafont 2003 snow is common over iberia including some snowfall events at lower elevations aran et al 2010 mora et al 2016 snowfalls are common every year over wide areas of iberia due to the presence of a central plateau with an average elevation of 650 m above sea level in addition there are five main mountain systems that exceed 2000 m a s l ranging from west to east across iberia two of them pyrenees and sierra nevada surpass 3000 m a s l fig 1 mountain ranges exhibit seasonal long lasting and deep snowpacks whose characteristics differ due to the climatological particularities of each region alonso gonzález et al 2020b specifically in iberia snow has important implications in different key features of the region including its hydrology lópez moreno and garcía ruiz 2004 sanmiguel vallelado et al 2017 ecology sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 economy lasanta et al 2007 and risk management muntán et al 2009 3 data and methods we used a daily gridded snowpack database covering the entire iberian peninsula for the period from 1980 to 2014 alonso gonzález et al 2018 the database was developed using a regional atmospheric simulation garcía valdecasas ojeda et al 2017 from the weather research and forecast wrf model version 3 8 skamarock et al 2008 at a 10 km spatial resolution as the meteorological forcing for the factorial snow model fsm 1 0 essery 2015 given the coarse spatial resolution 10 km wrf outputs were corrected from the elevation of the native grid of the simulation to different elevation bands at 100 m intervals for each simulated grid cell using a combination of radiative barometric and psychrometric formulae as well as lapse rates thus the simulated 2 m temperature of the wrf was corrected using the standard air temperature lapse rate β 0 0065 k m 1 and the surface pressure was adjusted using the barometric formula the long wave radiation was estimated according to the stefan boltzmann law using an all sky conditions parametrization of the emissivity based on the relative humidity rh at the elevation of 700 mb to estimate the cloud cover the rh was projected by correcting the dew point temperature for the elevation both the rh and long wave radiation parametrizations have been widely used in the literature and have also been implemented in meteorological distribution models liston and elder 2006 finally the precipitation phase partitioning was calculated on the basis of the estimated temperature of the surface of the hydrometeors using the equations proposed by harder and pomeroy 2013 a detailed description of the mathematical formulae as well as a graphical scheme can be found in alonso gonzález et al 2018 to disaggregate the semi distributed fashion i e elevation bands distribution of the snowpack database we interpolated the snowpack series over a dem of 1 km resolution the distributed snow series over each objective cell of the 1 km dem was generated by the weighted average of eight neighbour cells in the nearest two elevation bands directly higher and lower the distance between each objective cell and four cells in the nearest two elevation bands inside the three dimensional space of the semi distributed database was used to generate the new series from the weighted average of the semi distributed series alonso gonzález et al 2018 compared the database with both remote sensing imagery and in situ observations of snow height hs and swe and illustrated the database s spatial and temporal consistency a comparison with modis gap filled snow cover products showed a mean absolute error of 6 07 and a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 76 in addition the available swe and hs series for the iberian peninsula were used to validate the intra annual patterns of accumulation at different percentiles with coheńs kappa value k greater than 0 6 the database has been used for different studies over iberia including climatology alonso gonzález et al 2020b 2020a hydrology morán tejeda et al 2019 and ecology sanmiguel vallelado et al 2019 an example of a time series of swe for a single cell red circle in fig 1 across different elevation bands retrieved from the database is shown in fig 2 to remove ephemeral snowpacks for any year we only considered snow as seasonal when more than 30 mm of swe remained for more than 30 consecutive days these thresholds were selected on the basis of sturm et al 1995 but were adapted to the study area on the basis of the snow climatology created by alonso gonzález et al 2020b this processing was performed for each season for each cell cells having less five snow season respecting the above mentioned criteria swe greater than 30 mm for more than 30 consecutive days where removed from the analysis for each year and for each cell in we calculated the peak swe mm the snow cover duration days and the seasonal melt rate mm day 1 the seasonal melt rate was computed in millimetres per day as the peak swe divided by the time from the date of peak swe to the date of the end of the snow season or snow disappearance the duration was defined as the number of days with continuous snow cover thus no early or late season accumulation and complete melt events were considered in addition in the rare case of a complete mid season melt the latest snow season was used to determine the relative influence of the peak swe and the melt rate independent variables to explain the duration of snow cover dependent variable fig 3 we used a backward stepwise linear regression model in the form d β 0 βp p βm m where β 0 is the y intercept βp is the coefficient associated with peak swe p and βm is the coefficient associated with the seasonal melt rate m since the regression was stepwise the best fitting independent variable i e either the peak swe or the melt rate was chosen first iteratively each variable was considered for removal addition on the basis of the variations of the akaike information criterion aic the coefficients were then standardized by multiplying the regression based coefficient by the ratio of the standard deviation of the dependent variable d by the standard deviation of the independent variable p or m providing a simple quantification of the weight of each independent variable on the duration of snow cover we then evaluated how βp and βm were distributed along the elevations in the main mountain ranges of iberia we then extracted the elevation values of the dem using the βp and βm values to evaluate the β coefficients variation with the elevation thus we studied the elevations where one of the β coefficients was greater than the other or only one variable was selected by the stepwise approach all the calculations were performed using the r programming language r core team 2020 at the supercomputing facilities of the spanish research council we use one location in the pyrenees as an example the same location indicated in fig 2 to illustrate the specific results and then provide the results of the distributed analyses over the iberian mountains 4 results and discussion the main temporal patterns and the relationship with elevation of the three snow indexes fig 4 can be exemplificated by a single cell of the pyrenees red dot in fig 1 peak swe exhibits noticeable temporal variability at all elevations but with a decrease with increasing elevation coefficient of variation cv of 0 48 0 30 and 0 23 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively this result is mainly attributed to the snowpacks in temperate regions being consistently close to the zero degree isotherm since they are highly sensitive to the precipitation partition phase fayad and gascoin 2020 thus the elevation ensures colder temperatures and more constant peak swe values which are mostly regulated by the precipitation which is why several studies have found the higher areas or colder locations of mountain ranges to be less affected by climate warming worldwide alonso gonzález et al 2020c marty et al 2017 matiu et al 2021 pierce and cayan 2013 sproles et al 2013 as in the case of peak swe an obvious relation exists between the duration of the snow cover and the elevation with longer durations at higher elevations fig 4 the interannual variability of the snow cover duration also decreases with increasing elevation cv of 0 33 0 11 and 0 09 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively in this particular example the melt rates showed a more complex spatial and temporal behaviour the lower cv for the snow cover duration compared with that for the peak swe might explain the inversions in the relation of the melt rates with the elevation in some particular years the seasons with thicker shallower snowpacks do not increase decrease linearly with the snow cover duration since the melt rates show different values as the snow season progresses on average the melt rates tend to increase with increasing elevation average of 14 1 19 5 and 19 0 mm day 1 at 2000 2400 and 2900 m a s l respectively in this particular example however this relation is not as clear as that observed for the peak swe and the snow cover duration this pattern occurs because an effective melt not only requires temperature warmer than 0 c but also a considerable increase in incoming solar radiation and decreased albedo at the end of the winter musselman et al 2017 at the sample location in the pyrenees figs 1 and 4 the β coefficients of the peak swe and melt rate as well as the adjusted r 2 of the stepwise regression model are correlated with the elevation fig 5 most likely due to local particularities of this specific location the peak swe exhibited a higher β coefficient than the melt rates at all elevation bands at the 1400 1800 and 2400 2900 m elevation bands the melt rate was not even included in the model by the stepwise algorithm as a predictor variable thus the model suggests that for this single cell example fig 4 the peak swe exerts greater control of the snow cover duration than the melt rates here the maximum explained variance of the model is found at low and medium elevations and the overall evolution of adjusted r 2 follows the evolution of the β coefficients of peak swe with a negligible effect when the melt rate is also included in the model as a predictor variable we extended the previously methodology described for a single cell fig 5 to the all study area a large spatial variability is observed in the peak swe melt rate and the snow cover duration over iberia fig 6 with strong differences also observed within the same mountain ranges even at similar elevations as reported in previous studies alonso gonzález et al 2020b among the five main mountain ranges of iberia the pyrenees and cantabrian mountains receive the most snow with a maximum swe approaching 2000 mm and a snow cover duration as long as 290 days in the most favourable locations fig 6 by contrast the sierra nevada exhibited lower values when similar elevation bands were compared a complete description of the snow climatology and the differences between mountain ranges can be found in the work of alonso gonzález et al 2020b as expected the snow season duration and peak swe are mostly controlled by elevation in addition melt rates tend to be faster at the higher elevations fig 6 consistent with other studies that found faster melt rates occurring later in the snow season under conditions of greater incoming radiation musselman et al 2017 wu et al 2018 peak swe is more variable at lower than at higher elevation leading to very different melt rates having a significant influence on the snow cover duration the interannual cv estimated for the snow cover duration and peak swe follows a similar spatial pattern with a clear decrease with increasing elevation fig 6 this effect might be a consequence of the low values of each index low elevations that can lead to extremely large cv values however the preprocessing of the snow series where each snow season must meet the minimum accumulation and duration criteria prevents the standard deviation from being divided by small mean values differences in cv values were observed between the three snow indexes the cv values for the mean season duration were lower than for the peak swe whose cv values were in turn lower than those for the melt rates the stepwise models used to predict the snow cover duration from the peak swe and the melt rate showed an average coefficient of determination r 2 adjust of 0 5 the adjusted r 2 values of the models showed no clear dependence on the elevation or differences between mountain ranges although the highest determination coefficients were found in the band between 1500 and 2000 m a s l and the variability of the adjusted r 2 values tended to decrease with increasing elevation supplementary fig 1 this greater variability at the lower elevations was likely caused by the fact that there were more cases at the lower elevations in addition to a higher variability in the snow indexes focusing on the pyrenees modelling results showed that snow cover duration is more sensitive to peal swe than to melt rates fig 7 the peak swe was excluded by the stepwise approach fig 7 left panel in only 2 4 of the cells moreover considering the subset of cells where either peak swe and melt rate p m or only melt rate m were selected by the stepwise model melt rate β coefficients were higher than peak swe one in only 6 8 of the cases fig 7 right panel by contrast the cases where the model considered only the peak swe represented 35 6 of cells fig 7a increasing to 93 2 of cells when both indexes were included and the peak swe exhibited higher β coefficients fig 7 right panel in addition the cells where the melt rates exhibited a higher influence were concentrated at the lower elevations with an average elevation of 1180 m a s l in contrast with the 1740 m a s l elevation in the cells where the peak swe exhibited a higher β coefficient fig 7 right panel surprisingly despite the strongly contrasting climatological characteristics of the five iberian mountain ranges alonso gonzález et al 2020b this spatial pattern of the β coefficient of the peak swe β p and melt rate β m is similar over the other iberian mountain ranges table 1 and supplementary fig 2 slight differences are observed in the average elevation values as a consequence of the different hypsography of each range table 1 this finding is consistent with the results of similar studies developed in the western united states trujillo and molotch 2014 where deeper snowpacks lead to longer snow seasons and higher melt rates thus the relative areas where the β m is higher than the β p decrease regularly from the lower iberian central and cantabrian ranges with 81 6 89 2 and 89 1 respectively to the higher pyrenees and sierra nevada with 93 2 and 95 5 respectively elevation mountain ranges independently from the elevation the accumulation i e peak swe dominates the snow cover duration however at the lower areas the melt rates increase its importance in controlling the snow cover duration this result is particularly relevant as the iberian snowpacks have shown contrasting behaviours due to the climatological variability of the iberian peninsula alonso gonzález et al 2020b thus this finding suggests that the results of the present study could be extrapolated to other regions of the planet at comparable latitudes where the peak swe is reached with a low cold content because the pattern remains similar over the different mountain ranges however snowpacks over high latitude sites may present different behaviours because of different partitioning of the energy and mass balance of the snowpacks including a completely different seasonal distribution of the incoming solar radiation combined with in general a shallower snowpack the greater dependency of the snow season duration on the peak swe than on the melt rate table 1 indicates that the precipitation is a mayor driver of the snow season duration as despite the whole energy balance has its own influence the peak swe is mostly controlled by precipitation especially at the higher elevations morán tejeda et al 2013 musselman et al 2021 at high elevation snow melts late in spring and the depletion curve rather steep as consequence of the rise of shortwave radiation at lower elevations melting occurs earlier and is a function of the date of peak swe thus the melt rates in the areas where the peak swe occurs earlier tends to be more variable than in the areas where the peak swe occurs latter i e the higher and colder areas despite most atmospheric models showing a high consensus to project a generalized warming the climate change projections show large disagreements and uncertainties about how the precipitation could evolve in the next decades kharin et al 2013 in addition the sensitivity to warming of the snow accumulation may be different even in areas with comparable climatological characteristics due to local effects lópez moreno et al 2017a the seasonal precipitation patterns will play a key role as the peak swe is affected by the winter and spring precipitation and the surface temperatures of the iberian peninsula are expected to increase similarly for the winter and spring seasons carvalho et al 2020 lorenzo and alvarez 2020 have reported differences in the future seasonal precipitation patterns of iberia estimated from high resolution atmospheric simulations extracted from the euro cordex project their results highlight the uncertainty of the projections to simulate the future evolution of the precipitation and the spatial variability of the accumulated precipitation changes nevertheless they show a general increase in the total winter precipitation of approximately 15 with a decrease as large as 20 in the spring total precipitation these results suggest that the areas where the peak swe is controlled by the total winter precipitation warmer areas will exhibit a different evolution than those controlled by the spring precipitation colder areas however even under scenarios of substantial precipitation increases the sensitivity of the peak swe has proven to be negative in iberia under warmer conditions alonso gonzález et al 2020c including in the higher elevations or colder areas these results are consistent with a sensitivity analysis performed for most of the mountain climates of the world lópez moreno et al 2020a where consistent projected climate warming led to a decrease in both the peak swe and the snow cover duration in most of the mountains of the planet thus a generalized decrease in the length of the snow seasons is expected on the basis of the decline of the peak swe as a consequence of warming providing continuity with the reported ongoing trend estimated from long term reanalysis simulations in the pyrenees lópez moreno et al 2020b the results presented here suggest that the areas where the melt rates play a key role in controlling the snow seasonal duration are located at the lower elevations these results are consistent for the different mountain ranges despite their climatological differences the average elevations where the melt rates dependency dominates the peak swe dependency were similar in all the investigated mountain ranges with larger differences in the pyrenees this effect is caused by the hypsometry of each mountain ranges in most of the areas the duration of the snow cover is controlled by the peak swe making the average elevation between both cases similar as there are many more areas at low elevations than at high elevations the slight differences between mountain ranges in the percentage of area where the melt rates exert greater control of the snow season duration can be easily explained by the differences in the hypsography of the mountain ranges i e a higher percentage of the total area is at a low elevation this difference in hypsography likely explains why the pyrenees and sierra nevada exhibit a higher percentage of their area where the snow cover seasonal duration is controlled by the peak swe 93 2 and 95 5 respectively as they have the higher elevational ranges among the iberian mountain ranges our results may indicate that the control exerted by the melt rates over the snow cover seasonal duration could increase in the future because of the rise of the winter zero degree isotherm this finding is relevant as previous studies have reported a generalized negative sensitivity of the melt rates to warming alonso gonzález et al 2020c musselman et al 2017 however despite the lower melt rates a generalized decrease in the snow cover duration as a consequence of the lower peak swe values is expected the lower melt rates will not compensate for lower peak swe values as they are the result of a different level of decrease in the peak swe and the snow season length the available projections for precipitation and temperature show different seasonal patterns in their expected future evolution and different increases in the role of the melt rate at the lower elevations the snow cover duration at high elevations greater than 2000 2200 m a s l could be more strongly influenced by climate change than those at medium and low elevations a result already observed in the pyrenees over the last decades lópez moreno et al 2020b despite the relatively high r2 adjusted values found in the models supplementary fig 1 there is an important part of the variance that it is unexplained by the models it is obvious that other factors different form the melt rates and the peak swe could condition the duration of the snow cover for example some winters may influence the shape of the daily snowpack time series introducing some uncertainties in the models specifically the accumulation and melt are often not linear fig 3 it is possible to find some seasons where exceptionally dry periods followed by an intense precipitation period lead to a secondary but relevant peak swe during the spring these situations may delay the melt out day increasing the impact on the length of the snow season duration in addition it may be possible to find seasons where the exact day of occurrence of the peak swe could be difficult to identify because numerous days have the same swe peak this could have some influence in the estimation of the melt rates in those seasons however these situations are rare due to the regional nature of the timeseries of the snowpack database thus despite the uncertainties the results of the present study are easy to generalize being transferrable to other temperate climate mountain ranges of the world the results presented here cannot be extrapolated to small spatial scales where the local climatology characteristics explain an important part of the spatial variability of the snowpack lópez moreno et al 2017b revuelto et al 2020 fassnacht 2021 such an effect is relevant even under warmer conditions where slope and aspect could lead to more spatially variable snowpacks lópez moreno et al 2013 because of the control of the topography over the radiative surface fluxes accumulation patterns and wind redistribution in addition the correlation between melt rates and peak swe might be different at the wind redistribution scales due to the local interactions with vegetation and landscape pomeroy et al 2004 5 conclusions we analysed the roles of the peak swe and melt rates to explain the temporal and spatial variability of snow cover duration we used a daily gridded snowpack database derived from numerical simulations this database has proven to be consistent with both in situ measurements and remote sensing snow cover products the long term average and the interannual variability exhibited by the peak swe melt rate and snow cover duration highlight the varied conditions of the snowpack existing across the iberian peninsula giving the results of the present study a wider geographical entity as this snowpack is representative of many other snowpacks over temperate mountain ranges using the combination of peak swe and melt rates to explain the snow cover duration resulted in on average an adjusted r 2 of 0 5 we did not find a clear relation between different levels of explained variance with the geographical location mountain range or elevation range we found that in most of the areas of the main mountain ranges of iberia 90 of the total area the peak swe exerts greater control than the melt rates to explain the interannual variability of the snow cover duration the areas where the melt rates exerted greater control of the snow season duration were located at lower elevations given the key role of the total precipitation in controlling the interannual variability of the peak swe the results presented here indicate notable uncertainty in the projections for the future evolution of the snow cover duration the snow cover duration in colder areas mostly at higher elevations where the spring precipitations control much of the seasonal peak swe might be particularly uncertain compared with that in warmer areas where the peak swe is controlled by the wintertime accumulated precipitation nonetheless the confidence of climate projections toward a warmer climate will lead to a clear generalized decrease of snow cover duration in all mountains of iberia and most of the mountains of the world snow cover duration could be particularly reduced at mid and high elevations the role of melt rates in controlling the snow seasonal duration may gain importance in the next few decades as a consequence of the rise of the winter zero degree isotherm credit authorship contribution statement esteban alonso gonzález conceptualization methodology software data curation writing

3487,water shortage has severely threatened the north china plain ncp a typical grain bowl and highly populated and urbanized area in china as surface water body area swa is a critical variable for measuring regional water resources understanding its changes and driving mechanisms is important for sustainable water management here we examine the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 by using all the available landsat imagery the water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm and cloud computing platform google earth engine gee the results show that swa of the ncp significantly p 0 05 expanded by 68 0 from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr the most remarkable expansion of swa happened in shandong province 75 0 km2 yr which is an increasingly important aquaculture production region we find that the increasing artificial reservoirs lakes due to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development are the main drivers for the expansion of swa in the ncp the expansion of swa caused a significant increase in water evaporation 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could lead to excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy similarly shandong province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation 0 03 km3 yr which could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies continuous temperature rise 0 02 0 06 c yr in the future as predicted by the climate models cmip5 under the two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios of medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp

however the information about the dynamics and long term trends of surface water bodies in the ncp to the present remains underexplored in addition the studies about the effects of the dynamics of surface water bodies on total water storage in the ncp are still limited which hinders our capability to achieve sustainable management of water resources the rapid development of remote sensing

surface water bodies in the ncp during the past three decades and analyze the driving factors and subsequent effects on total water storage to achieve this objective we firstly generated the annual maps of surface water bodies at 30 m spatial resolution using all the available landsat sr imagery and gee to examine the interannual variations and trends of surface water area swa and then quantitatively analyzed the driving factors of the changes of swa from both climate change and human activities finally we investigated the trends of water evaporation and examined the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage this study is expected to provide essential information for water managers and decision makers to guide the sustainable planning and management of limited water

terrain shadows due to the scan line corrector slc off gaps in each landsat 7 etm image after 2003 we only considered and used those good quality observations outside the slc off gaps after filtering all these remaining pixels were considered good quality landsat observations which could be used for water body detection after a systematic and quantitative investigation towards the landsat data availability we found that the good quality observations were sufficient to support retrospective and annual monitoring of surface water bodies in the ncp since 1987 fig 2 therefore we used all the available landsat 5 7 8 collection 1 tier 1 sr images covering the entire ncp during 1987 2020 48 000 images 38 terabytes of data to continuously monitor the dynamics of swa 2 2 2 climate data in this study two kinds of long term climate data sets were used to investigate the trends of annual precipitation ap in the study area during 1987 2019 the monthly 0 5 and 0 25 gridded data from the 1 climatic research unit timeseries cru ts version 4 01 and 2 the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 for the global climate respectively the cru ts precipitation data set is derived from the spatial interpolation based on the daily or sub daily observational data collected by national meteorological services and other agents shi et al 2017 agreeing well with rain gauge measurements zhao et al 2020 the era5 a state of the art reanalysis precipitation data product with wide coverage and fine spatial and temporal resolutions xin et al 2021 is advocated for understanding extreme precipitation and disaster events kumar et al 2021 as the era5 climate data for july december in 2020 has not been released we analyzed the variations and trends of ap from 1987 to 2019 we also used the projected climate change data set in the 21st century which were derived from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate model under two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios the medium greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp 4 5 and high emission scenario rcp 8 5 https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the cmip5 projected climate change data set are 0 25 and daily we used the cmip5 data set to calculate ap and annual mean temperature amt over the ncp in 2020 2100 the annual water evaporation was derived from the water evaporation layer in the second version of penman monteith leuning pml v2 evapotranspiration et data set 2000 2020 which has spatial and temporal resolutions of 500 m and eight days zhang et al 2019b 2 2 3 reservoirs and lakes data the data of geographical distributions of reservoirs lakes were collected from the global reservoir and dam database grand which was released by the global water system project gwsp and the columbia university center for international earth science information network ciesin in 2011 the reservoirs lakes were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery and are available as polygon shapefiles the main focus of the database was to include all these reservoirs lakes with a storage capacity of more than 0 1 km3 but many smaller reservoirs lakes were added when remote sensing data were available lehner et al 2011a lehner et al 2011b the grand database represents the geographical distributions of global reservoirs lakes in early 2011 2 2 4 statistical data we obtained annual areas of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs lakes in the ncp during 1987 2019 from the china statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj and the statistical yearbooks of each municipality or province https www yearbookchina com the data for the year 2020 were not included as these statistical yearbooks of 2021 have not been released until now 2 3 methods 2 3 1 satellite observations of swa dynamics surface water bodies can be detected by using the relationships between water and vegetation indices and our previous studies have performed surface water body change analyses based on time series landsat images and the threshold based water body mapping algorithms wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2017 zou et al 2018 similarly the water and vegetation indices including modified normalized difference water index mndwi enhanced vegetation index evi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were used for surface water body mapping in this study the complete workflow of generating annual maps of surface water bodies was shown in fig 3 for all the landsat pixels with good quality observations these indices were calculated based on the following spectral bands and equations 1 mndwi ρ green ρ swir 1 ρ green ρ swir 1 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 3 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red 1 0 ρ nir 6 0 ρ red 7 5 ρ blue where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir and ρ swir 1 are the surface reflectance values of bands blue 0 45 0 52 μm green 0 52 0 60 μm red 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared nir 0 77 0 90 μm and shortwave infrared 1 swir1 1 55 1 75 μm respectively in the landsat sensors a criterion mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi was used to identify the pixels which show stronger water signals than vegetation signals evi 0 1 can ensure that the vegetation pixels or the mixed pixels of water and vegetation were removed therefore only those pixels that meet the criteria mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi and evi 0 1 were classified as water body pixels while other pixels were classified as non water pixels for each landsat pixel in ncp the surface water frequency in a year was calculated based on eq 4 4 frequency y 1 n y i 1 n y w y i 100 where frequency is the water body frequency of a pixel y is the specified year ny is the number of good quality observations in the location in that year wy i denotes whether one observation is a water body with 1 indicating water and 0 indicating non water the surface water frequencies of individual pixels in the year 2020 and the period 1987 2020 varied substantially across the entire ncp fig 4 a and b after setting a certain threshold surface water bodies were extracted from the annual maps of water body frequency and their areas were varied according to different thresholds fig 4c in this study swa refers to the area of year long surface water bodies covered by water throughout the year a good agreement of the interannual variations and trends of swa between our water frequency data set with the threshold of 0 75 and jrc year long water data set after 2000 has been observed fig 4c however the annual swa from our data set was higher than that from the jrc data set before 2000 when some data were missing in the jrc water data set wang et al 2020b therefore the water body frequency of 0 75 was set to be the threshold to extract year long water bodies in this study which was also consistent with our previous studies wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2017 zou et al 2018 we used the random sampling approach and very high resolution vhr imagery from digitalglobe centre national d etudes spatiales cnes astrium at google earth platform to assess the accuracies of annual maps of surface water bodies the accuracies of the year long water body maps in 2000 2010 and 2020 were validated for each year the land cover types within a total of 600 random regions of interest rois with 100 m radius circles equal to roughly 27 000 landsat pixels across the entire ncp were visually interpreted by using vhr images in google earth fig 5 showed the spatial distributions of 169 rois for water and 431 rois for non water which were used for accuracy assessmemt of the surface water map in 2020 in order to ensure the temporal consistency of reference data and water mapping results we chose and interpreted the vhr images within the rois in the same year with the resultant maps of surface water bodies finally we generated the confusion matrices for the water maps of these three years on the envi 5 3 platform for accuracy assessment the results showed an overall accuracy of 97 6 kappa coefficient of 0 93 for the year 2000 96 7 0 91 for the year 2010 and 97 4 0 93 for the year 2020 respectively table 1 2 3 2 statistical analysis of swa dynamics based on the annual binary maps of surface water bodies of the ncp generated in this study we firstly aggregated the 30 m maps into area percentage maps of swa at both 0 5 arc degree and 1 km resolutions we then investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa at both pixel and regional scales firstly we applied the theil sen slope estimator and the mann kendall test method to annual swa percentage maps spatial resolutions of 0 5 arc degree and 1 km to obtain the temporal trend of swa and its statistical significance level in each pixel during 1987 2020 the theil sen is a median based non parametric trend test estimator which has no strict requirement for specific distribution of data yang et al 2019 the mann kendall test is a non parametric trend test method commonly used to detect trends in long term time series related to the geoscience field forkel et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 secondly we investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 at the provincial scale using the arcgis 10 3 software platform and python 2 7 programming language similarly we derived the interannual variations and trends of ap and water evaporation at the pixel and regional scales 2 3 3 attribution analysis of swa dynamics surface water bodies in the ncp mainly include rivers e g yellow river inland reservoirs lakes used for water conservancy projects and recreation purposes and coastal aquaculture ponds therefore the trends of swa could be dominated by the variations of these kinds of water bodies here we firstly carried out the analyses of the consistency between the spatial patterns of swa changes and the geographical locations of the reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds secondly we investigated the variations of anthropogenic i e areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds and climatic i e ap factors in the ncp thirdly we applied partial correlations to quantitatively explore the effects of these factors on swa dynamics 2 3 4 effects of swa dynamics on water evaporation considering that surface water bodies are changing and will strongly impact the available water resources through evaporation zhan et al 2019 here we quantitatively explored the effects of swa dynamics on evaporation in the ncp through the following two steps firstly we investigated and found the consistency between the spatial patterns of linear trends of water evaporation and swa in the study area during 2000 2020 secondly we explored the correlation between annual total water evaporation and swa using the linear regression model 3 results 3 1 increasing swa in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 generally swa showed an increasing trend in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 fig 6 specifically among the 336 0 5 0 5 arc degree grid cells of swa percentage maps 165 49 1 of them experienced a significant p 0 05 increase of swa during 1987 2020 fig 6a the most remarkable expansion of swa occurred in the eastern coastal regions and shandong province fig 6a furthermore the analyses based on higher resolution 1 km 1 km grid cells of swa percentage maps showed that the large reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds experienced the significant expansion of swa fig 6b in terms of the interannual variations and trends swa continuously increased from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 increased by 68 0 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr fig 6c at the provincial scale we found that the most rapid expansion of swa 75 0 km2 yr occurred in shandong province followed by the provinces of henan 16 7 km2 yr hebei 8 9 km2 yr and shanxi 4 8 km2 yr swa of shandong province has more than doubled during the period from 1469 7 km2 in 1987 to 3586 4 km2 in 2020 increased by 144 b t is the only region that experienced the decline of swa 3 6 km2 yr during 1987 2020 fig 6c however the trends of swa in b t were different in different periods specifically swa increased during 1987 1995 and then decreased after 1995 it was worth noting that swa in b t showed an increasing trend again from 2010 to 2020 25 9 21 4 km2 yr especially after 2014 26 8 km2 yr which was the start time of the implementation of the south to north water division snwd project 3 2 swa expansion from increasing reservoirs and aquaculture ponds consistent with the finding that the reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds have greatly expanded based on landsat images fig 6b the statistical data about the areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds from the statistical yearbooks also show increasing areas of reservoirs lakes 43 1 km2 yr and aquaculture ponds 64 3 km2 yr in the ncp during 1987 2019 fig 7 a and b human activities including the construction and extension of inland reservoirs lakes due to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development could contribute to the expansion of swa for example the ecological urgent water replenishing euwr project was implemented in shandong province in 2002 to divert water from the yangtze river to sustain the lake nansihu huang 2003 while the yellow river division yrd project was implemented in shanxi province since 2002 the snwd project in the provinces of henan hebei and shandong started in 2014 which was also followed by the gradual increase of swa fig 7 showed the expansion processes of several typical inland reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds namely reservoir xiaolangdi which was used for flood and drought management and electricity production reservoir dalangdian which was used for domestic water use coastal aquaculture ponds in the changzhou city of hebei province and dongying city of shandong province in terms of the effects of climate change on the dynamics of swa we found that ap 3 3 mm yr showed significantly p 0 05 negative trends during 1987 2019 fig 8 which suggested that the changes in precipitation were not conducive to the increase of swa over the past three decades statistical analyses also proved that anthropogenic factors areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds played significantly positive effects on the expansion of swa rather than precipitation firstly the areas of reservoirs lakes r 0 84 p 0 01 and aquaculture ponds r 0 84 p 0 01 were significantly and positively correlated with swa expansion during 1987 2019 while ap r 0 2 p 0 27 was not significantly correlated with swa changes fig 9 secondly partial correlations indicated that the relationship between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa remains significant after controlling for the effect of ap however controlling for the effect of the areas of aquaculture ponds strongly decreases partial correlation between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa which suggested that most of the information on swa variations that are contained in the areas of reservoirs lakes can be found in the areas of aquaculture ponds the partial correlations between the areas of aquaculture ponds and swa were similar to those between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa these statistical analyses suggested that the expansion of swa was mainly controlled by the increases of the areas of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs lakes rather than the changes of ap 3 3 increasing water evaporation and potential effects on regional water storage fig 10 showed the spatial patterns of linear trends of swa spatial resolution of 1 km and water evaporation 1 km and 0 5 arc degree in the ncp during 2000 2020 as can be seen the regions i e reservoirs lakes coastal aquaculture ponds with swa expansion experienced significant increases in water evaporation during 2000 2020 fig 10a and b the increases of evaporation were the most remarkable in the eastern parts of ncp especially in shandong province fig 10c coinciding with the most rapid expansion of swa in the province fig 6 the total water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp during 2000 2020 fig 10d the linear regression between the changes of water evaporation and swa showed that there was a significant p 0 01 and positive correlation between the increase of total water evaporation and expansion of swa fig 10e the consistent spatial patterns of water evaporation rise and swa expansion together with the significant correlation between the interannual variations of water evaporation and swa suggested that the expansion of swa greatly contributed to the increases of water evaporation in the ncp considering that shandong province experienced the most rapid increases in swa and water evaporation we also quantitatively studied the effects of water evaporation increase on total water storage in shandong the results showed that annual total water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 03 km3 yr in shandong province during 2000 2020 fig 10f and there was a significant p 0 01 and positive correlation between the increase of water evaporation and expansion of swa fig 10g the annual increase of water evaporation in shandong was equivalent to a loss of total water storage by 0 25 mm yr in the province for the regions covered by surface water bodies in shandong in 2000 2085 km2 the annual increase of water evaporation was equivalent to water storage decline by 14 4 mm while for the surface water regions in 2020 3586 km2 annual water evaporation increase was equal to water storage decline by 8 4 mm therefore the increasing evaporation due to swa expansion could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the surface water regions in shandong province during 2000 2020 4 discussion 4 1 implications of expanded swa in the ncp despite the long term severe water shortage in the ncp this study revealed the expanded areas of surface water bodies in the region over the past three decades the expansion of swa is of great significance to human well being and ecosystem in such a water limited region because 1 the widely distributed reservoirs lakes ensure water supply to industrial and agricultural production and domestic uses gao et al 2017 o reilly et al 2015 2 some large lakes e g lake baiyangdian coupled with its surrounding runoff are internationally important wetlands playing a vital role in protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem by providing habitats for a wide range of precious species liu et al 2013 tao et al 2015b 3 the construction of urban artificial lakes provide recreation landscapes for residents however some ecological and environmental issues brought by the expanded swa can not be ignored firstly previous studies jia et al 2021 mao et al 2018 ren et al 2019 have documented that the transformation of wetlands to aquaculture ponds in coastal regions of the ncp damaged the habitats of coastal mangroves and reeds as well as numerous precious fish and endangered migratory birds jiang et al 2015 secondly aquaculture ponds greatly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 and affected local water quality through the use of artificial feed and chemical additives pattanaik and narendra prasad 2011 thirdly as the water in some lakes or reservoirs is extracted from underground aquifers the exposure of groundwater to the surface could increase water evaporation and therefore strongly impact the regional water resources zhan et al 2019 in this study we found consistent spatial patterns and a significant correlation between water evaporation increase and swa expansion as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could cause excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy sacks et al 1994 this study suggests that the expansion of surface water bodies could accelerate the loss of regional water resources through evaporation finally the increase of reservoir numbers could cause the loss of river connectivity and threaten the ecosystem process these rivers support grill et al 2019 4 2 effects of future climate on surface water resources future climate change could significantly affect the long term variations of surface water bodies therefore understanding the trends of climate conditions in the future is of great significance to sustainable management and the use of water resources using the cmip5 projected data under both medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios the trends of temperature and precipitation in the ncp from 2020 to 2100 were investigated the results showed that both the precipitation and temperature would increase in the region in the future under these scenarios the annual mean of daily minimum temperature will significantly p 0 01 increase at a rate of 0 02 c yr and 0 03 c yr under the scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 11 while the annual mean of daily maximum temperature will significantly increase at a rate of 0 06 c yr for both the two scenarios the rcp 4 5 projected the lowest increase of ap 0 52 mm yr p 0 01 while the rcp 8 5 projected the highest increase 1 19 mm yr p 0 01 raising temperature is likely to affect et and atmospheric water storage and thereby the precipitation salem et al 2018 continuous temperature rise in the future could further stress the pressure of water shortage in the ncp and bring considerable threats to natural ecosystem and restrict regional sustainable development on the one hand the increasing temperature could cause more consumption of surface water resources by agricultural irrigation zhang et al 2019c on the other hand more substantial water evaporation induced by higher temperatures would lead to the decline of surface water resources and even the drying out of runoff and wetlands and consequently affect the biodiversity in riparian or wetland ecosystems therefore the water resource crisis of the ncp would continue in the future and effective water saving measures are urgent 4 3 comparison with previous studies for such a water limited region of the ncp previous studies mainly focused on the dynamics of groundwater resources and total water storage using the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace previous studies aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 pan et al 2017 qin et al 2013 have revealed that the ncp was one of the three most serious depletion hotspots of water storage in the world and identified the intense agricultural irrigation as the main driving factor of the depleting water storage in the ncp in the past decades for example huang et al 2015 detected the variations of groundwater storage in the ncp during 2003 2013 and found the depleted groundwater storage 16 mm yr owing to groundwater overexploitation xu et al 2019 revealed the decline of total water storage 7 mm yr in the region from 2003 to 2016 due to agricultural irrigation surface water is also an important component of total water storage though previous studies pekel et al 2016 song et al 2018 tao et al 2015b wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2018 have investigated the dynamics of surface water bodies they only focused on the variations and trends of surface water bodies as well as their driving factors the studies about the effects of the dynamics of surface water bodies on total water storage are still very limited for example zhang et al 2019a investigated the changes of lakes in china over eight periods every five or ten years for a period during 1960s 2015 by using landsat toa images and topographic maps however they only focused on the dynamics of lakes with sizes over 1 km2 in addition the epoch based analyses of lake dynamics could miss important information e g turning points about the inter annual variations of surface water bodies due to their strong variability similar studies included the analyses of lake dynamics in the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2017 and mongolian plateau tao et al 2015b during several sparse epochs in contrast our current study could depict the complete processes of swa dynamics in the ncp from 1987 to the present though our previous study wang et al 2020b investigated the interannual variations and spatial patterns of trends of swa and total water storage in china during 1989 2016 and revealed the spatial temporal divergency and consistency between swa and total water storage in the whole country however that study focused on analyzing water resources dynamics at the national scale lacking the quantitative analyses of the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage in the ncp in this study we firstly investigated the continuous change processes of swa and their driving factors in the ncp from 1987 to the present using all the available landsat sr data and gee we then quantitatively analyzed the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage by investigating the relationships between the changes of swa and water evaporation we found that the expanded swa due to the increasing artificial reservoirs and aquaculture ponds could accelerate the loss of water in the ncp through increased evaporation 0 09 km3 yr the data and methods used in this study to continuously monitor the dynamics of surface water bodies and explore the effects of swa changes on total water storage are also applicable to similar researches in other regions across the globe 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in this study though our current study together with previous researches pekel et al 2016 song et al 2018 tao et al 2015a wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2018 have contributed to the research progresses of water resources changes we have to note that there are still uncertainties and limitations remained in the methods and analyses in this study the uncertainties of the methods remote sensing data and those ancillary data et and precipitation used in this study were analyzed firstly surface water body mapping using 30 m spatial resolution landsat imagery could miss some water bodies with sizes smaller than 30 m 30 m secondly some bad quality observations e g clouds terrain shadows snows may remain after quality filtering which might have led to some low frequency inundation noises in the water body maps wang et al 2020b therefore the spatial temporal dynamics of year long surface water bodies in this study can provide much more reliable information than that of seasonal water bodies in addition it should be noted that some other satellite data e g sentinel 2 with higher spatial resolutions have been released in gee the virtual constellation of landsat with these sensors could provide observations with both high spatial and temporal resolutions for continuous monitoring of water body dynamics wulder et al 2015 zhou et al 2019b finally we used the theil sen slope estimator and the mann kendall test method to investigate the spatial patterns of linear trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 however it is notable that some abrupt changes are not likely to be reflected in swa trends especially in the early or late of the time series the use of those climate data products to analyze the driving factors of swa dynamics and their effects on total water storage could also bring some uncertainties to the studies though pml v2 et data were modeled by using penman monteith pm equation and taking modis data albedo emissivity and leaf area index and gldas meteorological forcing data as input data zhang et al 2019b this data set has been recognized as one of the most advanced and popular sources for actual values of et and evaporation and compared favorably with several eddy covariance flux towers fuentes et al 2020 for example he et al 2020 verified and compared the three high resolution et products pml v2 ssebop v4 and mod16a2 in north china and found that pml v2 showed the highest consistency with the fluctuation trend observed at the site the combined use of the two data sets with different spatial resolutions could also bring some uncertainties to the trends of precipitation as there are inevitable deviations in generating these two kinds of precipitation data sets of cru ts and era5 however they are commonly used data products and have been widely applied in researches related to climate change ukkola et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and hydrology and water resources li et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in addition we need to recognize that the water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm used in this study can only detect surface water bodies given that wetlands not only refer to the regions covered by surface water bodies but also the surrounding vegetated regions and the mixes of water and vegetation li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 mao et al 2020 the extensive applications of the algorithm in monitoring the dynamics of wetlands should consider the seasonality of the composites of water and vegetation thus the algorithms should be modified accordingly 5 conclusion the ncp is one of the most important agricultural production regions and densely populated areas in china using all the available landsat imagery water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm and cloud computing platform gee this study investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 we showed that swa in the ncp significantly increased from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 increased by 68 0 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr shandong province experienced the most remarkable increase of swa 75 0 km2 yr followed by the provinces of henan 16 7 km2 yr hebei 8 9 km2 yr and shanxi 4 8 km2 yr b t is the only region that experienced a decrease in swa 3 6 km2 yr we found that the increasing reservoirs lakes owing to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development were the main drivers for the expansion of swa in the ncp in addition the water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp during 2000 2020 also shandong province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation 0 03 km3 yr as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could cause excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy which could accelerate the loss of water resources at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies the cmip5 future climate projections revealed a significant temperature increase 0 02 0 06 c yr but a small change in precipitation under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios which indicated that the future climate change would add a new threat to water security in the ncp credit authorship contribution statement yan zhou conceptualization methodology formal analysis

3487,water shortage has severely threatened the north china plain ncp a typical grain bowl and highly populated and urbanized area in china as surface water body area swa is a critical variable for measuring regional water resources understanding its changes and driving mechanisms is important for sustainable water management here we examine the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 by using all the available landsat imagery the water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm and cloud computing platform google earth engine gee the results show that swa of the ncp significantly p 0 05 expanded by 68 0 from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr the most remarkable expansion of swa happened in shandong province 75 0 km2 yr which is an increasingly important aquaculture production region we find that the increasing artificial reservoirs lakes due to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development are the main drivers for the expansion of swa in the ncp the expansion of swa caused a significant increase in water evaporation 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could lead to excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy similarly shandong province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation 0 03 km3 yr which could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies continuous temperature rise 0 02 0 06 c yr in the future as predicted by the climate models cmip5 under the two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios of medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emission could further increase water evaporation which may add more pressure to regional water shortage this study warns that despite an observed significant swa expansion water shortage remains a major concern in the ncp keywords north china plain ncp surface water area swa google earth engine gee landsat water evaporation 1 introduction water shortage is one of the most significant factors limiting sustainable development in the north china plain ncp one of the most important agricultural production regions and densely populated areas in china guo and shen 2015 liu et al 2001 qin et al 2013 surface water bodies including lakes reservoirs ponds rivers and streams are critically important water resources for industrial and agricultural production as well as biodiversity conservation in riparian and wetland ecosystems huang et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 xie et al 2017 zou et al 2018 surface water bodies are dynamic owing to different natural and anthropogenic drivers hall et al 2014 the changes in surface water bodies could affect water evaporation and subsequently regional water resources zhan et al 2019 the spatial distribution temporal dynamics and long term trends of surface water bodies can provide valuable information for water resource planning and management in coping with climate change and human disturbance zou et al 2018 however the information about the dynamics and long term trends of surface water bodies in the ncp to the present remains underexplored in addition the studies about the effects of the dynamics of surface water bodies on total water storage in the ncp are still limited which hinders our capability to achieve sustainable management of water resources the rapid development of remote sensing technology in recent decades provides an effective way to monitor the dynamics of surface water bodies huang et al 2018 especially in remote and inaccessible mountainous regions song et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 compared to traditional in situ measurements satellites could provide observations with high frequency for continuous monitoring of surface water bodies over a large region a few data products on the spatial distributions of surface water bodies with various spatial and temporal resolutions have been released based on satellite imagery such as global water body data glowabo at 30 m resolution for the year 2000 verpoorter et al 2014 and global 3 arc second water body map g3wbm for 2010 yamazaki et al 2015 however limited by data availability and the processing capacity of platforms these single period static maps cannot precisely depict the dynamic processes e g interannual variations of changes in surface water bodies using modis imagery ji et al 2018 generated the daily global surface water change database at 500 m resolution for 2001 2016 however the spatial resolution of the data is too coarse to identify small inland water bodies in 2016 the joint research centre jrc pekel et al 2016 released the yearly global water body maps at 30 m spatial resolution from 1984 to 2015 however the data missed some surface water bodies in china before the year 2000 though the entire landsat 5 7 8 top of atmosphere toa reflectance data were used to generate the jrc data set pekel et al 2016 the data archiving of landsat images is dynamic zhu et al 2019 and the landsat archive held at the united states geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros center in 2016 when the jrc global surface water data were generated was likely less complete than it is currently the use of surface reflectance sr data would be preferred for land cover mapping dong et al 2016 gong et al 2019 wang et al 2020a you and dong 2020 as there are deviations between the values of these water or vegetation indices derived from toa reflectance data and sr data dong et al 2016 to date no study has used the landsat sr data set to generate annual maps of surface water bodies in the ncp from the 1980s to the present the lack of information on the continuous processes of spatial temporal dynamics of surface water bodies makes it hard to investigate the relationships between the dynamics of surface water bodies and their associated effects on regional water resources e g water loss through evaporation and the environment e g greenhouse gas emissions from small ponds fortunately the remote sensing cloud computing platforms e g google earth engine gee comprising of various kinds of remote sensing e g sr data of landsat sentinel and modis and geospatial data sets widely used classifiers and powerful computing capability gorelick et al 2017 pan et al 2021 open opportunities for realizing retrospective and continuous monitoring of land cover changes dong et al 2019 zhou et al 2019a our previous studies wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2017 zou et al 2018 have documented the interannual variations of surface water bodies in the conterminous united states china and mongolian plateau by using all the available landsat sr imagery and gee this study aimed to understand the spatial temporal changes of surface water bodies in the ncp during the past three decades and analyze the driving factors and subsequent effects on total water storage to achieve this objective we firstly generated the annual maps of surface water bodies at 30 m spatial resolution using all the available landsat sr imagery and gee to examine the interannual variations and trends of surface water area swa and then quantitatively analyzed the driving factors of the changes of swa from both climate change and human activities finally we investigated the trends of water evaporation and examined the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage this study is expected to provide essential information for water managers and decision makers to guide the sustainable planning and management of limited water resources in the ncp and provide a reference for the research of water resources dynamics in other similar regions over the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp defined in this study geographically includes the municipalities of beijing and tianjin and the provinces of hebei henan shandong and shanxi fig 1 considering the smaller areas of beijing and tianjin compared to other provinces they were merged as one region beijing tianjin b t in this study the ncp region is home to 26 of the human population in china accounting for 25 of gross domestic production gdp and national grain production but it has only 3 of the total freshwater resources fig 1 statistics 2019 xu et al 2019 agriculture consumes more than 70 of the total water use in the region liu et al 2001 xu et al 2005 extensive pumping for irrigation has made the region be one of the three major groundwater depletion regions in the world cao et al 2013 han et al 2017 huang et al 2015 siebert et al 2010 in addition the population growth and urbanization acceleration in the beijing tianjin hebei region fig 1b and c yang et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 aggravate the water shortage pressure in the ncp therefore population growth urbanization development and agricultural production are likely to be limited due to the region s water scarcity qin et al 2013 2 2 data 2 2 1 landsat imagery among all the satellites landsat family sensors have the longest historical observations with a medium spatial resolution hansen and loveland 2012 wulder and coops 2014 providing the most appropriate data to continuously track the dynamics of surface water bodies overtime at various spatial and temporal scales all the available landsat 5 7 8 collection 1 tier 1 sr images in the study area since 1984 were used in this study these images were originally derived from the usgs and have been conducted geometric and atmospheric correction as well as cross calibration among different sensors dwyer et al 2018 wulder et al 2016 all these images have been released in the database of gee in this study the pixels of clouds cloud shadows and snows in each image were removed by using the quality assurance qa band from a cloud masking method called cfmask which works well and is suitable for preparing landsat data for land cover change monitoring zhu and woodcock 2014 in addition the solar azimuth and zenith angles of each image derived from image properties were used along with the digital elevation model dem from shuttle radar topography mission srtm to simulate and remove terrain shadows due to the scan line corrector slc off gaps in each landsat 7 etm image after 2003 we only considered and used those good quality observations outside the slc off gaps after filtering all these remaining pixels were considered good quality landsat observations which could be used for water body detection after a systematic and quantitative investigation towards the landsat data availability we found that the good quality observations were sufficient to support retrospective and annual monitoring of surface water bodies in the ncp since 1987 fig 2 therefore we used all the available landsat 5 7 8 collection 1 tier 1 sr images covering the entire ncp during 1987 2020 48 000 images 38 terabytes of data to continuously monitor the dynamics of swa 2 2 2 climate data in this study two kinds of long term climate data sets were used to investigate the trends of annual precipitation ap in the study area during 1987 2019 the monthly 0 5 and 0 25 gridded data from the 1 climatic research unit timeseries cru ts version 4 01 and 2 the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis era5 for the global climate respectively the cru ts precipitation data set is derived from the spatial interpolation based on the daily or sub daily observational data collected by national meteorological services and other agents shi et al 2017 agreeing well with rain gauge measurements zhao et al 2020 the era5 a state of the art reanalysis precipitation data product with wide coverage and fine spatial and temporal resolutions xin et al 2021 is advocated for understanding extreme precipitation and disaster events kumar et al 2021 as the era5 climate data for july december in 2020 has not been released we analyzed the variations and trends of ap from 1987 to 2019 we also used the projected climate change data set in the 21st century which were derived from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate model under two representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios the medium greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp 4 5 and high emission scenario rcp 8 5 https esgf node llnl gov search cmip5 the spatial and temporal resolutions of the cmip5 projected climate change data set are 0 25 and daily we used the cmip5 data set to calculate ap and annual mean temperature amt over the ncp in 2020 2100 the annual water evaporation was derived from the water evaporation layer in the second version of penman monteith leuning pml v2 evapotranspiration et data set 2000 2020 which has spatial and temporal resolutions of 500 m and eight days zhang et al 2019b 2 2 3 reservoirs and lakes data the data of geographical distributions of reservoirs lakes were collected from the global reservoir and dam database grand which was released by the global water system project gwsp and the columbia university center for international earth science information network ciesin in 2011 the reservoirs lakes were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery and are available as polygon shapefiles the main focus of the database was to include all these reservoirs lakes with a storage capacity of more than 0 1 km3 but many smaller reservoirs lakes were added when remote sensing data were available lehner et al 2011a lehner et al 2011b the grand database represents the geographical distributions of global reservoirs lakes in early 2011 2 2 4 statistical data we obtained annual areas of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs lakes in the ncp during 1987 2019 from the china statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj and the statistical yearbooks of each municipality or province https www yearbookchina com the data for the year 2020 were not included as these statistical yearbooks of 2021 have not been released until now 2 3 methods 2 3 1 satellite observations of swa dynamics surface water bodies can be detected by using the relationships between water and vegetation indices and our previous studies have performed surface water body change analyses based on time series landsat images and the threshold based water body mapping algorithms wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2017 zou et al 2018 similarly the water and vegetation indices including modified normalized difference water index mndwi enhanced vegetation index evi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were used for surface water body mapping in this study the complete workflow of generating annual maps of surface water bodies was shown in fig 3 for all the landsat pixels with good quality observations these indices were calculated based on the following spectral bands and equations 1 mndwi ρ green ρ swir 1 ρ green ρ swir 1 2 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 3 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red 1 0 ρ nir 6 0 ρ red 7 5 ρ blue where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir and ρ swir 1 are the surface reflectance values of bands blue 0 45 0 52 μm green 0 52 0 60 μm red 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared nir 0 77 0 90 μm and shortwave infrared 1 swir1 1 55 1 75 μm respectively in the landsat sensors a criterion mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi was used to identify the pixels which show stronger water signals than vegetation signals evi 0 1 can ensure that the vegetation pixels or the mixed pixels of water and vegetation were removed therefore only those pixels that meet the criteria mndwi evi or mndwi ndvi and evi 0 1 were classified as water body pixels while other pixels were classified as non water pixels for each landsat pixel in ncp the surface water frequency in a year was calculated based on eq 4 4 frequency y 1 n y i 1 n y w y i 100 where frequency is the water body frequency of a pixel y is the specified year ny is the number of good quality observations in the location in that year wy i denotes whether one observation is a water body with 1 indicating water and 0 indicating non water the surface water frequencies of individual pixels in the year 2020 and the period 1987 2020 varied substantially across the entire ncp fig 4 a and b after setting a certain threshold surface water bodies were extracted from the annual maps of water body frequency and their areas were varied according to different thresholds fig 4c in this study swa refers to the area of year long surface water bodies covered by water throughout the year a good agreement of the interannual variations and trends of swa between our water frequency data set with the threshold of 0 75 and jrc year long water data set after 2000 has been observed fig 4c however the annual swa from our data set was higher than that from the jrc data set before 2000 when some data were missing in the jrc water data set wang et al 2020b therefore the water body frequency of 0 75 was set to be the threshold to extract year long water bodies in this study which was also consistent with our previous studies wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2017 zou et al 2018 we used the random sampling approach and very high resolution vhr imagery from digitalglobe centre national d etudes spatiales cnes astrium at google earth platform to assess the accuracies of annual maps of surface water bodies the accuracies of the year long water body maps in 2000 2010 and 2020 were validated for each year the land cover types within a total of 600 random regions of interest rois with 100 m radius circles equal to roughly 27 000 landsat pixels across the entire ncp were visually interpreted by using vhr images in google earth fig 5 showed the spatial distributions of 169 rois for water and 431 rois for non water which were used for accuracy assessmemt of the surface water map in 2020 in order to ensure the temporal consistency of reference data and water mapping results we chose and interpreted the vhr images within the rois in the same year with the resultant maps of surface water bodies finally we generated the confusion matrices for the water maps of these three years on the envi 5 3 platform for accuracy assessment the results showed an overall accuracy of 97 6 kappa coefficient of 0 93 for the year 2000 96 7 0 91 for the year 2010 and 97 4 0 93 for the year 2020 respectively table 1 2 3 2 statistical analysis of swa dynamics based on the annual binary maps of surface water bodies of the ncp generated in this study we firstly aggregated the 30 m maps into area percentage maps of swa at both 0 5 arc degree and 1 km resolutions we then investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa at both pixel and regional scales firstly we applied the theil sen slope estimator and the mann kendall test method to annual swa percentage maps spatial resolutions of 0 5 arc degree and 1 km to obtain the temporal trend of swa and its statistical significance level in each pixel during 1987 2020 the theil sen is a median based non parametric trend test estimator which has no strict requirement for specific distribution of data yang et al 2019 the mann kendall test is a non parametric trend test method commonly used to detect trends in long term time series related to the geoscience field forkel et al 2015 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 secondly we investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 at the provincial scale using the arcgis 10 3 software platform and python 2 7 programming language similarly we derived the interannual variations and trends of ap and water evaporation at the pixel and regional scales 2 3 3 attribution analysis of swa dynamics surface water bodies in the ncp mainly include rivers e g yellow river inland reservoirs lakes used for water conservancy projects and recreation purposes and coastal aquaculture ponds therefore the trends of swa could be dominated by the variations of these kinds of water bodies here we firstly carried out the analyses of the consistency between the spatial patterns of swa changes and the geographical locations of the reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds secondly we investigated the variations of anthropogenic i e areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds and climatic i e ap factors in the ncp thirdly we applied partial correlations to quantitatively explore the effects of these factors on swa dynamics 2 3 4 effects of swa dynamics on water evaporation considering that surface water bodies are changing and will strongly impact the available water resources through evaporation zhan et al 2019 here we quantitatively explored the effects of swa dynamics on evaporation in the ncp through the following two steps firstly we investigated and found the consistency between the spatial patterns of linear trends of water evaporation and swa in the study area during 2000 2020 secondly we explored the correlation between annual total water evaporation and swa using the linear regression model 3 results 3 1 increasing swa in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 generally swa showed an increasing trend in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 fig 6 specifically among the 336 0 5 0 5 arc degree grid cells of swa percentage maps 165 49 1 of them experienced a significant p 0 05 increase of swa during 1987 2020 fig 6a the most remarkable expansion of swa occurred in the eastern coastal regions and shandong province fig 6a furthermore the analyses based on higher resolution 1 km 1 km grid cells of swa percentage maps showed that the large reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds experienced the significant expansion of swa fig 6b in terms of the interannual variations and trends swa continuously increased from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 increased by 68 0 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr fig 6c at the provincial scale we found that the most rapid expansion of swa 75 0 km2 yr occurred in shandong province followed by the provinces of henan 16 7 km2 yr hebei 8 9 km2 yr and shanxi 4 8 km2 yr swa of shandong province has more than doubled during the period from 1469 7 km2 in 1987 to 3586 4 km2 in 2020 increased by 144 b t is the only region that experienced the decline of swa 3 6 km2 yr during 1987 2020 fig 6c however the trends of swa in b t were different in different periods specifically swa increased during 1987 1995 and then decreased after 1995 it was worth noting that swa in b t showed an increasing trend again from 2010 to 2020 25 9 21 4 km2 yr especially after 2014 26 8 km2 yr which was the start time of the implementation of the south to north water division snwd project 3 2 swa expansion from increasing reservoirs and aquaculture ponds consistent with the finding that the reservoirs lakes and coastal aquaculture ponds have greatly expanded based on landsat images fig 6b the statistical data about the areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds from the statistical yearbooks also show increasing areas of reservoirs lakes 43 1 km2 yr and aquaculture ponds 64 3 km2 yr in the ncp during 1987 2019 fig 7 a and b human activities including the construction and extension of inland reservoirs lakes due to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development could contribute to the expansion of swa for example the ecological urgent water replenishing euwr project was implemented in shandong province in 2002 to divert water from the yangtze river to sustain the lake nansihu huang 2003 while the yellow river division yrd project was implemented in shanxi province since 2002 the snwd project in the provinces of henan hebei and shandong started in 2014 which was also followed by the gradual increase of swa fig 7 showed the expansion processes of several typical inland reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds namely reservoir xiaolangdi which was used for flood and drought management and electricity production reservoir dalangdian which was used for domestic water use coastal aquaculture ponds in the changzhou city of hebei province and dongying city of shandong province in terms of the effects of climate change on the dynamics of swa we found that ap 3 3 mm yr showed significantly p 0 05 negative trends during 1987 2019 fig 8 which suggested that the changes in precipitation were not conducive to the increase of swa over the past three decades statistical analyses also proved that anthropogenic factors areas of reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds played significantly positive effects on the expansion of swa rather than precipitation firstly the areas of reservoirs lakes r 0 84 p 0 01 and aquaculture ponds r 0 84 p 0 01 were significantly and positively correlated with swa expansion during 1987 2019 while ap r 0 2 p 0 27 was not significantly correlated with swa changes fig 9 secondly partial correlations indicated that the relationship between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa remains significant after controlling for the effect of ap however controlling for the effect of the areas of aquaculture ponds strongly decreases partial correlation between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa which suggested that most of the information on swa variations that are contained in the areas of reservoirs lakes can be found in the areas of aquaculture ponds the partial correlations between the areas of aquaculture ponds and swa were similar to those between the areas of reservoirs lakes and swa these statistical analyses suggested that the expansion of swa was mainly controlled by the increases of the areas of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs lakes rather than the changes of ap 3 3 increasing water evaporation and potential effects on regional water storage fig 10 showed the spatial patterns of linear trends of swa spatial resolution of 1 km and water evaporation 1 km and 0 5 arc degree in the ncp during 2000 2020 as can be seen the regions i e reservoirs lakes coastal aquaculture ponds with swa expansion experienced significant increases in water evaporation during 2000 2020 fig 10a and b the increases of evaporation were the most remarkable in the eastern parts of ncp especially in shandong province fig 10c coinciding with the most rapid expansion of swa in the province fig 6 the total water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp during 2000 2020 fig 10d the linear regression between the changes of water evaporation and swa showed that there was a significant p 0 01 and positive correlation between the increase of total water evaporation and expansion of swa fig 10e the consistent spatial patterns of water evaporation rise and swa expansion together with the significant correlation between the interannual variations of water evaporation and swa suggested that the expansion of swa greatly contributed to the increases of water evaporation in the ncp considering that shandong province experienced the most rapid increases in swa and water evaporation we also quantitatively studied the effects of water evaporation increase on total water storage in shandong the results showed that annual total water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 03 km3 yr in shandong province during 2000 2020 fig 10f and there was a significant p 0 01 and positive correlation between the increase of water evaporation and expansion of swa fig 10g the annual increase of water evaporation in shandong was equivalent to a loss of total water storage by 0 25 mm yr in the province for the regions covered by surface water bodies in shandong in 2000 2085 km2 the annual increase of water evaporation was equivalent to water storage decline by 14 4 mm while for the surface water regions in 2020 3586 km2 annual water evaporation increase was equal to water storage decline by 8 4 mm therefore the increasing evaporation due to swa expansion could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the surface water regions in shandong province during 2000 2020 4 discussion 4 1 implications of expanded swa in the ncp despite the long term severe water shortage in the ncp this study revealed the expanded areas of surface water bodies in the region over the past three decades the expansion of swa is of great significance to human well being and ecosystem in such a water limited region because 1 the widely distributed reservoirs lakes ensure water supply to industrial and agricultural production and domestic uses gao et al 2017 o reilly et al 2015 2 some large lakes e g lake baiyangdian coupled with its surrounding runoff are internationally important wetlands playing a vital role in protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem by providing habitats for a wide range of precious species liu et al 2013 tao et al 2015b 3 the construction of urban artificial lakes provide recreation landscapes for residents however some ecological and environmental issues brought by the expanded swa can not be ignored firstly previous studies jia et al 2021 mao et al 2018 ren et al 2019 have documented that the transformation of wetlands to aquaculture ponds in coastal regions of the ncp damaged the habitats of coastal mangroves and reeds as well as numerous precious fish and endangered migratory birds jiang et al 2015 secondly aquaculture ponds greatly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 and affected local water quality through the use of artificial feed and chemical additives pattanaik and narendra prasad 2011 thirdly as the water in some lakes or reservoirs is extracted from underground aquifers the exposure of groundwater to the surface could increase water evaporation and therefore strongly impact the regional water resources zhan et al 2019 in this study we found consistent spatial patterns and a significant correlation between water evaporation increase and swa expansion as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could cause excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy sacks et al 1994 this study suggests that the expansion of surface water bodies could accelerate the loss of regional water resources through evaporation finally the increase of reservoir numbers could cause the loss of river connectivity and threaten the ecosystem process these rivers support grill et al 2019 4 2 effects of future climate on surface water resources future climate change could significantly affect the long term variations of surface water bodies therefore understanding the trends of climate conditions in the future is of great significance to sustainable management and the use of water resources using the cmip5 projected data under both medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios the trends of temperature and precipitation in the ncp from 2020 to 2100 were investigated the results showed that both the precipitation and temperature would increase in the region in the future under these scenarios the annual mean of daily minimum temperature will significantly p 0 01 increase at a rate of 0 02 c yr and 0 03 c yr under the scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 11 while the annual mean of daily maximum temperature will significantly increase at a rate of 0 06 c yr for both the two scenarios the rcp 4 5 projected the lowest increase of ap 0 52 mm yr p 0 01 while the rcp 8 5 projected the highest increase 1 19 mm yr p 0 01 raising temperature is likely to affect et and atmospheric water storage and thereby the precipitation salem et al 2018 continuous temperature rise in the future could further stress the pressure of water shortage in the ncp and bring considerable threats to natural ecosystem and restrict regional sustainable development on the one hand the increasing temperature could cause more consumption of surface water resources by agricultural irrigation zhang et al 2019c on the other hand more substantial water evaporation induced by higher temperatures would lead to the decline of surface water resources and even the drying out of runoff and wetlands and consequently affect the biodiversity in riparian or wetland ecosystems therefore the water resource crisis of the ncp would continue in the future and effective water saving measures are urgent 4 3 comparison with previous studies for such a water limited region of the ncp previous studies mainly focused on the dynamics of groundwater resources and total water storage using the data of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace previous studies aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 pan et al 2017 qin et al 2013 have revealed that the ncp was one of the three most serious depletion hotspots of water storage in the world and identified the intense agricultural irrigation as the main driving factor of the depleting water storage in the ncp in the past decades for example huang et al 2015 detected the variations of groundwater storage in the ncp during 2003 2013 and found the depleted groundwater storage 16 mm yr owing to groundwater overexploitation xu et al 2019 revealed the decline of total water storage 7 mm yr in the region from 2003 to 2016 due to agricultural irrigation surface water is also an important component of total water storage though previous studies pekel et al 2016 song et al 2018 tao et al 2015b wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2018 have investigated the dynamics of surface water bodies they only focused on the variations and trends of surface water bodies as well as their driving factors the studies about the effects of the dynamics of surface water bodies on total water storage are still very limited for example zhang et al 2019a investigated the changes of lakes in china over eight periods every five or ten years for a period during 1960s 2015 by using landsat toa images and topographic maps however they only focused on the dynamics of lakes with sizes over 1 km2 in addition the epoch based analyses of lake dynamics could miss important information e g turning points about the inter annual variations of surface water bodies due to their strong variability similar studies included the analyses of lake dynamics in the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2017 and mongolian plateau tao et al 2015b during several sparse epochs in contrast our current study could depict the complete processes of swa dynamics in the ncp from 1987 to the present though our previous study wang et al 2020b investigated the interannual variations and spatial patterns of trends of swa and total water storage in china during 1989 2016 and revealed the spatial temporal divergency and consistency between swa and total water storage in the whole country however that study focused on analyzing water resources dynamics at the national scale lacking the quantitative analyses of the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage in the ncp in this study we firstly investigated the continuous change processes of swa and their driving factors in the ncp from 1987 to the present using all the available landsat sr data and gee we then quantitatively analyzed the effects of swa dynamics on total water storage by investigating the relationships between the changes of swa and water evaporation we found that the expanded swa due to the increasing artificial reservoirs and aquaculture ponds could accelerate the loss of water in the ncp through increased evaporation 0 09 km3 yr the data and methods used in this study to continuously monitor the dynamics of surface water bodies and explore the effects of swa changes on total water storage are also applicable to similar researches in other regions across the globe 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in this study though our current study together with previous researches pekel et al 2016 song et al 2018 tao et al 2015a wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019b zou et al 2018 have contributed to the research progresses of water resources changes we have to note that there are still uncertainties and limitations remained in the methods and analyses in this study the uncertainties of the methods remote sensing data and those ancillary data et and precipitation used in this study were analyzed firstly surface water body mapping using 30 m spatial resolution landsat imagery could miss some water bodies with sizes smaller than 30 m 30 m secondly some bad quality observations e g clouds terrain shadows snows may remain after quality filtering which might have led to some low frequency inundation noises in the water body maps wang et al 2020b therefore the spatial temporal dynamics of year long surface water bodies in this study can provide much more reliable information than that of seasonal water bodies in addition it should be noted that some other satellite data e g sentinel 2 with higher spatial resolutions have been released in gee the virtual constellation of landsat with these sensors could provide observations with both high spatial and temporal resolutions for continuous monitoring of water body dynamics wulder et al 2015 zhou et al 2019b finally we used the theil sen slope estimator and the mann kendall test method to investigate the spatial patterns of linear trends of swa in the ncp during 1987 2020 however it is notable that some abrupt changes are not likely to be reflected in swa trends especially in the early or late of the time series the use of those climate data products to analyze the driving factors of swa dynamics and their effects on total water storage could also bring some uncertainties to the studies though pml v2 et data were modeled by using penman monteith pm equation and taking modis data albedo emissivity and leaf area index and gldas meteorological forcing data as input data zhang et al 2019b this data set has been recognized as one of the most advanced and popular sources for actual values of et and evaporation and compared favorably with several eddy covariance flux towers fuentes et al 2020 for example he et al 2020 verified and compared the three high resolution et products pml v2 ssebop v4 and mod16a2 in north china and found that pml v2 showed the highest consistency with the fluctuation trend observed at the site the combined use of the two data sets with different spatial resolutions could also bring some uncertainties to the trends of precipitation as there are inevitable deviations in generating these two kinds of precipitation data sets of cru ts and era5 however they are commonly used data products and have been widely applied in researches related to climate change ukkola et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and hydrology and water resources li et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in addition we need to recognize that the water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm used in this study can only detect surface water bodies given that wetlands not only refer to the regions covered by surface water bodies but also the surrounding vegetated regions and the mixes of water and vegetation li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 mao et al 2020 the extensive applications of the algorithm in monitoring the dynamics of wetlands should consider the seasonality of the composites of water and vegetation thus the algorithms should be modified accordingly 5 conclusion the ncp is one of the most important agricultural production regions and densely populated areas in china using all the available landsat imagery water indices and threshold based water mapping algorithm and cloud computing platform gee this study investigated the interannual variations and trends of swa in the ncp from 1987 to 2020 we showed that swa in the ncp significantly increased from 4740 0 km2 in 1987 to 7963 7 km2 in 2020 increased by 68 0 at a rate of 101 9 km2 yr shandong province experienced the most remarkable increase of swa 75 0 km2 yr followed by the provinces of henan 16 7 km2 yr hebei 8 9 km2 yr and shanxi 4 8 km2 yr b t is the only region that experienced a decrease in swa 3 6 km2 yr we found that the increasing reservoirs lakes owing to the implementation of water projects together with aquaculture development were the main drivers for the expansion of swa in the ncp in addition the water evaporation significantly increased at a rate of 0 09 km3 yr in the ncp during 2000 2020 also shandong province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation 0 03 km3 yr as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs lakes and aquaculture ponds could cause excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy which could accelerate the loss of water resources at a rate of 8 4 14 4 mm yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies the cmip5 future climate projections revealed a significant temperature increase 0 02 0 06 c yr but a small change in precipitation under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios which indicated that the future climate change would add a new threat to water security in the ncp credit authorship contribution statement yan zhou conceptualization methodology formal analysis

3488,the complexity of rainfall canopy interactions is likely to increase under extreme weather events extreme conditions may affect forest structure and change the throughfall tf spatial distribution over time mistakenly claiming the time stability of tf spatial variability can lead to misunderstanding the rainfall canopy interactions obscuring the relationships between weather forests and hydrology herein we rely on an unprecedented six hydrological year event based dataset from the brazilian atlantic forest spanning from 2013 to 2019 summing up 427 rainfall events to assess i the effects of a prolonged drought period on the tf time stability and ii the importance of forest structure for the tf time stability the mean relative difference and time stability index were applied for different period lengths and related to forest structure gross rainfall amount gr maximum rainfall intensity and drought occurrence to assess whether they affect the tf spatial variability the results indicated that the throughfall spatial variability is less time stable during droughts due to a combination of more light intensity events with some extreme intensities 20 mm h 1 which were not observed in the non drought period changes in forest structure became evident after drought conditions and could not be tracked in studies with short monitoring periods since throughfall spatial distribution is driven by forest structure e g tree density species dominance and biomass such dynamics affected the time stability of the spatial variability the time instability was even greater for gr 10 mm because of the greater rainfall canopy interactions prior to canopy saturation therefore not accounting for forest dynamics and drought effects on the tf spatial variability lead to misinterpreting time stability keywords ecohydrology rainfall partitioning canopy traits spatial variability drought atlantic forest 1 introduction forest ecosystems are recognized for their fundamental role in climate regulation water yield carbon uptake and storage as well as biochemical dynamics at local regional and even continental scales zhang et al 2017 however specific hydrological forest studies are needed to better understand these important ecosystem services these studies can enhance knowledge on water regulation and thereby contribute to improve management and conservation policies this could lead to more sustainable practices to mitigate the negative impacts of extreme weather events such as those caused by prolonged droughts which affect people s livelihood and ecosystem health coelho et al 2016 ellison et al 2017 this is critical since anomalously dry years entail more intense droughts in tropical regions nobre et al 2016 expanding their effects over the wet period and modifying the water budget in many forested catchments helman et al 2017 precipitation falling on a forest canopy takes different pathways on its way to the forest floor the incident or gross rainfall is routed to the subcanopy by throughfall and stemflow crockford and richardson 2000 guo et al 2020 throughfall tf is defined as the largest fraction of gross rainfall gr which directly passes through the canopy along with the portions that drip and splash from it stemflow is the minor gr fraction which drains from outlying leaves and branches and is channeled to the bole or stem of plants levia and germer 2015 liu et al 2018 llorens and domingo 2007 such rainfall redistribution is driven by both weather and forest characteristics van stan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 rainfall intensity duration and amount under different wind speeds and directions have been recognized as the main meteorological drivers of rainfall redistribution in forests e g nanko et al 2011 on the other hand the structure and architecture of the forest canopy are generally considered the most critical biotic features controlling rainfall redistribution in forests staelens et al 2006 terra et al 2018a such redistribution entails different spatial and temporal dynamics of tf being an important element of forest hydrology and biogeochemistry dynamics metzger et al 2021 as it controls soil moisture patterns junqueira junior et al 2017 oliveira et al 2021 nutrient input and redistribution mantovani et al 2021 tonello et al 2021 preferential pathway formation and groundwater recharge bialkowski and buttle 2015 guswa and spence 2011 forest transpiration guswa and spence 2011 rodrigues et al 2021b root growth and the distribution of tree species according to soil water availability pressland 1976 terra et al 2018b although many studies have addressed the connections between tf and soil moisture in both time and space junqueira junior et al 2017 molina et al 2019 oliveira et al 2021 rodrigues et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 further importance should be given to tf spatial variability and its drivers to enhance understanding of the rainfall forest hydrology connections a variety of internal and external factors are believed to influence tf spatial patterns but the methods for testing them are still in their infancy this is particularly the case for tropical forests therefore there is a great need for studies that address the physical relationships related to the influence of canopy properties on forest hydrological variables one approach used worldwide in various forest ecosystems is that of time stability to assess the dynamics of tf spatial variability over time keim and link 2018 van stan et al 2020 this approach highlights the most time stable locations as well as those which are persistently wetter and or drier than the tf spatial average regardless of the time keim and link 2018 studied the temporal persistence of tf spatial patterns in forest stands in the us pacific northwest region linking time stability with geostatistical properties staelens et al 2006 analyzed the tf spatial variability and temporal stability under a dominant beech tree in relation to the canopy cover and found that the tf spatial variability was significantly higher during the leafed season than during the leafless season at different time scales zhang et al 2016 found that tf spatial variability in xerophytic shrub canopies is temporally stable zhu et al 2021 also studied tf time stability in a semi arid mountain range in china and related the stability to the spatial dynamics of soil moisture wullaert et al 2009 classified the tf spatial variability in a montane rainforest as extremely stable over time regardless of the time period analyzed therefore the tf spatial variability seems to be time stable in most of the ecosystems around the world however zimmermann et al 2009 observed that the temporal persistence of throughfall at individual plots disappeared after one year in a tropical semi deciduous moist forest the need for longer event based sample periods to better characterize patterns in throughfall distribution was highlighted by levia and frost 2006 in a broad review about the spatial and temporal variability of throughfall long sample periods enable observing forest and weather dynamics and how these dynamics affect tf variability none of the abovementioned studies performed an assessment based on more than four years of observation and or included extreme weather conditions such as prolonged droughts a knowledge gap arises as the time stability of tf spatial variability may be affected by intense droughts which in turn would lead to i greater impacts on forest dynamics and biogeochemistry cycles such as biomass loss due to tree mortality especially for large ones ryan 2015 ii favoring of drought tolerant tree species esquivel muelbert et al 2018 and iii change in carbon balance choat et al 2018 schlesinger et al 2016 although several studies have evaluated the temporal persistence of throughfall spatial patterns in temperate forests i e staelens et al 2006 semi arid mountain forests i e zhu et al 2021 and tropical forests i e wullaert et al 2009 only a few studies considered forest traits as drivers of throughfall time stability mostly focusing on individual tree traits as opposed to forest traits e g canopy thickness lai leaf characteristics and stem architecture sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 aware of this importance stogsdill et al 1989 assessed the relationship between thinning and throughfall input to improve soil water availability in a pinus plantation however the tf observed in tropical forests where canopies are closed stratified and complex aubry kientz et al 2019 guan et al 2013 has probably interacted and responded to the traits of several trees therefore it is crucial to appraise the consequences of changes in forest structure as a consequence of droughts on the tf dynamics as further highlighted in this study the usually short monitoring period has blurred the real dynamics of tf spatial distribution which in turn has led to misinterpretation of tf time stability tropical forests are dynamic ecosystems that respond to soil moisture and nutrient availability and are therefore subject to constant modification souza et al 2021 terra et al 2018b as the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture and nutrient availablitiy is partly determined by tf metzger et al 2021 oliveira et al 2021 misunderstanding the tf spatiotemporal distribution precludes correctly assessing forest growth and dynamics under a changing climate with more likely stressful conditions anderegg et al 2020 a better understanding of forest resilience therefore depends on a proper assessment of the temporal evolution of tf spatial distribution southeastern brazil harbors part of the brazilian atlantic forest one of the world s most biodiverse areas myers et al 2000 with remarkable endemism and a strong hydrological role mello et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2021b however this biome has been highly degraded by the historical expansion of both urban and agricultural activities dean 1995 joly et al 2014 ribeiro et al 2009 there is currently ca 12 4 of the original extent when considering remnants larger than 3 ha sos mata atlântica access link https www sosma org br which points out the biome devastation degree fortunately the largest remaining atlantic forest patches are located in mountain ranges which are advantageous environments from a hydrological persepctive i e water yield mello et al 2019 teixeira et al 2021 this reinforces the importance of the atlantic forest for water management due to its close relationship with water availability terra et al 2018b however long term field data for hydrology and water management are scarce in brazil since collecting long term field data is extremely time and resource consuming however such datasets are essential for better resource planning and enable evaluating hydrological behavior at different temporal and spatial scales in brief they provide a better understanding of complex hydrological processes notably in relation to tropical forest environments against this background our study relies on an unprecedented six hydrological year event based dataset spanning from 2013 to 2019 to track the temporal and spatial variability of throughfall in an atlantic forest remnant in southeastern brazil the study was carried out per hydrological year october to september to answer the following questions i do dry conditions affect the time stability of throughfall patterns ii what are the effects of forest structure on throughfall spatial variability and time stability under different drought conditions and iii have previous studies mistakenly suggested throughfall time stability considering that the atlantic forest is a fundamental biome for water resources in brazil mello et al 2019 teixeira et al 2021 answering these questions can help the eco hydrological stakeholders address adaptations to adverse conditions and improve strategies to maintain ecosystem services moreover this study aims to stimulate reflection on the suggested throughfall time stability in a dynamic environment as misinterpretation can lead to erroneously understanding the rainfall forest hydrology connections in a climate change scenario 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site 44 58 15 w and 21 13 42 s is a 6 35 ha atlantic forest remnant fig 1 in an advanced successional stage after full protection in 1986 souza et al 2021 the forest is classified as semi deciduous since up to 50 of its trees lose their leaves during the dry season which is an adaptation to rainfall seasonality oliveira filho and fontes 2000 the canopy is stratified and three tree layers can be identified the main layer consists of trees ranging from 10 m to 15 m in height and forms the remnant body emergent trees scatter across the main layer with 20 m in height upper layer whereas small trees seedlings and bushes compose the understory layer junqueira junior et al 2019 terra et al 2018a there are canopy gaps distributed across the remnant formed by fallen trees rodrigues et al 2021a the position and openness of such gaps are random and mainly depend on the size of the felled trees which caused the openness the study area is upon a gneiss geological formation from the archean period access link http www portalgeologia com br index php mapa col form download tab the soil is a red oxisol with slopes ranging from 5 to 15 in an undulating topography junqueira junior et al 2017 forming a common landscape in southeast brazil atlantic forest oxisol site the climate is characterized by rainy summers and dry winters with well defined rainfall seasonality the wet season extends from october to march and is responsible for 80 of the rainfall whereas the dry season lasts from april to september the average monthly vertical water balance rainfall minus potential evapotranspiration ranges from 75 9 mm in august to 158 6 mm in december the average maximum and minimum temperatures are 27 2 1 6 c and 15 4 2 5 c respectively wind intensity is greatest in september 2 9 m s 1 and least in february may and june 2 2 m s 1 with slight variations throughout the year easterly wind directions prevail in the rainy season and northeasterly directions in the dry season average sunshine per day ranges from 4 9 h in december to 8 0 h in august highlighting the influence of clouds during the rainy season the climate is temperate cwa according to the köppen classification these climatological features are based on the 1981 2010 time series from a weather station placed 2 km from the atlantic forest remnant provided by the national institute of meteorology inmet 2 2 gross rainfall and throughfall monitoring gr was collected from october 2013 to september 2019 using both totalizing and tipping bucket rain gauges both gauges were installed on the top of a 22 m meteorological tower mot fig 1d and presented good agreement between their readings r2 0 95 junqueira junior et al 2019 the tipping gauge measured rainfall at 0 2 mm resolution campbell scientific cr10x and stored it in a 10 minute time step in a hobbo datalogger the water collected in the totalizing gauge was drained into a 60 l bin placed at the base of the mot the readings were performed with graduated cylinders of measuring volumes ranging from 0 1 l to 1 0 l next three totalizer rain gauges were installed surrounding the atlantic forest remnant to correct inconsistencies in the gr dataset rodrigues et al 2021a fig 1b throughfall tf was measured using 31 rain gauges across inventory plots fig 1c these plots were selected because they represent the main tree species distribution and the terrain features oliveira et al 2021 such gauges have a collected area of 378 5 cm2 and were installed 150 cm above the floor to avoid splash in rodrigues et al 2021a the gauges were equipped with meshes to avoid clogging with leaves and debris the meshes were cleaned at least once a week during the rainy season to guarantee representativeness of the measuring observed by junqueira junior et al 2019 this representativeness refers to a low standard error in the non roving distribution of the 31 gauges and periodic maintenance was needed to maintain the suitability of the present configuration throughfall and gross rainfall were monitored four hours after the rainfall event to guarantee total dryness of the canopy the monitoring was carried out the next morning for events that had started in the late afternoon 2 3 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi is a probabilistic approach to characterize drought occurrence frequency and duration based on a time series of rainfall mckee et al 1993 the interesting aspect about this index is that rainfall deficit or surplus can be highlighted together with its return period the spi was selected because it has been widely applied in both brazillian savanna junqueira et al 2020 and atlantic forest biomes silva and mello 2021 for water resource management the second reason is because spi standardizes the rainfall for a location and period of interest quiring 2009 which enables the results of this study regarding drought occurrence to be compared with others dealing with throughfall spatial variability worldwide the steps for computing spi were i a monthly time series of rainfall provided by inmet was accumulated on the scale of a hydrological year from october to september from 1961 to 2019 resulting in a total of 58 hydrological years spi is strongly influenced by the time series length and more than 50 years is recommended to avoid distortions quiring 2009 ii the gamma 2 parameter probability function was fitted to this time series and its adequacy was assessed using the anderson darling test anderson and darling 1952 1954 at 5 probability level iii the respective probability was applied to an inverse standard normal distribution µ 0 σ 1 mckee et al 1993 the positive and negative deviations are the spi and indicate rainfall surplus and deficit respectively monthly rainfall was integrated from october to september to account for drought occurrence in the hydrological year scale which covers the period from 1961 1962 to 2018 2019 in order to analyze the studied period in the context of prolonged drought different time scales indicate different impacts of rainfall deficits on water availability characterizing the agricultural meteorological and hydrological droughts quiring 2009 although long periods such as the hydrological year are preferred for water resource management prolonged droughts increase forest dynamics making the use of the hydrological year scale adequate to assess their effect on throughfall further evidence for considering long periods is that forests have a delayed response to droughts anderegg et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2021b the persistent dry weather can also be shown by comparing the gross rainfall gr air temperature t and air relative humidity rh of the 2013 2019 period study period to the regional climatological average 1981 2010 moreover the maximum rainfall intensity of one hour imax was selected from each rainfall event to assess the likely differences on rainfall variability in the presence or absence of droughts 2 4 spatial variability and time stability the spatial variability of throughfall was assessed on an event scale by means of the coefficient of variation cv and the 31 rain gauge datasets collected in the study period the time stability was assessed through the time stability indicator tsi which is a function of the mean relative difference mrdj and the standard deviation of the relative difference σ rd ij minet et al 2013 vachaud et al 1985 1 rd i j tf i j tf i tf i 2 tf i 1 m j 1 m tf ij 3 mrd j 1 n i 1 n rd ij 4 σ rd j 1 n 1 i 1 n rd i j mrd j 2 in which rdij is the relative difference of time i in the rain gauge position j tf i is the spatial mean of tf on time i mrd j is calculated for all rain gauges and represents the behavior of tf in the position j in relation to the spatial average tf mrdj 0 represents wetter locations mrdj 0 drier locations and mrdj 0 locations with tf amount close to the forest average mrdj represents the plots of the atlantic forest remnant that are wetter dryer or closer to the spatial average tf however the standard deviation of the relative positions indicates how much the tf spatial pattern varies between events vachaud et al 1985 therefore it is not appropriate to only rely on mrdj to define time stability because its variability σ rd ij is also important therefore tsi was developed to integrate the effect of mrdj and σ rd ij 5 tsi mrd j 2 σ rd j 2 the lower the tsi value the more time stable the location is assessing tsi differs from mrd because it describes the persistence of the spatial distribution i e the tf time stability whereas mrd describes the expected tf spatial distribution throughout the study period two approaches were considered to assess the tf time stability i the single from 2013 2014 to 2018 2019 and ii the integrated 2013 2015 2015 2017 2017 2019 2013 2016 2016 2019 2013 2017 2013 2019 hydrological years 2 5 forest structure forest structure variables used in this study were obtained from a permanent plot network sampled in the atlantic forest remnant a total of 126 plots of 20 20 m 400 m2 were established in the fragment in 1987 these plots were re measured in the years 1992 1996 2001 2006 2010 2015 and 2017 all arboreal individuals with a diameter at breast height dbh 5 cm were identified and measured in each plot souza et al 2021 for the trees which presented tillering we transformed the diameter to a unique value according to the following equation macdicken et al 1991 6 d d n 1 2 d n 2 2 d n 2 in which d is the transformed diameter and dn is the tillered tree diameter botanical material was collected and exsiccates were made for species identification tree nomenclature was standardized using the flora do brasil according to the apg iv classification system bfg 2021 the angiosperm phylogeny group et al 2016 we selected the 31 abovementioned plots from the field survey fig 1b i e each of the 31 forest plots that contained a rain gauge we calculated the following variables for each plot from the forest inventory data of 2010 2015 and 2017 aboveground biomass agb basal area g mean diameter at breast height dbh coefficient of variation from the mean dbh cv dbh number of trees per hectare n ha 1 species richness s shannon diversity index h and pielou evenness index j table 1 the aboveground biomass for each plot was determined by each forest inventory year i e 2010 2015 and 2017 using the equation proposed by chave et al 2014 through the biomass package réjou méchain et al 2017 in r language r core team 2020 the equation provides individual tree agb by considering the tree diameter d and wood density wd as well as the site coordinates which enable estimating the measure of environmental stress e to do so the wood density is achieved from the global wood density database gwd therefore the plot agb was obtained as the sum of the agb of the trees within the plot 2 6 multivariable analyses we followed the protocol presented in fig 2 in order to conduct the analyses correlating mrd and forest strucucture data we ran this protocol for both the 10 mm and the 10 mm set of events therefore we first ran a principal components analysis pca pearson 1901 hotelling 1933 jolliffe 1973 of the annual mean relative difference mrd data mrd 13 14 mrd 14 15 mrd 15 16 mrd 16 17 mrd 17 18 and mrd 18 19 and a pca for the annual time stability indicator tsi data tsi 13 14 tsi 14 15 tsi 15 16 tsi 16 17 tsi 17 18 and tsi 18 19 in order to deal with a set of multiple variables pca is a much used unconstrained ordination analysis and is considered the best way to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data to determine what statistically and practically matters moreover this analysis is widely used as an exploratory tool which helps to visualize patterns out of multivariate data the basic assumptions of pca are i multiple variables multiple variables are required to perform the analysis ii variables should be measured at continuous level although ordinal variables are frequently used see hoshiyar et al 2021 iii sample adequacy generally at least 5 to 10 cases per variable is recommended for pca analysis iv linear relationships among variables it is assumed that the relationships between variables are linear since pca is based on person s correlation coefficients and v no significant outliers assumptions i ii and iii were obviously met since the variables are scaled prior to the analysis assumptions iv and v were also met see tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 and figs s1 s2 s3 and s4 thus we used the envfit function vegan package for r oksanen et al 2020 in aiming to interpret the meaning of the pca outputs with the available forest variables dbh 10 n 10 g 10 cv dbh 10 agb 10 s 10 h 10 j 10 dbh 15 n 15 g 15 cv dbh 15 agb 15 s 15 h 15 j 15 dbh 17 n 17 g 17 cv dbh 17 agb 17 s 17 h 17 and j 17 and to only select a subset of forest variables that appear to be important for the pca arrangements the envfit function is designed to calculate regression of supplementary not explanatory variables on ordination axes of uncontrained ordination and test the significance of these regressions by a permutation test therefore the forest variables were projected onto the pca ordination diagrams as supplementary variables i e regressions of each forest variable were independently fit to ordination axes and their significance was tested by a permutation test with the number of permutations 999 next we used redundancy analyses to represent the relationship between the mrd and the forest variables as well as the relationship between tsi and the forest variables redundancy analysis rda reduces the multivariable universe to an easier to understand two or three dimensional space where the variations of the response variables can be related to those of the explanatory variables ter braak and looman 1994 therefore rda is a contrained ordination technique ordination with covariates or predictors used to explain a dataset y using a dataset x legendre et al 2011 we used the forest dataset x as the explanatory variable of the scaled mrd dataset y as well as the scaled tsi dataset only including those variables in the forest set x whose vectors were significantly or marginally significant p value 0 1 according to the envfit outputs for each case tables s5 s6 s7 and s8 the assumptions of rda are rather the same as the pca and have been met for our data tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 one of the main advantages of both pca and rda is the diagram biplot which enables visually interpreting multiple correlations the variables are typically positively correlated when two vectors are close in the diagram and form a small angle 3 results 3 1 prolonged drought during the study period the adequacy of the gamma pdf to model the frequency distribution of the hydrological year rainfall series was confirmed through the anderson darling test fig 3 a therefore the spi can be applied to assess drought conditions in the study region dry and wet hydrological years interspersed up to 2011 2012 indicating drought seasonality occurrence in the region however a prolonged drought period could be observed at the end of the time series fig 3b such a prolonged meteorological drought impacts the atlantic forest hydrology as highlighted by rodrigues et al 2021b and souza et al 2021 and is therefore expected to interfere in the throughfall time stability thus the study period was split into two to assess the effects of droughts on the throughfall time stability i prolonged drought period october 2013 to september 2018 and ii non drought period october 2018 september 2019 table s1 depicts the spi classification in accordance with the world meteorological organization wmo world meteorological organization wmo 2012 gr and rh were below average for most of the months during the study period whereas temperature was greater than average fig 3c overall gr was 250 mm less than the climatological year average rh ranged from 58 4 to 74 8 and from 62 3 to 79 8 for the 2013 2019 and 1981 2010 periods respectively moreover t ranged from 17 2 c to 23 6 c in the study period whereas t ranged from 16 9 c to 22 8 c for the climatological average the behavior of gr t and rh indicated that the study period was drier and hotter than the average long term conditions of the region the box plots regarding rainfall intensity highlight the different distribution of maximum rainfall intensity between the prolonged drought and non drought period fig 4 a greater concentration of light rainfall events was observed in the prolonged drought period in which the first second and third quartiles were 0 25 mm h 1 1 78 mm h 1 and 5 08 mm h 1 respectively conversely they were 0 76 mm h 1 3 05 mm h 1 and 7 87 mm h 1 during the non drought period respectively however heavier rainfall events were observed in the prolonged drought period characterizing a greater variability of rainfall intensities fig 4 this is confirmed by the greater coefficient of variation in the prolonged drought cv 141 versus that in the non drought period cv 108 3 2 canopy water balance box plot and filtering techniques highlighted 25 rainfall events out of 427 encompassing 6 hydrological years as outliers these events were then removed before the analyses annual gross rainfall gr ranged from 860 mm 2013 2014 to 1422 mm 2018 2019 throughfall tf ranged from 707 mm to 1135 mm 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 respectively and represented up to 84 5 of gr 2016 2017 most of the throughfall occurred in the wet season up to 94 2 in 2015 2016 gp and tf in the prolonged drought period added up to 5232 mm and 4097 mm respectively with tf gp of 78 3 in contrast gp and tf in the non drought period were 1422 mm and 1135 tf gp 79 8 respectively on the event scale the tf gr ratio increased with gross rainfall regardless of the period analyzed prolonged drought or non drought periods fig 5 tf gr ranged from 2 4 to 99 1 and from 19 8 to 98 1 in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively the tf gr followed logarithmic behavior in both analyzed periods with gr describing 60 7 of the tf gr variability in the non drought period fig 5b in contrast only 33 4 of tf gr variability was described by gr in the prolonged drought period fig 5b the logarithimic tendency was similar for small rainfall events gr 10 mm and became different beyond this threshold moreover gr represented 99 and 97 of tf s variability in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively fig 5a the linear pattern is the same regardless of the rainfall amount or 10 mm highlighting an overall relationship between these two variables evaporation from canopy interception accounted for an average 22 4 of gr ranging from 153 4 mm 17 8 to 333 8 mm 27 7 in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively canopy evaporation in the prolonged drought added up to 1135 mm accounting for 21 7 of gr whereas 287 mm 20 2 of gr was observed in the non drought period as shown in fig 3b the range of canopy evaporation was larger in the prolonged drought 0 9 to 97 6 than in the non drought periods 1 9 to 80 2 3 3 gross rainfall period length and throughfall time stability the tf spatial variability represented by the coefficient of variation decreased up to the threshold of gr 10 mm and stabilized at cv 25 regardless of drought or non drought condition fig 5c i e greater spatial variability occurs for events 10 mm even under different climatological conditions table s1 the wet and dry plots were more acute for events below the threshold gr 10 mm whereas mrdj was closer to 0 for gr 10 mm figs 6 and 7 the greater tf time stability is remarkable for greater amounts of gross rainfall gr due to the lower fluctuations of mrdj fig 7 this is confirmed by tsi which was 0 25 0 09 and 0 49 0 21 when only considering events above and below the threshold gr 10 mm respectively overall the tf spatial pattern is more sensitive to changes in gr for events 10 mm since water input to the remnant becomes more homogeneous as long as gross rainfall increases plots representing the remnant tf average mrd 1 varied between the study years and rainfall amount regarding gr 10 mm plots 70 70 118 109 122 and 65 represented the tf spatial average for 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 periods respectively in contrast plots 1 67 3 62 24 64 and 60 could be used to determine the tf spatial average in 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively for gr 10 mm although there were no differences in the metric ranges the relative positions of the inventory plots changed throughout the hydrological years figs 6 and 7 and s2 the most drastic changes in the rank position were observed in plots 45 62 96 100 and 101 which changed betweem wet and dry positions plots 45 96 and 101 ranged from 19 21 26 22 and 57 43 drier to 18 16 14 5 and 6 9 wetter than the remnant tf average for gr 10 mm for gr 10 mm moreover plots 62 and 100 ranged from 42 41 and 53 38 wetter to 15 15 and 41 39 drier than the tf spatial average for gr 10 mm for gr 10 mm in contrast plot 120 was drier than the tf spatial average while plot 42 was wetter than the tf spatial average regardless of the measurement time we also integrated different time periods to verify the influence of the the dataset lengths on the time stability of tf spatial variability the rank position of the inventory plots changed among the different lengths regardless of the rainfall amount highlighting different time evolutions of tf spatial variability for the integrated datasets from two hydrological years to the entire period table 2 and figs s3 and s4 3 4 rainfall intensity droughts and the throughfall time stability regarding the maximum rainfall intensity the tf spatial variability decreased up to the threshold of imax 2 5 mm h 1 stabilizing at cv 25 fig 5d in both prolonged drought and non drought periods i e the greater spatial variability occurs for imax 2 5 mm h 1 in the presence and absence of droughts the spatial variability of tf is more time stable in the non drought than in the prolonged drought period as indicated by the lower fluctuation of mrdj fig 8 this is reinforced by the tsi of 0 30 0 11 and 0 41 0 13 in the non drought and prolonged drought period respectively regarding the threshold imax 2 5 mm h 1 tsi was 0 30 0 13 and 0 29 0 08 for events below and above the threshold in the non drought period respectively a greater instability of the tf spatial variability was observed during lighter imax 2 5 mm h 1 than heavier rainfall events in the prolonged drought period indicated by tsi of 0 45 0 12 and 0 37 0 14 respectively plots representing the remnant tf average mrd 1 were different regarding rainfall intensity and the presence or absence of droughts for imax 2 5 mm h 1 plots 21 and 64 prolonged drought period and 1 non drought period can be considered as representative of tf spatial average for imax 2 5 mm h 1 plots 96 and 1 represented the tf spatial average in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively the presense or absence of droughts defined the relative postions of the plots fig 8 changes in plots 101 6 41 60 45 and 21 were more relevant because they changed between wet and dry positions when the study period was split into prolonged drought and non drought periods for instance plots 101 41 60 and 6 became wetter in the non drought period while plot 21 became drier this pattern was observed for imax 2 5 mm h 1 and 2 5 mm h 1 fig 8 overall these plots concentrated at drier and wetter positions in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively highlighting the influence of rainfall intensity distribution fig 4 in the relative spatial distribution of tf 3 5 forest structure and the throughfall time stability the pca with envifit selected forest variables correlated with variations in mrd and tsi data mrd pca for 10 mm events only pointed out the numer of trees n10 n15 and n17 as being important for mrd data arrangement table s5 whereas mrd pca for 10 mm selected the number of trees the plot mean diameter and the evenness index n10 n15 n17 dbh10 dbh15 dbh17 and j17 table s6 tsi pca for 10 mm events pointed out basal area aboveground biomass plot mean diameter diversity and evenness as important for tsi events g10 g15 g17 cv dbh10 h10 h15 j10 j15 dbh17 agb10 agb15 and agb17 table s7 whereas tsi pca for 10 events only selected tree occupation cover variables dbh10 dbh15 dbh17 g10 g15 g17 agb10 agb15 and agb17 table s8 the redundancy analysis rda highlighted different interactions between forest and rainfall redistribution mrd when the threshold gr 10 mm was considered fig 9 rda for gr 10 mm shows that the first and second axes explained nearly 95 of the constrained variation in the data three forest structure variables presented significant p 0 1 contributions to explain variation in the tf matrix n 10 n 15 and n 17 with positive correlations to mrd fig 9a rda for gr 10 mm demonstrates that the first and second axes explained nearly 79 of the constrained variation in the data a total of 8 forest structure variables showed significant p 0 1 contributions to explain variation in the tf matrix n 10 n 15 and n 17 with overall positive correlations to mrd and dbh 10 dbh 15 dbh 17 j 15 and j 17 with negative correlations to mrd fig 9b the rda showed a different influence of forest structure on the tf time stability regarding tsi for gr 10 mm the first and second axes explained 78 2 of the constrained variation with fourteen variables responsible for such variability g 10 cvdbh 10 agb 10 h 10 j 10 g 15 cvdbh 15 agb 15 h 15 j 15 g 17 dbh 17 agb 17 and h 17 p 0 1 with positive correlations to tsi on the other hand dbh 10 agb 10 g 10 dbh 15 agb 15 g 15 dbh 17 agb 17 and g 17 p 0 1 were responsible for explaining 70 3 of the constraining variation in the two axes with positive correlations to tsi for gr 10 mm fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 canopy rainfall interactions and the tf spatial variability although studies have demonstrated the influence of rainfall intensity and amount in throughfall behavior liu et al 2019 sheng and cai 2021 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 we did not find a difference in the cv tendency regardless of the drought intensity fig 5c d moreover the frequency of rainfall events was similar among the study years fig s1 this means that the forest structure and architecture determined the spatial variability of throughfall not the rainfall distribution for gross rainfall 10 mm the canopy is still filling and water entering the forest is mainly due to the existence of gaps free throughfall the formation of some preferential dripping points staelens et al 2006 and drops splashing from the canopy levia et al 2019 as rainfall progresses the canopy reservoir fills and more water is routed to the forest floor carlyle moses et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2021a spatial variability decreases as long as more dripping points occur and stabilizes for events higher than 10 mm cv 25 when the canopy is saturated and the water drains into all dripping pathways allen et al 2013 fathizadeh et al 2014 the same pattern was observed in other forest worldwide sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 su et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 only differing by the threshold and the stable cv table s2 for instance fan et al 2015 observed a threshold of 20 mm in a pine forest decreasing to a stable cv of 16 5 in a mixed deciduous forest staelens et al 2006 observed a threshold of 10 mm and a stable cv of 19 and 11 for the leafed and leafless periods respectively sheng and cai 2021 zhu et al 2021 and su et al 2019 observed a stable cv of 20 in a boreal semi arid mountain forests and mixed evergreen deciduous broadleaved forests respectively the greater stable cv value 25 observed in the atlantic forest remnant may be due to its higher species diversity and stratified canopy terra et al 2018a which create different zones for throughfall carlyle moses and lishman 2015 moreover the greater stable cv value could also be a consequence of the non roving approach used in this study since roving rain gauges after each rainfall event may decrease the throughfall spatial variability fan et al 2015 however junqueira junior et al 2019 and rodrigues et al 2021a confirmed the adequacy of the spatial distribution of rain gauges to represent the tf spatial variability in the forest remnant therefore the more noticeable cv value can be related to the complexity of the atlantic forest remnant the increase in tf gr ratio supports the assumptions about the formation of more drainage pathways as the canopy gets fuller increasing the transformation of gr into tf up to a stable ratio of 82 fig 5b although tf linearly increases with gr fig 5a the tf gr stabilization indicates that the canopy has reached its maximum drainage capacity beyond this point no more drainage pathways are formed and the water entering the forest as tf is a function of the maximum drainage capacity the canopy openness and the weather conditions therefore the canopy rainfall interactions are minimized and the observed variability is mainly due to atmosphere dynamics rather than forest structure for gr 10 mm tf gr variability is driven by canopy evaporation which is a function of the available energy during and between events rodrigues et al 2021a rodrigues et al 2021a called attention to the importance of the energy stored in biomass and air within the atlantic forest remnant in both drought and non drought conditions however external energy arrives by advection and increases canopy evaporation during droughts rodrigues et al 2021a which explains the differences in the tf gp fluctuations between the two analyzed periods fig 5b this fluctuation can also partly be explained by the semi deciduous characteristic of the atlantic forest remnant oliveira filho and fontes 2000 due to the natural leaf loss seasonality which is intensified during prolonged droughts rodrigues et al 2021b furthermore wind direction and intensity contribute to the increase in variability through the rain shadow phenomenon fan et al 2015 although evaporation leaf shedding and wind patterns are important in the variability of tf gr for events 10 mm the acuteness of the increase on the tf gr ratio is mainly due to canopy filling which leads to new dripping points and the greater contribution of tf fig 5b 4 2 influence of forest structure on the time stability of tf spatial variability the redundancy analysis of mrd fig 9 pointed out the forest characteristics that drive the overall tf spatial distribution in the study period 2013 2019 highlighting the characteristics which improve water input more populated plots i e plots with a higher number of trees in our study area input more water to the forest regardless of the rainfall amount fig 9 plots with higher numbers of individuals usually indicate those that are recovering from a disturbance i e gaps created by fallen trees and therefore have higher densities of young trees martins et al 2004 oliveira filho et al 1997 reduced canopy interception is observed in young trees due to their small crown terra et al 2018a wullaert et al 2009 funnel shaped branches germer et al 2006 su et al 2019 and greater canopy openness martins et al 2004 for gr 10 mm the higher dominance of certain tree species lower j values also increases throughfall fig 9 tree species in tropical forests show a wide range of anatomic and architectural traits poorter et al 2006 which can either boost rainfall interception terra et al 2018a or increase throughfall therefore plots with greater water inputs via throughfall are probably dominated by species with improved drainage capacity moreover higher mean tree diameter in 2010 2015 and 2017 had a negative effect on throughfall for gr 10 mm fig 9 this is expected since the more trees there are per area in tropical forests the thinner they tend to be hallé et al 1978 ngueguim et al 2018 the greater rainfall canopy interaction before saturation gr 10 mm highlights the effect of canopy openness for tf since free throughfall is more relevant in events with lower rainfall amounts staelens et al 2006 the importance of canopy openness for tf decreased in large events as also observed by zimmerman et al 2009 therefore the canopy drainage capacity becomes more relevant than the rainfall canopy interaction to spatially distribute throughfall after canopy saturation this is reinforced by the importance assigned to tree species fig 9 which points out the species specific characteristics that improves canopy drainage levia and frost 2006 this information can support decisions toward reforestation by selecting tree species that increase water input forest structure and architecture drive the time stability of tf spatial variability in the atlantic forest remnant as indicated by the rda plot considering the tsi fig 9 regardless of the gross rainfall amount 10 mm or 10 mm the larger the area occupied by the tree boles in a plot as indicated by agb and g the less time stable the plot was this means that throughfall time stable conditions are related to lesser biomass per area the biomass of the atlantic forest remnant is increasing as it moves toward an advanced successional stage souza et al 2021 this is likely the explanation for the importance assigned to dbh because the temporal increase in biomass was greatest in the large diameters classes in the study remnant souza et al 2021 which is consistent with the abovmentioned importance of tree occupation for tf time instability in contrast the importance of h and j for gr 10 mm can be attached to the onset of new dripping points which increases the time instability of tf spatial distribution since tropical forests have a wide range of species with different canopy storage capacity leaf properties such as shape orientation and texture branch architecture canopy structure and hydrophobicity and bark roughness levia and frost 2006 nanko et al 2014 poorter et al 2006 terra et al 2018a the diversity and dominance of certain species provide a distinct time for starting canopy drainage allen et al 2013 this condition in combination with varying rainfall amounts resulted in a variety of spatial configurations of dripping pathways since forest canopy is unsaturated when gr 10 mm these different configurations of dripping points decreased tf time stability i e tf spatial variability was unstable for gr 10 mm this is confirmed by the non significance of h and j in the rda for gr 10 mm beyond this rainfall amount all dripping points had already started homogenizing the time evolution of the tf spatial distribution rda highlights linear relationships between explanatory and response variables ter braak and looman 1994 and some cautions should be taken when dealing with rainfall partitioning the canopy is a complex environment due to the heterogeneity of species leaf characteristics branch angulation water storage capacity and seasonality leaf shedding in the dry period among others the association of the abovementioned characteristics can lead to non linear responses which cannot be observed using rda legendre et al 2010 ter braak and looman 1994 therefore some connections and potential drivers of the throughfall spatial distribution could have been left out however rda was used as an exploratory analysis to shed light on the importance of considering forest dynamics when dealing with the throughfall time stability the results of this study will supplement future studies on forest hydrology and point to the need for considering forest dynamics and weather conditions future works should also increase the time resolution of the measured forest structure variables to track inter season variation and implement scanning technologies such as lidar for a 3d characterization of the canopy 4 3 influence of rainfall intensity on the time stability of tf spatial variability the different distribution of the maximum rainfall intensity between the non drought and prolonged drought periods fig 4 affected the time stability of the tf spatial variability fig 8 the tf spatial variability was less time stable in the prolonged drought period in which a greater variability of imax cv 141 was observed this instability increased even more for rainfall events with imax 2 5 mm h 1 fig 8 canopy rainfall interactions are greater fig 5d for light events because they can either saturate or unsaturate the canopy long events with low intensity saturate the canopy activate all dripping pathways as previously stated and decrease the tf spatial variability conversely unsaturation is likely to occur in short events with low intensity yan et al 2021 different spatial configurations of dripping pathways are formed depending on the rainfall amount intensity and duration this drives the throughfall redistribution in each event changing the spatial distribution over time fig 8 therefore more unstable time conditions can be expected as long as droughts with a concentration of light events become more frequent the tf spatial variability was more time stable for imax 2 5 mm h 1 intense events have greater kinetic energy which reduces canopy storage capacity calder et al 1996 and increases tf yan et al 2021 i e the canopy is easily saturated in these events the tf spatial variability tends to homogenize with greater tf fig 5d decreasing tsi fig 8 however greater tsi values were observed during the prolonged drought period this was likely due to the occurrence of heavier events since the imax was limited to 20 mm h 1 in the non drought period fig 4 higher rainfall intensities splash more water from the canopy nanko et al 2006 which can either be recaptured or become throughfall depending on the canopy thickness nanko et al 2008 more splashes from the canopy added to the diversity of canopy structures terra et al 2018a increased the tf spatial variability in the atlantic forest remnant during the prolonged drought period however the relative contribution of each throughfall type free drip and splash in the time stability needs further investigation for instance the formation of splash throughfall is greater at the onset of events levia et al 2019 and its random distribution likely increases spatial variability therefore future studies dealing with diverse and dynamic environments as in tropical forests should consider partitioning throughfall as well as their respective size and volume because it is another source of spatial variability that can affect the time stability of throughfall levia et al 2019 2017 nanko et al 2016 4 4 forest drought feedback and tf time stability long term meteorological droughts can affect forest structure function and ecosystem services by leading to higher individual tree loss and lower tree growth ultimately reducing forest productivity anderegg et al 2013 the duration and aggressiveness of such events influence water and soil nutrient availability and consequently change structure and composition of the forest he and dijkstra 2014 trees are long lived organisms and so they are expected to be more vulnerable to rapid changes in climate brodribb et al 2020 the atlantic forest remnant where our study was conducted is adapted to climate seasonality and therefore to a certain level of periodic drought souza et al 2021 however the region went through various stages of abnormal drought during 2013 2019 fig 3 which certainly impacted its structural dynamics although the remnant has been reported to show a long term increase in biomass decreasing tree density and increasing abundance of late successional plants which are indicators of the late successional stage due to protection souza et al 2021 we observed a strong increase in the loss of trees along with basal area negative net change in the 2015 2017 interval fig 10 this may have been intensified by drought conditions corroborating previous studies on forest changes under severe and long droughts berenguer et al 2021 phillips et al 2009 these changes in the forest structure have the potential to modify the inputs of water because the tf spatial variability is connected to forest structure as previously highlighted fig 9 therefore the time stability of the tf spatial variability disappears as long as the lengths of the monitoring period extends because the longer the monitoring period the higher the probability that natural changes in forest structure will affect the spatial distribution of tf the influence of the different study periods and the length of the periods is in accordance with the abovementioned changes in the tf spatial variability different configurations of the rank positions highlighted the changes in the tf spatial variability as long as the monitoring period was modified table 2 and figs s3 and s4 i e this claims that tf time stable conditions are unfeasible in a dynamic environment because the tf spatial distribution changes over time moreover attention must be paid to the feedback effects of forest moisture stress on climate change the more forests dry up the more likely they are to accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changing surface energy balances phillips et al 2009 climate scenarios for the study area indicate that extreme weather events will increase in the future making longer dry periods more likely nehren et al 2019 in turn paleoenvironmental studies show that changes in precipitation patterns during the late quaternary have repeatedly led to shifts in the transition zone between the cerrado and the atlantic forest biomes and that even small changes in water balance affect the fragile ecological balance kirchner et al 2015 future studies could also track possible changes in species composition in face of such events as an increase in abundance of drought tolerant species is likely to happen esquivel muelbert et al 2018 4 5 misinterpretation of throughfall time stability in previous studies throughfall time stability is related to forest structure and architecture fig 6 and therefore changes in the forest configuration modify the spatial distribution of throughfall three main factors are able to modify the forest structure i anthropogenic activities i e logging and fire ii ecological succession i e gaps created by falling trees and differences in forest structure in forest edge versus forest interior and iii natural disturbances i e droughts the investigated atlantic forest remnant is in an advanced successional stage and has been under protection since 1986 souza et al 2021 which means that some throughfall instability as indicated by the variability in the rank position throughout the years figs 6 and 7 is due to natural changes in the forest structure over time these changes may be exacerbated by prolonged drought conditions that the forest has experienced fig 3 which could have increased both tree mortality and biomass losses in the past years fig 10 such behavior questions the previous statement of tf time stability and precludes the definition of a specific position to represent the remnant average tf vachaud et al 1985 as claimed by most of the published studies table s2 in this regard claiming throughfall time stability without considering structural changes can lead to misinterpretation several studies have argued about the throughfall time stability in different types of forests around the world indicating positions which could be used to monitor the throughfall spatial average table s2 moreover the importance of weather characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration and amount and wind speed on throughfall time stability liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 have also been highlighted however canopy structure has been recognized to be more important than weather characteristics for throughfall spatial and temporal dynamics nanko et al 2016 sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 wullaert et al 2009 the significance has already been linked to leafed and leafless periods or growing and dormant periods because a shift in the spatial distribution was observed when both periods were evaluated separately staelens et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2008 since the hydrological year scale encompasses wet and dry periods some instability in the spatial variability of throughfall figs 6 and 7 can be attached to the semi deciduousness of the atlantic forest stand however most studies consider a short monitoring period such as a season or just one hydrological year whereas longer studies 4 years are scarce table s2 because the response to drought conditions is delayed see forest drought feedbacks and the tf time stability topic significant changes in the forest structure and canopy composition were not ascertained in the studies with short monitoring periods even forests which have not faced stressful droughts short periods were also unable to account for forest succession this caused a false impression of throughfall time stability for different time intervals and period lengths table 2 and figs s2 s3 and s4 future studies should apply temporal variograms to appraise the period length that the time stability of throughfall persists zimmermann et al 2009 this approach will highlight the maximum period length in which throughfall time stability could be considered without the risk of misinterpretation moreover it will also provide insights into throughfall spatial variability between different time intervals zimmermann et al 2009 most studies did not split the events i e gr 10 mm and 10 mm before assessing the throughfall time stability the canopy rainfall interaction is greater for gr 10 mm as a consequence of rainfall amount and formation of dripping points causing instability in the throughfall spatial variability when all events are put together to account for time stable positions the abovementioned interactions are smoothed due to events 10 mm homogenizing the water inputs within the forest fig 5c 6 and 7 zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 pointed out increased relative errors 40 in the mean throughfall estimates for small events due to a greater canopy rainfall interaction in heterogeneous forests such as tropical forests these authors recommended boosting the number of gauges to decrease throughfall uncertainty mainly when dealing with small events therefore beyond the abovementioned importance of splitting the analyses into saturated gr 10 mm and unsaturated gr 10 mm canopy for a correct assessment of time stability we recommend future studies to improve their monitoring set according to zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 incorrect accounting for the throughfall spatial variability is another source of uncertainty in defining time stable positions mainly regarding small events in tropical forests additional precautions should be taken as long as drier years become more frequent and intense more instability of the tf spatial variability can be expected during droughts due to the greater variability of maximum rainfall intensity as highlighted by the greater coefficient of variation and presence of lighter events fig 4 light events create canopy saturation and unsaturation episodes increasing the time instability of the throughfall spatial variability this instability is also due to the decreased canopy storage capacity and increased splash throughfall as a consequence of heavier events imax 20 mm h 1 therefore indicating overall stable positions will become even harder during droughts 5 conclusion the throughfall spatial variability decreased with gross rainfall amount because a greater canopy rainfall interaction occurred prior to canopy saturation gr 10 mm the different spatial configuration of dripping points which depends on rainfall amount and specie specific characteristics added to the greater importance of canopy openness free throughfall is more relevant in events with lower rainfall amounts increased the temporal changes of the spatial distribution before canopy saturation i e throughfall is more time instable for small events forest structure also demonstrated importance for the throughfall spatial variability after canopy saturation highlighting species which either booster rainfall interception drier plots or improve canopy drainage wetter plots however tropical forests are in constant development either ecologically succeeding or adaptating to natural anthropogenic disturbances e g droughts logging and fire this development changes forest structure and therefore the throughfall time stability i e defining time stable positions is not straightforward because the throughfall spatial distribution changes with forest dynamics as highlighted by the differences in the time stable positions for different periods lengths these results can only be tracked by long monitoring periods and claiming time stability in shorter periods one year or less can lead to misinterpretation the throughfall spatial variability was less time stable in the prolonged drought period than in the non drought period the greater concentration of events with light intensities and the presence of more extreme events heavy intensities 20 mm h 1 are responsible for increasing time instability light events can either saturate or unsaturate the canopy depending on their duration long or short events this creates different spatial configurations of throughfall distribution affecting the spatial variability over time moreover the heavier the event the lower the storage capacity of the canopy and the greater the amount of splash throughfall formed this increases the throughfall input and the randomness of the spatial distribution in a climate change scenario where droughts become more intense and frequent more throughfall time instability can be expected as long as the observed distribution of rainfall intensities in the prolonged drought is maintained future works should consider the effects of droughts and forest dynamics on throughfall time stability considering the abovementioned issues will prevent misinterpreting time stability and provide a more precise definition of time stable positions funding this

3488,the complexity of rainfall canopy interactions is likely to increase under extreme weather events extreme conditions may affect forest structure and change the throughfall tf spatial distribution over time mistakenly claiming the time stability of tf spatial variability can lead to misunderstanding the rainfall canopy interactions obscuring the relationships between weather forests and hydrology herein we rely on an unprecedented six hydrological year event based dataset from the brazilian atlantic forest spanning from 2013 to 2019 summing up 427 rainfall events to assess i the effects of a prolonged drought period on the tf time stability and ii the importance of forest structure for the tf time stability the mean relative difference and time stability index were applied for different period lengths and related to forest structure gross rainfall amount gr maximum rainfall intensity and drought occurrence to assess whether they affect the tf spatial variability the results indicated that the throughfall spatial variability is less time stable during droughts due to a combination of more light intensity events with some extreme intensities 20 mm h 1 which were not observed in the non drought period changes in forest structure became evident after drought conditions and could not be tracked in studies with short monitoring periods since throughfall spatial distribution is driven by forest structure e g tree density species dominance and biomass such dynamics affected the time stability of the spatial variability the time instability was even greater for gr 10 mm because of the greater rainfall canopy interactions prior to canopy saturation therefore not accounting for forest dynamics and drought effects on the tf spatial variability lead to misinterpreting time stability keywords ecohydrology rainfall partitioning canopy traits spatial variability drought atlantic forest 1 introduction forest ecosystems are recognized for their fundamental role in climate regulation water yield carbon uptake and storage as well as biochemical dynamics at local regional and even continental scales zhang et al 2017 however specific hydrological forest studies are needed to better understand these important ecosystem services these studies can enhance knowledge on water regulation and thereby contribute to improve management and conservation policies this could lead to more sustainable practices to mitigate the negative impacts of extreme weather events such as those caused by prolonged droughts which affect people s livelihood and ecosystem health coelho et al 2016 ellison et al 2017 this is critical since anomalously dry years entail more intense droughts in tropical regions nobre et al 2016 expanding their effects over the wet period and modifying the water budget in many forested catchments helman et al 2017 precipitation falling on a forest canopy takes different pathways on its way to the forest floor the incident or gross rainfall is routed to the subcanopy by throughfall and stemflow crockford and richardson 2000 guo et al 2020 throughfall tf is defined as the largest fraction of gross rainfall gr which directly passes through the canopy along with the portions that drip and splash from it stemflow is the minor gr fraction which drains from outlying leaves and branches and is channeled to the bole or stem of plants levia and germer 2015 liu et al 2018 llorens and domingo 2007 such rainfall redistribution is driven by both weather and forest characteristics van stan et al 2020 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 rainfall intensity duration and amount under different wind speeds and directions have been recognized as the main meteorological drivers of rainfall redistribution in forests e g nanko et al 2011 on the other hand the structure and architecture of the forest canopy are generally considered the most critical biotic features controlling rainfall redistribution in forests staelens et al 2006 terra et al 2018a such redistribution entails different spatial and temporal dynamics of tf being an important element of forest hydrology and

understanding of the rainfall forest hydrology connections a variety of internal and external factors are believed to influence tf spatial patterns but the methods for testing them are still in their infancy this is particularly the case for tropical forests therefore there is a great need for studies that address the physical relationships related to the influence of canopy properties on forest hydrological variables one approach used worldwide in various forest ecosystems is that of time stability to assess the dynamics of tf spatial variability over time keim and link 2018 van stan et al 2020 this approach highlights the most time stable locations as well as those which are persistently wetter and or drier than the tf spatial average regardless of the time keim and link 2018 studied the temporal persistence of tf spatial patterns in forest stands in the us pacific northwest region linking time stability with geostatistical properties staelens et al 2006 analyzed the tf spatial variability and temporal stability under a dominant beech tree in relation to the canopy cover and found that the tf spatial variability was significantly higher during the leafed season than during the leafless season at different time scales zhang et al 2016 found that tf spatial variability in xerophytic shrub canopies is temporally stable zhu et al 2021 also studied tf time stability in a semi arid mountain range in china and related the stability to the spatial dynamics of soil moisture wullaert et al 2009 classified the tf spatial variability in a montane rainforest as extremely stable over time regardless of the time period analyzed therefore the tf spatial variability seems to be time stable in most of the ecosystems around the world however zimmermann et al 2009 observed that the temporal persistence of throughfall at individual plots disappeared after one year in a tropical semi deciduous moist forest the need for longer event based sample periods to better characterize patterns in throughfall distribution was highlighted by levia and frost 2006 in a broad review about the spatial and temporal variability of throughfall long sample periods enable observing forest and weather dynamics and how these dynamics affect tf variability none of the abovementioned studies performed an assessment based on more than four years of observation and or included extreme weather conditions such as prolonged droughts a knowledge gap arises as the time stability of tf spatial variability may be affected by intense droughts which in turn would lead to i greater impacts on forest dynamics and biogeochemistry cycles such as biomass loss due to tree mortality especially for large ones ryan 2015 ii favoring of drought tolerant tree species esquivel muelbert et al 2018 and iii change in carbon balance choat et al 2018 schlesinger et al 2016 although several studies have evaluated the temporal persistence of throughfall spatial patterns in temperate forests i e staelens et al 2006 semi arid mountain forests i e zhu et al 2021 and tropical forests i e wullaert et al 2009 only a few studies considered forest traits as drivers of throughfall time stability mostly focusing on individual tree traits as opposed to forest traits e g canopy thickness lai leaf characteristics and stem architecture sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 aware of this importance stogsdill et al 1989 assessed the relationship between thinning and throughfall input to improve soil water availability in a pinus plantation however the tf observed in tropical forests where canopies are closed stratified and complex aubry kientz et al 2019 guan et al 2013 has probably interacted and responded to the traits of several trees therefore it is crucial to appraise the consequences of changes in forest structure as a consequence of droughts on the tf dynamics as further highlighted in this study the usually short monitoring period has blurred the real dynamics of tf spatial distribution which in turn has led to misinterpretation of tf time stability tropical forests are dynamic ecosystems that respond to soil moisture and nutrient availability and are therefore subject to constant modification souza et al 2021 terra et al 2018b as the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture and nutrient availablitiy is partly determined by tf metzger et al 2021 oliveira et al 2021 misunderstanding the tf spatiotemporal distribution precludes correctly assessing forest growth and dynamics under a changing climate with more likely stressful conditions anderegg et al 2020 a better understanding of forest resilience therefore depends on a proper assessment of the temporal evolution of tf spatial distribution southeastern brazil harbors part of the brazilian atlantic forest one of the world s most biodiverse areas myers et al 2000 with remarkable endemism and a strong hydrological role mello et al 2019 rodrigues et al 2021b however this biome has been highly degraded by the historical expansion of both urban and agricultural activities dean 1995 joly et al 2014 ribeiro et al 2009 there is currently ca 12 4 of the original extent when considering remnants larger than 3 ha sos mata atlântica access link https www sosma org br which points out the biome devastation degree fortunately the largest remaining atlantic forest patches are located in mountain ranges which are advantageous environments from a hydrological persepctive i e water yield mello et al 2019 teixeira et al 2021 this reinforces the importance of the atlantic forest for water management due to its close relationship with water availability terra et al 2018b however long term field data for hydrology and water management are scarce in brazil since collecting long term field data is extremely time and resource consuming however such datasets are essential for better resource planning and enable evaluating hydrological behavior at different temporal and spatial scales in brief they provide a better understanding of complex hydrological processes notably in relation to tropical forest environments against this background our study relies on an unprecedented six hydrological year event based dataset spanning from 2013 to 2019 to track the temporal and spatial variability of throughfall in an atlantic forest remnant in southeastern brazil the study was carried out per hydrological year october to september to answer the following questions i do dry conditions affect the time stability of throughfall patterns ii what are the effects of forest structure on throughfall spatial variability and time stability under different drought conditions and iii have previous studies mistakenly suggested throughfall time stability considering that the atlantic forest is a fundamental biome for water resources in brazil mello et al 2019 teixeira et al 2021 answering these questions can help the eco hydrological stakeholders address adaptations to adverse conditions and improve strategies to maintain ecosystem services moreover this study aims to stimulate reflection on the suggested throughfall time stability in a dynamic environment as misinterpretation can lead to erroneously understanding the rainfall forest hydrology connections in a climate change scenario 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site 44 58 15 w and 21 13 42 s is a 6 35 ha atlantic forest remnant fig 1 in an advanced successional stage after full protection in 1986 souza et al 2021 the forest is classified as semi deciduous since up to 50 of its trees lose their leaves during the dry season which is an adaptation to rainfall seasonality oliveira filho and fontes 2000 the canopy is stratified and three tree layers can be identified the main layer consists of trees ranging from 10 m to 15 m in height and forms the remnant body emergent trees scatter across the main layer with 20 m in height upper layer whereas small trees seedlings and bushes compose the understory layer junqueira junior et al 2019 terra et al 2018a there are canopy gaps distributed across the remnant formed by fallen trees rodrigues et al 2021a the position and openness of such gaps are random and mainly depend on the size of the felled trees which caused the openness the study area is upon a gneiss geological formation from the archean period access link http www portalgeologia com br index php mapa col form download tab the soil is a red oxisol with slopes ranging from 5 to 15 in an undulating topography junqueira junior et al 2017 forming a common landscape in southeast brazil atlantic forest oxisol site the climate is characterized by rainy summers and dry winters with well defined rainfall seasonality the wet season extends from october to march and is responsible for 80 of the rainfall whereas the dry season lasts from april to september the average monthly vertical water balance rainfall minus potential evapotranspiration ranges from 75 9 mm in august to 158 6 mm in december the average maximum and minimum temperatures are 27 2 1 6 c and 15 4 2 5 c respectively wind intensity is greatest in september 2 9 m s 1 and least in february may and june 2 2 m s 1 with slight variations throughout the year easterly wind directions prevail in the rainy season and northeasterly directions in the dry season average sunshine per day ranges from 4 9 h in december to 8 0 h in august highlighting the influence of clouds during the rainy season the climate is temperate cwa according to the köppen classification these climatological features are based on the 1981 2010 time series from a weather station placed 2 km from the atlantic forest remnant provided by the national institute of meteorology inmet 2 2 gross rainfall and throughfall monitoring gr was collected from october 2013 to september 2019 using both totalizing and tipping bucket rain gauges both gauges were installed on the top of a 22 m meteorological tower mot fig 1d and presented good agreement between their readings r2 0 95 junqueira junior et al 2019 the tipping gauge measured rainfall at 0 2 mm resolution campbell scientific cr10x and stored it in a 10 minute time step in a hobbo datalogger the water collected in the totalizing gauge was drained into a 60 l bin placed at the base of the mot the readings were performed with graduated cylinders of measuring volumes ranging from 0 1 l to 1 0 l next three totalizer rain gauges were installed surrounding the atlantic forest remnant to correct inconsistencies in the gr dataset rodrigues et al 2021a fig 1b throughfall tf was measured using 31 rain gauges across inventory plots fig 1c these plots were selected because they represent the main tree species distribution and the terrain features oliveira et al 2021 such gauges have a collected area of 378 5 cm2 and were installed 150 cm above the floor to avoid splash in rodrigues et al 2021a the gauges were equipped with meshes to avoid clogging with leaves and debris the meshes were cleaned at least once a week during the rainy season to guarantee representativeness of the measuring observed by junqueira junior et al 2019 this representativeness refers to a low standard error in the non roving distribution of the 31 gauges and periodic maintenance was needed to maintain the suitability of the present configuration throughfall and gross rainfall were monitored four hours after the rainfall event to guarantee total dryness of the canopy the monitoring was carried out the next morning for events that had started in the late afternoon 2 3 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi is a probabilistic approach to characterize drought occurrence frequency and duration based on a time series of rainfall mckee et al 1993 the interesting aspect about this index is that rainfall deficit or surplus can be highlighted together with its return period the spi was selected because it has been widely applied in both brazillian savanna junqueira et al 2020 and atlantic forest biomes silva and mello 2021 for water resource management the second reason is because spi standardizes the rainfall for a location and period of interest quiring 2009 which enables the results of this study regarding drought occurrence to be compared with others dealing with throughfall spatial variability worldwide the steps for computing spi were i a monthly time series of rainfall provided by inmet was accumulated on the scale of a hydrological year from october to september from 1961 to 2019 resulting in a total of 58 hydrological years spi is strongly influenced by the time series length and more than 50 years is recommended to avoid distortions quiring 2009 ii the gamma 2 parameter probability function was fitted to this time series and its adequacy was assessed using the anderson darling test anderson and darling 1952 1954 at 5 probability level iii the respective probability was applied to an inverse standard normal distribution µ 0 σ 1 mckee et al 1993 the positive and negative deviations are the spi and indicate rainfall surplus and deficit respectively monthly rainfall was integrated from october to september to account for drought occurrence in the hydrological year scale which covers the period from 1961 1962 to 2018 2019 in order to analyze the studied period in the context of prolonged drought different time scales indicate different impacts of rainfall deficits on water availability characterizing the agricultural meteorological and hydrological droughts quiring 2009 although long periods such as the hydrological year are preferred for water resource management prolonged droughts increase forest dynamics making the use of the hydrological year scale adequate to assess their effect on throughfall further evidence for considering long periods is that forests have a delayed response to droughts anderegg et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2021b the persistent dry weather can also be shown by comparing the gross rainfall gr air temperature t and air relative humidity rh of the 2013 2019 period study period to the regional climatological average 1981 2010 moreover the maximum rainfall intensity of one hour imax was selected from each rainfall event to assess the likely differences on rainfall variability in the presence or absence of droughts 2 4 spatial variability and time stability the spatial variability of throughfall was assessed on an event scale by means of the coefficient of variation cv and the 31 rain gauge datasets collected in the study period the time stability was assessed through the time stability indicator tsi which is a function of the mean relative difference mrdj and the standard deviation of the relative difference σ rd ij minet et al 2013 vachaud et al 1985 1 rd i j tf i j tf i tf i 2 tf i 1 m j 1 m tf ij 3 mrd j 1 n i 1 n rd ij 4 σ rd j 1 n 1 i 1 n rd i j mrd j 2 in which rdij is the relative difference of time i in the rain gauge position j tf i is the spatial mean of tf on time i mrd j is calculated for all rain gauges and represents the behavior of tf in the position j in relation to the spatial average tf mrdj 0 represents wetter locations mrdj 0 drier locations and mrdj 0 locations with tf amount close to the forest average mrdj represents the plots of the atlantic forest remnant that are wetter dryer or closer to the spatial average tf however the standard deviation of the relative positions indicates how much the tf spatial pattern varies between events vachaud et al 1985 therefore it is not appropriate to only rely on mrdj to define time stability because its variability σ rd ij is also important therefore tsi was developed to integrate the effect of mrdj and σ rd ij 5 tsi mrd j 2 σ rd j 2 the lower the tsi value the more time stable the location is assessing tsi differs from mrd because it describes the persistence of the spatial distribution i e the tf time stability whereas mrd describes the expected tf spatial distribution throughout the study period two approaches were considered to assess the tf time stability i the single from 2013 2014 to 2018 2019 and ii the integrated 2013 2015 2015 2017 2017 2019 2013 2016 2016 2019 2013 2017 2013 2019 hydrological years 2 5 forest structure forest structure variables used in this study were obtained from a permanent plot network sampled in the atlantic forest remnant a total of 126 plots of 20 20 m 400 m2 were established in the fragment in 1987 these plots were re measured in the years 1992 1996 2001 2006 2010 2015 and 2017 all arboreal individuals with a diameter at breast height dbh 5 cm were identified and measured in each plot souza et al 2021 for the trees which presented tillering we transformed the diameter to a unique value according to the following equation macdicken et al 1991 6 d d n 1 2 d n 2 2 d n 2 in which d is the transformed diameter and dn is the tillered tree diameter botanical material was collected and exsiccates were made for species identification tree nomenclature was standardized using the flora do brasil according to the apg iv classification system bfg 2021 the angiosperm phylogeny group et al 2016 we selected the 31 abovementioned plots from the field survey fig 1b i e each of the 31 forest plots that contained a rain gauge we calculated the following variables for each plot from the forest inventory data of 2010 2015 and 2017 aboveground biomass agb basal area g mean diameter at breast height dbh coefficient of variation from the mean dbh cv dbh number of trees per hectare n ha 1 species richness s shannon diversity index h and pielou evenness index j table 1 the aboveground biomass for each plot was determined by each forest inventory year i e 2010 2015 and 2017 using the equation proposed by chave et al 2014 through the biomass package réjou méchain et al 2017 in r language r core team 2020 the equation provides individual tree agb by considering the tree diameter d and wood density wd as well as the site coordinates which enable estimating the measure of environmental stress e to do so the wood density is achieved from the global wood density database gwd therefore the plot agb was obtained as the sum of the agb of the trees within the plot 2 6 multivariable analyses we followed the protocol presented in fig 2 in order to conduct the analyses correlating mrd and forest strucucture data we ran this protocol for both the 10 mm and the 10 mm set of events therefore we first ran a principal components analysis pca pearson 1901 hotelling 1933 jolliffe 1973 of the annual mean relative difference mrd data mrd 13 14 mrd 14 15 mrd 15 16 mrd 16 17 mrd 17 18 and mrd 18 19 and a pca for the annual time stability indicator tsi data tsi 13 14 tsi 14 15 tsi 15 16 tsi 16 17 tsi 17 18 and tsi 18 19 in order to deal with a set of multiple variables pca is a much used unconstrained ordination analysis and is considered the best way to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data to determine what statistically and practically matters moreover this analysis is widely used as an exploratory tool which helps to visualize patterns out of multivariate data the basic assumptions of pca are i multiple variables multiple variables are required to perform the analysis ii variables should be measured at continuous level although ordinal variables are frequently used see hoshiyar et al 2021 iii sample adequacy generally at least 5 to 10 cases per variable is recommended for pca analysis iv linear relationships among variables it is assumed that the relationships between variables are linear since pca is based on person s correlation coefficients and v no significant outliers assumptions i ii and iii were obviously met since the variables are scaled prior to the analysis assumptions iv and v were also met see tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 and figs s1 s2 s3 and s4 thus we used the envfit function vegan package for r oksanen et al 2020 in aiming to interpret the meaning of the pca outputs with the available forest variables dbh 10 n 10 g 10 cv dbh 10 agb 10 s 10 h 10 j 10 dbh 15 n 15 g 15 cv dbh 15 agb 15 s 15 h 15 j 15 dbh 17 n 17 g 17 cv dbh 17 agb 17 s 17 h 17 and j 17 and to only select a subset of forest variables that appear to be important for the pca arrangements the envfit function is designed to calculate regression of supplementary not explanatory variables on ordination axes of uncontrained ordination and test the significance of these regressions by a permutation test therefore the forest variables were projected onto the pca ordination diagrams as supplementary variables i e regressions of each forest variable were independently fit to ordination axes and their significance was tested by a permutation test with the number of permutations 999 next we used redundancy analyses to represent the relationship between the mrd and the forest variables as well as the relationship between tsi and the forest variables redundancy analysis rda reduces the multivariable universe to an easier to understand two or three dimensional space where the variations of the response variables can be related to those of the explanatory variables ter braak and looman 1994 therefore rda is a contrained ordination technique ordination with covariates or predictors used to explain a dataset y using a dataset x legendre et al 2011 we used the forest dataset x as the explanatory variable of the scaled mrd dataset y as well as the scaled tsi dataset only including those variables in the forest set x whose vectors were significantly or marginally significant p value 0 1 according to the envfit outputs for each case tables s5 s6 s7 and s8 the assumptions of rda are rather the same as the pca and have been met for our data tables s1 s2 s3 and s4 one of the main advantages of both pca and rda is the diagram biplot which enables visually interpreting multiple correlations the variables are typically positively correlated when two vectors are close in the diagram and form a small angle 3 results 3 1 prolonged drought during the study period the adequacy of the gamma pdf to model the frequency distribution of the hydrological year rainfall series was confirmed through the anderson darling test fig 3 a therefore the spi can be applied to assess drought conditions in the study region dry and wet hydrological years interspersed up to 2011 2012 indicating drought seasonality occurrence in the region however a prolonged drought period could be observed at the end of the time series fig 3b such a prolonged meteorological drought impacts the atlantic forest hydrology as highlighted by rodrigues et al 2021b and souza et al 2021 and is therefore expected to interfere in the throughfall time stability thus the study period was split into two to assess the effects of droughts on the throughfall time stability i prolonged drought period october 2013 to september 2018 and ii non drought period october 2018 september 2019 table s1 depicts the spi classification in accordance with the world meteorological organization wmo world meteorological organization wmo 2012 gr and rh were below average for most of the months during the study period whereas temperature was greater than average fig 3c overall gr was 250 mm less than the climatological year average rh ranged from 58 4 to 74 8 and from 62 3 to 79 8 for the 2013 2019 and 1981 2010 periods respectively moreover t ranged from 17 2 c to 23 6 c in the study period whereas t ranged from 16 9 c to 22 8 c for the climatological average the behavior of gr t and rh indicated that the study period was drier and hotter than the average long term conditions of the region the box plots regarding rainfall intensity highlight the different distribution of maximum rainfall intensity between the prolonged drought and non drought period fig 4 a greater concentration of light rainfall events was observed in the prolonged drought period in which the first second and third quartiles were 0 25 mm h 1 1 78 mm h 1 and 5 08 mm h 1 respectively conversely they were 0 76 mm h 1 3 05 mm h 1 and 7 87 mm h 1 during the non drought period respectively however heavier rainfall events were observed in the prolonged drought period characterizing a greater variability of rainfall intensities fig 4 this is confirmed by the greater coefficient of variation in the prolonged drought cv 141 versus that in the non drought period cv 108 3 2 canopy water balance box plot and filtering techniques highlighted 25 rainfall events out of 427 encompassing 6 hydrological years as outliers these events were then removed before the analyses annual gross rainfall gr ranged from 860 mm 2013 2014 to 1422 mm 2018 2019 throughfall tf ranged from 707 mm to 1135 mm 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 respectively and represented up to 84 5 of gr 2016 2017 most of the throughfall occurred in the wet season up to 94 2 in 2015 2016 gp and tf in the prolonged drought period added up to 5232 mm and 4097 mm respectively with tf gp of 78 3 in contrast gp and tf in the non drought period were 1422 mm and 1135 tf gp 79 8 respectively on the event scale the tf gr ratio increased with gross rainfall regardless of the period analyzed prolonged drought or non drought periods fig 5 tf gr ranged from 2 4 to 99 1 and from 19 8 to 98 1 in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively the tf gr followed logarithmic behavior in both analyzed periods with gr describing 60 7 of the tf gr variability in the non drought period fig 5b in contrast only 33 4 of tf gr variability was described by gr in the prolonged drought period fig 5b the logarithimic tendency was similar for small rainfall events gr 10 mm and became different beyond this threshold moreover gr represented 99 and 97 of tf s variability in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively fig 5a the linear pattern is the same regardless of the rainfall amount or 10 mm highlighting an overall relationship between these two variables evaporation from canopy interception accounted for an average 22 4 of gr ranging from 153 4 mm 17 8 to 333 8 mm 27 7 in 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 respectively canopy evaporation in the prolonged drought added up to 1135 mm accounting for 21 7 of gr whereas 287 mm 20 2 of gr was observed in the non drought period as shown in fig 3b the range of canopy evaporation was larger in the prolonged drought 0 9 to 97 6 than in the non drought periods 1 9 to 80 2 3 3 gross rainfall period length and throughfall time stability the tf spatial variability represented by the coefficient of variation decreased up to the threshold of gr 10 mm and stabilized at cv 25 regardless of drought or non drought condition fig 5c i e greater spatial variability occurs for events 10 mm even under different climatological conditions table s1 the wet and dry plots were more acute for events below the threshold gr 10 mm whereas mrdj was closer to 0 for gr 10 mm figs 6 and 7 the greater tf time stability is remarkable for greater amounts of gross rainfall gr due to the lower fluctuations of mrdj fig 7 this is confirmed by tsi which was 0 25 0 09 and 0 49 0 21 when only considering events above and below the threshold gr 10 mm respectively overall the tf spatial pattern is more sensitive to changes in gr for events 10 mm since water input to the remnant becomes more homogeneous as long as gross rainfall increases plots representing the remnant tf average mrd 1 varied between the study years and rainfall amount regarding gr 10 mm plots 70 70 118 109 122 and 65 represented the tf spatial average for 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 periods respectively in contrast plots 1 67 3 62 24 64 and 60 could be used to determine the tf spatial average in 2013 2014 2014 2015 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively for gr 10 mm although there were no differences in the metric ranges the relative positions of the inventory plots changed throughout the hydrological years figs 6 and 7 and s2 the most drastic changes in the rank position were observed in plots 45 62 96 100 and 101 which changed betweem wet and dry positions plots 45 96 and 101 ranged from 19 21 26 22 and 57 43 drier to 18 16 14 5 and 6 9 wetter than the remnant tf average for gr 10 mm for gr 10 mm moreover plots 62 and 100 ranged from 42 41 and 53 38 wetter to 15 15 and 41 39 drier than the tf spatial average for gr 10 mm for gr 10 mm in contrast plot 120 was drier than the tf spatial average while plot 42 was wetter than the tf spatial average regardless of the measurement time we also integrated different time periods to verify the influence of the the dataset lengths on the time stability of tf spatial variability the rank position of the inventory plots changed among the different lengths regardless of the rainfall amount highlighting different time evolutions of tf spatial variability for the integrated datasets from two hydrological years to the entire period table 2 and figs s3 and s4 3 4 rainfall intensity droughts and the throughfall time stability regarding the maximum rainfall intensity the tf spatial variability decreased up to the threshold of imax 2 5 mm h 1 stabilizing at cv 25 fig 5d in both prolonged drought and non drought periods i e the greater spatial variability occurs for imax 2 5 mm h 1 in the presence and absence of droughts the spatial variability of tf is more time stable in the non drought than in the prolonged drought period as indicated by the lower fluctuation of mrdj fig 8 this is reinforced by the tsi of 0 30 0 11 and 0 41 0 13 in the non drought and prolonged drought period respectively regarding the threshold imax 2 5 mm h 1 tsi was 0 30 0 13 and 0 29 0 08 for events below and above the threshold in the non drought period respectively a greater instability of the tf spatial variability was observed during lighter imax 2 5 mm h 1 than heavier rainfall events in the prolonged drought period indicated by tsi of 0 45 0 12 and 0 37 0 14 respectively plots representing the remnant tf average mrd 1 were different regarding rainfall intensity and the presence or absence of droughts for imax 2 5 mm h 1 plots 21 and 64 prolonged drought period and 1 non drought period can be considered as representative of tf spatial average for imax 2 5 mm h 1 plots 96 and 1 represented the tf spatial average in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively the presense or absence of droughts defined the relative postions of the plots fig 8 changes in plots 101 6 41 60 45 and 21 were more relevant because they changed between wet and dry positions when the study period was split into prolonged drought and non drought periods for instance plots 101 41 60 and 6 became wetter in the non drought period while plot 21 became drier this pattern was observed for imax 2 5 mm h 1 and 2 5 mm h 1 fig 8 overall these plots concentrated at drier and wetter positions in the prolonged drought and non drought periods respectively highlighting the influence of rainfall intensity distribution fig 4 in the relative spatial distribution of tf 3 5 forest structure and the throughfall time stability the pca with envifit selected forest variables correlated with variations in mrd and tsi data mrd pca for 10 mm events only pointed out the numer of trees n10 n15 and n17 as being important for mrd data arrangement table s5 whereas mrd pca for 10 mm selected the number of trees the plot mean diameter and the evenness index n10 n15 n17 dbh10 dbh15 dbh17 and j17 table s6 tsi pca for 10 mm events pointed out basal area aboveground biomass plot mean diameter diversity and evenness as important for tsi events g10 g15 g17 cv dbh10 h10 h15 j10 j15 dbh17 agb10 agb15 and agb17 table s7 whereas tsi pca for 10 events only selected tree occupation cover variables dbh10 dbh15 dbh17 g10 g15 g17 agb10 agb15 and agb17 table s8 the redundancy analysis rda highlighted different interactions between forest and rainfall redistribution mrd when the threshold gr 10 mm was considered fig 9 rda for gr 10 mm shows that the first and second axes explained nearly 95 of the constrained variation in the data three forest structure variables presented significant p 0 1 contributions to explain variation in the tf matrix n 10 n 15 and n 17 with positive correlations to mrd fig 9a rda for gr 10 mm demonstrates that the first and second axes explained nearly 79 of the constrained variation in the data a total of 8 forest structure variables showed significant p 0 1 contributions to explain variation in the tf matrix n 10 n 15 and n 17 with overall positive correlations to mrd and dbh 10 dbh 15 dbh 17 j 15 and j 17 with negative correlations to mrd fig 9b the rda showed a different influence of forest structure on the tf time stability regarding tsi for

constraining variation in the two axes with positive correlations to tsi for gr 10 mm fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 canopy rainfall interactions and the tf spatial variability although studies have demonstrated the influence of rainfall intensity and amount in throughfall behavior liu et al 2019 sheng and cai 2021 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 we did not find a difference in the cv tendency regardless of the drought intensity fig 5c d moreover the frequency of rainfall events was similar among the study years fig s1 this means that the forest structure and architecture determined the spatial variability of throughfall not the rainfall distribution for gross rainfall 10 mm the canopy is still filling and water entering the forest is mainly due to the existence of gaps free throughfall the formation of some preferential dripping points staelens et al 2006 and drops splashing from the canopy levia et al 2019 as rainfall progresses the canopy reservoir fills and more water is routed to the forest floor carlyle moses et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2021a spatial variability decreases as long as more dripping points occur and stabilizes for events higher than 10 mm cv 25 when the canopy is saturated and the water drains into all dripping pathways allen et al 2013 fathizadeh et al 2014 the same pattern was observed in other forest worldwide sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 su et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 only differing by the threshold and the stable cv table s2 for instance fan et al 2015 observed a threshold of 20 mm in a pine forest decreasing to a stable cv of 16 5 in a mixed deciduous forest staelens et al 2006 observed a threshold of 10 mm and a stable cv of 19 and 11 for the leafed and leafless periods respectively sheng and cai 2021 zhu et al 2021 and su et al 2019 observed a stable cv of 20 in a boreal semi arid mountain forests and mixed evergreen deciduous broadleaved forests respectively the greater stable cv value 25 observed in the atlantic forest remnant may be due to its higher species diversity and stratified canopy terra et al 2018a which create different zones for throughfall carlyle moses and lishman 2015 moreover the greater stable cv value could also be a consequence of the non roving approach used in this study since roving rain gauges after each rainfall event may decrease the throughfall spatial variability fan et al 2015 however junqueira junior et al 2019 and rodrigues et al 2021a confirmed the adequacy of the spatial distribution of rain gauges to represent the tf spatial variability in the forest remnant therefore the more noticeable cv value can be related to the complexity of the atlantic forest remnant the increase in tf gr ratio supports the assumptions about the formation of more drainage pathways as the canopy gets fuller increasing the transformation of gr into tf up to a stable ratio of 82 fig 5b although tf linearly increases with gr fig 5a the tf gr stabilization indicates that the canopy has reached its maximum drainage capacity beyond this point no more drainage pathways are formed and the water entering the forest as tf is a function of the maximum drainage capacity the canopy openness and the weather conditions therefore the canopy rainfall interactions are minimized and the observed variability is mainly due to atmosphere dynamics rather than forest structure for gr 10 mm tf gr variability is driven by canopy evaporation which is a function of the available energy during and between events rodrigues et al 2021a rodrigues et al 2021a called attention to the importance of the energy stored in biomass and air within the atlantic forest remnant in both drought and non drought conditions however external energy arrives by advection and increases canopy evaporation during droughts rodrigues et al 2021a which explains the differences in the tf gp fluctuations between the two analyzed periods fig 5b this fluctuation can also partly be explained by the semi deciduous characteristic of the atlantic forest remnant oliveira filho and fontes 2000 due to the natural leaf loss seasonality which is intensified during prolonged droughts rodrigues et al 2021b furthermore wind direction and intensity contribute to the increase in variability through the rain shadow phenomenon fan et al 2015 although evaporation leaf shedding and wind patterns are important in the variability of tf gr for events 10 mm the acuteness of the increase on the tf gr ratio is mainly due to canopy filling which leads to new dripping points and the greater contribution of tf fig 5b 4 2 influence of forest structure on the time stability of tf spatial variability the redundancy analysis of mrd fig 9 pointed out the forest characteristics that drive the overall tf spatial distribution in the study period 2013 2019 highlighting the characteristics which improve water input more populated plots i e plots with a higher number of trees in our study area input more water to the forest regardless of the rainfall amount fig 9 plots with higher numbers of individuals usually indicate those that are recovering from a disturbance i e gaps created by fallen trees and therefore have higher densities of young trees martins et al 2004 oliveira filho et al 1997 reduced canopy interception is observed in young trees due to their small crown terra et al 2018a wullaert et al 2009 funnel shaped branches germer et al 2006 su et al 2019 and greater canopy openness martins et al 2004 for gr 10 mm the higher dominance of certain tree species lower j values also increases throughfall fig 9 tree species in tropical forests show a wide range of anatomic and architectural traits poorter et al 2006 which can either boost rainfall interception terra et al 2018a or increase throughfall therefore plots with greater water inputs via throughfall are probably dominated by species with improved drainage capacity moreover higher mean tree diameter in 2010 2015 and 2017 had a negative effect on throughfall for gr 10 mm fig 9 this is expected since the more trees there are per area in tropical forests the thinner they tend to be hallé et al 1978 ngueguim et al 2018 the greater rainfall canopy interaction before saturation gr 10 mm highlights the effect of canopy openness for tf since free throughfall is more relevant in events with lower rainfall amounts staelens et al 2006 the importance of canopy openness for tf decreased in large events as also observed by zimmerman et al 2009 therefore the canopy drainage capacity becomes more relevant than the rainfall canopy interaction to spatially distribute throughfall after canopy saturation this is reinforced by the importance assigned to tree species fig 9 which points out the species specific characteristics that improves canopy drainage levia and frost 2006 this information can support decisions toward reforestation by selecting tree species that increase water input forest structure and architecture drive the time stability of tf spatial variability in the atlantic forest remnant as indicated by the rda plot considering the tsi fig 9 regardless of the gross rainfall amount 10 mm or 10 mm the larger the area occupied by the tree boles in a plot as indicated by agb and g the less time stable the plot was this means that throughfall time stable conditions are related to lesser biomass per area the biomass of the atlantic forest remnant is increasing as it moves toward an advanced successional stage souza et al 2021 this is likely the explanation for the importance assigned to dbh because the temporal increase in biomass was greatest in the large diameters classes in the study remnant souza et al 2021 which is consistent with the abovmentioned importance of tree occupation for tf time instability in contrast the importance of h and j for gr 10 mm can be attached to the onset of new dripping points which increases the time instability of tf spatial distribution since tropical forests have a wide range of species with different canopy storage capacity leaf properties such as shape orientation and texture branch architecture canopy structure and hydrophobicity and bark roughness levia and frost 2006 nanko et al 2014 poorter et al 2006 terra et al 2018a the diversity and dominance of certain species provide a distinct time for starting canopy drainage allen et al 2013 this condition in combination with varying rainfall amounts resulted in a variety of spatial configurations of dripping pathways since forest canopy is unsaturated when gr 10 mm these different configurations of dripping points decreased tf time stability i e tf spatial variability was unstable for gr 10 mm this is confirmed by the non significance of h and j in the rda for gr 10 mm beyond this rainfall amount all dripping points had already started homogenizing the time evolution of the tf spatial distribution rda highlights linear relationships between explanatory and response variables ter braak and looman 1994 and some cautions should be taken when dealing with rainfall partitioning the canopy is a complex environment due to the heterogeneity of species leaf characteristics branch angulation water storage capacity and seasonality leaf shedding in the dry period among others the association of the abovementioned characteristics can lead to non linear responses which cannot be observed using rda legendre et al 2010 ter braak and looman 1994 therefore some connections and potential drivers of the throughfall spatial distribution could have been left out however rda was used as an exploratory analysis to shed light on the importance of considering forest dynamics when dealing with the throughfall time stability the results of this study will supplement future studies on forest hydrology and point to the need for considering forest dynamics and weather conditions future works should also increase the time resolution of the measured forest structure variables to track inter season variation and implement scanning technologies such as lidar for a 3d characterization of the canopy 4 3 influence of rainfall intensity on the time stability of tf spatial variability the different distribution of the maximum rainfall intensity between the non drought and prolonged drought periods fig 4 affected the time stability of the tf spatial variability fig 8 the tf spatial variability was less time stable in the prolonged drought period in which a greater variability of imax cv 141 was observed this instability increased even more for rainfall events with imax 2 5 mm h 1 fig 8 canopy rainfall interactions are greater fig 5d for light events because they can either saturate or unsaturate the canopy long events with low intensity saturate the canopy activate all dripping pathways as previously stated and decrease the tf spatial variability conversely unsaturation is likely to occur in short events with low intensity yan et al 2021 different spatial configurations of dripping pathways are formed depending on the rainfall amount intensity and duration this drives the throughfall redistribution in each event changing the spatial distribution over time fig 8 therefore more unstable time conditions can be expected as long as droughts with a concentration of light events become more frequent the tf spatial variability was more time stable for imax 2 5 mm h 1 intense events have greater kinetic energy which reduces canopy storage capacity calder et al 1996 and increases tf yan et al 2021 i e the canopy is easily saturated in these events the tf spatial variability tends to homogenize with greater tf fig 5d decreasing tsi fig 8 however greater tsi values were observed during the prolonged drought period this was likely due to the occurrence of heavier events since the imax was limited to 20 mm h 1 in the non drought period fig 4 higher rainfall intensities splash more water from the canopy nanko et al 2006 which can either be recaptured or become throughfall depending on the canopy thickness nanko et al 2008 more splashes from the canopy added to the diversity of canopy structures terra et al 2018a increased the tf spatial variability in the atlantic forest remnant during the prolonged drought period however the relative contribution of each throughfall type free drip and splash in the time stability needs further investigation for instance the formation of splash throughfall is greater at the onset of events levia et al 2019 and its random distribution likely increases spatial variability therefore future studies dealing with diverse and dynamic environments as in tropical forests should consider partitioning throughfall as well as their respective size and volume because it is another source of spatial variability that can affect the time stability of throughfall levia et al 2019 2017 nanko et al 2016 4 4 forest drought feedback and tf time stability long term meteorological droughts can affect forest structure function and ecosystem services by leading to higher individual tree loss and lower tree growth ultimately reducing forest productivity anderegg et al 2013 the duration and aggressiveness of such events influence water and soil nutrient availability and consequently change structure and composition of the forest he and dijkstra 2014 trees are long lived organisms and so they are expected to be more vulnerable to rapid changes in climate brodribb et al 2020 the atlantic forest remnant where our study was conducted is adapted to climate seasonality and therefore to a certain level of periodic drought souza et al 2021 however the region went through various stages of abnormal drought during 2013 2019 fig 3 which certainly impacted its structural dynamics although the remnant has been reported to show a long term increase in biomass decreasing tree density and increasing abundance of late successional plants which are indicators of the late successional stage due to protection souza et al 2021 we observed a strong increase in the loss of trees along with basal area negative net change in the 2015 2017 interval fig 10 this may have been intensified by drought conditions corroborating previous studies on forest changes under severe and long droughts berenguer et al 2021 phillips et al 2009 these changes in the forest structure have the potential to modify the inputs of water because the tf spatial variability is connected to forest structure as previously highlighted fig 9 therefore the time stability of the tf spatial variability disappears as long as the lengths of the monitoring period extends because the longer the monitoring period the higher the probability that natural changes in forest structure will affect the spatial distribution of tf the influence of the different study periods and the length of the periods is in accordance with the abovementioned changes in the tf spatial variability different configurations of the rank positions highlighted the changes in the tf spatial variability as long as the monitoring period was modified table 2 and figs s3 and s4 i e this claims that tf time stable conditions are unfeasible in a dynamic environment because the tf spatial distribution changes over time moreover attention must be paid to the feedback effects of forest moisture stress on climate change the more forests dry up the more likely they are to accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changing surface energy balances phillips et al 2009 climate scenarios for the study area indicate that extreme weather events will increase in the future making longer dry periods more likely nehren et al 2019 in turn paleoenvironmental studies show that changes in precipitation patterns during the late quaternary have repeatedly led to shifts in the transition zone between the cerrado and the atlantic forest biomes and that even small changes in water balance affect the fragile ecological balance kirchner et al 2015 future studies could also track possible changes in species composition in face of such events as an increase in abundance of drought tolerant species is likely to happen esquivel muelbert et al 2018 4 5 misinterpretation of throughfall time stability in previous studies throughfall time stability is related to forest structure and architecture fig 6 and therefore changes in the forest configuration modify the spatial distribution of throughfall three main factors are able to modify the forest structure i anthropogenic activities i e logging and fire ii ecological succession i e gaps created by falling trees and differences in forest structure in forest edge versus forest interior and iii natural disturbances i e droughts the investigated atlantic forest remnant is in an advanced successional stage and has been under protection since 1986 souza et al 2021 which means that some throughfall instability as indicated by the variability in the rank position throughout the years figs 6 and 7 is due to natural changes in the forest structure over time these changes may be exacerbated by prolonged drought conditions that the forest has experienced fig 3 which could have increased both tree mortality and biomass losses in the past years fig 10 such behavior questions the previous statement of tf time stability and precludes the definition of a specific position to represent the remnant average tf vachaud et al 1985 as claimed by most of the published studies table s2 in this regard claiming throughfall time stability without considering structural changes can lead to misinterpretation several studies have argued about the throughfall time stability in different types of forests around the world indicating positions which could be used to monitor the throughfall spatial average table s2 moreover the importance of weather characteristics e g rainfall intensity duration and amount and wind speed on throughfall time stability liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 have also been highlighted however canopy structure has been recognized to be more important than weather characteristics for throughfall spatial and temporal dynamics nanko et al 2016 sheng and cai 2021 staelens et al 2006 wullaert et al 2009 the significance has already been linked to leafed and leafless periods or growing and dormant periods because a shift in the spatial distribution was observed when both periods were evaluated separately staelens et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2008 since the hydrological year scale encompasses wet and dry periods some instability in the spatial variability of throughfall figs 6 and 7 can be attached to the semi deciduousness of the atlantic forest stand however most studies consider a short monitoring period such as a season or just one hydrological year whereas longer studies 4 years are scarce table s2 because the response to drought conditions is delayed see forest drought feedbacks and the tf time stability topic significant changes in the forest structure and canopy composition were not ascertained in the studies with short monitoring periods even forests which have not faced stressful droughts short periods were also unable to account for forest succession this caused a false impression of throughfall time stability for different time intervals and period lengths table 2 and figs s2 s3 and s4 future studies should apply temporal variograms to appraise the period length that the time stability of throughfall persists zimmermann et al 2009 this approach will highlight the maximum period length in which throughfall time stability could be considered without the risk of misinterpretation moreover it will also provide insights into throughfall spatial variability between different time intervals zimmermann et al 2009 most studies did not split the events i e gr 10 mm and 10 mm before assessing the throughfall time stability the canopy rainfall interaction is greater for gr 10 mm as a consequence of rainfall amount and formation of dripping points causing instability in the throughfall spatial variability when all events are put together to account for time stable positions the abovementioned interactions are smoothed due to events 10 mm homogenizing the water inputs within the forest fig 5c 6 and 7 zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 pointed out increased relative errors 40 in the mean throughfall estimates for small events due to a greater canopy rainfall interaction in heterogeneous forests such as tropical forests these authors recommended boosting the number of gauges to decrease throughfall uncertainty mainly when dealing with small events therefore beyond the abovementioned importance of splitting the analyses into saturated gr 10 mm and unsaturated gr 10 mm canopy for a correct assessment of time stability we recommend future studies to improve their monitoring set according to zimmermann and zimmermann 2014 incorrect accounting for the throughfall spatial variability is another source of uncertainty in defining time stable positions mainly regarding small events in tropical forests additional precautions should be taken as long as drier years become more frequent and intense more instability of the tf spatial variability can be expected during droughts due to the greater variability of maximum rainfall intensity as highlighted by the greater coefficient of variation and presence of lighter events fig 4 light events create canopy saturation and unsaturation episodes increasing the time instability of the throughfall spatial variability this instability is also due to the decreased canopy storage capacity and increased splash throughfall as a consequence of heavier events imax 20 mm h 1 therefore indicating overall stable positions will become even harder during droughts 5 conclusion the throughfall spatial variability decreased with gross rainfall amount because a greater canopy rainfall interaction occurred prior to canopy saturation gr 10 mm the different spatial configuration of dripping points which depends on rainfall amount and specie specific characteristics added to the greater importance of canopy openness free throughfall is more relevant in events with lower rainfall amounts increased the temporal changes of the spatial distribution before canopy saturation i e throughfall is more time instable for small events forest structure also demonstrated importance for the throughfall spatial variability after canopy saturation highlighting species which either booster rainfall interception drier plots or improve canopy drainage wetter plots however tropical forests are in constant development either ecologically succeeding or adaptating to natural anthropogenic disturbances e g droughts logging and fire this development changes forest structure and therefore the throughfall time stability i e defining time stable positions is not straightforward because the throughfall spatial distribution changes with forest dynamics as highlighted by the differences in the time stable positions for different periods lengths these results can only be tracked by long monitoring periods and claiming time stability in shorter periods one year or less can lead to misinterpretation the throughfall spatial variability was less time stable in the prolonged drought period than in the non drought period the greater concentration of events with light intensities and the presence of more extreme events heavy intensities 20 mm h 1 are responsible for increasing time instability light events can either saturate or unsaturate the canopy depending on their duration long or short events this creates different spatial configurations of throughfall distribution affecting the spatial variability over time moreover the heavier the event the lower the storage capacity of the canopy and the greater the amount of splash throughfall formed this increases the throughfall input and the randomness of the spatial distribution in a climate change scenario where droughts become more intense and frequent more throughfall time instability can be expected as long as the observed distribution of rainfall intensities in the prolonged drought is maintained future works should consider the effects of droughts and forest dynamics on throughfall time stability considering the abovementioned issues will prevent misinterpreting time stability and provide a more precise definition of time stable positions funding this

3489,the popularity of subsurface distributed storage based kerbside stormwater infiltration systems is increasing because they can be integrated within the strict spatial constraints of existing infrastructure distributed systems operate based on the concept of spreading a limited amount of storage throughout the catchment area to achieve runoff management objectives storage can also limit the performance of urban stormwater systems this study investigated the role of storage capacity especially the volumetric capacity and the emptying time in the performance of kerbside leaky well systems in a residential catchment area with a native clay soil environment a detailed process based deterministic hydrological model was used to analyze hydrologic storage via a continuous simulation approach the model was calibrated against catchment outflows measured with stormwater infiltration devices individual kerbside infiltration systems were also calibrated to monitor the behavior of on site kerbside infiltration systems by using approach of continuous simulations during designed scenarios this study considered the prestorm storage availability in the hydrological analysis the results demonstrated that hydrologic storage greatly influences the performance of kerbside leaky well systems during higher intensity storms in addition the results show that distributing a stormwater storage volume equal to thirty five 1 kl rainwater tanks across the catchment area as a kerbside infiltration system could notably reduce the runoff flow rates and volumes the results further highlight that the addition of more homes within the connected area could diminish the stormwater reduction benefits achieved through the installation of a distributed kerbside infiltration system keywords water sensitive urban design infiltration systems hydrological analysis hydraulic modelling infill development epa swmm 1 introduction urbanisation is expected to increase under the stress of a growing population at the global scale among the approaches implemented to manage a growing urban population policy makers worldwide are adopting infill development as a policy to manage the spread of urban areas in doing so the aim is to limit the complications associated with city expansion including the development of new service infrastructure and the loss of natural landscapes and agricultural land along the urban fringe abedini and khalili 2019 the focus on infill development however can result in an increased imperviousness in existing urban catchments e g individual allotments with yard space are converted into lots with multiple dwelling roofs driveways and other impervious spaces at the cost of pervious areas and associated depression storage kemp and myers 2015 urban stormwater runoff carries pollutants from roads streets driveways and roofs into receiving water bodies argue and pezzaniti 2006 and the increase in runoff flow rates due to the above increased impervious areas exhibits the potential to mobilise higher pollutant loads from urban catchments this can potentially cause further degradation of downstream waterbodies ramier et al 2011 the adoption of a water sensitive urban design wsud philosophy represents an opportunity to manage additional runoff without the need to rehabilitate existing stormwater infrastructure wsud in australia involves the implementation of sustainable measures to manage water resources including stormwater in australia this term is adopted in a similar way to other broadly similar terms internationally including best management practices bmps and green infrastructure in the usa sustainable drainage systems suds in the uk and sponge cities in china fletcher et al 2014 the introduction of wsud for peak flow and volume management purposes effectively entails detention and retention storage enhancement in each catchment wsud for stormwater peak flow and volume management includes source control measures such as kerbside infiltration systems which are generally designed to capture and retain runoff volumes and allow infiltration into native soil moore et al 2016 the adoption of wsud in urban catchments may represent an opportunity to overcome the gradually increasing peak flow and runoff volumes jamali et al 2020 for example kerbside infiltration systems comprise a potential retrofitting technique for residential catchments due to their ease of installation without major construction activities argue et al 2013 the installation of distributed kerbside infiltration systems provides alternative flow paths for urban runoff flows thereby diverting them from the stormwater drainage system into the subsurface environment fry and maxwell 2017 through infiltration into the native subsurface soil stormwater is retained in the catchment the decision to adopt infiltration measures requires information regarding the hydrologic characteristics of the catchment future development conditions including the extent of infill development and stormwater runoff peak flow reduction benefits argue et al 2013 the available infiltration options for developed catchments are more limited than those available for greenfield scenarios due to spatial constraints e g there occurs an established mix of public and private land and the presence of water power and wastewater infrastructure limits the public space this poses a challenge for designers to propose solutions that can effectively contribute to runoff reduction and can still be installed within the limited available public space grey et al 2018 distributed kerbside infiltration systems can be a good solution for stormwater management of existing urban catchments kronaveter et al 2001 in addition to stormwater volume and pollutant interception distributed kerbside infiltration systems can supplement the drainage system capacity through peak flow rate reduction argue and pezzaniti 2006 and can be installed with a small footprint despite their popularity in many urban areas their performance and limitations remain unclear sharma et al 2016 an example of distributed kerbside infiltration systems includes kerbside leaky well systems a relatively new concept of stormwater infiltration kerbside leaky well systems offer the advantage of smaller dimensions which enable them to be retrofitted in an existing urban environment without interfering with other infrastructure services including telecommunications electricity and water supply systems fry and maxwell 2017 the advantage of their small dimensions however comes at the expense of their storage capacity a major factor that influences the performance of kerbside leaky well systems gomes calixto et al 2020 avellaneda and jefferson 2020 in their research have concluded that major effects of wsud systems on catchment hydrology can be observed if more than 20 of connected impervious area drains to a wsud system the distributed storage systems can be connected to greater percentage of connected impervious area however for significant impact on catchment hydrology individual wsud systems needs to have enough volumetric capacity to meet the storage demands of catchment runoff during peak flowrate storms the available storage capacity of a kerbside leaky well system is influenced by different factors such as the total storage volume emptying rate temporal patterns and connected impervious area stewart et al 2017 it is tempting to adopt a distributed kerbside infiltration system without disturbing the existing infrastructure or the need for massive construction activities however the optimal storage capacity to achieve a notable impact should be considered in terms of kerbside infiltration systems storage is a complex process the available storage to manage runoff during a given storm event is a function of two variables argue et al 2013 myers and pezzaniti 2018 a the total storage volume of the system which allows the kerbside infiltration system to capture stormwater from the street before exfiltration into the surrounding soil and b prestorm storage which depends on the exfiltration rate of kerbside infiltration systems the emptying time in this study we applied the term hydrological storage to refer to the combination of these variables we also considered the impact of increasing the housing density on the performance of kerbside leaky well systems by varying the connected impervious area through the addition of more homes this analysis enabled us to forecast the behavior of kerbside leaky well systems installed in denser catchment areas and with increased connected impervious area a hydrological model is an acceptable tool to determine the impact of storage on the runoff interception efficiency of kerbside infiltration systems implemented at the catchment scale avila et al 2016 most modelling based impact assessment studies however have either reported results with no calibration or have considered single storm events for model calibration purposes leonard and gato trinidad 2020 criticised this approach noting that this ignores variable antecedent catchment conditions and disregards the impact of the available prestorm storage volume in computing the efficiency of a wsud system including infiltration to control urban runoff continuous simulation approaches alleviate these shortcomings by considering prestorm conditions ball et al 2019 myers and pezzaniti 2018 one drawback of the continuous simulation approach is that most previous studies have applied large timesteps in simulations a large timestep can compromise the ability to simulate the runoff peak flow rate ball et al 2019 another problem with prior modelling based impact assessment studies is that the majority has not documented calibration procedures for their catchment models containing wsud elements against observed outflows locatelli et al 2017 moreover few impact assessment studies based on hydrological modelling approaches have evaluated the ability of models to represent wsud systems with an objective statistical framework roldin et al 2012 for example avellaneda and jefferson 2020 performed a detailed study to determine the sensitivity of 16 hydrological metrics to the installation of raingardens within a 26 km2 catchment with the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model while the model was calibrated against preinstallation catchment conditions based on hourly temporal data the study did not report on the model performance to stand for installed raingardens the working mechanism of infiltration involves several complex hydrological processes such as the capture of runoff from street gutters and the corresponding recovery process which involves infiltration into the native soil as defined by the exfiltration rate of the system szota et al 2019 these factors are non linear in nature for example infiltration from kerbside infiltration systems entails the lateral exfiltration process instead of a process subject to a constant seepage rate ignoring these aspects results in oversimplification of the working mechanism of infiltration devices impact assessment studies based on hydrological modelling however should create a robust baseline for the evaluation of the performance of a kerbside infiltration system one method of creating a baseline is to model the behaviour of installed kerbside infiltration systems thus capturing their true performance during different storm events this is difficult to simulate without the incorporation of a detailed representation of the installed systems into the catchment model and calibration against outflows niazi et al 2017 1 1 research gap regarding kerbside infiltration systems it is important to consider the factor of hydrological storage to determine their potential to reduce catchment outflows several studies grey et al 2018 sapdhare et al 2019 szota et al 2019 have investigated the efficacy of kerbside distributed tree pits and leaky wells at the individual system level by changing variables e g drainage media gutter slope capture zone and approach flow velocity however none of these studies have scaled up the performance of individual systems to determine their effect on catchment runoff characteristics we were unable to identify any study reporting the impact of distributed kerbside infiltration systems at the catchment scale based on a validated hydrological model calibrated against the individual system performance and catchment outflows with infiltration with continuous simulations to understand the impact of varying storage factors this represents important information as the uptake of distributed kerbside infiltration systems is on the rise due to the focus of the government on infill development promotion government of south australia 2017 in this situation urban planners should understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of the installation of kerbside infiltration systems with limited storage the results of this study could enable urban planners to better understand the impact of storage on the performance of distributed kerbside infiltration systems 1 2 research contributions in this study we adopted a distributed dual drainage hydrological model to examine the effect of the storage volume prestorm storage and connected impervious areas on the performance of kerbside leaky well systems the study performed continuous simulations to consider the effect of the available prestorm storage volume on the retention system performance this aspect has not been widely reported in the literature the results of this study could benefit catchment managers in the selection of appropriate wsud technologies to address the increased runoff volume and peak flow rates due to ongoing greenfield and infill development 2 methods and materials herein a hydrological modelling approach was applied in a case study catchment to achieve the stated objectives the study analysed the impact of the variability in the hydrological storage and connected impervious area on the performance of individual kerbside leaky well systems we also analysed the influence of these parameters on catchment outflows 2 1 case study catchment background and data collection an example of measures to reduce the extent of greenfield development along urban fringes is the 30 year plan for greater adelaide the capital of south australia australia which was developed by the government of south australia 2017 the plan contains a target to manage urban growth by ensuring that 70 of new development occurs within the existing urban footprint by adopting policies to encourage infill development whereby higher density living is implemented through small to large scale redevelopment of existing land parcels it is accepted however that this strategy can increase runoff peak flow and runoff volumes considering this situation we selected a 17 45 ha residential catchment in hawthorn an inner suburb of adelaide south australia australia the catchment was selected based on its proximity to the adelaide cbd 6 km to the southeast and a housing density of six allotments per hectare which represents low density detached housing and is representative of a majority of residential urban development in australia spencer et al 2015 based on current data detached housing is by far the most common type of residential property in australia 72 of total dwellings australian bureau of statistics 2017 considering policies that aim to increase the allotment density near urban centers such as the adelaide 30 year plan government of south australia 2017 it is anticipated that the housing density and the connected impervious area may increase in the case study area which was factored into the study scenarios the results can be used by catchment managers to assess the efficacy of kerbside leaky wells and ameliorate the hydrologic impact of increases in the urban density in typical residential catchment areas the catchment characteristics along with the stormwater drainage systems and kerbside leaky well locations are shown in fig 1 the catchment contains 97 houses and 11 detached residential units the catchment exhibits a gentle slope along the west direction with an average gradient of 0 5 the catchment was selected due to the availability of runoff data before and after the installation of 181 kerbside inlets and leaky well systems across the catchment these systems comprise a kerbside inlet orifice treenet r750 plates that intercepts kerbside runoff for storage in an adjacent kerbside leaky well where it infiltrates the surrounding soil the kerbside leaky well systems comprise a 250 mm perforated pipe which also functions as temporary storage runoff from the street gutter is conveyed via a 90 mm pvc pipe the intended installation depth of the kerbside leaky wells was 1 4 m however due to variations in the soil and rock surrounding the systems the actual depth of the wells ranged from 0 82 m to 1 4 m fig 2 the total storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems in the case study catchment fig 2 was 110 l on average including the infiltration zone the systems were installed in clay soil and the observed exfiltration rate reached 0 002 l sec 2 2 data collection and model selection and development rainfall runoff monitoring has been ongoing in the study catchment since january 2016 the data time series included three periods a period without wsud january 2016 to january 2017 a period during which wsud was implemented in the form of 93 kerbside leaky wells january 2017 to january 2018 and a period with all 181 kerbside leaky wells operational january 2018 to the present rainfall and runoff monitoring data were obtained at a one minute resolution because a small time step is useful to obtain an accurate estimate of the peak flow rate in this relatively small and volatile urban catchment the model used in this study was selected based on scientific reviews of hydrological models to simulate the physical processes of urban catchments the critical features considered in the selection of the model included the ability to represent 1 varying catchment scales 2 pipe hydraulics 3 flow routing 4 varying temporal resolutions and 5 both major and minor system flows 6 the ability to conduct continuous simulations and 7 the inbuild option to model infiltration systems based on these criteria we reviewed articles on modelling software reviews by zoppou 2001 elliott and trowsdale 2007 jayasooriya and ng 2014 and kaykhosravi et al 2018 based on these reviews and our criteria we shortlisted four suitable modelling tools epaswmm rossman 2015 and its commercial variant pcswmm chi canada mike urban dhi mouse 2017 and music ewater 2014 music was excluded because of its limited pipe hydraulics temporal resolution 5 minute or greater and lack of a flow routing capability mike urban does not provide a built in solution to represent infiltration systems elliott and trowsdale 2007 whereas pcswmm offers a suite of wsud systems kaykhosravi et al 2018 noted in their review that swmm is the most commonly used deterministic modelling tool for estimating the benefits of wsud systems therefore we chose the epaswmm based platformpcwsmm a commercial variant of epaswmm for hydrological modelling pcswmm satisfies all the model selection criteria is compatible with gis tools and includes an automated dual drainage creator furthermore it has been recommended for use in studies on the performance of infiltration systems fanelli et al 2017 a description of the preparation of a deterministic model of the catchment and kerbside leaky wells was previously detailed by shahzad et al 2021 briefly the model was developed in three steps first a dual drainage catchment model was prepared in pcswmm software version 7 2 considering advanced pipe hydraulics which represented the catchment prior to the installation of kerbside leaky wells this model was populated with parameters to represent the preinstallation catchment characteristics most of the parameters including the sub catchment area imperviousness and drainage system features were measured in the field or obtained from the local government authority city of mitcham in the form of a geographical information system shapefile regarding the other parameters including the width manning s n coefficient for pervious and impervious surfaces and catchment infiltration parameters automated calibration to continuous time series data was performed with the parameter estimation model pest version 15 to acquire a set of parameters yielding the best fit to the observed hydrographs second the storage capacity and emptying rate of individual kerbside leaky well systems were simulated this was conducted by collecting field data measuring the filling and emptying characteristics of three wells with water level sensors these data were analysed to develop an approach to effectively simulate the performance of kerbside leaky wells based on the orifice outlet which was demonstrated to be superior to the pcswmm infiltration options shahzad et al 2021 this increased the reliability of the results in this study as the simulated behaviour of kerbside leaky well systems was based on the observed filling and emptying characteristics of the installed kerbside leaky well systems this enabled the study to simulate prospective scenarios in a realistic way third during model preparation the impact of kerbside leaky wells was incorporated into the preinstallation model this catchment model with kerbside leaky wells was then calibrated against rainfall and flow observation data from january 2018 onwards and a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 73 was achieved for a one year continuous simulation the nse value of individual storm events extracted from the continuous flow time series ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 these nse values indicated that the prediction model was acceptable for further application model evaluation was performed and reported shahzad et al 2021 based on recommendations of the american society of civil engineers asce task committee 1993 to perform continuous simulation based evaluation of the wsud element performance we adopted a continuous simulation model of the measured rainfall january 2016 to december 2018 and developed a flow series for each simulation scenario storm events were extracted from the flow series according to the principles of partial duration series pds the storm event extraction criteria were based on selected events at least 12 h apart with a minimum flow rate threshold of 10 l s green infrastructure is typically designed to cater to frequent storm events green and jolly 2018 for this reason the assessment of the kerbside leaky well performance excluded larger more intense storm events those resulting in catchment outflows with flowrate higher than 300 l sec 6 storm events 2 3 development of the modelling scenarios the reference scenario i e the catchment with no wsud was simulated considering three years of rainfall data with the preinstallation model as reported in shahzad et al 2021 the postinstallation model shahzad et al 2021 was simulated considering three years of rainfall data this provided the outputs to ascertain the stormwater runoff and flow rate reduction benefits of the installed kerbside leaky well systems during various events we then simulated three scenarios to better understand the influences of the amount of storage and an increasing urban density on catchment runoff and the flow rate to this end we divided the storage factor into two components the total storage volume and the emptying time in addition we considered the impact of increasing the urban density by adding more house to the present catchment model another factor that can influence performance of kerbside leaky well systems is the catchment slope however previous studies e g sapdhare et al 2019 have indicated that these systems and similar infiltration systems argue et al 2013 are better suited to low gradients therefore the impact of the gradient was not investigated an overview of the adopted scenarios in this study is shown in fig 3 2 3 1 baseline scenarios these scenarios served as a benchmark against which the runoff reduction benefits were evaluated as such we initially ran the preinstallation model shahzad et al 2021 considering rainfall data for three years we also ran the present case of kerbside leaky well systems for three years to create baselines of the possible stormwater reduction benefits across the selected flow rate groups the outputs of this baseline comparison provided us with the criteria to evaluate the outputs of the three subsequent scenarios total storage volume under this scenario the catchment model was simulated with the present configuration of installed kerbside leaky well systems the storage volume was increased in regular increments while maintaining the exfiltration rate at the present level emptying time this scenario was simulated by adjusting the exfiltration rate to a maximum value of 10 h and a minimum value of two hours the total storage volume under this scenario remained at the present level connected impervious area this scenario was simulated by adopting growth rates to accomplish 10 and 30 year infill development the storage volume and exfiltration rate were maintained at the present levels the scenario provided information regarding the diminishing effectiveness of kerbside leaky well systems when these devices are installed in a catchment area with comparatively denser housing the results of these scenarios were grouped according to certain flow rate threshold groups as summarised in table 1 the categorization depended on the baseline no wsud scenario and remained constant throughout all the following analyses the improvements in the interception capacity of the individual kerbside leaky well systems and catchment outflows were then compared to the runoff interception efficiency of the kerbside leaky well systems under the present configuration considering the targeted flow rates the rate of increase in the connected impervious area due to development growth was retrieved from another study on nearby urban catchments conducted by myers et al 2014 the methods adopted for development growth determination are described in detail in section 2 5 in this study we estimated the growth rate for 10 year id10 and 30 year id30 periods as listed in table 3 2 4 total storage volume rainfall data for three years measured at the site were used to run the validated postinstallation pcswmm model representing the study catchment with the installed kerbside leaky well systems these scenarios focused on the quantification of changes in the performance of kerbside leaky wells with increasing storage volume the storage node representing the storage capacity of the existing kerbside leaky well systems with a storage volume ranging from 82 to 134 l was adjusted to simulate kerbside leaky well systems with a higher storage capacity in each case the exfiltration rate remained the same as the present level i e 0 002 l sec volume increase was simulated by assuming storage pipes as shown in fig 2 of different diameters readily available from australian manufacturers table 2 provides the geometry of the simulated well sizes based on this scenario we noted the total runoff volume peak flow rate and intercepted runoff for each storm event we then reported the percentage of the total runoff volume intercepted across each flow rate group we also reported the catchment outflows and average flow rate across the flow rate groups to ascertain the impacts of increasing the storage volume on the catchment runoff regime statistical analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that the main effects of the installed infiltration devices are insensitive to the storage volume of the individual kerbside leaky wells and that any variations in storage volume do not produce significant main effects on the catchment runoff discharge we tested this hypothesis via ordinary two way analysis of variance anova based on methods described in quinn and keough 2002 we constructed models based on flow rate group mean and standard deviation values of runoff flows corresponding to the total storage volume as presented in table 1 two way anova was followed by an appropriate post hoc test dunnett test quinn and keough 2002 to identify the true cause of the sensitivity of the runoff response to variations in the kerbside infiltration systems the analysis assisted in the identification of the required storage volume to produce significant main effects 2 4 1 impact of the emptying time the focus of this scenario was to analyse the performance of kerbside leaky well systems under varying exfiltration rates the exfiltration rate determines the storage availability before the arrival of a new storm event this parameter is a function of the native soil type filter medium properties and hydraulically efficient fissures in adjacent soil attributed to the presence of tree roots johnson et al 2016 the installed kerbside leaky well systems across the catchment exfiltrated 100 l in approximately 10 h the kerbside leaky wells contained in the model represented three configurations mainly varying in depth to establish equal emptying features of all the wells regardless of storage we varied the volumetric exfiltration rate from 0 002 to 0 004 l sec the second emptying time was selected based on a report by bartens et al 2008 they reported that tree roots can improve infiltration into native soil by 153 therefore the discharge rate at the storage node was adjusted to improve the emptying time by 150 this provided us with an emptying time of 8 h we then selected a minimum emptying time of two hours as reported for green roofs by locatelli et al 2014 between emptying times of two and four hours 2 hour increments were selected to better understand the impact of variation on the interception capacity of the kerbside leaky wells all adopted volumetric rates under the different scenarios are presented in table 3 five scenarios were carried out the emptying rate was then plotted against the runoff interception volume runoff interception was estimated by comparing the kerbside leaky well infiltration volume to the total catchment discharge 2 5 connected impervious area direct discharge of roof runoff into the street is a common practice in australia argue et al 2013 this suggests that as development occurs in a catchment additional roof areas directly discharge into the street stormwater system thus indicating an increase in the connected impervious area avila et al 2016 myers et al 2014 performed a detailed study to estimate the infill development growth rate in a southern adelaide catchment area frederick street catchment glengowrie south australia based on their analysis we adopted an annual development growth rate of 0 65 a gradual increase in dwellings in the catchment area rounded to the nearest number during a given year this growth rate translated into 1 3 homes per year in the angas road case study catchment we estimated the increased number of homes according to development scenarios of 10 and 30 years the australian bureau of statistics abs 2016 reported that the average roof area of a house in south australia reaches approximately 200 m2 considering this value we investigated the current allotment distribution in the catchment and identified those allotments that could be transformed into two houses each with a roof area of 200 m2 as previously noted the catchment contains relatively large allotments and therefore most of these allotments may be redeveloped into two or more homes table 4 summarises the present housing distribution level and the expected number of subdivisible allotments in this manner we increased the connected impervious area 2 6 description of the model updating methods to represent the model scenarios following the simulation of the no wsud scenario considering rainfall data for three years the model was updated to run the various scenarios as shown in fig 3 changes reflecting infill development were implemented in the postinstallation model to represent future catchment scenarios growth rates of 0 65 and 1 3 homes per year were applied to quantify the 10 and 30 year imperviousness characteristics respectively of the catchment table 4 lists the number of houses that should be added in the catchment to reflect 10 and 30 year growth levels fig 4 shows the locations of the modified lots to include two infill development cases the resultant catchment parameters that were modified from the present model are presented in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 reference scenario the results of the reference scenario table 5 indicated that the installed kerbside leaky well systems reduced the peak flow rate for group a events by 15 there was also a 17 reduction in runoff volume in this group in group b the intercepted runoff volume was 143 kl larger than that in group a but the reduction percentage was lower these results demonstrate that in their present configuration each kerbside leaky well system intercepts an average runoff volume of 5 kl per year 3 2 impact of the storage volume the results when varying the total storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems indicated that an increase in storage volume improved the runoff retention performance based on a three year simulation period increasing the storage pipe diameter from 250 to 375 mm retained 150 to 250 kl more runoff from the catchment than did the present systems the improvement was the most notable for storms with a peak flow up to 100 l s fig 5 shows the average flow reduction improvement achieved by increasing the storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems a detailed breakdown of the improvements in the runoff reduction in terms of the percentage reduction is provided in table s1 of the supplementary information the storage volume increase benefits were also translated into lower discharges from the catchment the fig 6 shows that with increasing storage volume the catchment discharge decreased across all flow rate groups in the low flow rate groups there was an 83 reduction in the 10th runoff volume percentile however in the 10th percentile of group d the runoff volume was reduced by only 15 the reduction effect of increasing the storage volume was also observed in the 90th percentile in group a the 90th percentile runoff volume was reduced by 32 for group a storms and for group d storms this percentile was reduced by 27 in quantitative terms these are important reductions that can be achieved by increasing the storage volume by 150 however the results of two way anova indicated that these reduction amounts did not induce a significant main effect on catchment hydrology and there was an 18 chance of randomly observing an effect that was larger or smaller in an experiment of this size we concluded that this effect is nonsignificant however we further explored the two way anova results via a post hoc test by establishing a no wsud scenario as the control dunnett s test indicated that a significant effect on the runoff volume only occurred if the storage volume was increased by 150 installing a pipe with a diameter of 375 mm at p 0 039 the detailed results of dunnett s test with a 95 confidence interval are presented in the supplementary material table s2 storage volume increase did produce significant main effects on flow rate reduction two way anova revealed that the storage volume of the kerbside leaky wells accounted for 3 of the total variation in the average group flow rates f 30 09 5 642 p value less than 0 0001 in simple terms this suggests that if the storage volume does not affect the flow rate there is a less than 0 01 chance of randomly observing this large reduction amount in mean group flow rate fig 7 dunnett s post hoc test conducted by establishing a no wsud scenario as a control indicated that a significant difference between group means occurred when kerbside leaky wells with at least 275 mm pipes an increase of 110 were simulated we attributed this improvement in the capability of the kerbside leaky well systems to reduce the runoff flow rate to the higher interception capacity of the kerbside leaky wells to retain captured runoff which then exfiltrated into the surrounding soil at the present volumetric exfiltration rate this resulted in providing runoff flows with another pathway available through the network of kerbside leaky wells instead of flowing directly towards the catchment outlet this aspect is important as a larger runoff volume is lost from the drainage line to the native soil environment through the kerbside leaky wells which offsets the hydrographs of the different sub catchments this impact was also observed at high flowrates these results suggest that by optimally distributing the storage amount 88 to 202 l significant peak flow reductions can be achieved for a relatively small total storage amount from 23 to 35 kl as the hydrographs of the different sub catchments can be offset this storage amount requires the installation of 23 to 35 1 kl rainwater tanks rainwater tanks however exhibit uncontrolled variables in the form of the emptying time which depends on domestic usage while the adoption of smart tanks as reported by jamali et al 2020 can control this variable the relative costs of smart system installation should be considered the storage volume did not manifest significant main effects on runoff volume reduction compared to the no wsud scenario increasing the storage volume atleast by 150 over the present storage level yielded a significant effect according to dunnett s post hoc test a closer examination of the simulation results revealed that to attain significant main effects a constant decrease in runoff volume during group c and d storms is required these results are justifiable because the main effects are influenced by large events and a greater runoff portion is produced during group c and d storms notably fig 7 shows that by increasing storage from 110 to 120 the average flow rate was only reduced by 3 during group d storms second during high intensity storms the catchment discharged more runoff as this group comprises storms of a higher intensity and duration due to this factor although the kerbside leaky wells captured more runoff fig 5 the interception amounts remained smaller than the event totals this suggests that despite an increase in surface area a large portion of high flow rate storms could still bypass the kerbside inlets without capture occurring additionally we did not vary the capture area of the installed kerbside leaky well systems szota et al 2019 indicated that the capture area of kerbside systems is a significant factor that can influence their performance therefore a potential cause of the relatively nonsignificant improvement during high flow rate storms could be the constant area of the capture zone solutions to these problems could include reconfiguration of street gutters increasing the depth of the bowl depression in front of the inlet thereby reducing the flow velocity and increasing the capture potential and where possible adopting even larger volumes through large pipes or kerbside trenches however these solutions are limited due to economic viability site constraints such as underlying services and space restrictions the enhanced runoff interception of the kerbside leaky well systems was further manifested as an improvement in annual runoff retention fig 8 shows that storage volume increase resulted in approximately 300 kl of additional retention annually based on a consistent volumetric exfiltration rate 0 002 l s another notable result of storage volume increase was that complete emptying of the kerbside leaky wells expanded beyond the 10 hour timeframe of existing systems further research should be conducted on the adoption of larger wells which may enable a corresponding higher or lower exfiltration rate due to the increased exposed surface area the results of this study however indicated that kerbside leaky well systems with an increased storage volume can capture enough runoff resulting in full occupancy of a given leaky well this in combination with the wet season saturated subsurface soil conditions and low evaporation rates in winter can manifest in a longer emptying time petrucci et al 2012 therefore in the wet winter season during the likely occurrence of consecutive events kerbside leaky wells may attain varied and compromised performance levels regarding runoff management this aspect resulted in only a modest improvement during high flow events high flow storms are also accompanied by significant prebursts this suggests that at the start of a high flow storm the full capacity of a kerbside leaky well system may not be available gomes calixto et al 2020 the critical impact of prestorm storage on the performance of retention systems was also acknowledged by gomes calixto et al 2020 they reported a peak flow rate reduction of 32 with the complete storage capacity available and the same system reduced the peak flow rate by only 15 when the initial storage was only partially available 3 3 emptying time the results when reducing the emptying time of the wells effectively increasing the exfiltration rate indicate that an improvement in the runoff volume reduction of up to 13 was achieved for group a storms i e 20 for the present case to 33 if the kerbside leaky wells can empty in two hours after intercepting the runoff fig 9 at shorter emptying times the captured stormwater was discharged faster into the surrounding environment thus creating more available volume for runoff capture szota et al 2019 reducing the emptying time from 10 to 2 h still almost doubled the retained runoff volume of the wells for group d storms the statistical transformation of the runoff flow and volume data revealed the influence across all the flowrate groups fig 10 these reductions however were nonsignificant according to the results of two way anova of the main effects increasing the emptying time accounted for 0 1188 of the total variance f 0 35 dfn 5 dfd 657 and p value 0 8822 there occurred an 88 chance of randomly observing an effect this large with no emptying time change from the present case i e a 10 hour emptying time the effect was considered nonsignificant this finding supports the argument that to control the runoff volume larger storage volumes are more important than the emptying time at the catchment scale the total runoff retention level increased from 985 kl at the monitored volumetric exfiltration 0 002 l sec to 1613 76 kl at the ideal exfiltration rate 0 019 l sec fig 12 the study findings align with the proposed theory of argue et al 2012 that kerbside leaky wells are better placed to function as source control devices in high drainage soils this analysis also indicated that the presence and activity of tree roots which could result in a 153 improvement in the hydraulic efficiency of the surrounding soil bartens et al 2008 yielded an exfiltration rate of up to 0 005 l s resulting in a 14 greater annual retention over the present case fig 12 previous research johnson et al 2016 on the impacts of tree roots as conduits for both uptake and preferential flow pathways has indicated that the hydraulic redistribution phenomenon can occur immediately upon the installation of kerbside leaky well systems this suggests that the present systems can potentially be expected to retain 14 more runoff annually than expected due to the presence of tree roots we were not in possession of field data for tree root uptakes and moments for the catchment trees and therefore only relied on the values reported in published literature to conduct our analysis however more focused research on the impact of tree roots on the exfiltration capacity of the surrounding soil should be performed to better understand the performance of kerbside leaky well systems while this study has analysed the impact of emptying time we could not analyse the influence of clogging clogging is a time dependent variable which may reduce the storage capacity of leaky wells over time this factor could further highlight the critical nature of limited storage capacity of installed leaky wells in terms of the flow rate fig 11 the two way anova showed significant results regarding the main effects of the emptying time which accounted for 0 2711 of the total variance f 2 90 dfn 5 dfd 657 p value 0 0135 without the influence of the emptying time there is a 1 3 chance of randomly observing this decrease in the runoff flow rate therefore this effect is considered small but significant 3 4 connected impervious area 3 4 1 runoff generation the assumed levels of catchment development and thus the increased impervious area generated more runoff per hectare across all flow rate groups table 6 there were linear trends of increasing runoff volumes and flow rates for all flow rate groups with increasing imperviousness table s4 of the supplementary data provides a detailed breakdown of the percentage increase across all flowrate groups in the no wsud catchment the low flow rate groups attained a proportionally larger increase in runoff per hectare than did the high flow rate groups group a exhibited increases of 31 and 57 in the runoff volume per hectare under both development scenarios group b attained increases of 33 and 65 under the 10 and 30 year development scenarios respectively this effect is attributed to the increase in the connected impervious area and the reduction in the influence of pervious areas on runoff flow delay due to natural storage gomes calixto et al 2020 in the case of high flow rate storms the increase in the contributing area may also have resulted in a greater contribution of runoff originating from pervious areas gomes calixto et al 2020 however verification of the contribution of pervious areas to runoff generation is beyond the scope of this paper another reason is that street gutters only convey the designed runoff during high flow rate events extra runoff due to an increase in discharge may follow other available flow paths such as low depression areas fry and maxwell 2017 roldin et al 2012 this results in an increase in the runoff bypass volume across the kerbside leaky well inlets in the high flow rate group the increases in runoff per hectare suggest that the storage capacity of the present kerbside leaky well systems is insufficient to compensate for the loss of natural storage sites within the catchment also the increases in the peak flow rate and total runoff volume with increasing development highlights the need to consider this aspect in planning kemp and myers 2015 regarding the implementation of wsud systems the results table 6 indicated that the kerbside leaky well systems can maintain the runoff per hectare below the no wsud case level in groups a and b under the 10 year development scenario only however in the high flow rate groups the present capacity of the kerbside leaky well systems did not offset the effects of the increased runoff volume or peak flow this suggests that by installing systems under the case study layout additional stormwater management measures are required to maintain current stormwater service levels with increasing development when development was projected 30 years forward the catchment generated more runoff than did the present catchment across all flow rate groups the increased runoff flow rate and volume indicated that en route to the catchment outlet stormwater runoff was not intercepted at the same hydrologic efficiency as it was in the present state of the catchment this occurs because the runoff increase resulted in an increased demand for storage but with a limited storage availability the generated runoff instead followed the stormwater drainage path without interception by the network of kerbside infiltration systems however bypass flow should also be considered for its impact on the hydraulic efficency of inlets as demonstrated by sapdhare et al 2019 nevertheless adopting a larger storage volume can help to partially offset the decrease in efficiency of kerbside leaky well systems as demonstrated in section 3 2 the results summarised in table s1 of supplementary information indicate that with a 300 mm diameter storage volume the kerbside leaky wells could potentially retain 12 more runoff than could the installed kerbside leaky well systems in the present catchment this suggests that by installing kerbside leaky wells with 300 mm pipes the increase in groups a and b under the 10 year growth scenario could be negated noting that these larger wells may still not reduce runoff during group c and d storms in the case of development however the major reason for adopting infiltration devices is to manage runoff during small to medium storms moore et al 2016 therefore to ensure the success of kerbside leaky well systems it is necessary to achieve a good performance in runoff management during group a and b storms 3 4 2 impact of development on the performance of the kerbside leaky well systems the simulated runoff and flow rate at the catchment outfall are shown in fig 13 for all flow rate groups the runoff flow rate and volume both increased across all flow rate groups we first examine the notable flow rate analysis results a pronounced increase in runoff flow rate was observed in group c the average flow rate in this group increased by approximately 40 l s or 37 fig 14 a similar pattern was also observed for the runoff volume groups c and d exhibited an approximately 50 increase in the runoff volume fig 13 we again reiterate that it is possible that during these strong storm events there may also be contributions of pervious areas gomes calixto et al 2020 also noted this aspect in their study regarding the discharge of runoff from pervious areas during storms of a higher intensity and duration the results table 6 also revealed that the runoff increase was more significant than that in the flow rate over the present catchment this occurs because the kerbside leaky well systems did not exert a significant impact on runoff flow rate reduction in the catchment the kerbside leaky well systems exhibited a small footprint and area relative to the contributing area while studies have demonstrated that increasing the connected area improved the performance of distributed storage to store more runoff avellaneda and jefferson 2020 the imperviousness to storage ratio is critical to achieve this outcome the changes in imperviousness of the connected area resulted in a higher discharge with increasing flowrate ensuing quick filling of small storage volumes bypass runoff volume increase and recovery time delay however it should be noted that although enhancing the imperviousness resulted in a greater increase in the runoff volume and flow rate during high flow rate storms fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the increase in the low flow rate groups was more critical this occurs because distributed systems provide considerable runoff reduction benefits during small to medium events only jamali et al 2020 additionally the results of the current study suggested that the kerbside leaky well systems yielded a considerable decrease in runoff patterns during low intensity storms the decline in the performance of the kerbside leaky well systems during these storms due to the increase in connected impervious area indicated that the overall effectiveness of these kerbside leaky well systems was diminished to provide runoff reduction benefits in the catchment it thus becomes important to consider this aspect in planning the installation of kerbside leaky well systems 4 conclusion this study presented an analysis of the application of distributed kerbside stormwater infiltration systems for runoff management at the catchment scale the highlight of this study is the adoption of a calibrated hydrological model considering stormwater infiltration this study demonstrated that with increasing storage volume distributed devices could provide a significant reduction in the runoff volume and flow rate at the catchment scale which was verified through statistical analysis the findings suggested that kerbside infiltration systems are the most effective in managing small to medium storms 12 to 4 exceedance per year ey storms however supplementing these devices with larger storage volumes and or improved emptying rates could enhance their performance levels during high flow storms of the two factors investigated in this study only the storage volume can be reasonably controlled by the designers of these systems because the emptying time of native soil cannot be reasonably changed in a developed catchment based on the results of this study however the performance of these systems can be improved by adopting larger storage volumes for the scenarios presented increasing the storage volume led to an almost linear relationship with the runoff volume reduction and had the most impact on performance in terms of the percentage the impact of the emptying time was significant only when the storage volumes were full and constant exfiltration from leaky wells was the main operating variable the results of this study suggest that based on their capacity the present kerbside leaky well systems will not be able to maintain current service levels as the catchment density approaches the levels estimated for 2030 although the quantity of the intercepted runoff may increase the runoff retention percentage may decrease either an increase in storage volume or the provision of an increased emptying rate no longer than six hours is required the results of this research could ensure that decisions regarding catchment development are made with an appropriate level of information the study recommends that life cycle cost analysis of different retention systems should be carried out under climate change scenarios to better understand the feasibility of kerbside leaky well systems in addition a study comparing distributed and centralized storage operations should be performed to determine the comparative success of each storage option credit authorship contribution statement hussain shahzad conceptualization methodology

3489,the popularity of subsurface distributed storage based kerbside stormwater infiltration systems is increasing because they can be integrated within the strict spatial constraints of existing infrastructure distributed systems operate based on the concept of spreading a limited amount of storage throughout the catchment area to achieve runoff management objectives storage can also limit the performance of urban stormwater systems this study investigated the role of storage capacity especially the volumetric capacity and the emptying time in the performance of kerbside leaky well systems in a residential catchment area with a native clay soil environment a detailed process based deterministic hydrological model was used to analyze hydrologic storage via a continuous simulation approach the model was calibrated against catchment outflows measured with stormwater infiltration devices individual kerbside infiltration systems were also calibrated to monitor the behavior of on site kerbside infiltration systems by using approach of continuous simulations during designed scenarios this study considered the prestorm storage availability in the hydrological analysis the results demonstrated that hydrologic storage greatly influences the performance of kerbside leaky well systems during higher intensity storms in addition the results show that distributing a stormwater storage volume equal to thirty five 1 kl rainwater tanks across the catchment area as a kerbside infiltration system could notably reduce the runoff flow rates and volumes the results further highlight that the addition of more homes within the connected area could diminish the stormwater reduction benefits achieved through the installation of a distributed kerbside infiltration system keywords water sensitive urban design infiltration systems hydrological analysis hydraulic modelling infill development epa swmm 1 introduction urbanisation is expected to increase under the stress of a growing population at the global scale among the approaches implemented to manage a growing urban population policy makers worldwide are adopting infill development as a policy to manage the spread of urban areas in doing so the aim is to limit the complications associated with city expansion including the development of new service infrastructure and the loss of natural landscapes and agricultural land along the urban fringe abedini and khalili 2019 the focus on infill development however can result in an increased imperviousness in existing urban catchments e g individual allotments with yard space are converted into lots with multiple dwelling roofs driveways and other impervious spaces at the cost of pervious areas and associated depression storage kemp and myers 2015 urban stormwater runoff carries pollutants from roads streets driveways and roofs into receiving water bodies argue and pezzaniti 2006 and the increase in runoff flow rates due to the above increased impervious areas exhibits the potential to mobilise higher pollutant loads from urban catchments this can potentially cause further degradation of downstream waterbodies ramier et al 2011 the adoption of a water sensitive urban design wsud philosophy represents an opportunity to manage additional runoff without the need to rehabilitate existing stormwater infrastructure wsud in australia involves the implementation of sustainable measures to manage water resources including stormwater in australia this term is adopted in a similar way to other broadly similar terms internationally including best management practices bmps and green infrastructure in the usa sustainable drainage systems suds in the uk and sponge cities in china fletcher et al 2014 the introduction of wsud for peak flow and volume management purposes effectively entails detention and retention storage enhancement in each catchment wsud for stormwater peak flow and volume management includes source control measures such as kerbside infiltration systems which are generally designed to capture and retain runoff volumes and allow infiltration into native soil moore et al 2016 the adoption of wsud in urban catchments may represent an opportunity to overcome the gradually increasing peak flow and runoff volumes jamali et al 2020 for example kerbside infiltration systems comprise a potential retrofitting technique for residential catchments due to their ease of installation without major construction activities argue et al 2013 the installation of distributed kerbside infiltration systems provides alternative flow paths for urban runoff flows thereby diverting them from the stormwater drainage system into the subsurface environment fry and maxwell 2017 through infiltration into the native subsurface soil stormwater is retained in the catchment the decision to adopt infiltration measures requires information regarding the hydrologic characteristics of the catchment future development conditions including the extent of infill development and stormwater runoff peak flow reduction benefits argue et al 2013 the available infiltration options for developed catchments are more limited than those available for greenfield scenarios due to spatial constraints e g there occurs an established mix of public and private land and the presence of water power and wastewater infrastructure limits the public space this poses a challenge for designers to propose solutions that can effectively contribute to runoff reduction and can still be installed within the limited available public space grey et al 2018 distributed kerbside infiltration systems can be a good solution for stormwater management of existing urban catchments kronaveter et al 2001 in addition to stormwater volume and pollutant interception distributed kerbside infiltration systems can supplement the drainage system capacity through peak flow rate reduction argue and pezzaniti 2006 and can be installed with a small footprint despite their popularity in many urban areas their performance and limitations remain unclear sharma et al 2016 an example of distributed kerbside infiltration systems includes kerbside leaky well systems a relatively new concept of stormwater infiltration kerbside leaky well systems offer the advantage of smaller dimensions which enable them to be retrofitted in an existing urban environment without interfering with other infrastructure services including telecommunications electricity and water supply systems fry and maxwell 2017 the advantage of their small dimensions however comes at the expense of their storage capacity a major factor that influences the performance of kerbside leaky well systems gomes calixto et al 2020 avellaneda and jefferson 2020 in their research have concluded that major effects of wsud systems on catchment hydrology can be observed if more than 20 of connected impervious area drains to a wsud system the distributed storage systems can be connected to greater percentage of connected impervious area however for significant impact on catchment hydrology individual wsud systems needs to have enough volumetric capacity to meet the storage demands of catchment runoff during peak flowrate storms the available storage capacity of a kerbside leaky well system is influenced by different factors such as the total storage volume emptying rate temporal patterns and connected impervious area stewart et al 2017 it is tempting to adopt a distributed kerbside infiltration system without disturbing the existing infrastructure or the need for massive construction activities however the optimal storage capacity to achieve a notable impact should be considered in terms of kerbside infiltration systems storage is a complex process the available storage to manage runoff during a given storm event is a function of two variables argue et al 2013 myers and pezzaniti 2018 a the total storage volume of the system which allows the kerbside infiltration system to capture stormwater from the street before exfiltration into the surrounding soil and b prestorm storage which depends on the exfiltration rate of kerbside infiltration systems the emptying time in this study we applied the term hydrological storage to refer to the combination of these variables we also considered the impact of increasing the housing density on the performance of kerbside leaky well systems by varying the connected impervious area through the addition of more homes this analysis enabled us to forecast the behavior of kerbside leaky well systems installed in denser catchment areas and with increased connected impervious area a hydrological model is an acceptable tool to determine the impact of storage on the runoff interception efficiency of kerbside infiltration systems implemented at the catchment scale avila et al 2016 most modelling based impact assessment studies however have either reported results with no calibration or have considered single storm events for model calibration purposes leonard and gato trinidad 2020 criticised this approach noting that this ignores variable antecedent catchment conditions and disregards the impact of the available prestorm storage volume in computing the efficiency of a wsud system including infiltration to control urban runoff continuous simulation approaches alleviate these shortcomings by considering prestorm conditions ball et al 2019 myers and pezzaniti 2018 one drawback of the continuous simulation approach is that most previous studies have applied large timesteps in simulations a large timestep can compromise the ability to simulate the runoff peak flow rate ball et al 2019 another problem with prior modelling based impact assessment studies is that the majority has not documented calibration procedures for their catchment models containing wsud elements against observed outflows locatelli et al 2017 moreover few impact assessment studies based on hydrological modelling approaches have evaluated the ability of models to represent wsud systems with an objective statistical framework roldin et al 2012 for example avellaneda and jefferson 2020 performed a detailed study to determine the sensitivity of 16 hydrological metrics to the installation of raingardens within a 26 km2 catchment with the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model while the model was calibrated against preinstallation catchment conditions based on hourly temporal data the study did not report on the model performance to stand for installed raingardens the working mechanism of infiltration involves several complex hydrological processes such as the capture of runoff from street gutters and the corresponding recovery process which involves infiltration into the native soil as defined by the exfiltration rate of the system szota et al 2019 these factors are non linear in nature for example infiltration from kerbside infiltration systems entails the lateral exfiltration process instead of a process subject to a constant seepage rate ignoring these aspects results in oversimplification of the working mechanism of infiltration devices impact assessment studies based on hydrological modelling however should create a robust baseline for the evaluation of the performance of a kerbside infiltration system one method of creating a baseline is to model the behaviour of installed kerbside infiltration systems thus capturing their true performance during different storm events this is difficult to simulate without the incorporation of a detailed representation of the installed systems into the catchment model and calibration against outflows niazi et al 2017 1 1 research gap regarding kerbside infiltration systems it is important to consider the factor of hydrological storage to determine their potential to reduce catchment outflows several studies grey et al 2018 sapdhare et al 2019 szota et al 2019 have investigated the efficacy of kerbside distributed tree pits and leaky wells at the individual system level by changing variables e g drainage media gutter slope capture zone and approach flow velocity however none of these studies have scaled up the performance of individual systems to determine their effect on catchment runoff characteristics we were unable to identify any study reporting the impact of distributed kerbside infiltration systems at the catchment scale based on a validated hydrological model calibrated against the individual system performance and catchment outflows with infiltration with continuous simulations to understand the impact of varying storage factors this represents important information as the uptake of distributed kerbside infiltration systems is on the rise due to the focus of the government on infill development promotion government of south australia 2017 in this situation urban planners should understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of the installation of kerbside infiltration systems with limited storage the results of this study could enable urban planners to better understand the impact of storage on the performance of distributed kerbside infiltration systems 1 2 research contributions in this study we adopted a distributed dual drainage hydrological model to examine the effect of the storage volume prestorm storage and connected impervious areas on the performance of kerbside leaky well systems the study performed continuous simulations to consider the effect of the available prestorm storage volume on the retention system performance this aspect has not been widely reported in the literature the results of this study could benefit catchment managers in the selection of appropriate wsud technologies to address the increased runoff volume and peak flow rates due to ongoing greenfield and infill development 2 methods and materials herein a hydrological modelling approach was applied in a case study catchment to achieve the stated objectives the study analysed the impact of the variability in the hydrological storage and connected impervious area on the performance of individual kerbside leaky well systems we also analysed the influence of these parameters on catchment outflows 2 1 case study catchment background and data collection an example of measures to reduce the extent of greenfield development along urban fringes is the 30 year plan for greater adelaide the capital of south australia australia which was developed by the government of south australia 2017 the plan contains a target to manage urban growth by ensuring that 70 of new development occurs within the existing urban footprint by adopting policies to encourage infill development whereby higher density living is implemented through small to large scale redevelopment of existing land parcels it is accepted however that this strategy can increase runoff peak flow and runoff volumes considering this situation we selected a 17 45 ha residential catchment in hawthorn an inner suburb of adelaide south australia australia the catchment was selected based on its proximity to the adelaide cbd 6 km to the southeast and a housing density of six allotments per hectare which represents low density detached housing and is representative of a majority of residential urban development in australia spencer et al 2015 based on current data detached housing is by far the most common type of residential property in australia 72 of total dwellings australian bureau of statistics 2017 considering policies that aim to increase the allotment density near urban centers such as the adelaide 30 year plan government of south australia 2017 it is anticipated that the housing density and the connected impervious area may increase in the case study area which was factored into the study scenarios the results can be used by catchment managers to assess the efficacy of kerbside leaky wells and ameliorate the hydrologic impact of increases in the urban density in typical residential catchment areas the catchment characteristics along with the stormwater drainage systems and kerbside leaky well locations are shown in fig 1 the catchment contains 97 houses and 11 detached residential units the catchment exhibits a gentle slope along the west direction with an average gradient of 0 5 the catchment was selected due to the availability of runoff data before and after the installation of 181 kerbside inlets and leaky well systems across the catchment these systems comprise a kerbside inlet orifice treenet r750 plates that intercepts kerbside runoff for storage in an adjacent kerbside leaky well where it infiltrates the surrounding soil the kerbside leaky well systems comprise a 250 mm perforated pipe which also functions as temporary storage runoff from the street gutter is conveyed via a 90 mm pvc pipe the intended installation depth of the kerbside leaky wells was 1 4 m however due to variations in the soil and rock surrounding the systems the actual depth of the wells ranged from 0 82 m to 1 4 m fig 2 the total storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems in the case study catchment fig 2 was 110 l on average including the infiltration zone the systems were installed in clay soil and the observed exfiltration rate reached 0 002 l sec 2 2 data collection and model selection and development rainfall runoff monitoring has been ongoing in the study catchment since january 2016 the data time series included three periods a period without wsud january 2016 to january 2017 a period during which wsud was implemented in the form of 93 kerbside leaky wells january 2017 to january 2018 and a period with all 181 kerbside leaky wells operational january 2018 to the present rainfall and runoff monitoring data were obtained at a one minute resolution because a small time step is useful to obtain an accurate estimate of the peak flow rate in this relatively small and volatile urban catchment the model used in this study was selected based on scientific reviews of hydrological models to simulate the physical processes of urban catchments the critical features considered in the selection of the model included the ability to represent 1 varying catchment scales 2 pipe hydraulics 3 flow routing 4 varying temporal resolutions and 5 both major and minor system flows 6 the ability to conduct continuous simulations and 7 the inbuild option to model infiltration systems based on these criteria we reviewed articles on modelling software reviews by zoppou 2001 elliott and trowsdale 2007 jayasooriya and ng 2014 and kaykhosravi et al 2018 based on these reviews and our criteria we shortlisted four suitable modelling tools epaswmm rossman 2015 and its commercial variant pcswmm chi canada mike urban dhi mouse 2017 and music ewater 2014 music was excluded because of its limited pipe hydraulics temporal resolution 5 minute or greater and lack of a flow routing capability mike urban does not provide a built in solution to represent infiltration systems elliott and trowsdale 2007 whereas pcswmm offers a suite of wsud systems kaykhosravi et al 2018 noted in their review that swmm is the most commonly used deterministic modelling tool for estimating the benefits of wsud systems therefore we chose the epaswmm based platformpcwsmm a commercial variant of epaswmm for hydrological modelling pcswmm satisfies all the model selection criteria is compatible with gis tools and includes an automated dual drainage creator furthermore it has been recommended for use in studies on the performance of infiltration systems fanelli et al 2017 a description of the preparation of a deterministic model of the catchment and kerbside leaky wells was previously detailed by shahzad et al 2021 briefly the model was developed in three steps first a dual drainage catchment model was prepared in pcswmm software version 7 2 considering advanced pipe hydraulics which represented the catchment prior to the installation of kerbside leaky wells this model was populated with parameters to represent the preinstallation catchment characteristics most of the parameters including the sub catchment area imperviousness and drainage system features were measured in the field or obtained from the local government authority city of mitcham in the form of a geographical information system shapefile regarding the other parameters including the width manning s n coefficient for pervious and impervious surfaces and catchment infiltration parameters automated calibration to continuous time series data was performed with the parameter estimation model pest version 15 to acquire a set of parameters yielding the best fit to the observed hydrographs second the storage capacity and emptying rate of individual kerbside leaky well systems were simulated this was conducted by collecting field data measuring the filling and emptying characteristics of three wells with water level sensors these data were analysed to develop an approach to effectively simulate the performance of kerbside leaky wells based on the orifice outlet which was demonstrated to be superior to the pcswmm infiltration options shahzad et al 2021 this increased the reliability of the results in this study as the simulated behaviour of kerbside leaky well systems was based on the observed filling and emptying characteristics of the installed kerbside leaky well systems this enabled the study to simulate prospective scenarios in a realistic way third during model preparation the impact of kerbside leaky wells was incorporated into the preinstallation model this catchment model with kerbside leaky wells was then calibrated against rainfall and flow observation data from january 2018 onwards and a nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of 0 73 was achieved for a one year continuous simulation the nse value of individual storm events extracted from the continuous flow time series ranged from 0 88 to 0 97 these nse values indicated that the prediction model was acceptable for further application model evaluation was performed and reported shahzad et al 2021 based on recommendations of the american society of civil engineers asce task committee 1993 to perform continuous simulation based evaluation of the wsud element performance we adopted a continuous simulation model of the measured rainfall january 2016 to december 2018 and developed a flow series for each simulation scenario storm events were extracted from the flow series according to the principles of partial duration series pds the storm event extraction criteria were based on selected events at least 12 h apart with a minimum flow rate threshold of 10 l s green infrastructure is typically designed to cater to frequent storm events green and jolly 2018 for this reason the assessment of the kerbside leaky well performance excluded larger more intense storm events those resulting in catchment outflows with flowrate higher than 300 l sec 6 storm events 2 3 development of the modelling scenarios the reference scenario i e the catchment with no wsud was simulated considering three years of rainfall data with the preinstallation model as reported in shahzad et al 2021 the postinstallation model shahzad et al 2021 was simulated considering three years of rainfall data this provided the outputs to ascertain the stormwater runoff and flow rate reduction benefits of the installed kerbside leaky well systems during various events we then simulated three scenarios to better understand the influences of the amount of storage and an increasing urban density on catchment runoff and the flow rate to this end we divided the storage factor into two components the total storage volume and the emptying time in addition we considered the impact of increasing the urban density by adding more house to the present catchment model another factor that can influence performance of kerbside leaky well systems is the catchment slope however previous studies e g sapdhare et al 2019 have indicated that these systems and similar infiltration systems argue et al 2013 are better suited to low gradients therefore the impact of the gradient was not investigated an overview of the adopted scenarios in this study is shown in fig 3 2 3 1 baseline scenarios these scenarios served as a benchmark against which the runoff reduction benefits were evaluated as such we initially ran the preinstallation model shahzad et al 2021 considering rainfall data for three years we also ran the present case of kerbside leaky well systems for three years to create baselines of the possible stormwater reduction benefits across the selected flow rate groups the outputs of this baseline comparison provided us with the criteria to evaluate the outputs of the three subsequent scenarios total storage volume under this scenario the catchment model was simulated with the present configuration of installed kerbside leaky well systems the storage volume was increased in regular increments while maintaining the exfiltration rate at the present level emptying time this scenario was simulated by adjusting the exfiltration rate to a maximum value of 10 h and a minimum value of two hours the total storage volume under this scenario remained at the present level connected impervious area this scenario was simulated by adopting growth rates to accomplish 10 and 30 year infill development the storage volume and exfiltration rate were maintained at the present levels the scenario provided information regarding the diminishing effectiveness of kerbside leaky well systems when these devices are installed in a catchment area with comparatively denser housing the results of these scenarios were grouped according to certain flow rate threshold groups as summarised in table 1 the categorization depended on the baseline no wsud scenario and remained constant throughout all the following analyses the improvements in the interception capacity of the individual kerbside leaky well systems and catchment outflows were then compared to the runoff interception efficiency of the kerbside leaky well systems under the present configuration considering the targeted flow rates the rate of increase in the connected impervious area due to development growth was retrieved from another study on nearby urban catchments conducted by myers et al 2014 the methods adopted for development growth determination are described in detail in section 2 5 in this study we estimated the growth rate for 10 year id10 and 30 year id30 periods as listed in table 3 2 4 total storage volume rainfall data for three years measured at the site were used to run the validated postinstallation pcswmm model representing the study catchment with the installed kerbside leaky well systems these scenarios focused on the quantification of changes in the performance of kerbside leaky wells with increasing storage volume the storage node representing the storage capacity of the existing kerbside leaky well systems with a storage volume ranging from 82 to 134 l was adjusted to simulate kerbside leaky well systems with a higher storage capacity in each case the exfiltration rate remained the same as the present level i e 0 002 l sec volume increase was simulated by assuming storage pipes as shown in fig 2 of different diameters readily available from australian manufacturers table 2 provides the geometry of the simulated well sizes based on this scenario we noted the total runoff volume peak flow rate and intercepted runoff for each storm event we then reported the percentage of the total runoff volume intercepted across each flow rate group we also reported the catchment outflows and average flow rate across the flow rate groups to ascertain the impacts of increasing the storage volume on the catchment runoff regime statistical analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that the main effects of the installed infiltration devices are insensitive to the storage volume of the individual kerbside leaky wells and that any variations in storage volume do not produce significant main effects on the catchment runoff discharge we tested this hypothesis via ordinary two way analysis of variance anova based on methods described in quinn and keough 2002 we constructed models based on flow rate group mean and standard deviation values of runoff flows corresponding to the total storage volume as presented in table 1 two way anova was followed by an appropriate post hoc test dunnett test quinn and keough 2002 to identify the true cause of the sensitivity of the runoff response to variations in the kerbside infiltration systems the analysis assisted in the identification of the required storage volume to produce significant main effects 2 4 1 impact of the emptying time the focus of this scenario was to analyse the performance of kerbside leaky well systems under varying exfiltration rates the exfiltration rate determines the storage availability before the arrival of a new storm event this parameter is a function of the native soil type filter medium properties and hydraulically efficient fissures in adjacent soil attributed to the presence of tree roots johnson et al 2016 the installed kerbside leaky well systems across the catchment exfiltrated 100 l in approximately 10 h the kerbside leaky wells contained in the model represented three configurations mainly varying in depth to establish equal emptying features of all the wells regardless of storage we varied the volumetric exfiltration rate from 0 002 to 0 004 l sec the second emptying time was selected based on a report by bartens et al 2008 they reported that tree roots can improve infiltration into native soil by 153 therefore the discharge rate at the storage node was adjusted to improve the emptying time by 150 this provided us with an emptying time of 8 h we then selected a minimum emptying time of two hours as reported for green roofs by locatelli et al 2014 between emptying times of two and four hours 2 hour increments were selected to better understand the impact of variation on the interception capacity of the kerbside leaky wells all adopted volumetric rates under the different scenarios are presented in table 3 five scenarios were carried out the emptying rate was then plotted against the runoff interception volume runoff interception was estimated by comparing the kerbside leaky well infiltration volume to the total catchment discharge 2 5 connected impervious area direct discharge of roof runoff into the street is a common practice in australia argue et al 2013 this suggests that as development occurs in a catchment additional roof areas directly discharge into the street stormwater system thus indicating an increase in the connected impervious area avila et al 2016 myers et al 2014 performed a detailed study to estimate the infill development growth rate in a southern adelaide catchment area frederick street catchment glengowrie south australia based on their analysis we adopted an annual development growth rate of 0 65 a gradual increase in dwellings in the catchment area rounded to the nearest number during a given year this growth rate translated into 1 3 homes per year in the angas road case study catchment we estimated the increased number of homes according to development scenarios of 10 and 30 years the australian bureau of statistics abs 2016 reported that the average roof area of a house in south australia reaches approximately 200 m2 considering this value we investigated the current allotment distribution in the catchment and identified those allotments that could be transformed into two houses each with a roof area of 200 m2 as previously noted the catchment contains relatively large allotments and therefore most of these allotments may be redeveloped into two or more homes table 4 summarises the present housing distribution level and the expected number of subdivisible allotments in this manner we increased the connected impervious area 2 6 description of the model updating methods to represent the model scenarios following the simulation of the no wsud scenario considering rainfall data for three years the model was updated to run the various scenarios as shown in fig 3 changes reflecting infill development were implemented in the postinstallation model to represent future catchment scenarios growth rates of 0 65 and 1 3 homes per year were applied to quantify the 10 and 30 year imperviousness characteristics respectively of the catchment table 4 lists the number of houses that should be added in the catchment to reflect 10 and 30 year growth levels fig 4 shows the locations of the modified lots to include two infill development cases the resultant catchment parameters that were modified from the present model are presented in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 reference scenario the results of the reference scenario table 5 indicated that the installed kerbside leaky well systems reduced the peak flow rate for group a events by 15 there was also a 17 reduction in runoff volume in this group in group b the intercepted runoff volume was 143 kl larger than that in group a but the reduction percentage was lower these results demonstrate that in their present configuration each kerbside leaky well system intercepts an average runoff volume of 5 kl per year 3 2 impact of the storage volume the results when varying the total storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems indicated that an increase in storage volume improved the runoff retention performance based on a three year simulation period increasing the storage pipe diameter from 250 to 375 mm retained 150 to 250 kl more runoff from the catchment than did the present systems the improvement was the most notable for storms with a peak flow up to 100 l s fig 5 shows the average flow reduction improvement achieved by increasing the storage volume of the kerbside leaky well systems a detailed breakdown of the improvements in the runoff reduction in terms of the percentage reduction is provided in table s1 of the supplementary information the storage volume increase benefits were also translated into lower discharges from the catchment the fig 6 shows that with increasing storage volume the catchment discharge decreased across all flow rate groups in the low flow rate groups there was an 83 reduction in the 10th runoff volume percentile however in the 10th percentile of group d the runoff volume was reduced by only 15 the reduction effect of increasing the storage volume was also observed in the 90th percentile in group a the 90th percentile runoff volume was reduced by 32 for group a storms and for group d storms this percentile was reduced by 27 in quantitative terms these are important reductions that can be achieved by increasing the storage volume by 150 however the results of two way anova indicated that these reduction amounts did not induce a significant main effect on catchment hydrology and there was an 18 chance of randomly observing an effect that was larger or smaller in an experiment of this size we concluded that this effect is nonsignificant however we further explored the two way anova results via a post hoc test by establishing a no wsud scenario as the control dunnett s test indicated that a significant effect on the runoff volume only occurred if the storage volume was increased by 150 installing a pipe with a diameter of 375 mm at p 0 039 the detailed results of dunnett s test with a 95 confidence interval are presented in the supplementary material table s2 storage volume increase did produce significant main effects on flow rate reduction two way anova revealed that the storage volume of the kerbside leaky wells accounted for 3 of the total variation in the average group flow rates f 30 09 5 642 p value less than 0 0001 in simple terms this suggests that if the storage volume does not affect the flow rate there is a less than 0 01 chance of randomly observing this large reduction amount in mean group flow rate fig 7 dunnett s post hoc test conducted by establishing a no wsud scenario as a control indicated that a significant difference between group means occurred when kerbside leaky wells with at least 275 mm pipes an increase of 110 were simulated we attributed this improvement in the capability of the kerbside leaky well systems to reduce the runoff flow rate to the higher interception capacity of the kerbside leaky wells to retain captured runoff which then exfiltrated into the surrounding soil at the present volumetric exfiltration rate this resulted in providing runoff flows with another pathway available through the network of kerbside leaky wells instead of flowing directly towards the catchment outlet this aspect is important as a larger runoff volume is lost from the drainage line to the native soil environment through the kerbside leaky wells which offsets the hydrographs of the different sub catchments this impact was also observed at high flowrates these results suggest that by optimally distributing the storage amount 88 to 202 l significant peak flow reductions can be achieved for a relatively small total storage amount from 23 to 35 kl as the hydrographs of the different sub catchments can be offset this storage amount requires the installation of 23 to 35 1 kl rainwater tanks rainwater tanks however exhibit uncontrolled variables in the form of the emptying time which depends on domestic usage while the adoption of smart tanks as reported by jamali et al 2020 can control this variable the relative costs of smart system installation should be considered the storage volume did not manifest significant main effects on runoff volume reduction compared to the no wsud scenario increasing the storage volume atleast by 150 over the present storage level yielded a significant effect according to dunnett s post hoc test a closer examination of the simulation results revealed that to attain significant main effects a constant decrease in runoff volume during group c and d storms is required these results are justifiable because the main effects are influenced by large events and a greater runoff portion is produced during group c and d storms notably fig 7 shows that by increasing storage from 110 to 120 the average flow rate was only reduced by 3 during group d storms second during high intensity storms the catchment discharged more runoff as this group comprises storms of a higher intensity and duration due to this factor although the kerbside leaky wells captured more runoff fig 5 the interception amounts remained smaller than the event totals this suggests that despite an increase in surface area a large portion of high flow rate storms could still bypass the kerbside inlets without capture occurring additionally we did not vary the capture area of the installed kerbside leaky well systems szota et al 2019 indicated that the capture area of kerbside systems is a significant factor that can influence their performance therefore a potential cause of the relatively nonsignificant improvement during high flow rate storms could be the constant area of the capture zone solutions to these problems could include reconfiguration of street gutters increasing the depth of the bowl depression in front of the inlet thereby reducing the flow velocity and increasing the capture potential and where possible adopting even larger volumes through large pipes or kerbside trenches however these solutions are limited due to economic viability site constraints such as underlying services and space restrictions the enhanced runoff interception of the kerbside leaky well systems was further manifested as an improvement in annual runoff retention fig 8 shows that storage volume increase resulted in approximately 300 kl of additional retention annually based on a consistent volumetric exfiltration rate 0 002 l s another notable result of storage volume increase was that complete emptying of the kerbside leaky wells expanded beyond the 10 hour timeframe of existing systems further research should be conducted on the adoption of larger wells which may enable a corresponding higher or lower exfiltration rate due to the increased exposed surface area the results of this study however indicated that kerbside leaky well systems with an increased storage volume can capture enough runoff resulting in full occupancy of a given leaky well this in combination with the wet season saturated subsurface soil conditions and low evaporation rates in winter can manifest in a longer emptying time petrucci et al 2012 therefore in the wet winter season during the likely occurrence of consecutive events kerbside leaky wells may attain varied and compromised performance levels regarding runoff management this aspect resulted in only a modest improvement during high flow events high flow storms are also accompanied by significant prebursts this suggests that at the start of a high flow storm the full capacity of a kerbside leaky well system may not be available gomes calixto et al 2020 the critical impact of prestorm storage on the performance of retention systems was also acknowledged by gomes calixto et al 2020 they reported a peak flow rate reduction of 32 with the complete storage capacity available and the same system reduced the peak flow rate by only 15 when the initial storage was only partially available 3 3 emptying time the results when reducing the emptying time of the wells effectively increasing the exfiltration rate indicate that an improvement in the runoff volume reduction of up to 13 was achieved for group a storms i e 20 for the present case to 33 if the kerbside leaky wells can empty in two hours after intercepting the runoff fig 9 at shorter emptying times the captured stormwater was discharged faster into the surrounding environment thus creating more available volume for runoff capture szota et al 2019 reducing the emptying time from 10 to 2 h still almost doubled the retained runoff volume of the wells for group d storms the statistical transformation of the runoff flow and volume data revealed the influence across all the flowrate groups fig 10 these reductions however were nonsignificant according to the results of two way anova of the main effects increasing the emptying time accounted for 0 1188 of the total variance f 0 35 dfn 5 dfd 657 and p value 0 8822 there occurred an 88 chance of randomly observing an effect this large with no emptying time change from the present case i e a 10 hour emptying time the effect was considered nonsignificant this finding supports the argument that to control the runoff volume larger storage volumes are more important than the emptying time at the catchment scale the total runoff retention level increased from 985 kl at the monitored volumetric exfiltration 0 002 l sec to 1613 76 kl at the ideal exfiltration rate 0 019 l sec fig 12 the study findings align with the proposed theory of argue et al 2012 that kerbside leaky wells are better placed to function as source control devices in high drainage soils this analysis also indicated that the presence and activity of tree roots which could result in a 153 improvement in the hydraulic efficiency of the surrounding soil bartens et al 2008 yielded an exfiltration rate of up to 0 005 l s resulting in a 14 greater annual retention over the present case fig 12 previous research johnson et al 2016 on the impacts of tree roots as conduits for both uptake and preferential flow pathways has indicated that the hydraulic redistribution phenomenon can occur immediately upon the installation of kerbside leaky well systems this suggests that the present systems can potentially be expected to retain 14 more runoff annually than expected due to the presence of tree roots we were not in possession of field data for tree root uptakes and moments for the catchment trees and therefore only relied on the values reported in published literature to conduct our analysis however more focused research on the impact of tree roots on the exfiltration capacity of the surrounding soil should be performed to better understand the performance of kerbside leaky well systems while this study has analysed the impact of emptying time we could not analyse the influence of clogging clogging is a time dependent variable which may reduce the storage capacity of leaky wells over time this factor could further highlight the critical nature of limited storage capacity of installed leaky wells in terms of the flow rate fig 11 the two way anova showed significant results regarding the main effects of the emptying time which accounted for 0 2711 of the total variance f 2 90 dfn 5 dfd 657 p value 0 0135 without the influence of the emptying time there is a 1 3 chance of randomly observing this decrease in the runoff flow rate therefore this effect is considered small but significant 3 4 connected impervious area 3 4 1 runoff generation the assumed levels of catchment development and thus the increased impervious area generated more runoff per hectare across all flow rate groups table 6 there were linear trends of increasing runoff volumes and flow rates for all flow rate groups with increasing imperviousness table s4 of the supplementary data provides a detailed breakdown of the percentage increase across all flowrate groups in the no wsud catchment the low flow rate groups attained a proportionally larger increase in runoff per hectare than did the high flow rate groups group a exhibited increases of 31 and 57 in the runoff volume per hectare under both development scenarios group b attained increases of 33 and 65 under the 10 and 30 year development scenarios respectively this effect is attributed to the increase in the connected impervious area and the reduction in the influence of pervious areas on runoff flow delay due to natural storage gomes calixto et al 2020 in the case of high flow rate storms the increase in the contributing area may also have resulted in a greater contribution of runoff originating from pervious areas gomes calixto et al 2020 however verification of the contribution of pervious areas to runoff generation is beyond the scope of this paper another reason is that street gutters only convey the designed runoff during high flow rate events extra runoff due to an increase in discharge may follow other available flow paths such as low depression areas fry and maxwell 2017 roldin et al 2012 this results in an increase in the runoff bypass volume across the kerbside leaky well inlets in the high flow rate group the increases in runoff per hectare suggest that the storage capacity of the present kerbside leaky well systems is insufficient to compensate for the loss of natural storage sites within the catchment also the increases in the peak flow rate and total runoff volume with increasing development highlights the need to consider this aspect in planning kemp and myers 2015 regarding the implementation of wsud systems the results table 6 indicated that the kerbside leaky well systems can maintain the runoff per hectare below the no wsud case level in groups a and b under the 10 year development scenario only however in the high flow rate groups the present capacity of the kerbside leaky well systems did not offset the effects of the increased runoff volume or peak flow this suggests that by installing systems under the case study layout additional stormwater management measures are required to maintain current stormwater service levels with increasing development when development was projected 30 years forward the catchment generated more runoff than did the present catchment across all flow rate groups the increased runoff flow rate and volume indicated that en route to the catchment outlet stormwater runoff was not intercepted at the same hydrologic efficiency as it was in the present state of the catchment this occurs because the runoff increase resulted in an increased demand for storage but with a limited storage availability the generated runoff instead followed the stormwater drainage path without interception by the network of kerbside infiltration systems however bypass flow should also be considered for its impact on the hydraulic efficency of inlets as demonstrated by sapdhare et al 2019 nevertheless adopting a larger storage volume can help to partially offset the decrease in efficiency of kerbside leaky well systems as demonstrated in section 3 2 the results summarised in table s1 of supplementary information indicate that with a 300 mm diameter storage volume the kerbside leaky wells could potentially retain 12 more runoff than could the installed kerbside leaky well systems in the present catchment this suggests that by installing kerbside leaky wells with 300 mm pipes the increase in groups a and b under the 10 year growth scenario could be negated noting that these larger wells may still not reduce runoff during group c and d storms in the case of development however the major reason for adopting infiltration devices is to manage runoff during small to medium storms moore et al 2016 therefore to ensure the success of kerbside leaky well systems it is necessary to achieve a good performance in runoff management during group a and b storms 3 4 2 impact of development on the performance of the kerbside leaky well systems the simulated runoff and flow rate at the catchment outfall are shown in fig 13 for all flow rate groups the runoff flow rate and volume both increased across all flow rate groups we first examine the notable flow rate analysis results a pronounced increase in runoff flow rate was observed in group c the average flow rate in this group increased by approximately 40 l s or 37 fig 14 a similar pattern was also observed for the runoff volume groups c and d exhibited an approximately 50 increase in the runoff volume fig 13 we again reiterate that it is possible that during these strong storm events there may also be contributions of pervious areas gomes calixto et al 2020 also noted this aspect in their study regarding the discharge of runoff from pervious areas during storms of a higher intensity and duration the results table 6 also revealed that the runoff increase was more significant than that in the flow rate over the present catchment this occurs because the kerbside leaky well systems did not exert a significant impact on runoff flow rate reduction in the catchment the kerbside leaky well systems exhibited a small footprint and area relative to the contributing area while studies have demonstrated that increasing the connected area improved the performance of distributed storage to store more runoff avellaneda and jefferson 2020 the imperviousness to storage ratio is critical to achieve this outcome the changes in imperviousness of the connected area resulted in a higher discharge with increasing flowrate ensuing quick filling of small storage volumes bypass runoff volume increase and recovery time delay however it should be noted that although enhancing the imperviousness resulted in a greater increase in the runoff volume and flow rate during high flow rate storms fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the increase in the low flow rate groups was more critical this occurs because distributed systems provide considerable runoff reduction benefits during small to medium events only jamali et al 2020 additionally the results of the current study suggested that the kerbside leaky well systems yielded a considerable decrease in runoff patterns during low intensity storms the decline in the performance of the kerbside leaky well systems during these storms due to the increase in connected impervious area indicated that the overall effectiveness of these kerbside leaky well systems was diminished to provide runoff reduction benefits in the catchment it thus becomes important to consider this aspect in planning the installation of kerbside leaky well systems 4 conclusion this study presented an analysis of the application of distributed kerbside stormwater infiltration systems for runoff management at the catchment scale the highlight of this study is the adoption of a calibrated hydrological model considering stormwater infiltration this study demonstrated that with increasing storage volume distributed devices could provide a significant reduction in the runoff volume and flow rate at the catchment scale which was verified through statistical analysis the findings suggested that kerbside infiltration systems are the most effective in managing small to medium storms 12 to 4 exceedance per year ey storms however supplementing these devices with larger storage volumes and or improved emptying rates could enhance their performance levels during high flow storms of the two factors investigated in this study only the storage volume can be reasonably controlled by the designers of these systems because the emptying time of native soil cannot be reasonably changed in a developed catchment based on the results of this study however the performance of these systems can be improved by adopting larger storage volumes for the scenarios presented increasing the storage volume led to an almost linear relationship with the runoff volume reduction and had the most impact on performance in terms of the percentage the impact of the emptying time was significant only when the storage volumes were full and constant exfiltration from leaky wells was the main operating variable the results of this study suggest that based on their capacity the present kerbside leaky well systems will not be able to maintain current service levels as the catchment density approaches the levels estimated for 2030 although the quantity of the intercepted runoff may increase the runoff retention percentage may decrease either an increase in storage volume or the provision of an increased emptying rate no longer than six hours is required the results of this research could ensure that decisions regarding catchment development are made with an appropriate level of information the study recommends that life cycle cost analysis of different retention systems should be carried out under climate change scenarios to better understand the feasibility of kerbside leaky well systems in addition a study comparing distributed and centralized storage operations should be performed to determine the comparative success of each storage option credit authorship contribution statement hussain shahzad conceptualization methodology
