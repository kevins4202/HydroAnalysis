10775,agriculture in the semiarid region is undergoing radical changes driven by global warming and increasing incidences of extreme weather events predicting and evaluating the responses of crop yield and water use patterns of rainfed cropping systems according to future temperature and precipitation changes could provide important information regarding adoption of climate smart farming systems that could offer great resilience and sustainability the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential changes in agronomic productivity hydrological balance and economic profitability of cropping systems with perennial legumes and rotation on the loess plateau of china affected by different future temperature and precipitation scenarios using apsim based modeling five different cropping systems were investigated i continuous maize zea mays m ii continuous winter wheat triticum aestivum w iii continuous lucerne medicago sativa l iv maize wheat soybean gyleine max rotation mws and v lucerne 4 yr winter wheat 2 yr rotation lw in xifeng gansu china five series of temperature and precipitation changes scenarios no changes in atmospheric co2 concentrations were considered based on rcps representative concentration pathways were integrated into scenario simulations including the baseline scenario 1980 2010 mid century scenarios of rcp4 5 m45 and rcp8 5 m85 and end century scenarios of rcp4 5 e45 and rcp8 5 e85 the results showed that compared with baseline simulations mean maize yield under rcps decreased by 6 7 37 7 and the mean wheat yield decreased by 1 7 23 6 lucerne yield consistently increased by 7 2 12 3 under m45 and e45 although different cropping systems affected the yield to a certain extent only the difference between the wheat yields of w and mws was significant p 0 05 on a cropping system level of every 6 yr totally five phases for a scenario of 30 yr the temperature and precipitation changes did not significantly affect plant transpiration tc per phase for all systems except l which received its highest soil evaporation es per phase in baseline the greatest es per phase was found in the e85 l tended to provide greater tc per phase and evapotranspiration et per phase ranging from 1219 to 1332 mm and 2910 3034 mm respectively followed by lw l and mws presented the highest and lowest es per phase 1636 1724 and 1592 1677 mm respectively the gross profit gp per 6 yr phase and water productivity wp per 6 yr phase of l were the greatest among all cropping systems 11 5 13 7 thousand us ha 1 per phase and 3 72 4 41 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively followed by lw and mws for m w and mws the gp per phase and the wp per phase were predicted to be greater under the baseline than under any of the rcps whereas m45 and e45 scenarios improved the gp per phase and wp per phase of l and lw compared with those of the baseline in general we advocate that lw based systems have the greatest potential for producing acceptable yield and economic profit under future temperature and precipitation scenarios for this local environment keywords loess plateau cropping system climate change scenarios crop yield evapotranspiration economic profit 1 introduction in recent years the increasing evidence of global climate change ipcc 2014 has highlighted the need to adopt cropping systems that are less consumptive of resources and are more resilient towards damage caused by extreme weather incidences piao et al 2010 several result synthesis and meta analysis studies have been conducted to focus on the effects of climate change on wheat triticum aestivum and maize zea mays production in the semiarid loess plateau of china in particular zhang and liu 2005 and he et al 2014 predicted that without significant improvement in cultivar development the grain yield of wheat and maize could be reduced by up to 17 31 under projected climate change under the background of climate change the production of maize and winter wheat still dominates the cropland in the rainfed loess plateau region in china mo et al 2016 both crops play important roles in securing grain supply for human consumption and animal feed and have greatly contributed to the national economy china s grain production has been largely dependent on monoculture based systems which significantly increased grain yield and even resulted in intermittent over supply during past decades wang et al 2010 these input demanding monoculture systems required high inputs of chemicals and created enormous pressure on the overall resilience and sustainability of agroecosystems in the semiarid region of china where agricultural and natural resources are typically scant the input quantities of chemical fertilizers pesticides and fossil energy have increased by 45 41 and 55 respectively from 2000 to 2015 nbs 2017 therefore farmers and researchers should focus more on developing alternative sustainable cropping systems that are less consumptive of natural resources yet capable of producing a sufficient amount of high quality grains to meet national and even global demand zhu et al 2017 this is particularly challenging for semiarid dryland based agriculture where the overall agronomic productivity might be limited by the available water under climate change conditions to ameliorate the negative consequences of intensive monoculture based grain production systems under climate change the inclusion of legumes has been proposed ojiem et al 2014 in light of this issue legumes such as lucerne medicago sativa and soybean gyleine max are typically grown in the fallow period of continuous cereal production forming a rotational system that can complete the production gap utilize additional available soil moisture and provide reasonable water use pattern and various crop products on a system basis extensive research works related to legume cereal rotations conducted globally have indicated great agroecological and economic benefits including reduced chemical fertilizer input fumagalli et al 2014 and water usage jat et al 2013 as well as increased land productivity singh et al 1999 liu et al 2016 particularly in the semiarid loess plateau jia et al 2009 argued that mixed cropping systems such as the intercropping of different cereal crops or legume cereal rotations might provide better land productivity without additional water inputs in another study wang et al 2012 noted that to conserve soil moisture continuous production of lucerne should be limited to 10 yr and other shallow root crops should be cultivated after lucerne in addition the changes in land uses from the monocultures of cereals such as continuous maize and winter wheat to legume cereal rotations may play a significant role in adapting to climate change by enhancing and stabilizing land productivity and resourse use traore et al 2017 ma et al 2018 in the semiarid loess plateau however information on yield change water use and economic returns of legume cereal rotations vs conventional monoculture systems under the realm of climate change remains extremely limited and is urgently needed systematic investigations are necessary to assess the agronomic and economic impacts as well as the ecological functions of different legume cereal and monoculture production systems in the loess plateau of china the overall goal of this study was to evaluate alternative legume cereal rotational cropping systems for their agronomic economic and environmental sustainability under rainfed conditions based on established process based models that have been calibrated using published field based data from local environments unlike either conventional modeling studies or meta analysis syntheses our overall data analysis pathway involves intensive use of previously published site specific data largely from our own research group when specifying the values of different model parameters our modeling effort includes system analysis based on scenarios of projected future temperature and precipitation conditions the future projected changes in atmospheric co2 concentrations were not considered to evaluate potential changes in i agronomic productivity such as grain yield and forage yield ii hydrological balance indicated as the evapotranspiration variation and distribution and iii gross profit and water productivity influenced by the long term effects of different cropping systems continuous and rotational legume cereal cropping systems in the loess plateau of china 2 methods and materials 2 1 temperature and precipitation scenarios climate change scenarios are often used in modeling studies to evaluate the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change he et al 2015 traore et al 2017 the representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 are a series of trajectories of greenhouse gas ghg and air pollutant emission energy and land use technological development and socio economic change reported by ipcc based on different 21st century pathways ipcc 2014 we generated the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projections in february 2016 from three general circulation models gcms of the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 bcc csm1 1 bcc beijing climate center ccsm4 ccsm community climate system model and cnrm cm5 cnrm centre national de recherches meteorologiques zhao et al 2014 reported that the root mean square error between observed and projected data of these three models was only 2 0 2 5 while the spatial correlation was higher than 0 6 the simulation periods of rcps were limited to the mid century 2040 2070 and the end century 2070 2100 the abbreviations of the rcps were defined in table 1 m45 and m85 were the mid century scenarios of rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively while e45 and e85 were the end century scenarios of rcp4 5 and 8 5 respectively the rcps were generated using the protocols specified by acsgtr agmip climate scenario generation tools with r www agmip org acsgtr cannot forecast ghg co2 n2o ch4 etc so different co2 levels were not considered in the projected scenarios we primarily utilized both future temperature and precipitation scenarios as well as baseline 1980 2010 weather data to evaluate cropping system performance in the current study fig 1 2 2 model introduction the agricultural production system simulator apsim ver 7 4 holzworth et al 2014 was used for scenario analysis in the current study apsim is a well recognized mechanistic model for simulating biological and physical processes as a process based model apsim has been widely used for simulating crop production risk management and crop adaptation in various cropping systems studies singh et al 2011 archontoulis et al 2014 amarasingha et al 2017 khaliq et al 2019 the soilwat2 module in apsim was used to model water infiltration and movement in the soil and the crop modules apsim maize apsim wheat apsim soybean and apsim lucerne were used to simulate crop development and production keating et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 www apsim info 2 3 field data based model calibration the parameter calibrations for the apsim maize zhongdan2 apsim wheat xifeng24 and apsim soybean fengshou12 modules were carried out based on published field data grain yield and dry matter biomass obtained from studies that were directly published by our research group on the loess plateau of china including a maize wheat soybean rotation study conducted during 2001 2007 experiment 1 luo et al 2005 yang et al 2010 2018 table 2 the calibration of apsim lucerne longdong was carried out based on the dry matter biomass data from two experiments that were conducted during 1985 1987 experiment 2 and 1997 2003 experiment 3 liu 1992 chen et al 2008 shen et al 2009 table 2 the calibration and evaluation of soil water dynamics in our apsim simulation were accomplished based on the observations in the above field trails described in chen et al 2008 and yang et al 2018 the results suggested that apsim was suitable for estimating the crop growth and soil water dynamics by root mean square error rmse index of agreement d and determination coefficient r2 in our former studies chen et al 2008 yang et al 2018 table s1 the main soil modeling parameters that were used in apsim such as the soil bulk density bd drained upper limit dul and low limit ll were determined by shen 2004 using the methods described by dalgliesh and foale 1998 table 3 all data used for model calibration were selected from the field trials that were conducted at the qingyang loess plateau research station of lanzhou university 35 39 n 107 51 e elevation 1298 m at shishe qingyang city in gansu province of china fig 2 the average long term 1961 2010 annual precipitation was 546 mm with an average of 255 frost free days per year the mean annual temperature ranged from 8 c to 10 c and the mean annual total sunshine hours ranged from 2300 to 2700 h the soil of the study site was los orthic entisols according to the fao classification system fao 1990 the groundwater depth was below 50 m agriculture in this area is mainly rainfed with summer dominant precipitation and is a cold semiarid climate bsk in the köppen climate classification the weather data 1980 2010 including daily maximal and minimal air temperature daily precipitation and daily solar radiation was obtained from the meteorologic bureau of xifeng the distance between the meteorological station and the experimental site is 19 6 km the common cropping systems in this region were continuous cereals monocultures or rotations usually maize wheat 2 yr rotation over the past several decades while legume incorporated systems such as maize wheat soybean 2 yr rotation have gained greater popularity and have been reported in previous studies jia et al 2009 shen et al 2009 2 4 apsim based simulation 2 4 1 simulation setting two rotational systems and three continuous monoculture systems were included for the scenario simulations using apsim the two rotations were i the maize wheat soybean rotation mws each cycle completed in two years and ii the lucerne wheat rotation lw lucerne production for four years followed by two seasons of winter wheat the three continuous systems included i continuous maize m ii continuous winter wheat w and iii continuous lucerne l details of the cropping systems sowing harvest dates and crop management are described in table 4 the cultivars used for each system were commercial standard cultivars which were specified in apsim including zhongdan2 maize xifeng24 winter wheat fengshou12 soybean and longdong lucerne tillage practices consisted of 20 cm deep ploughing prior to the sowing of maize winter wheat and soybean after harvest remaining cereal residues were removed from the field according to the predominant managerial practices adopted by local farmers who usually use those residues as fuel sources for winter heating purposes in the current study scenario analysis was conducted for all five cropping systems were using the baseline data 1980 2010 and projected temperature and precipitation scenarios totally a baseline scenario 2 rcps 2 time periods and 3 gcms generated scenarios with apsim since the projected scenarios in this study did not include co2 concentration predictions the module of co2 control was not incorporated in our apsim simulations initial soil conditions were assumed similar to remove any bias based on previous soil conditions for the simulated 30 yr production under each scenario the production of m and mws that was initiated in 1981 was based on recorded weather data and environmental conditions which serves as the baseline scenario the production simulations of m and mws was carried out starting from 2041 based on m45 and m85 or 2071 based on e45 and e85 as specified by the mid century scenarios or end century scenarios the simulations of other cropping systems w l and lw that were initiated in 1980 2040 and 2070 were based on the baseline scenario mid century scenarios m45 and m85 and end century scenarios e45 and e85 respectively the mean annual precipitation at the study site was 525 mm in 1980 2010 with high inter annual variability ranging from 312 to 794 mm fig 3 a while the mean annual maximal and minimal air temperature were 14 3 and 4 6 c respectively fig 3b july august and september were characterized as wetter than other months and accounted for approximately 70 of the total annual precipitation fig 3c the warmest and coldest months were july and january respectively fig 3d compared with the baseline data the projected temperature of rcps increased the daily maximal and minimum temperatures by 1 35 4 04 and 1 17 4 22 c yr 1 respectively the increases of temperature in m85 and e85 were greater than in m45 and e45 fig 4 six scenarios indicated reductions in precipitation compared with the baseline data e g 56 mm yr 1 of reduction as indicated by cnrm of m85 while five scenarios indicated increases e g the bcc of m45 showed a 19 mm yr 1 increase compared with baseline the solar radiation amounts under the projected rcps did not show noticeable changes with values decreasing by approximately 0 1 when compared with the baseline values as the first crops of each rotation wheat in w lucerne in l and lw and maize in m and mws had a specific sowing time window table 4 and a requirement for accumulated precipitation 10 mm for sowing smith et al 2016 the whole 30 year simulation period was divided to five phases for each system table 4 the subsequent crops in mws and lw would be sown after the previous crop harvest regardless of the moisture conditions the initial soil water storage of each simulation was set at 100 of plant available water for each soil layer table 3 the initial no3 n and soc contents were set according to observed values in previous studies conducted at this research site yang et al 2010 table 3 we modified each simulation as no post harvest organic matter crop stubble remaining on the soil surface while the subsequent residuals of crops were all removed from the fields all simulation results were obtained based on rainfed conditions with no irrigation inputs 2 4 2 results generation and synthesis the effects of treatments were investigated based on the outputs of apsim simulations grain yield maize and winter wheat and forage yield lucerne and soybean determined by biomass values in the simulations were simulated and recorded to provide a basis for comparing biomass production yield across different cropping systems and climate scenarios we investigated crop water use by comparing soil evaporation es per phase plant transpiration tc per phase and evapotranspiration et per phase during every 6 yr mm per phase the economic gross profit gp per phase thousand us ha 1 per phase was calculated using the following equation 1 g p y p c f c s c t where yp represents the value of the crop yield grain and forage cf and cs represent the cost of fertilizer and seeding respectively and ct represents other machinery costs tillage and harvesting a fixed value unit price was applied in this study production cost 2016 which includes seeds pesticides herbicides fertilizers fossil fuels equipment maintenance and depreciation and labour costs associated with common farming operations were estimated based on the guidelines provided by the regional farmers cooperative and extension service agencies near the study site market prices for grain and forage hay 2016 were obtained from china s national agricultural market service database http datacenter cngrain com and are presented in table 5 for consistency purposes all input unit costs in table 5 were estimated based on the fixed market value of 2016 without interannual variation and inflation for the purposes of quantifying efficiency of water utilization from an economic perspective the water productivity wp per phase us ha 1 mm 1 per phase for each cropping system was calculated as 2 w p g p w s 3 w s p s w i s w t we calculated wp per phase by crop production phase when analysing rotational systems to standardize the comparisons made between scenarios and cropping systems thus in eq 2 the gp values were the gp per phase either within a rotational or continuous cropping system at the same time in this paper ws represents the water supply mm which includes the et and water loss surface runoff and deep drainage under 200 cm within each phase in eq 3 p represents the amount of precipitation during each phase and swi and swt represent the initial and ending soil water storage mm respectively in the 0 200 cm soil layer 2 5 data analysis data analyses were performed by genstat edition 18 vsn international hemel hempstead united kingdom statistics software if not described specifically the data for each series scenario represents the mean predicted values of the simulations of three gcms bcc ccsm and cnrm the crop yield tc per phase es per phase et per phase and gp per phase and wp per phase of the scenario simulations were compared among the cropping systems and rcps the analysis of variances based mean separation was performed using the duncan multi range test at p 0 05 differences in crop yield among cropping systems were tested using fisher s protected least significant difference test due to the fact that maize and lucerne were only planted in two cropping systems annual crop yields were considered repeated measures in the variation analyses different phases which included the means of the results from three gcms bcc ccsm and cnrm were considered a fixed effect and treated as replications in the variation analyses 3 results 3 1 crop yield compared with the baseline prediction mean maize yield of m and mws was decreased by 6 7 m45 to 28 2 e85 and 12 2 m45 to 37 7 e85 under the rcps fig 5 the mean winter wheat yield was decreased by 5 4 m45 to 23 6 e85 and 1 7 e45 to 8 8 m85 for w and lw respectively however for the mws system m45 and e45 improved wheat yield by 1 5 and 3 5 respectively compared with the baseline values p 0 05 m85 and e85 reduced the wheat yield by 1 8 and 0 9 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the rcps also predicted a 1 1 m45 to 25 4 e85 lower soybean yield compared with the baseline data p 0 05 fig 5 different from the other crops lucerne yield under m45 and e45 consistently improved by 11 7 12 3 and 7 2 8 7 for l and lw respectively p 0 05 for l monocultures e85 reduced lucerne yield by 6 2 but m85 increased it by 5 5 for lw rotational cropping both m85 and e85 reduced lucerne yield by 13 9 and 0 4 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 different gcms did not significantly influence crop yields data not shown the mean grain yield of the m system was 5575 kg ha 1 and it was improved by 17 0 34 7 under mws on average 23 8 p 0 088 fig 6 for winter wheat w showed the highest yield 4347 kg ha 1 among the three systems w mws and lw while mws and lw reduced the mean yield by 17 1 36 1 p 0 05 and 8 1 23 0 p 0 05 compared with w respectively fig 6 for lucerne the mean yield was relatively similar between l and lw within deviations ranging from 2 1 11 1 on average 8 9 p 0 05 fig 6 3 2 evapotranspiration the majority of simulations produced insignificantly different tc values among the climate scenarios including the baseline data however numerically speaking the baseline climatic conditions presented the greatest tc per phase 1061 1259 mm for m w and mws followed by e45 1044 1228 mm and m45 1038 1217 mm table 6 likewise l tended to provide greatest tc per phase ranged from 1219 to 1332 mm followed by lw and mws 1138 1272 and 1131 1259 mm respectively table 6 w provided the lowest tc per phase 984 1061 mm which were significantly lower than those of l mws and lw p 0 05 table 6 based on table 6 the first greatest es per phase of 6 yr was found in e85 except for the l system which received its highest es in baseline on a cropping system level the l system showed the highest es per phase 1636 1724 mm among cropping systems followed by lw and w 1624 1703 and 1662 1739 mm respectively while mws provided the lowest values 1592 1677 mm table 6 additionally the values of et per phase were similar among scenarios p 0 05 on a cropping system basis the first highest the second highest and the lowest et per phase were found in l 2910 3034 mm lw 2838 2951 mm and w 2700 2723 mm table 6 respectively the m45 scenario of ccsm and the m85 scenario of cnrm showed 33 5 60 4 mm yr 1 lower annual precipitation compared with other gcms which caused relatively high differences in tc among three gcms for tc per phase these two scenarios were 2 6 10 and 3 6 7 6 lower than the mean p 0 05 respectively for es per phase the maximal difference between gcms for a same rcp was only 4 7 3 3 economic profit and water productivity the gp per phase of l was the greatest among all cropping systems 11 5 13 7 thousand us ha 1 followed by lw and mws 10 0 12 2 and 7 5 10 4 thousand us ha 1 respectively table 7 l also provided the greatest wp per phase among the systems on average 3 72 4 41 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase followed by lw and mws 3 29 3 98 and 2 50 3 39 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively table 8 the gp per phase and wp per phase of m and w were relatively low providing gp value of 6 3 9 1 and 7 2 10 0 thousand us ha 1 and wp value of 2 09 2 95 and 2 44 3 27 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively tables 7 and 8 the gp per phase and wp per phase were generally similar to that of crop yield tables 7 and 8 the baseline predicted a greater gp per phase and wp per phase compared with the rcps for m w and mws while the m45 scenario provided the second greatest values l and lw indicated the highest gp per phase and mean wp per phase under m45 improved 6 1 13 7 compared with baseline data followed by e45 improved 5 2 13 1 compared with baseline data moreover m w and mws presented significant reductions on gp per phase and wp per phase under e85 compared with baseline data p 0 05 tables 7 and 8 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield there were no consistent changes in predicted precipitation for the scenarios fig 4 while the main predicted climate impacts among rcps caused by the magnitude differences in temperature increase were rather apparent in the current study shorter growing seasons for maize and winter wheat could be observed as a consequence of more rapid accumulation of heat units and early maturity when temperature rises watson et al 1997 he et al 2015 in this study rcps produced lower maize and wheat yield than those of the baseline scenario especially in the gcms which were predicted lower annual precipitation than baseline data innes et al 2015 agreed with this finding based on long term statistically modeling results another modeling study pointed out that the main cause of yield reduction was the reduction of the vegetative growth period which led to a limited production of photosynthates used for grain filling processes traore et al 2017 our results agreed well with these previous findings for example the end century scenarios were warmer than mid century scenarios and rcp8 5 showed higher temperatures rising compared with those of the rcp4 5 scenarios which resulted in more drastic yield reductions for maize and wheat for soybean crop however its short growing seasons were less impacted by temperature and precipitation changes singh et al 1999 resulting in insignificant yield losses across all of the rcps for lucerne production the yields of both l and lw were markedly improved under the mid century scenarios m45 and e45 in agreement with raza et al 2013 who hypothesized that moderately increasing temperature within a certain range could enhance yield by lengthening the growing season mws and lw indicated generally lower winter wheat yields than that of w in each scenario we speculated that this was due to lower soil moisture content at wheat sowing in mws and lw as well as the low water supply during winter and spring fig 3c maize yield under mws was greater than that under m which agreed with common findings in agronomic production as well as many former experimental or modeling results appearing to be a case of different water consumption by previous crops yang et al 2015a smith et al 2016 moreover the lucerne crop gained 2 1 11 1 of yield increases in lw compared with that of l which agreed with the finding by doole and pannell 2008 the production increase of lucerne was largely a consequence of the additional nitrogen inputs added by wheat in general we conclude that the system outputs of the rotational systems were generally greater than continuous cropping as a whole under highly variable climate conditions despite the yield reduction observed in the individual crop production phase smith et al 2016 sieling and christe 2015 however as we have not considered the co2 concentration change and fertilisation effect the predicted future crop yields might be underestimated in the scenario simulations policy et al 1993 4 2 evapotranspiration overall water use evaluated as tc of cereal crops should be greatly reduced under rising temperature conditions as indicated under the majority of the scenario simulations for the legume based systems such as l this effect might not be as pronounced as that of cereals because lucerne typically has a very deep root system that could enhance water uptake from deep soil profiles under limited surface water input our results agreed well with a previous modeling study that m45 and e45 insignificantly improved tc p 0 05 with higher trend on water uptake of lucerne brown et al 2012 similar to the results reported by gaydon et al 2017 our results indicated that apsim modeling could successfully capture the effects of variable tc reduction caused by precipitation change which also affects et and ws and increased temperature under different gcms for example the m45 scenario of ccsm and the m85 scenario of cnrm showed marked reductions in tc per phase compared with the other gcms under corresponding pathways the differences in precipitation seemed to be insufficient for drastically affecting es or et as both values were relatively similar among scenarios moderate amounts of es reduction were still observed for l and lw under m45 e45 and m85 compared with the baseline scenario particularly the differences of l were significant at the level of p 0 05 this finding could be explained from the longer growing season of lucerne which tended to provide more pronounced responses towards the changes in environmental factors such as precipitation raza et al 2013 at the cropping system level we found that mws and lw presented consistently greater tc per phase and lower es per phase compared with those of m and w due to longer total production period and greater ground vegetation cover the longer growing season and the deeper tap root systems of lucerne pietsch et al 2007 brown et al 2012 produced high accumulative tc within both monocultures and rotations the l system also presented slightly higher es per phase than other cropping systems the reason might be the higher soil holding capacity caused by high organic matter which derived from the long lucerne planting time providing more water for evaporation in the shallow soil layers evaporation mainly consumed the stored soil water at the depth range of 0 60 cm liu et al 2015 m typically had greater tc per phase and lower es per phase than w because maize s growing seasons were generally the main rainy season of the study site from july to september it is also noteworthy that maize and lucerne both indicated poorer soil water recharge than wheat the studies based on field experiments jia et al 2009 and boundary function analysis zhang et al 2014 suggested that the continuous perennation of lucerne could lead to severe moisture depletion at the deep soil layer additionally the maize yield largely depends on plant available water at the early stages when precipitation is typically scarce in the loess plateau therefore the contiguous production of both lucerne and maize monocultures would require large amounts of water to ensure productivity raza et al 2013 yang et al 2015b and are unsuitable for long term implementation in semiarid regions in contrast the relatively lower tc per phase and et per phase of w indicated that winter wheat could be integrated into maize and or lucerne based crop rotations due to its limited water consumption shen et al 2009 gaiser et al 2012 from this perspective mws and lw systems are more adaptable towards temperature and precipitation changes as indicated by their overall significantly lower es per phase but slightly greater tc than those of the monoculture systems 4 3 gross profit gp and water productivity wp without question the economic profit of adopting different cropping systems in the semiarid region can be greatly affected by many production input factors such as variety selection market prices of crops and the amount of fertilization liu et al 2016 however our research findings indicated that the future temperature and precipitation change could have tremendous impacts on the gp per phase and wp per phase generally the gp and wp responses towards the rcps largely mirrored the yield response pattern particularly for the mws system we found relatively greater decreases in the gp per phase and wp per phase under rcps this could be partially attributed to the poor performance of maize and wheat phases caused by environmental variability and limited water availability gresta et al 2016 he et al 2014 in previous studies rotational systems were generally considered to be more profitable due to the longer production period as reported in both experimental and modeling studies doole and pannell 2008 smith et al 2016 this generally agreed with our findings which indicated greater gp per phase and wp per phase of lw or mws compared with m or w respectively however our results also indicated that the continuous system l provided the highest gp per phase and wp per phase which was mainly caused by the high price of lucerne hay ojiem et al 2014 we conclude that under fixed crop prices and production costs legume cereal rotations or legume monocultures could provide satisfactory economic income for local farmers more effort related to extension education should be conducted to influence farmers preferences and enhance knowledge transfer in the rural region of the loess plateau of china tang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 4 4 uncertainty and its implications our results showed large uncertainty variation in crop yield predictions across different future temperature and precipitation change scenarios this uncertainty primarily stems from the differences in the way gcms respond to changes in radiative forcing levels teng et al 2012 for example the e85 scenario of cnrm improved 6 5 of the wp per phase of l whereas this metric was lower than the baseline scenario for the other two gcms this might be due to the impacts of higher precipitation of cnrm than bcc and ccsm from july to september the period that chen et al 2008 indicated that lucerne field maintained dry soil down to 3 m and there seemed to be no deep drainage occurring even after significant precipitation events the higher precipitation in this period would mitigate water stress under cnrm the rcp trajectories adopted by ipcc are clustered and labelled according to the possible ranges of radiative forcing values that are determined by atmospheric ghg emissions the ideal simulated results should also indicate good agreement between elevated ghg concentrations and crop production responses however the projected scenarios in this study were generated by acsgtr without forecasting co2 concentration resulting in uncertainty to the effects of co2 fertilization subsequent research should focus on the observed advantageous responses that are associated with lucerne and winter wheat both are c3 crops compared to maize c4 under different rcps because c assimilation efficiency of c3 crops could be enhanced under increased co2 concentration policy et al 1993 for the economic analysis a fixed value unit price approach was chosen to limit the impacts of inflation on the market value evaluation in the current study table 5 however cost price structures could change significantly in the future in further studies price change projections could be integrated into the economic analysis 5 conclusions through the use of long term simulation the projected future temperature and precipitation scenarios resulted in significant reductions in yield for both maize and winter wheat under both continuous and rotational systems compared with the baseline data lucerne yield was improved under the rcp4 5 scenarios which indicated high productivity levels given the rising temperature conditions in the future the m and l cropping systems had greater tc per phase and et per phase than w implying that continuous maize and lucerne are unsuitable for the projected future temperature and precipitation change scenarios wheat indicated greater potential to conserve soil water in rotations both mws and lw tended to utilize soil moisture to a greater extent which resulted in greater soil moisture depletion and lower es per phase based on fixed crop prices and production costs 2016 l produced the highest gp per phase and wp per phase among all systems and lw also presented relatively higher values with lower variation therefore we conclude that lw based systems have the greatest potential for providing acceptable yield and economic profit under limited water availability and good agronomic productivity as well as maintaining resilient ecological functionality and sustainability under the projected future temperature and precipitation changes in the local environment future studies should focus on refining and improving the model s robustness and accuracy under different environmental conditions and management practices with combination of multi crop and climate modeling with projected future changes in atmospheric co2 practical experimentation coupled with demonstration and extension education is critical to identify and promote the adoption of suitable cropping systems more effort should be implemented into investigating other legume cereal rotations and intercropping practices within different regions of china and establishing these systems locally as part

10775,agriculture in the semiarid region is undergoing radical changes driven by global warming and increasing incidences of extreme weather events predicting and evaluating the responses of crop yield and water use patterns of rainfed cropping systems according to future temperature and precipitation changes could provide important information regarding adoption of climate smart farming systems that could offer great resilience and sustainability the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential changes in agronomic productivity hydrological balance and economic profitability of cropping systems with perennial legumes and rotation on the loess plateau of china affected by different future temperature and precipitation scenarios using apsim based modeling five different cropping systems were investigated i continuous maize zea mays m ii continuous winter wheat triticum aestivum w iii continuous lucerne medicago sativa l iv maize wheat soybean gyleine max rotation mws and v lucerne 4 yr winter wheat 2 yr rotation lw in xifeng gansu china five series of temperature and precipitation changes scenarios no changes in atmospheric co2 concentrations were considered based on rcps representative concentration pathways were integrated into scenario simulations including the baseline scenario 1980 2010 mid century scenarios of rcp4 5 m45 and rcp8 5 m85 and end century scenarios of rcp4 5 e45 and rcp8 5 e85 the results showed that compared with baseline simulations mean maize yield under rcps decreased by 6 7 37 7 and the mean wheat yield decreased by 1 7 23 6 lucerne yield consistently increased by 7 2 12 3 under m45 and e45 although different cropping systems affected the yield to a certain extent only the difference between the wheat yields of w and mws was significant p 0 05 on a cropping system level of every 6 yr totally five phases for a scenario of 30 yr the temperature and precipitation changes did not significantly affect plant transpiration tc per phase for all systems except l which received its highest soil evaporation es per phase in baseline the greatest es per phase was found in the e85 l tended to provide greater tc per phase and evapotranspiration et per phase ranging from 1219 to 1332 mm and 2910 3034 mm respectively followed by lw l and mws presented the highest and lowest es per phase 1636 1724 and 1592 1677 mm respectively the gross profit gp per 6 yr phase and water productivity wp per 6 yr phase of l were the greatest among all cropping systems 11 5 13 7 thousand us ha 1 per phase and 3 72 4 41 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively followed by lw and mws for m w and mws the gp per phase and the wp per phase were predicted to be greater under the baseline than under any of the rcps whereas m45 and e45 scenarios improved the gp per phase and wp per phase of l and lw compared with those of the baseline in general we advocate that lw based systems have the greatest potential for producing acceptable yield and economic profit under future temperature and precipitation scenarios for this local environment keywords loess plateau cropping system climate change scenarios crop yield evapotranspiration economic profit 1 introduction in recent years the increasing evidence of global climate change ipcc 2014 has highlighted the need to adopt cropping systems that are less consumptive of resources and are more resilient towards damage caused by extreme weather incidences piao et al 2010 several result synthesis and meta analysis studies have been conducted to focus on the effects of climate change on wheat triticum aestivum and maize zea mays production in the semiarid loess plateau of china in particular zhang and liu 2005 and he et al 2014 predicted that without significant improvement in cultivar development the grain yield of wheat and maize could be reduced by up to 17 31 under projected climate change under the background of climate change the production of maize and winter wheat still dominates the cropland in the rainfed loess plateau region in china mo et al 2016 both crops play important roles in securing grain supply for human consumption and animal feed and have greatly contributed to the national economy china s grain production has been largely dependent on monoculture based systems which significantly increased grain yield and even resulted in intermittent over supply during past decades wang et al 2010 these input demanding monoculture systems required high inputs of chemicals and created enormous pressure on the overall resilience and sustainability of agroecosystems in the semiarid region of china where agricultural and natural resources are typically scant the input quantities of chemical fertilizers pesticides and fossil energy have increased by 45 41 and 55 respectively from 2000 to 2015 nbs 2017 therefore farmers and researchers should focus more on developing alternative sustainable cropping systems that are less consumptive of natural resources yet capable of producing a sufficient amount of high quality grains to meet national and even global demand zhu et al 2017 this is particularly challenging for semiarid dryland based agriculture where the overall agronomic productivity might be limited by the available water under climate change conditions to ameliorate the negative consequences of intensive monoculture based grain production systems under climate change the inclusion of legumes has been proposed ojiem et al 2014 in light of this issue legumes such as lucerne medicago sativa and soybean gyleine max are typically grown in the fallow period of continuous cereal production forming a rotational system that can complete the production gap utilize additional available soil moisture and provide reasonable water use pattern and various crop products on a system basis extensive research works related to legume cereal rotations conducted globally have indicated great agroecological and economic benefits including reduced chemical fertilizer input fumagalli et al 2014 and water usage jat et al 2013 as well as increased land productivity singh et al 1999 liu et al 2016 particularly in the semiarid loess plateau jia et al 2009 argued that mixed cropping systems such as the intercropping of different cereal crops or legume cereal rotations might provide better land productivity without additional water inputs in another study wang et al 2012 noted that to conserve soil moisture continuous production of lucerne should be limited to 10 yr and other shallow root crops should be cultivated after lucerne in addition the changes in land uses from the monocultures of cereals such as continuous maize and winter wheat to legume cereal rotations may play a significant role in adapting to climate change by enhancing and stabilizing land productivity and resourse use traore et al 2017 ma et al 2018 in the semiarid loess plateau however information on yield change water use and economic returns of legume cereal rotations vs conventional monoculture systems under the realm of climate change remains extremely limited and is urgently needed systematic investigations are necessary to assess the agronomic and economic impacts as well as the ecological functions of different legume cereal and monoculture production systems in the loess plateau of china the overall goal of this study was to evaluate alternative legume cereal rotational cropping systems for their agronomic economic and environmental sustainability under rainfed conditions based on established process based models that have been calibrated using published field based data from local environments unlike either conventional modeling studies or meta analysis syntheses our overall data analysis pathway involves intensive use of previously published site specific data largely from our own research group when specifying the values of different model parameters our modeling effort includes system analysis based on scenarios of projected future temperature and precipitation conditions the future projected changes in atmospheric co2 concentrations were not considered to evaluate potential changes in i agronomic productivity such as grain yield and forage yield ii hydrological balance indicated as the evapotranspiration variation and distribution and iii gross profit and water productivity influenced by the long term effects of different cropping systems continuous and rotational legume cereal cropping systems in the loess plateau of china 2 methods and materials 2 1 temperature and precipitation scenarios climate change scenarios are often used in modeling studies to evaluate the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change he et al 2015 traore et al 2017 the

zhao et al 2014 reported that the root mean square error between observed and projected data of these three models was only 2 0 2 5 while the spatial correlation was higher than 0 6 the simulation periods of rcps were limited to the mid century 2040 2070 and the end century 2070 2100 the abbreviations of the rcps were defined in table 1 m45 and m85 were the mid century scenarios of rcp4 5 and 8

with r www agmip org acsgtr cannot forecast ghg co2 n2o ch4 etc so different co2 levels were not considered in the projected scenarios we primarily utilized both future temperature and precipitation scenarios as well as baseline 1980 2010 weather data to evaluate cropping system performance in the current study fig 1 2 2 model introduction the agricultural production system simulator apsim ver 7

an average of 255 frost free days per year the mean annual temperature ranged from 8 c to 10 c and the mean annual total sunshine hours ranged from 2300 to 2700 h the soil of the study site was los orthic entisols according to the fao classification system fao 1990 the groundwater depth was below 50 m agriculture in this area is mainly rainfed with summer dominant precipitation and is a cold

the meteorologic bureau of xifeng the distance between the meteorological station and the experimental site is 19 6 km the common cropping systems in this region were continuous cereals monocultures or rotations usually maize wheat 2 yr rotation over the past several decades while legume incorporated systems such as maize wheat soybean 2 yr rotation have gained greater popularity and have been reported in previous studies jia et al 2009 shen et al 2009 2 4 apsim based simulation 2 4 1 simulation setting two rotational systems and three continuous monoculture systems were included for the scenario simulations using apsim the two rotations were i the maize wheat soybean rotation mws each cycle completed in two years and ii the lucerne wheat rotation lw lucerne production for four years

harvest dates and crop management are described in table 4 the cultivars used for each system were commercial standard cultivars which were specified in apsim including zhongdan2 maize xifeng24 winter wheat fengshou12 soybean and longdong lucerne tillage practices consisted of 20 cm deep ploughing prior to the sowing of maize winter wheat and soybean after harvest remaining cereal residues were removed from the field according to the predominant managerial practices adopted by local farmers who usually use those residues as fuel sources for winter heating purposes in the current study scenario analysis was conducted for all five cropping systems were using the baseline data 1980 2010 and projected temperature and precipitation scenarios totally a baseline scenario 2 rcps 2 time periods and 3 gcms generated scenarios with apsim since the projected scenarios in this study did not include co2 concentration predictions the module of co2 control was not incorporated in our apsim simulations initial soil conditions were assumed similar to remove any bias based on previous soil conditions for the simulated 30 yr production under each scenario the production of m and mws that was initiated in 1981 was based on recorded weather data and environmental conditions which serves as the baseline scenario the production simulations of m and mws was carried out starting from 2041 based on m45 and m85 or 2071 based on e45 and e85 as specified by the mid century scenarios or end century scenarios the simulations of other cropping systems w l and lw that were initiated in 1980 2040 and 2070 were based on the baseline scenario mid century scenarios m45 and m85 and end century scenarios e45 and e85 respectively the mean annual precipitation at the study site was 525 mm in 1980 2010 with high inter annual variability ranging from 312 to 794 mm fig 3 a while the mean annual maximal and minimal air temperature were 14 3 and 4 6 c respectively fig 3b july august and september were characterized as wetter than other months and accounted for approximately 70 of the total annual precipitation fig 3c the warmest and coldest months were july and january respectively fig 3d compared with the baseline data the projected temperature of rcps increased the daily maximal and minimum temperatures by 1 35 4 04 and 1 17 4 22 c yr 1 respectively the increases of temperature in m85 and e85 were greater than in m45 and e45 fig 4 six scenarios indicated reductions in precipitation compared with the baseline data e g 56 mm yr 1 of reduction as indicated by cnrm of m85 while five scenarios indicated increases e g the bcc of m45 showed a 19 mm yr 1 increase compared with baseline the solar radiation amounts under the projected rcps did not show noticeable changes with values decreasing by approximately 0 1 when compared with the baseline values as the first crops of each rotation wheat in w lucerne in l and lw and maize in m and mws had a specific sowing time window table 4 and a requirement for accumulated precipitation 10 mm for sowing smith et al 2016 the whole 30 year simulation period was divided to five phases for each system table 4 the subsequent crops in mws and lw would be sown after the previous crop harvest regardless of the moisture conditions the initial soil water storage of each simulation was set at 100 of plant available water for each soil layer table 3 the initial no3 n and soc contents were set according to observed values in previous studies conducted at this research site yang et al 2010 table 3 we modified each simulation as no post harvest organic matter crop stubble remaining on the soil surface while the subsequent residuals of crops were all removed from the fields all simulation results were obtained based on rainfed conditions with no irrigation inputs 2 4 2 results generation and synthesis the effects of treatments were investigated based on the outputs of apsim simulations grain yield maize and winter wheat and forage yield lucerne and soybean determined by biomass values in the simulations were simulated and recorded to provide a basis for comparing biomass production yield across different cropping systems and climate scenarios we investigated crop water use by comparing soil evaporation es per phase plant transpiration tc per phase and evapotranspiration et per phase during every 6 yr mm per phase the economic gross profit gp per phase thousand us ha 1 per phase was calculated using the following equation 1 g p y p c f c s c t where yp represents the value of the crop yield grain and forage cf and cs represent the cost of fertilizer and seeding respectively and ct represents other machinery costs tillage and harvesting a fixed value unit price was applied in this study production cost 2016 which includes seeds pesticides herbicides fertilizers fossil fuels equipment maintenance and depreciation and labour costs associated with common farming operations were estimated based on the guidelines provided by the regional farmers cooperative and extension service agencies near the study site market prices for grain and forage hay 2016 were obtained from china s national agricultural market service database http datacenter cngrain com and are presented in table 5 for consistency purposes all input unit costs in table 5 were estimated based on the fixed market value of 2016 without interannual variation and inflation for the purposes of quantifying efficiency of water utilization from an economic perspective the water productivity wp per phase us ha 1 mm 1 per phase for each cropping system was calculated as 2 w p g p w s 3 w s p s w i s w t we calculated wp per phase by crop production phase when analysing rotational systems to standardize the comparisons made between scenarios and cropping systems thus in eq 2 the gp values were the gp per phase either within a rotational or continuous cropping system at the same time in this paper ws

hemel hempstead united kingdom statistics software if not described specifically the data for each series scenario represents the mean predicted values of the simulations of three gcms bcc ccsm and cnrm the crop yield tc per phase es per phase et per phase and gp per phase and wp per phase of the scenario simulations were compared among the cropping systems and rcps the analysis of variances based mean separation was performed using the duncan multi range test at p 0 05 differences in crop yield among cropping systems were tested using fisher s protected least significant difference test due to the fact that maize and lucerne were only planted in two cropping systems annual crop yields were considered repeated measures in the variation analyses different phases which included the means of the results from three gcms bcc ccsm and cnrm were considered a fixed effect and treated as replications in the variation analyses 3 results 3 1 crop yield compared with the baseline prediction mean maize yield of m and mws was decreased by 6 7 m45 to 28 2 e85 and 12 2 m45 to 37 7 e85 under the rcps fig 5 the mean winter wheat yield was decreased by 5 4 m45 to 23 6 e85 and 1 7 e45 to 8 8 m85 for w and lw respectively however for the mws system m45 and e45 improved wheat yield by 1 5 and 3 5 respectively compared with the baseline values p 0 05 m85 and e85 reduced the wheat yield by 1 8 and 0 9 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 the rcps also predicted a 1 1 m45 to 25 4 e85 lower soybean yield compared with the baseline data p 0 05 fig 5 different from the other crops lucerne yield under m45 and e45 consistently improved by 11 7 12 3 and 7 2 8 7 for l and lw respectively p 0 05 for l monocultures e85 reduced lucerne yield by 6 2 but m85 increased it by 5 5 for lw rotational cropping both m85 and e85 reduced lucerne yield by 13 9 and 0 4 respectively p 0 05 fig 5 different gcms did not significantly influence crop yields data not shown the mean grain yield of the m system was 5575 kg ha 1 and it was improved by 17 0 34 7 under mws on average 23 8 p 0 088 fig 6 for winter wheat w showed the highest yield 4347 kg ha 1 among the three systems w mws and lw while mws and lw reduced the mean yield by 17 1 36 1 p 0 05 and 8 1 23 0 p 0 05 compared with w respectively fig 6 for lucerne the mean yield was relatively similar between l and lw within deviations ranging from 2 1 11 1 on average 8 9 p 0 05 fig 6 3 2 evapotranspiration the majority of simulations produced insignificantly different tc values among the climate scenarios including the baseline data however numerically speaking the baseline climatic conditions presented the greatest tc per phase 1061 1259 mm for m w and mws followed by e45 1044 1228 mm and m45 1038 1217 mm table 6 likewise l tended to provide greatest tc per phase ranged from 1219 to 1332 mm followed by lw and mws 1138 1272 and 1131 1259 mm respectively table 6 w provided the lowest tc per phase 984 1061 mm which were significantly lower than those of l mws and lw p 0 05 table 6 based on table 6 the first greatest es per phase of 6 yr was found in e85 except for the l system which received its highest es in baseline on a cropping system level the l system showed the highest es per phase 1636 1724 mm among cropping systems followed by lw and w 1624 1703 and 1662 1739 mm respectively while mws provided the lowest values 1592 1677 mm table 6 additionally the values of et per phase were similar among scenarios p 0 05 on a cropping system basis the first highest the second highest and the lowest et per phase were found in l 2910 3034 mm lw 2838 2951 mm and w 2700 2723 mm table 6 respectively the m45 scenario of ccsm and the m85 scenario of cnrm showed 33 5 60 4 mm yr 1 lower annual precipitation compared with other gcms which caused relatively high differences in tc among three gcms for tc per phase these two scenarios were 2 6 10 and 3 6 7 6 lower than the mean p 0 05 respectively for es per phase the maximal difference between gcms for a same rcp was only 4 7 3 3 economic profit and water productivity the gp per phase of l was the greatest among all cropping systems 11 5 13 7 thousand us ha 1 followed by lw and mws 10 0 12 2 and 7 5 10 4 thousand us ha 1 respectively table 7 l also provided the greatest wp per phase among the systems on average 3 72 4 41 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase followed by lw and mws 3 29 3 98 and 2 50 3 39 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively table 8 the gp per phase and wp per phase of m and w were relatively low providing gp value of 6 3 9 1 and 7 2 10 0 thousand us ha 1 and wp value of 2 09 2 95 and 2 44 3 27 us ha 1 mm 1 per phase respectively tables 7 and 8 the gp per phase and wp per phase were generally similar to that of crop yield tables 7 and 8 the baseline predicted a greater gp per phase and wp per phase compared with the rcps for m w and mws while the m45 scenario provided the second greatest values l and lw indicated the highest gp per phase and mean wp per phase under m45 improved 6 1 13 7 compared with baseline data followed by e45 improved 5 2 13 1 compared with baseline data moreover m w and mws presented significant reductions on gp per phase and wp per phase under e85 compared with baseline data p 0 05 tables 7 and 8 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield there were no consistent changes in predicted precipitation for the scenarios fig 4 while the main predicted climate impacts among rcps caused by the magnitude differences in temperature increase were rather apparent in the current study shorter growing seasons for maize and winter wheat could be observed as a consequence of more rapid accumulation of heat units and early maturity when temperature rises watson et al 1997 he et al 2015 in this study rcps produced lower maize and wheat yield than those of the baseline scenario especially in the gcms which were predicted lower annual precipitation than baseline data innes et al 2015 agreed with this finding based on long term statistically modeling results another modeling study pointed out that the main cause of yield reduction was the reduction of the vegetative growth period which led to a limited production of photosynthates used for grain filling processes traore et al 2017 our results agreed well with these previous findings for example the end century scenarios were warmer than mid century scenarios and rcp8 5 showed higher temperatures rising compared with those of the rcp4 5 scenarios which resulted in more drastic yield reductions for maize and wheat for soybean crop however its short growing seasons were less impacted by temperature and precipitation changes singh et al 1999 resulting in insignificant yield losses across all of the rcps for lucerne production the yields of both l and lw were markedly improved under the mid century scenarios m45 and e45 in agreement with raza et al 2013 who hypothesized that moderately increasing temperature within a certain range could enhance yield by lengthening the growing season mws and lw indicated generally lower winter wheat yields than that of w in each scenario we speculated that this was due to lower soil moisture content at wheat sowing in mws and lw as well as the low water supply during winter and spring fig 3c maize yield under mws was greater than that under m which agreed with common findings in agronomic production as well as many former experimental or modeling results appearing to be a case of different water consumption by previous crops yang et al 2015a smith et al 2016 moreover the lucerne crop gained 2 1 11 1 of yield increases in lw compared with that of l which agreed with the finding by doole and pannell 2008 the production increase of lucerne was largely a consequence of the additional nitrogen inputs added by wheat in general we conclude that the system outputs of the rotational systems were generally greater than continuous cropping as a whole under highly variable climate conditions despite the yield reduction observed in the individual crop production phase smith et al 2016 sieling and christe 2015 however as we have not considered the co2 concentration change and fertilisation effect the predicted future crop yields might be underestimated in the scenario simulations policy et al 1993 4 2 evapotranspiration overall water use evaluated as tc of cereal crops should be greatly reduced under rising temperature conditions as indicated under the majority of the scenario simulations for the legume based systems such as l this effect might not be as pronounced as that of cereals because lucerne typically has a very deep root system that could enhance water uptake from deep soil profiles under limited surface water input our results agreed well with a previous modeling study that m45 and e45 insignificantly improved tc p 0 05 with higher trend on water uptake of lucerne brown et al 2012 similar to the results reported by gaydon et al 2017 our results indicated that apsim modeling could successfully capture the effects of variable tc reduction caused by precipitation change which also affects et and ws and increased temperature under different gcms for example the m45 scenario of ccsm and the m85 scenario of cnrm showed marked reductions in tc per phase compared with the other gcms under corresponding pathways the differences in precipitation seemed to be insufficient for drastically affecting es or et as both values were relatively similar among scenarios moderate amounts of es reduction were still observed for l and lw under m45 e45 and m85 compared with the baseline scenario particularly the differences of l were significant at the level of p 0 05 this finding could be explained from the longer growing season of lucerne which tended to provide more pronounced responses towards the changes in environmental factors such as precipitation raza et al 2013 at the cropping system level we found that mws and lw presented consistently greater tc per phase and lower es per phase compared with those of m and w due to longer total production period and greater ground vegetation cover the longer growing season and the deeper tap root systems of lucerne pietsch et al 2007 brown et al 2012 produced high accumulative tc within both monocultures and rotations the l system also presented slightly higher es per phase than other cropping systems the reason might be the higher soil holding capacity caused by high organic matter which derived from the long lucerne planting time providing more water for evaporation in the shallow soil layers evaporation mainly consumed the stored soil water at the depth range of 0 60 cm liu et al 2015 m typically had greater tc per phase and lower es per phase than w because maize s growing seasons were generally the main rainy season of the study site from july to september it is also noteworthy that maize and lucerne both indicated poorer soil water recharge than wheat the studies based on field experiments jia et al 2009 and boundary function analysis zhang et al 2014 suggested that the continuous perennation of lucerne could lead to severe moisture depletion at the deep soil layer additionally the maize yield largely depends on plant available water at the early stages when precipitation is typically scarce in the loess plateau therefore the contiguous production of both lucerne and maize monocultures would require large amounts of water to ensure productivity raza et al 2013 yang et al 2015b and are unsuitable for long term implementation in semiarid regions in contrast the relatively lower tc per phase and et per phase of w indicated that winter wheat could be integrated into maize and or lucerne based crop rotations due to its limited water consumption shen et al 2009 gaiser et al 2012 from this perspective mws and lw systems are more adaptable towards temperature and precipitation changes as indicated by their overall significantly lower es per phase but slightly greater tc than those of the monoculture systems 4 3 gross profit gp and water productivity wp without question the economic profit of adopting different cropping systems in the semiarid region can be greatly affected by many production input factors such as variety selection market prices of crops and the amount of fertilization liu et al 2016 however our research findings indicated that the future temperature and precipitation change could have tremendous impacts on the gp per phase and wp per phase generally the gp and wp responses towards the rcps largely mirrored the yield response pattern particularly for the mws system we found relatively greater decreases in the gp per phase and wp per phase under rcps this could be partially attributed to the poor performance of maize and wheat phases caused by environmental variability and limited water availability gresta et al 2016 he et al 2014 in previous studies rotational systems were generally considered to be more profitable due to the longer production period as reported in both experimental and modeling studies doole and pannell 2008 smith et al 2016 this generally agreed with our findings which indicated greater gp per phase and wp per phase of lw or mws compared with m or w respectively however our results also indicated that the continuous system l provided the highest gp per phase and wp per phase which was mainly caused by the high price of lucerne hay ojiem et al 2014 we conclude that under fixed crop prices and production costs legume cereal rotations or legume monocultures could provide satisfactory economic income for local farmers more effort related to extension education should be conducted to influence farmers preferences and enhance knowledge transfer in the rural region of the loess plateau of china tang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 4 4 uncertainty and its implications our results showed large uncertainty variation in crop yield predictions across different future temperature and precipitation change scenarios this uncertainty primarily stems from the differences in the way gcms respond to changes in radiative forcing levels teng et al 2012 for example the e85 scenario of cnrm improved 6 5 of the wp per phase of l whereas this metric was lower than the baseline scenario for the other two gcms this might be due to the impacts of higher precipitation of cnrm than bcc and ccsm from july to september the period that chen et al 2008 indicated that lucerne field maintained dry soil down to 3 m and there seemed to be no deep drainage occurring even after significant precipitation events the higher precipitation in this period would mitigate water stress under cnrm the rcp trajectories adopted by ipcc are clustered and labelled according to the possible ranges of radiative forcing values that are determined by atmospheric ghg emissions the ideal simulated results should also indicate good agreement between elevated ghg concentrations and crop production responses however the projected scenarios in this study were generated by acsgtr without forecasting co2 concentration resulting in uncertainty to the effects of co2 fertilization subsequent research should focus on the observed advantageous responses that are associated with lucerne and winter wheat both are c3 crops compared to maize c4 under different rcps because c assimilation efficiency of c3 crops could be enhanced under increased co2 concentration policy et al 1993 for the economic analysis a fixed value unit price approach was chosen to limit the impacts of inflation on the market value evaluation in the current study table 5 however cost price structures could change significantly in the future in further studies price change projections could be integrated into the economic analysis 5 conclusions through the use of long term simulation the projected future temperature and precipitation scenarios resulted in significant reductions in yield for both maize and winter wheat under both continuous and rotational systems compared with the baseline data lucerne yield was improved under the rcp4 5 scenarios which indicated high productivity levels given the rising temperature conditions in the future the m and l cropping systems had greater tc per phase and et per phase than w implying that continuous maize and lucerne are unsuitable for the projected future temperature and precipitation change scenarios wheat indicated greater potential to conserve soil water in rotations both mws and lw tended to utilize soil moisture to a greater extent which resulted in greater soil moisture depletion and lower es per phase based on fixed crop prices and production costs 2016 l produced the highest gp per phase and wp per phase among all systems and lw also presented relatively higher values with lower variation therefore we conclude that lw based systems have the greatest potential for providing acceptable yield and economic profit under limited water availability and good agronomic productivity as well as maintaining resilient ecological functionality and sustainability under the projected future temperature and precipitation changes in the local environment future studies should focus on refining and improving the model s robustness and accuracy under different environmental conditions and management practices with combination of multi crop and climate modeling with projected future changes in atmospheric co2 practical experimentation coupled with demonstration and extension education is critical to identify and promote the adoption of suitable cropping systems more effort should be implemented into investigating other legume cereal rotations and intercropping practices within different regions of china and establishing these systems locally as part

10776,accurate quantification of net radiation flux r n is of paramount importance for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 rate which is used to estimate crop water use a widely recommended penman monteith procedure outlined in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 for estimation of r n fao56 r n is often used to estimate r n however the fao56 r n model is data intensive and also requires site specific calibrations of coefficients to attain a high level of accuracy of r n estimates these coefficients are often used without site specific calibrations as a result of the lack of large and representative radiative flux measurements in data scarce regions such as southern africa and r n estimates are therefore considered questionable assessment of different models in situ measurements of r n is critical to identify an alternative approach that could be used for accurate estimation of r n with minimal data input and without any site specific calibrations in this region in this study two new r n models which differ only in the procedures used to compute atmospheric emissivity were proposed the first model requires measurements of solar irradiance r s maximum and minimum air temperatures t a i r m i n and t a i r m a x while the second model requires additional measurements of relative humidity r h m i n and r h m a x for estimation of the actual vapour pressure e a i r two new r n models and a widely recommended fao56 r n model were evaluated using daily r n measurements acquired from five sites which represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa the results showed that the first model performed better than all the evaluated models at four sites with regression coefficient r 2 values greater than 0 90 and index of agreement d values greater than 0 97 these findings suggest that the first model presented here is the most promising and suitable to estimate r n with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations the findings of this study can be used to inform the decision on selecting a model to be used for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirement in climatic conditions similar to this region keywords calibration net radiometer modelling radiative flux reference crop evapotranspiration validations 1 introduction inefficient agricultural water management has resulted in severe environmental impacts such as groundwater depletion soil erosion and leaching of nutrients into downstream in most countries of the world alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 dile et al 2013 the need for precision agricultural water management is becoming more urgent for sustainable use of water resources as the water scarcity posed by climate change advances particular in semi arid regions anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 gwate et al 2019 niu et al 2019 within this context accurate quantification of crop water demand and use is of paramount importance for the development of informed adaptation strategies to support efficient agricultural water management in both irrigated and rainfed cropping systems gavilan et al 2007 annandale et al 2011 mcmahon et al 2013 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 crop water use is often estimated based on the concept of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 which is associated with atmospheric water demand allen et al 1998 defined e t 0 as evapotranspiration that occurs in a large ground area completely covered with grass of height 0 12 m underactive growth and not short of water according to allen et al 1998 e t 0 is computed for the reference grass and then is multiplied by the specific crop coefficients k c to estimate crop evapotranspiration weighing lysimeters and micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance and surface renewal have been internationally recognised as the most accurate methods of estimating e t 0 that are often used as standard methods against which other approaches are compared allen et al 1998 gavilan et al 2007 mengistu and savage 2010 according to mcmahon et al 2013 the main disadvantage of these techniques is the large number of the high frequency measurements required and the difficulties in measuring some of them consequently these techniques are relatively expensive and have generally been used only in well equipped and specific research sites mengistu and savage 2010 mcmahon et al 2013 in recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to establish special flux networks in a few countries of the world to monitor carbon water and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere ecosystems baldocchi 2014 chu et al 2017 therefore e t 0 is often estimated from meteorological data measured in standard weather stations using models allen et al 1998 in the widely recommended penman monteith procedure outlined in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 pm an equation driven by the difference between net radiation flux r n and soil stored heat flux the available energy flux is the most accurate model of estimating e t o over a wide range of climates and is often used as a standard model against which other models are compared allen et al 1998 gavilan et al 2007 in southern africa the fao 56 pm has been successfully applied to estimate e t o under different agro climatic zones e g persaud et al 2007 clulow et al 2012 tongwane et al 2017 furthermore models such as aquacrop sapwat and swb which compute crop water use based on the fao 56 pm have been widely used to estimate crop yields and crop water use in southern africa van heerden et al 2009 fessehazion et al 2012 modi and mabhaudhi 2013 mabhaudhi et al 2014 zinyengere et al 2015 the fao 56 pm equation for estimating e t o requires either estimates or measurements of r n which are not often not monitored at the standard weather stations in developing countries in particular dong et al 1992 allen et al 1998 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 carmona et al 2015 djaman et al 2016 net radiation fluxes are measured using expensive net radiometers equipment that require continuous calibration and maintenance to ensure accurate measurements dong et al 1992 llasat and snyder 1998 brotzge and duchon 2000 alados et al 2003 kjaersgaard et al 2007 geraldo ferreira et al 2011 previous studies e g geraldo ferreira et al 2011 wu et al 2017 have identified r n as one of the most difficult micrometeorological variables to monitor and interpret as a result of its dependence on temperature emissivity and reflectivity of the underlying surface consequently r n is available only from well equipped research stations in southern africa according to allen et al 1998 r n can be estimated from meteorological data that is readily available from most standard weather stations using empirical models estimates of r n are often used when in situ r n measurements of good quality are not readily available in the site of interest or to fill gaps and for quality assessments of r n datasets kjaersgaard et al 2007 several models have been developed and successfully applied to estimate r n kjaersgaard et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 carmona et al 2017 however each model has its superiorities and limitations in terms of theoretical assumptions data input requirements coefficients level of complexity and accuracy irmak et al 2010 the differences in the r n models are mainly attributed to the procedures used to compute clear sky solar radiation cloud cover net outgoing longwave radiation atmospheric emissivity and actual vapour pressure of the air kjaersgaard et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 the accuracy of the models to estimate r n affects the estimation of the available energy which is the main driver of the e t o batchelor 1984 gavilan et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 using incorrect measurements or estimates of r n could results in significant errors in the estimations of e t o by the fao 56 pm equation oliveira et al 2000 da cunha et al 2014 pereira et al 2014 consequently accurate quantification of r n is of paramount importance for the precise estimation of e t 0 previous studies e g kjaersgaard et al 2007 carmona et al 2017 have reported that fao56 r n requires site specific coefficients to attain a high level of accuracy of r n estimates however these coefficients are often used without site specific calibrations as a result of lack of representative radiative flux measurements in southern africa and r n estimates are therefore considered questionable therefore there is a need to develop a reliable model that could be used for accurate estimation of r n from readily available meteorological data without any site specific calibrations in southern africa for locations facing data scarcity improved estimation of r n can provide a more accurate prediction for e t o sabziparvar and mirgaloybayat 2015 furthermore it is desirable to accurately estimate e t o from weather data that are readily available and often in good quality for precise estimation of crop evapotranspiration pereira et al 2014 within this context assessment of different models to estimate r n relative to in situ measurements of r n is crucial for identification of the most accurate model that could be used as an alternative to estimate r n with minimal data input requirements for improved estimation of e t o very few if any studies that have been done to evaluate the performance of the fao56 r n under the climatic conditions of this region therefore the availability of in situ radiative flux data at five sites that represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa enables the unique opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of the r n models in this region therefore the main aim of this study was to improve the estimation of r n from standard weather data in this region the first objective was to evaluate the performance of the fao56 r n model in this region whilst the second objective was to develop and evaluate two new alternative procedures with relative minimum input data requirements to estimate r n without any site specific calibrations 2 study site the lack of a long term record of r n data across different agro climatic zones of southern africa often hinders the evaluation of r n models in this region after an extensive search of published literature and other relevant publicly available data sources five sites that represent a wide range of elevations climatic and land cover conditions across southern africa were selected to evaluate the performance of the r n models site selection was based on the availability of quality r n data measured using a four component net radiometer and corresponding meteorological data fig 1 the mfabeni mire and embomveni dunes sites are located at the maputaland in kwazulu natal of south africa these sites were located 6 km apart and therefore climatic conditions were similar but different elevations and land covers clulow et al 2012 maputaland has a warm temperate and fully humid climate

presented in table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 modelling net irradiance 3 1 1 proposed net radiation model in this paper we propose two models that compute r n from daily measurements of solar

of ε 0 to identify the most suitable equation in this region the choice of idso and jackson 1969 equation was based on its minimal data input and the fact that it was developed under wide climatic conditions that are typical to southern africa the choice of brutsaert 1975 was based on its physicality that is based on the radiative transfer theory and it was developed using data from several

18 comparisons were made between the daily r n e and r n at all five sites representing a wide range of climatic conditions elevations and land cover conditions of southern africa fig 2 a summary of the statistical results of the comparisons between r n and r n e values from three r n models at all five sites is presented in table 3 4 2 1 performance of the fao56 r n model the relationship between r n e predicted from the fao56 r n model eq 18 and r n was good at all five sites with r 2 values greater than 0 89 and c values less than 3 26 mj m 2 the rmse values ranged from 1 56 to 2 63 mj m 2 with mbe values ranging from 0 11 to 1 59 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model estimates r n well at all sites the d values greater than 0 94 indicated good similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites the findings of this study are in agreement with the previous studies that have reported a good performance of the fao56 r n model under a wide range of climatic conditions for example kjærsgaard et al 2009 reported good model performances with rmse values less than 1 47 mj m 2 and mbe values less than 1 06 mj m 2 under the sub humid climatic conditions of denmark kjærsgaard et al 2009 also reported a good model performance with rmse values less than 1 16 mj m 2 and mbe values less than 0 72 mj m 2 under the semi arid climatic conditions of spain and their findings suggested a better fao56 r n model performance under semi arid conditions compared to sub humid climatic conditions kjærsgaard et al 2009 irmak et al 2010 reported a good correlation between r n and r n e with the r 2 value of 0 93 and the rmse value of 1 44 mj m 2 under sub humid climatic conditions of nebraska carmona et al 2017 reported the rmse value of 1 90 mj m 2 and the mbe value of 1 64 mj m 2 under mild and humid climatic conditions of tandil city in argentina 4 2 2 performance of the proposed model idso jackson model eq 16 the relationship between r n and r n e predicted from the proposed model eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the idso and jackson 1969 equation was very good at all five sites with r 2 values greater than 0 90 and c values less than 1 97 mj m 2 the rmse values ranged from 1 09 to 2 27 mj m 2 with mbe values ranging from 0 65 to 1 16 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model estimates r n very well at all sites the d values greater than 0 97 indicated strong similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites 4 2 3 performance of the proposed model brutsaert model eq 17 the relationship between measurements of r n and r n e predicted from the proposed model eq 17 which estimates ε 0 using brutsaert 1975 equation was reasonable at all five sites with r 2 values greater than 0 82 and c values less than 3 63 mj m 2 the rmse values ranging from 3 34 to 5 27 mj m 2 with mbe values ranged from 1 97 to 4 73 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model often over estimated r n at all sites the d values greater than 0 86 indicated reasonable similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites 4 3 overall discussion the results showed that the proposed model eq 16 performed better than eq 17 and the fao56 r n model eq 18 at all sites except at the wetland of mfabeni mire where the fao56 r n model outperformed all the proposed new models discrepancies at mfabeni mire wetland could be attributed to significant r s absorbed by water than expected as a result of the lower reflection coefficient of water compared to the vegetation brutsaert 2013 a good agreement was obtained between daily r n and r n e predicted by the fao56 r n model at all five sites the results confirm the validity of the fao56 r n model under the climatic conditions of southern africa the observed differences between r n e from fao56 r n and r n may be attributed to the poor estimation of l d as a result of using coefficients proposed by allen et al 1998 without site specific calibrations at our sites these findings were consistent with previous studies which reported that the coefficients used in the fao56 r n model require site specific calibrations to attain more accurate of r n estimates e g kjaersgaard et al 2007 sabziparvar and mirgaloybayat 2015 carmona et al 2017 therefore this study confirmed the need for site specific calibrations of coefficients in the fao56 r n model for accurate r n estimates as also noted by carmona et al 2017 the results also showed that eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the empirical idso and jackson 1969 equation outperformed eq 17 which estimates ε 0 using a physically based brutsaert s 1975 equation at all sites regardless of the similarity of the equations utilised in these proposed two models which only varied in the procedures used to calculate ε 0 there were significant differences between their r n e the observed relatively poorer performance of eq 17 may be attributed to the poor estimation of l d as a result of using a default empirical coefficient of 1 24 in brutsaert s equation which could have lacked the validity under the agro climatic conditions of southern africa previous studies have demonstrated the need for site specific calibration of brutsaert s coefficient which varies with climatic and land cover conditions to attain best r n e carmona et al 2014 cheng and nnadi 2014 lópez olivari et al 2015 for example culf and gash 1993 found that a brutsaert s coefficient of 1 31 was suitable to attain the best estimates of l d under the climatic conditions of niger in west africa kjaersgaard et al 2007 suggested that at least 5 years of good quality profile data is needed to obtain stable site specific calibration of brutsaert s coefficient however the lack of long term quality radiative fluxes and profile measurements of e a i r and t a i r in the developing countries often hinders the site specific calibrations of coefficients used in the r n models cheng and nnadi 2014 these findings confirmed the need for site specific calibrations of brutsaert s coefficient to attain best r n e which limits its applicability in southern africa where long term profile measurements of e a i r and t a i r are lacking our findings do not coincide with the previous study by carmona et al 2017 which concluded that estimating ε 0 using brutsaert s 1975 equation is not confined to a specific climate regime in contrast our findings suggested that eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the idso and jackson 1969 equation is the most promising alternative and appropriate to estimate r n in the fao 56 pm equation in southern africa without any site specific calibrations this proposed model eq 16 only requires daily measurements of r s t m a x t m i n as meteorological data inputs whilst eq 17 requires additional measurements of r h m i n and r h m a x for estimation of e a i r according to kjaersgaard et al 2007 the accuracy of r n e depends on the quality of the input dataset therefore models that estimate r n from minimum meteorological inputs are recommended to reduce levels of uncertainties associated with quality of the input dataset these results suggested the suitability of the proposed model eq 16 to estimate r n with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations therefore the findings of this study suggested that the proposed model eq 16 could be used in the fao 56 pm equation for accurate estimation of crop water requirements in this region the findings of this study indicated that the performance of the r n models depends on the method used to compute ε 0 and is site specific because these models were developed from certain specific climatic conditions consequently their performances are affected by the local agro climatic conditions and are likely to give reliable estimates under similar conditions from which they were developed therefore it is recommended that r n model should be selected according to the climatic conditions of the site of interest for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirements in data scarce regions 5 conclusions accurate quantification of r n is of paramount importance for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 rate which is used to estimate crop water use net radiation fluxes are measured using expensive net radiometers that require continuous calibration and maintenance to attain accurate measurements consequently r n measurements are not readily available from standard weather stations in developing countries in particular therefore the assessment of different models relative to in situ measurements of r n is critical to identify the most accurate and robust alternative approach that could be reliably used to estimate r n with minimal data input and without any site specific calibrations in data scarce regions such as southern africa in this study two new r n models which differ only in the procedures used to compute atmospheric emissivity were proposed two new r n models and a widely recommended fao56 r n model were evaluated using daily r n measurements acquired from five sites which represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa this study showed that r n can be estimated well from standard weather station data using the fao56 r n model and the two proposed models in this region the results also revealed that the proposed new model that computes ε 0 from t a i r only performed better than all the evaluated models at four sites except at mfabeni mire where the fao56 r n model outperformed all the proposed new models discrepancies at mfabeni mire wetland were attributed to significant r s absorbed by water than expected these findings suggest that the proposed model presented here is the most promising alternative and appropriate to estimate r n in the fao 56 pm equation with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations however estimates of r n from this proposed model still need to be tested for suitability against in situ measurements of r n under all different climatic conditions of this region for extended periods before the model could be utilised with confidence the lack of a long term record of r n and e t 0 data across all different agro climatic zones of this region hindered the evaluation of these r n models and to investigate whether this improvement in r n estimation from the proposed model has any significant improvements in e t 0 estimation therefore the need for accurate and continuous radiative fluxes and e t 0 data across all different agro climatic zones of this region is indisputable the findings of this study also indicated that the performance of the r n models depends on the method used to compute ε 0 and therefore it is recommended that r n model should be selected according to the climatic conditions of the site of interest for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirement in data scarce regions acknowledgments

10776,accurate quantification of net radiation flux r n is of paramount importance for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 rate which is used to estimate crop water use a widely recommended penman monteith procedure outlined in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 for estimation of r n fao56 r n is often used to estimate r n however the fao56 r n model is data intensive and also requires site specific calibrations of coefficients to attain a high level of accuracy of r n estimates these coefficients are often used without site specific calibrations as a result of the lack of large and representative radiative flux measurements in data scarce regions such as southern africa and r n estimates are therefore considered questionable assessment of different models in situ measurements of r n is critical to identify an alternative approach that could be used for accurate estimation of r n with minimal data input and without any site specific calibrations in this region in this study two new r n models which differ only in the procedures used to compute atmospheric emissivity were proposed the first model requires measurements of solar irradiance r s maximum and minimum air temperatures t a i r m i n and t a i r m a x while the second model requires additional measurements of relative humidity r h m i n and r h m a x for estimation of the actual vapour pressure e a i r two new r n models and a widely recommended fao56 r n model were evaluated using daily r n measurements acquired from five sites which represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa the results showed that the first model performed better than all the evaluated models at four sites with regression coefficient r 2 values greater than 0 90 and index of agreement d values greater than 0 97 these findings suggest that the first model presented here is the most promising and suitable to estimate r n with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations the findings of this study can be used to inform the decision on selecting a model to be used for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirement in climatic conditions similar to this region keywords calibration net radiometer modelling radiative flux reference crop evapotranspiration validations 1 introduction inefficient agricultural water management has resulted in severe environmental impacts such as groundwater depletion soil erosion and leaching of nutrients into downstream in most countries of the world alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 dile et al 2013 the need for precision agricultural water management is becoming more urgent for sustainable use of water resources as the water scarcity posed by climate change advances particular in semi arid regions anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 gwate et al 2019 niu et al 2019 within this context accurate quantification of crop water demand and use is of paramount importance for the development of informed adaptation strategies to support efficient agricultural water management in both irrigated and rainfed cropping systems gavilan et al 2007 annandale et al 2011 mcmahon et al 2013 anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 crop water use is often estimated based on the concept of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 which is associated with atmospheric water demand allen et al 1998 defined e t 0 as evapotranspiration that occurs in a large ground area completely covered with grass of height 0 12 m underactive growth and not short of water according to allen et al 1998 e t 0 is computed for the reference grass and then is multiplied by the specific crop coefficients k c to estimate crop evapotranspiration weighing lysimeters and micrometeorological techniques such as eddy covariance and surface renewal have been internationally recognised as the most accurate methods of estimating e t 0 that are often used as standard methods against which other approaches are compared allen et al 1998 gavilan et al 2007 mengistu and savage 2010 according to mcmahon et al 2013 the main disadvantage of these techniques is the large number of the high frequency measurements required and the difficulties in measuring some of them consequently these techniques are relatively expensive and have generally been used only in well equipped and specific research sites mengistu and savage 2010 mcmahon et al 2013 in recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to establish special flux networks in a few countries of the world to monitor carbon water and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere ecosystems baldocchi 2014 chu et al 2017 therefore e t 0 is often estimated from meteorological data measured in standard weather stations using models allen et al 1998 in the widely recommended penman monteith procedure outlined in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 pm an equation driven by the difference between net radiation flux r n and soil stored heat flux the available energy flux is the most accurate model of estimating e t o over a wide range of climates and is often used as a standard model against which other models are compared allen et al 1998 gavilan et al 2007 in southern africa the fao 56 pm has been successfully applied to estimate e t o under different agro climatic zones e g persaud et al 2007 clulow et al 2012 tongwane et al 2017 furthermore models such as aquacrop sapwat and swb which compute crop water use based on the fao 56 pm have been widely used to estimate crop yields and crop water use in southern africa van heerden et al 2009 fessehazion et al 2012 modi and mabhaudhi 2013 mabhaudhi et al 2014 zinyengere et al 2015 the fao 56 pm equation for estimating e t o requires either estimates or measurements of r n which are not often not monitored at the standard weather stations in developing countries in particular dong et al 1992 allen et al 1998 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 carmona et al 2015 djaman et al 2016 net radiation fluxes are measured using expensive net radiometers equipment that require continuous calibration and maintenance to ensure accurate measurements dong et al 1992 llasat and snyder 1998 brotzge and duchon 2000 alados et al 2003 kjaersgaard et al 2007 geraldo ferreira et al 2011 previous studies e g geraldo ferreira et al 2011 wu et al 2017 have identified r n as one of the most difficult micrometeorological variables to monitor and interpret as a result of its dependence on temperature emissivity and reflectivity of the underlying surface consequently r n is available only from well equipped research stations in southern africa according to allen et al 1998 r n can be estimated from meteorological data that is readily available from most standard weather stations using empirical models estimates of r n are often used when in situ r n measurements of good quality are not readily available in the site of interest or to fill gaps and for quality assessments of r n datasets kjaersgaard et al 2007 several models have been developed and successfully applied to estimate r n kjaersgaard et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 carmona et al 2017 however each model has its superiorities and limitations in terms of theoretical assumptions data input requirements coefficients level of complexity and accuracy irmak et al 2010 the differences in the r n models are mainly attributed to the procedures used to compute clear sky solar radiation cloud cover net outgoing longwave radiation atmospheric emissivity and actual vapour pressure of the air kjaersgaard et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 the accuracy of the models to estimate r n affects the estimation of the available energy which is the main driver of the e t o batchelor 1984 gavilan et al 2007 irmak et al 2010 da cunha et al 2014 using incorrect measurements or estimates of r n could results in significant errors in the estimations of e t o by the fao 56 pm equation oliveira et al 2000 da cunha et al 2014 pereira et al 2014 consequently accurate quantification of r n is of paramount importance for the precise estimation of e t 0 previous studies e g kjaersgaard et al 2007 carmona et al 2017 have reported that fao56 r n requires site specific coefficients to attain a high level of accuracy of r n estimates however these coefficients are often used without site specific calibrations as a result of lack of representative radiative flux measurements in southern africa and r n estimates are therefore considered questionable therefore there is a need to develop a reliable model that could be used for accurate estimation of r n from readily available meteorological data without any site specific calibrations in southern africa for locations facing data scarcity improved estimation of r n can provide a more accurate prediction for e t o sabziparvar and mirgaloybayat 2015 furthermore it is desirable to accurately estimate e t o from weather data that are readily available and often in good quality for precise estimation of crop evapotranspiration pereira et al 2014 within this context assessment of different models to estimate r n relative to in situ measurements of r n is crucial for identification of the most accurate model that could be used as an alternative to estimate r n with minimal data input requirements for improved estimation of e t o very few if any studies that have been done to evaluate the performance of the fao56 r n under the climatic conditions of this region therefore the availability of in situ radiative flux data at five sites that represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa enables the unique opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of the r n models in this region therefore the main aim of this study was to improve the estimation of r n from standard weather data in this region the first objective was to evaluate the performance of the fao56 r n model in this region whilst the second objective was to develop and evaluate two new alternative procedures with relative minimum input data requirements to estimate r n without any site specific calibrations 2 study site the lack of a long term record of r n data across different agro climatic zones of southern africa often hinders the evaluation of r n models in this region after an extensive search of published literature and other relevant publicly available data sources five sites that represent a wide range of elevations climatic and land cover conditions across southern africa were selected to evaluate the performance of the r n models site selection was based on the availability of quality r n data measured using a four component net radiometer and corresponding meteorological data fig 1 the mfabeni mire and embomveni dunes sites are located at the maputaland in kwazulu natal of south africa these sites were located 6 km apart and therefore climatic conditions were similar but different elevations and land covers clulow et al 2012 maputaland has a warm temperate and fully humid climate

from the letseng site were acquired from the ukzn database collected by a postgraduate student and have not officially been published previously all datasets underwent a quality control routine to identify and remove missing data errors and suspect data as well as to ensure that data were consistent and met the data quality objectives for example t a i r below 35 c or greater than 50 c or t a i

mj m 2 with mbe values ranging from 0 11 to 1 59 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model estimates r n well at all sites the d values greater than 0 94 indicated good similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites the findings of this study are in agreement with the previous studies that have reported a good performance of the fao56 r n model under a wide range of climatic conditions for example kjærsgaard et al 2009 reported good model performances with rmse values less than 1 47 mj m 2 and mbe values less than 1 06 mj m 2 under the sub humid climatic conditions of denmark kjærsgaard et al 2009 also reported a good model performance with rmse values less than 1 16 mj m 2 and mbe values less than 0 72 mj m 2 under the semi arid climatic conditions of spain and their findings suggested a better fao56 r n model performance under semi arid conditions compared to sub humid climatic conditions kjærsgaard et al 2009 irmak et al 2010 reported a good correlation between r n and r n e with the r 2 value of 0 93 and the rmse value of 1 44 mj m 2 under sub humid climatic conditions of nebraska carmona et al 2017 reported the rmse value of 1 90 mj m 2 and the mbe value of 1 64 mj m 2 under mild and humid climatic conditions of tandil city in argentina 4 2 2 performance of the proposed model idso jackson model eq 16 the relationship between r n and r n e predicted from the proposed model eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the idso and jackson 1969 equation was very good at all five sites with r 2 values greater than 0 90 and c values less than 1 97 mj m 2 the rmse values ranged from 1 09 to 2 27 mj m 2 with mbe values ranging from 0 65 to 1 16 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model estimates r n very well at all sites the d values greater than 0 97 indicated strong similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites 4 2 3 performance of the proposed model brutsaert model eq 17 the relationship between measurements of r n and r n e predicted from the proposed model eq 17 which estimates ε 0 using brutsaert 1975 equation was reasonable at all five sites with r 2 values greater than 0 82 and c values less than 3 63 mj m 2 the rmse values ranging from 3 34 to 5 27 mj m 2 with mbe values ranged from 1 97 to 4 73 mj m 2 indicating that the proposed model often over estimated r n at all sites the d values greater than 0 86 indicated reasonable similarities between r n and r n e fluxes at all sites 4 3 overall discussion the results showed that the proposed model eq 16 performed better than eq 17 and the fao56 r n model eq 18 at all sites except at the wetland of mfabeni mire where the fao56 r n model outperformed all the proposed new models discrepancies at mfabeni mire wetland could be attributed to significant r s absorbed by water than expected as a result of the lower reflection coefficient of water compared to the vegetation brutsaert 2013 a good agreement was obtained between daily r n and r n e predicted by the fao56 r n model at all five sites the results confirm the validity of the fao56 r n model under the climatic conditions of southern africa the observed differences between r n e from fao56 r n and r n may be attributed to the poor estimation of l d as a result of using coefficients proposed by allen et al 1998 without site specific calibrations at our sites these findings were consistent with previous studies which reported that the coefficients used in the fao56 r n model require site specific calibrations to attain more accurate of r n estimates e g kjaersgaard et al 2007 sabziparvar and mirgaloybayat 2015 carmona et al 2017 therefore this study confirmed the need for site specific calibrations of coefficients in the fao56 r n model for accurate r n estimates as also noted by carmona et al 2017 the results also showed that eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the empirical idso and jackson 1969 equation outperformed eq 17 which estimates ε 0 using a physically based brutsaert s 1975 equation at all sites regardless of the similarity of the equations utilised in these proposed two models which only varied in the procedures used to calculate ε 0 there were significant differences between their r n e the observed relatively poorer performance of eq 17 may be attributed to the poor estimation of l d as a result of using a default empirical coefficient of 1 24 in brutsaert s equation which could have lacked the validity under the agro climatic conditions of southern africa previous studies have demonstrated the need for site specific calibration of brutsaert s coefficient which varies with climatic and land cover conditions to attain best r n e carmona et al 2014 cheng and nnadi 2014 lópez olivari et al 2015 for example culf and gash 1993 found that a brutsaert s coefficient of 1 31 was suitable to attain the best estimates of l d under the climatic conditions of niger in west africa kjaersgaard et al 2007 suggested that at least 5 years of good quality profile data is needed to obtain stable site specific calibration of brutsaert s coefficient however the lack of long term quality radiative fluxes and profile measurements of e a i r and t a i r in the developing countries often hinders the site specific calibrations of coefficients used in the r n models cheng and nnadi 2014 these findings confirmed the need for site specific calibrations of brutsaert s coefficient to attain best r n e which limits its applicability in southern africa where long term profile measurements of e a i r and t a i r are lacking our findings do not coincide with the previous study by carmona et al 2017 which concluded that estimating ε 0 using brutsaert s 1975 equation is not confined to a specific climate regime in contrast our findings suggested that eq 16 which estimates ε 0 using the idso and jackson 1969 equation is the most promising alternative and appropriate to estimate r n in the fao 56 pm equation in southern africa without any site specific calibrations this proposed model eq 16 only requires daily measurements of r s t m a x t m i n as meteorological data inputs whilst eq 17 requires additional measurements of r h m i n and r h m a x for estimation of e a i r according to kjaersgaard et al 2007 the accuracy of r n e depends on the quality of the input dataset therefore models that estimate r n from minimum meteorological inputs are recommended to reduce levels of uncertainties associated with quality of the input dataset these results suggested the suitability of the proposed model eq 16 to estimate r n with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations therefore the findings of this study suggested that the proposed model eq 16 could be used in the fao 56 pm equation for accurate estimation of crop water requirements in this region the findings of this study indicated that the performance of the r n models depends on the method used to compute ε 0 and is site specific because these models were developed from certain specific climatic conditions consequently their performances are affected by the local agro climatic conditions and are likely to give reliable estimates under similar conditions from which they were developed therefore it is recommended that r n model should be selected according to the climatic conditions of the site of interest for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirements in data scarce regions 5 conclusions accurate quantification of r n is of paramount importance for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration e t 0 rate which is used to estimate crop water use net radiation fluxes are measured using expensive net radiometers that require continuous calibration and maintenance to attain accurate measurements consequently r n measurements are not readily available from standard weather stations in developing countries in particular therefore the assessment of different models relative to in situ measurements of r n is critical to identify the most accurate and robust alternative approach that could be reliably used to estimate r n with minimal data input and without any site specific calibrations in data scarce regions such as southern africa in this study two new r n models which differ only in the procedures used to compute atmospheric emissivity were proposed two new r n models and a widely recommended fao56 r n model were evaluated using daily r n measurements acquired from five sites which represent different climatic and land cover conditions of southern africa this study showed that r n can be estimated well from standard weather station data using the fao56 r n model and the two proposed models in this region the results also revealed that the proposed new model that computes ε 0 from t a i r only performed better than all the evaluated models at four sites except at mfabeni mire where the fao56 r n model outperformed all the proposed new models discrepancies at mfabeni mire wetland were attributed to significant r s absorbed by water than expected these findings suggest that the proposed model presented here is the most promising alternative and appropriate to estimate r n in the fao 56 pm equation with minimum input data in southern africa without any site specific calibrations however estimates of r n from this proposed model still need to be tested for suitability against in situ measurements of r n under all different climatic conditions of this region for extended periods before the model could be utilised with confidence the lack of a long term record of r n and e t 0 data across all different agro climatic zones of this region hindered the evaluation of these r n models and to investigate whether this improvement in r n estimation from the proposed model has any significant improvements in e t 0 estimation therefore the need for accurate and continuous radiative fluxes and e t 0 data across all different agro climatic zones of this region is indisputable the findings of this study also indicated that the performance of the r n models depends on the method used to compute ε 0 and therefore it is recommended that r n model should be selected according to the climatic conditions of the site of interest for reliable estimates of r n for improved estimation of crop water requirement in data scarce regions acknowledgments

10777,cotton producers on the southern high plains of texas face reduced seasonal irrigation capacities as groundwater resources from the ogallala aquifer decline technological advancements have allowed producers to achieve maximal water use efficiencies 95 however new management strategies are necessary to sustain producer profitability by determining the optimal timing of irrigation producers may be able to conserve irrigation water and reduce their pumping expenses in a field experiment conduced from 2010 to 2013 cotton gossypium hirsutum l lint yield and profitability were compared across 27 irrigation treatments using a lepa irrigation system on pullman clay olton soils irrigation was applied during three growing periods determined by growing degree days gdd15 6 where p1 emergence to 525 gdd15 6 p2 525 750 gdd15 6 and p3 750 gdd15 6 treatments for the experiment included three irrigation capacities of 0 3 2 and 6 4 mm d 1 in a randomized block design with three replications profitability was assessed by calculating gross margin from economic budgets that included the management operations from each year on average treatments with an irrigation capacity of 0 mm d 1 in p1 made 6 less yield but saved 30 more water and generated the same profitability as the ic treatments of 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation during p3 at the 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation capacity ic was the most critical for yield potential generating 114 more yield than the 0 mm d 1 ic and 27 more than the 3 2 mm d 1 ic treatments resulting in a 468 and 110 increase in profit respectively keywords profitability lepa cotton irrigation capacity timing 1 introduction increasing drought coupled with declining nonrenewable water levels threaten the economic viability of irrigated agriculture in the ogallala aquifer region of the southern texas high plains thp the ogallala aquifer region of texas constitutes over 36 000 sq mi2 that covers 48 counties spanning the texas panhandle to just north of the midland odessa area mcguire 2007 twdb 2011 agriculture contributes approximately 7 billion annually in economic activity to the thp economy producing 25 of u s cotton production climate models indicate potential increases in average temperatures and the frequency duration and intensity of extreme events making this region a hotspot for severe water stress kloesel et al 2018 during 2011 scorching temperatures coupled with record low precipitation resulted in the worst drought the thp has seen since the 1930 s the variability of this semi arid climate has increased the dependence for water resources leading to the beginning of a transitional period from irrigated to rainfed agriculture with the decline in irrigation capacities producers are unable to meet crop water demand resulting in reduced yield potential and profitability araya et al 2019 deficit irrigation is an adaptive solution to declining saturated thickness making the timing and amount of irrigation crucial to maximize cotton boll development himanshu et al 2019 ritchie et al 2009 sharma et al 2015 and schaefer et al 2018 found irrigation can be strategically applied during different crop growth stages to optimize water availability however researchers do not agree on which cotton growth stage is the most sensitive to irrigation snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 buttar et al 2007 orgaz et al 1992 a variety of best management practices are being adopted by producers to reduce yield loss and maintain profitability pre plant irrigation has been a common strategy used by producers to build moisture in the soil profile to bank water in times of stress but this can often result in inefficient use of water resources ranging from 45 to 70 water loss due to the high winds and temperatures characteristic of the region mahan et al 2012 bordovsky and porter 2003 compounding these challenges are water management policies and institutions that have hindered adaptation to declining groundwater levels texas groundwater law is uniquely governed by a modified rule of capture which contributes to overexploitation of the aquifer desired future conditions dfcs were established by the groundwater management districts to address how the aquifer will be managed mace et al 2008 to meet the dfcs the high plains underground water conservation district adopted a 50 50 policy such that 50 of current water in the ogallala aquifer would remain in 50 years this is enforced by restricting the amount of water applied for irrigation to an allowable production rate of 1 50 ac ft per contiguous ac or 18 in per year high plains water district hpwd 2015 many producers in the region already face pumping capacities below this limit and the number of irrigated acres facing such natural restrictions is increasing the objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of irrigation timing on the yield and economic profitability of cotton production using various irrigation capacities in the southern high plains of texas to improve irrigation management strategies in the face of declining water resources 2 methods 2 1 study area this study utilizes results from cotton irrigation

from a pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustolls to an olton loam fine mixed superactive thermic aridic paleustolls usda nrcs 2014 the climate of this region is characterized as semi arid with hot and dry summers and cold winters the average annual rainfall is 444 mm and average in season rainfall of 280 mm occurring 1 may to 20 september during this study high rainfall was received in 2010 with low and ineffective rainfall in 2011 and 2012 and near average rainfall in 2013 2 2 irrigation experiments irrigation treatments were applied within three periods during the growing season p1 p2 p3 for daily maximum irrigation capacities ic of 0 mm d 1 low 3 2 mm d 1 medium and 6 4 mm d 1 high the periods were defined by growing degree day gdd

irrigation of 0 mm d 1 in all three periods and llm resulted in 0 mm d 1 in periods one and two and 3 2 mm day in period three if a rain event occurred irrigation was reduced or terminated if the water profile was above the specified target for that day table 1 describes the maximum irrigation capacities during the three growing periods for each of the 27 irrigation treatments this study was designed as a randomized complete block with a nested factorial treatment arrangement having three replicates in a 3 8 ha test area a four span center pivot system delivered water using the lepa irrigation method a variable rate irrigation vri controller 7000 vri farmscan ag pty ltd toowooma australia was used to create in field changes in irrigation amounts based on each treatment and location within the field the vri system and installation was completed prior to the start of the 2010 field experiment and continued through the 2013 growing season the treatment locations were left unchanged over the four year field experiment fig 1 2 3 economic analysis an economic analysis was conducted to assess the profitability of each irrigation treatment using the management practices described in table 2 which follow the commonly accepted guidelines for the region economic budgets were created by calculating crop revenue and expenses total crop revenue was calculated using the yield at harvest multiplied by the 2010 2013 average price for lint and cottonseed of 0 34 kg and 240 ton respectively nass 2010 2013 prices were held constant to make consistent comparisons across years due to a lack of spatial and temporal changes in fixed costs the cost of production was calculated using only variable expenses variable costs were defined by pre harvest and harvest expenses total pre harvest expenses included planting seed tillage herbicides growth regulators and fertilizers fibermax 9680 b2rf cotton was planted in may of each year at 115 000 138 000 seed ha 1 tillage practices included shredding and pulling stalks tandem disk ripper field cultivator listing paratill rolling cultivators rotary hoe and furrow diking prices for each tillage activity was averaged from the 2011 and 2013 texas a m custom rate survey klose 2011 2013 chemical and fertilizer prices were used from the texas alliance for water conservation budgets tawc 2010 2011 2012 2013 fertilizer expenses varied according to the irrigation amounts and the growth regulators were only used in the high irrigation treatments harvest expenses included the use of harvest aids stripping ginning bagging and tying the economic value and cost of production varied with each irrigation treatment due to the differences in yield and pumping cost fig 2 gross margin was used as the measure of profitability and was calculated as 1 g m i t e v i t v e i t where e v i t is the economic value of the cotton lint and seed for each of the 27 irrigation treatments across each year of the study and v e i t are the variable expenses incurred from the management operations that were unique to each crop year table 2 an assessment of the economic productivity of the applied irrigation will determine the per ha 1 profitability of the volume of irrigation water applied this is calculated as 2 e w p i t g m i t a i i t where e w p i t is the economic water productivity for each irrigation treatment across all years in the study g m i t is the gross margin calculated in eq 1 and a i i t is the water applied during each irrigation treatment 3 results 3 1 environmental and crop conditions 3 1 1 rainfall and irrigation the growing conditions of the four year study were highly varied the 2010 crop year was a wet year with annual rainfall of 557 mm exceeding the long term averages at the halfway experiment station with more than double the amount of monthly rainfall from january to april and july in season rainfall received was 161 mm from may through september temperatures in 2010 followed closely with the long term average the 2011 growing season was plagued by hot and dry weather with annual rainfall of 137 mm with only 23 mm occurring through the growing season temperatures were well above the long term average another dry year occurred in 2012 with temperatures slightly higher than the long term average in 2012 annual rainfall returned closer to the long term average at 348 mm but only 40 mm was received during the growing season the 2013 growing season was more representative of average weather and rainfall for the region rainfall was still below the long term average but it was received at the right time from june to september for graphical representation of monthly rainfall and daily high air temperature see figure 4 of bordovsky et al 2015 in season irrigation was initiated after planting with varied dates from year to year because of differences in planting dates and rainfall amounts on average irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm to 359 mm with 151 mm applied across the l treatments 216 mm across the m treatments and 261 mm across the h treatments in 2010 the irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm in the lll scenario to 232 mm in the hhh scenario and from 0 to 446 mm in 2011 0 369 mm in 2012 and 0 359 in 2013 3 1 2 yield cotton yield results are shown in tables 4 and 5 mean lint yield for each year was 1424 in 2010 374 in 2011 491 in 2012 and 1245 kg ha 1 in 2013 the highest average yields occurred in 2010 with yields ranging from 960 kg ha 1in the mll and hll treatments to 1820 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment the lowest average yields of this study was reported in 2011 with a range of 40 in the lll treatment to 1020 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment lint yields in 2012 were also low with yields ranging from 20 kg ha 1in the lll to 1250 in the mhh treatment in 2013 yields ranged from 560 in the lll and mll treatments to 1900 kg ha 1 in the mmh treatment table 4 averages across years of all 27 experiments ranged from 408 kg ha 1 in the lll treatment 0 mm irrigation to 1480 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment 337 mm irrigation the hhh treatment had the highest irrigation amount of 359 mm and generated a yield of 1410 kg ha 1 which was 5 less yield than the mhh treatment eliminating p1 irrigation l resulted in 30 and 42 less water applied compared to the m and h treatments and 6 and a 10 decline in yield respectively the lmm and mmm treatments generated the same average yield but lmm resulted in 30 less water applied the lhh used 20 less irrigation than the hhh but only had a decline in yield of 2 in 2010 the average l treatments yielded 19 kg ha more than m and 8 kg ha less than the h in 2011 the drought year eliminating the p1 irrigation l treatments had a 19 and 27 decline in yield from the average m and h treatments respectively in an average production year like 2013 eliminating p1 irrigation had a 7 and 13 decline in yield regardless of the year or the p1 and p2 irrigation amounts h irrigation in p3 produced the highest amount of cotton yield comparing the lmm to the mmm treatments in 2011 yield was 470 and 450 kg ha 1 and 1300 and 1330 kg ha 1 respectively in 2013 in the higher ic treatments yields in the lhh to mhh to hhh in 2011 were 760 1020 and 990 kg ha 1 respectively in 2013 the high ic treatments were 1810 1830 and 1750 kg ha 1 across all years the mhh treatments outperformed the hhh and the differences between lhh and hhh were 20 kg ha 1 less in 2010 230 kg ha 1 less in 2011 70 kg ha 1 more in 2012 and 60 kg ha 1 more in 2013 results from from a statistical analysis of irrigation period effects on cotton lint yield siwue and loan value during each year of the experiments is reported in bordovsky et al 2015 3 2 economic results table 6 presents the revenue variable cost and gross margin for each of the 27 irrigation treatments from 2010 to 2013 gross margin in 2010 all exceeded 100 ha 1in this wet year the rainfed treatment lll performed better than the hll hml mll mhl and mml treatments the mhh lhh and hhh treatments generated the greatest revenue and had the greatest profit due to the intensity of the 2011 drought and the significant reduction in crop yield all treatments had negative gross margin except for mhh and hhh in 2012 11 of the 27 treatments had positive gross margin with the lhh mhh and hhh treatments generating the highest profit in 2013 the lll mll and hll treatments had negative profitability the highest yielding treatments mostly achieved the highest gross margin although there were minimal differences between the profitability of h and m ic during the first and second growing periods in the third irrigation period h irrigation capacity treatments made 85 more profit than m treatments the mhh hhh and lhh treatments were the most profitable in 2011 and mmh lmh and mhh were the most profitable in 2013 eliminating the p1 irrigation had a 32 13 and 47 18 reduction in variable cost compared to the m and h ic treatments in 2011 the water applied in the m and h ic treatments were 90 and 160 mm more than the l ic in 2013 there was a 13 4 and 40 12 reduction in variable cost compared to the m and h ic treatments respectively where the irrigation water applied was 72 and 133 mm more than the l ic the lll treatment had a yield of 40 and 560 kg ha 1 table 5 in 2011 and 2013 respectively the h irrigation treatments in p3 had the greatest yield response and generated the most revenue but also lead to the most variable cost due to pumping which impacted profitability across the average l m and h ic lmh and lhh mhh and mmh and hmh and hhh generated the highest gross margin respectively the h treatments had the highest revenue highest variable cost and lowest gross margin profitability was comparable between the lmh and lhh and mhh and mmh treatments economic productivity of the applied irrigation is shown in table 7 results for the lll treatment were left blank since no water was applied the economic productivity of water in 2010 was very high compared to the other years in the study on average the l capacity treatments had the highest return on water applied in 2010 the mll llm and lml treatments had the highest value of water the 2011 and 2012 crop years were very low due to increased irrigation and poor yields in 2013 the lmh mmh and lmm and lhh generated the most return per mm of water used 4 discussion 4 1 impact of reduced irrigation in the early growing season in the face of water use restrictions or expected decline in yield due to drought forgoing irrigation during the first growth stage can help reduce water use and mitigate expenses on average treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated only 6 and 10 less yield than medium to high irrigation and used 30 and 42 less water respectively tables 3 and 5 medium capacity irrigations m of 3 2 mm d 1 generated 2 more profit than capacity irrigations of 0 mm d 1 but the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 was 28 less tables 6 and 7 high capacity irrigation h of 6 4 mm d 1 generated 29 less profit than capacity irrigations of 0 mm d 1 and 55 less return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 although the high irrigation capacities generated the most yield the cost of pumping increased variables expenses the mhh treatment generated the highest yield across all treatments of 1480 kg ha 1 on average followed by 1410 kg ha 1 in the hhh treatment and 1380 kg ha 1 in the lhh treatment table 5 water use was 337 359 and 286 mm ha 1 respectively table 3 the gross margin generated for the mhh hhh and lhh was 174 144 and 165 ha 1 tables 6 treatments that generated the highest return per mm of water applied were lhh 0 58 lmh 0 55 mhh 0 52 and hhh 0 40 table 7 forgoing irrigation in the first growing period only resulted in a profit loss of 9 per ha 1 and used 51 mm less water tables 6 and 3 in a wet year like 2010 yield water use and profitability were less variable treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated average yields of 19 kg ha 1 more than the medium capacity irrigations and 8 kg ha 1 less than the high capacity irrigations using 122 146 and 165 mm per ha 1 of water applied respectively tables 3 and 5 average profitability per ha was 215 08 206 23 and 207 23 and return based on water applied was 1 80 1 59 and 1 32 for the l m and h capacity treatments respectively tables 6 and 7 the mhh treatment achieved the highest gross margin followed by the lhh and hhh the lmh and llh treatments were very comparable table 6 in a drought year such as 2011 treatments with no irrigation l from gdd15 6 525 generated 18 5 and 27 less yield on average than medium m to high h irrigation capacities and used 36 and 50 less water respectively tables 3 and 5 profitability across the l m and h capacities was 112 31 120 72 and 121 31 per ha 1 with returns per mm of 0 87 0 69 and 0 47 tables 6 and 7 respectively only the mhh and hhh treatments had positive gross margin in 2013 an average production year treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated average yields of 7 and 13 less yield than the medium and high capacity irrigations using 30 and 44 less irrigation water respectively tables 3 and 5 the loss of irrigation in 2013 during the first part of the growing season resulted in a 15 decline in profitability compared to the average across all medium irrigation capacity treatments of 3 2 mm d 1 table 6 there was a 4 per ha difference in the average profit between the medium and high irrigation capacity treatments the mmh lmh and mhh treatments generated the highest gross margin table 6 4 2 impact of increased irrigation later in the growing season irrigation in the last growing stage where gdd15 6 750 generated far more profit potential than irrigation in the first stage with irrigation of m to h in period 2 this implies that irrigations can be delayed until it is needed in the future rather than trying to bank water in the soil profile during pre season irrigation on average treatments with high amounts of irrigation h after gdd15 6 750 generated 114 and 27 more yield than low 0 mm d 1 and medium 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation capacities and used 122 and 29 more water respectively tables 3 and 5 low capacity irrigations l of 0 mm d 1 generated 127 less profit than capacity irrigations of 6 4 mm d 1 and a 151 decrease on the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 medium capacity irrigations m of 3 2 mm d 1 generated 127 less profit than capacity irrigations of 6 4 mm d 1 and a 43 decline on the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 during 2010 the average l m and h irrigation capacities had yields of 1041 1517 and 1713 kg ha 1 and used 78 154 and 200 mm ha 1 respectively tables 3 and 5 gross margin was 119 96 232 43 and 276 15 per ha 1 table 6 across the h capacity irrigations the mhh treatment had the highest gross margin of 302 93 with a 1 42 per mm return on water applied tables 6 and 7 the llh treatment had comparable gross margins of 261 48 and generated the most return on water applied of 1 79 per mm tables 6 and 7 in 2013 there was a 191 82 difference between the h and l irrigation capacitates and a 92 67 difference between the h and m treatments table 6 5 conclusions this four year

10777,cotton producers on the southern high plains of texas face reduced seasonal irrigation capacities as groundwater resources from the ogallala aquifer decline technological advancements have allowed producers to achieve maximal water use efficiencies 95 however new management strategies are necessary to sustain producer profitability by determining the optimal timing of irrigation producers may be able to conserve irrigation water and reduce their pumping expenses in a field experiment conduced from 2010 to 2013 cotton gossypium hirsutum l lint yield and profitability were compared across 27 irrigation treatments using a lepa irrigation system on pullman clay olton soils irrigation was applied during three growing periods determined by growing degree days gdd15 6 where p1 emergence to 525 gdd15 6 p2 525 750 gdd15 6 and p3 750 gdd15 6 treatments for the experiment included three irrigation capacities of 0 3 2 and 6 4 mm d 1 in a randomized block design with three replications profitability was assessed by calculating gross margin from economic budgets that included the management operations from each year on average treatments with an irrigation capacity of 0 mm d 1 in p1 made 6 less yield but saved 30 more water and generated the same profitability as the ic treatments of 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation during p3 at the 6 4 mm d 1 irrigation capacity ic was the most critical for yield potential generating 114 more yield than the 0 mm d 1 ic and 27 more than the 3 2 mm d 1 ic treatments resulting in a 468 and 110 increase in profit respectively keywords profitability lepa cotton irrigation capacity timing 1 introduction increasing drought coupled with declining nonrenewable water levels threaten the economic viability of irrigated agriculture in the ogallala aquifer region of the southern texas high plains thp the ogallala aquifer region of texas constitutes over 36 000 sq mi2 that covers 48 counties spanning the texas panhandle to just north of the midland odessa area mcguire 2007 twdb 2011 agriculture contributes approximately 7 billion annually in economic activity to the thp economy producing 25 of u s cotton production climate models indicate potential increases in average temperatures and the frequency duration and intensity of extreme events making this region a hotspot for severe water stress kloesel et al 2018 during 2011 scorching temperatures coupled with record low precipitation resulted in the worst drought the thp has seen since the 1930 s the variability of this semi arid climate has increased the dependence for water resources leading to the beginning of a transitional period from irrigated to rainfed agriculture with the decline in irrigation capacities producers are unable to meet crop water demand resulting in reduced yield potential and profitability araya et al 2019 deficit irrigation is an adaptive solution to declining saturated thickness making the timing and amount of irrigation crucial to maximize cotton boll development himanshu et al 2019 ritchie et al 2009 sharma et al 2015 and schaefer et al 2018 found irrigation can be strategically applied during different crop growth stages to optimize water availability however researchers do not agree on which cotton growth stage is the most sensitive to irrigation snowden et al 2014 bordovsky et al 2015 buttar et al 2007 orgaz et al 1992 a variety of best management practices are being adopted by producers to reduce yield loss and maintain profitability pre plant irrigation has been a common strategy used by producers to build moisture in the soil profile to bank water in times of stress but this can often result in inefficient use of water resources ranging from 45 to 70 water loss due to the high winds and temperatures characteristic of the region mahan et al 2012 bordovsky and porter 2003 compounding these challenges are water management policies and institutions that have hindered adaptation to declining groundwater levels texas groundwater law is uniquely governed by a modified rule of capture which contributes to overexploitation of the aquifer desired future conditions dfcs were established by the groundwater management districts to address how the aquifer will be managed mace et al 2008 to meet the dfcs the high plains underground water conservation district adopted a 50 50 policy such that 50 of current water in the ogallala aquifer would remain in 50 years this is enforced by restricting the amount of water applied for irrigation to an allowable production rate of 1 50 ac ft per contiguous ac or 18 in per year high plains water district hpwd 2015 many producers in the region already face pumping capacities below this limit and the number of irrigated acres facing such natural restrictions is increasing the objective of this paper is to evaluate the impact of irrigation timing on the yield and economic profitability of cotton production using various irrigation capacities in the southern high plains of texas to improve irrigation management strategies in the face of declining water resources 2 methods 2 1 study area this study utilizes results from cotton irrigation

characterized as semi arid with hot and dry summers and cold winters the average annual rainfall is 444 mm and average in season rainfall of 280 mm occurring 1 may to 20 september during this study high rainfall was received in 2010 with low and ineffective rainfall in 2011 and 2012 and near average rainfall in 2013 2 2 irrigation experiments irrigation treatments were applied within three

irrigation of 0 mm d 1 in all three periods and llm resulted in 0 mm d 1 in periods one and two and 3 2 mm day in period three if a rain event occurred irrigation was reduced or terminated if the water profile was above the specified target for that day table 1 describes the maximum irrigation capacities during the three growing periods for each of the 27 irrigation treatments this study was designed as a randomized complete block with a nested factorial treatment arrangement having three replicates in a 3 8 ha test area a four span center pivot system delivered water using the lepa irrigation method a variable rate irrigation vri controller 7000 vri farmscan ag pty ltd toowooma australia was used to create in field changes in irrigation amounts based on each treatment and location within the field the vri system and installation was completed prior to the start of the 2010 field experiment and continued through the 2013 growing season the treatment locations were left unchanged over the four year field experiment fig 1 2 3 economic analysis an economic analysis was conducted to assess the profitability of each irrigation treatment using the management practices described in table 2 which follow the commonly accepted guidelines for the region economic budgets were created by calculating crop revenue and expenses total crop revenue was calculated using the yield at harvest multiplied by the 2010 2013 average price for lint and cottonseed of 0 34 kg and 240 ton respectively nass 2010 2013 prices were held constant to make consistent comparisons across years due to a lack of spatial and temporal changes in fixed costs the cost of production was calculated using only variable expenses variable costs were defined by pre harvest and harvest expenses total pre harvest expenses included planting seed tillage herbicides growth regulators and fertilizers fibermax 9680 b2rf cotton was planted in may of each year at 115 000 138 000 seed ha 1 tillage practices included shredding and pulling stalks tandem disk ripper field cultivator listing paratill rolling cultivators rotary hoe and furrow diking prices for each tillage activity was averaged from

expenses varied according to the irrigation amounts and the growth regulators were only used in the high irrigation treatments harvest expenses included the use of harvest aids stripping ginning bagging and tying the economic value and cost of production varied with each irrigation treatment due to the differences in yield and pumping cost fig 2 gross margin was used as the measure of profitability and was calculated as 1 g m i t e v i t v e i t where e v i t is the economic value of the cotton lint and seed for each of the 27 irrigation treatments across each year of the study and v e i t are the variable expenses incurred from the management operations that were unique to each crop year table 2 an assessment of the economic productivity of the applied irrigation will determine the per ha 1 profitability of the volume of irrigation water applied this is calculated as 2 e w p i t g m i t a i i t where e w p i t is the economic water productivity for each irrigation treatment across all years in the study g m i t is the gross margin calculated in eq 1 and a i i t is the water applied during each irrigation treatment 3 results 3 1 environmental and crop conditions 3 1 1 rainfall and irrigation the growing conditions of the four year study were highly varied the 2010 crop year was a wet year with annual rainfall of 557 mm exceeding the long term averages at the halfway experiment station with more than double the amount of monthly rainfall from january to april and july in season rainfall received was 161 mm from may through september temperatures in 2010 followed closely with the long term average the 2011 growing season was plagued by hot and dry weather with annual rainfall of 137 mm with only 23 mm occurring through the growing season temperatures were well above the long term average another dry year occurred in 2012 with temperatures slightly higher than the long term average in 2012 annual rainfall returned closer to the long term average at 348 mm but only 40 mm was received during the growing season the 2013 growing season was more representative of average weather and rainfall for the region rainfall was still below the long term average but it was received at the right time from june to september for graphical representation of monthly rainfall and daily high air temperature see figure 4 of bordovsky et al 2015 in season irrigation was initiated after planting with varied dates from year to year because of differences in planting dates and rainfall amounts on average irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm to 359 mm with 151 mm applied across the l treatments 216 mm across the m treatments and 261 mm across the h treatments in 2010 the irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm in the lll scenario to 232 mm in the hhh scenario and from 0 to 446 mm in 2011 0 369 mm in 2012 and 0 359 in 2013 3 1 2 yield cotton yield results are shown in tables 4 and 5 mean lint yield for each year was 1424 in 2010 374 in 2011 491 in 2012 and 1245 kg ha 1 in 2013 the highest average yields occurred in 2010 with yields ranging from 960 kg ha 1in the mll and hll treatments to 1820 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment the lowest average yields of this study was reported in 2011 with a range of 40 in the lll treatment to 1020 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment lint yields in 2012 were also low with yields ranging from 20 kg ha 1in the lll to 1250 in the mhh treatment in 2013 yields ranged from 560 in the lll and mll treatments to 1900 kg ha 1 in the mmh treatment table 4 averages across years of all 27 experiments ranged from 408 kg ha 1 in the lll treatment 0 mm irrigation to 1480 kg ha 1 in the mhh treatment 337 mm irrigation the hhh treatment had the highest irrigation amount of 359 mm and generated a yield of 1410 kg ha 1 which was 5 less yield than the mhh treatment eliminating p1 irrigation l resulted in 30 and 42 less water applied compared to the m and h treatments and 6 and a 10 decline in yield respectively the lmm and mmm treatments generated the same average yield but lmm resulted in 30 less water applied the lhh used 20 less irrigation than the hhh but only had a decline in yield of 2 in 2010 the average l treatments yielded 19 kg ha more than m and 8 kg ha less than the h in 2011 the drought year eliminating the p1 irrigation l treatments had a 19 and 27 decline in yield from the average m and h treatments respectively in an average production year like 2013 eliminating p1 irrigation had a 7 and 13 decline in yield regardless of the year or the p1 and p2 irrigation amounts h irrigation in p3 produced the highest amount of cotton yield comparing the lmm to the mmm treatments in 2011 yield was 470 and 450 kg ha 1 and 1300 and 1330 kg ha 1 respectively in 2013 in the higher ic treatments yields in the lhh to mhh to hhh in 2011 were 760 1020 and 990 kg ha 1 respectively in 2013 the high ic treatments were 1810 1830 and 1750 kg ha 1 across all years the mhh treatments outperformed the hhh and the differences between lhh and hhh were 20 kg ha 1 less in 2010 230 kg ha 1 less in 2011 70 kg ha 1 more in 2012 and 60 kg ha 1 more in 2013 results from from a statistical analysis of irrigation period effects on cotton lint yield siwue and loan value during each year of the experiments is reported in bordovsky et al 2015 3 2 economic results table 6 presents the revenue variable cost and gross margin for each of the 27 irrigation treatments from 2010 to 2013 gross margin in 2010 all exceeded 100 ha 1in this wet year the rainfed treatment lll performed better than the hll hml mll mhl and mml treatments the mhh lhh and hhh treatments generated the greatest revenue and had the greatest profit due to the intensity of the 2011 drought and the significant reduction in crop yield all treatments had negative gross margin except for mhh and hhh in 2012 11 of the 27 treatments had positive gross margin with the lhh mhh and hhh treatments generating the highest profit in 2013 the lll mll and hll treatments had negative profitability the highest yielding treatments mostly achieved the highest gross margin although there were minimal differences between the profitability of h and m ic during the first and second growing periods in the third irrigation period h irrigation capacity treatments made 85 more profit than m treatments the mhh hhh and lhh treatments were the most profitable in 2011 and mmh lmh and mhh were the most profitable in 2013 eliminating the p1 irrigation had a 32 13 and 47 18 reduction in variable cost compared to the m and h ic treatments in 2011 the water applied in the m and h ic treatments were 90 and 160 mm more than the l ic in 2013 there was a 13 4 and 40 12 reduction in variable cost compared to the m and h ic treatments respectively where the irrigation water applied was 72 and 133 mm more than the l ic the lll treatment had a yield of 40 and 560 kg ha 1 table 5 in 2011 and 2013 respectively the h irrigation treatments in p3 had the greatest yield response and generated the most revenue but also lead to the most variable cost due to pumping which impacted profitability across the average l m and h ic lmh and lhh mhh and mmh and hmh and hhh generated the highest gross margin respectively the h treatments had the highest revenue highest variable cost and lowest gross margin profitability was comparable between the lmh and lhh and mhh and mmh treatments economic productivity of the applied irrigation is shown in table 7 results for the lll treatment were left blank since no water was applied the economic productivity of water in 2010 was very high compared to the other years in the study on average the l capacity treatments had the highest return on water applied in 2010 the mll llm and lml treatments had the highest value of water the 2011 and 2012 crop years were very low due to increased irrigation and poor yields in 2013 the lmh mmh and lmm and lhh generated the most return per mm of water used 4 discussion 4 1 impact of reduced irrigation in the early growing season in the face of water use restrictions or expected decline in yield due to drought forgoing irrigation during the first growth stage can help reduce water use and mitigate expenses on average treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated only 6 and 10 less yield than medium to high irrigation and used 30 and 42 less water respectively tables 3 and 5 medium capacity irrigations m of 3 2 mm d 1 generated 2 more profit than capacity irrigations of 0 mm d 1 but the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 was 28 less tables 6 and 7 high capacity irrigation h of 6 4 mm d 1 generated 29 less profit than capacity irrigations of 0 mm d 1 and 55 less return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 although the high irrigation capacities generated the most yield the cost of pumping increased variables expenses the mhh treatment generated the highest yield across all treatments of 1480 kg ha 1 on average followed by 1410 kg ha 1 in the hhh treatment and 1380 kg ha 1 in the lhh treatment table 5 water use was 337 359 and 286 mm ha 1 respectively table 3 the gross margin generated for the mhh hhh and lhh was 174 144 and 165 ha 1 tables 6 treatments that generated the highest return per mm of water applied were lhh 0 58 lmh 0 55 mhh 0 52 and hhh 0 40 table 7 forgoing irrigation in the first growing period only resulted in a profit loss of 9 per ha 1 and used 51 mm less water tables 6 and 3 in a wet year like 2010 yield water use and profitability were less variable treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated average yields of 19 kg ha 1 more than the medium capacity irrigations and 8 kg ha 1 less than the high capacity irrigations using 122 146 and 165 mm per ha 1 of water applied respectively tables 3 and 5 average profitability per ha was 215 08 206 23 and 207 23 and return based on water applied was 1 80 1 59 and 1 32 for the l m and h capacity treatments respectively tables 6 and 7 the mhh treatment achieved the highest gross margin followed by the lhh and hhh the lmh and llh treatments were very comparable table 6 in a drought year such as 2011 treatments with no irrigation l from gdd15 6 525 generated 18 5 and 27 less yield on average than medium m to high h irrigation capacities and used 36 and 50 less water respectively tables 3 and 5 profitability across the l m and h capacities was 112 31 120 72 and 121 31 per ha 1 with returns per mm of 0 87 0 69 and 0 47 tables 6 and 7 respectively only the mhh and hhh treatments had positive gross margin in 2013 an average production year treatments with no irrigation l from germination to gdd15 6 525 generated average yields of 7 and 13 less yield than the medium and high capacity irrigations using 30 and 44 less irrigation water respectively tables 3 and 5 the loss of irrigation in 2013 during the first part of the growing season resulted in a 15 decline in profitability compared to the average across all medium irrigation capacity treatments of 3 2 mm d 1 table 6 there was a 4 per ha difference in the average profit between the medium and high irrigation capacity treatments the mmh lmh and mhh treatments generated the highest gross margin table 6 4 2 impact of increased irrigation later in the growing season irrigation in the last growing stage where gdd15 6 750 generated far more profit potential than irrigation in the first stage with irrigation of m to h in period 2 this implies that irrigations can be delayed until it is needed in the future rather than trying to bank water in the soil profile during pre season irrigation on average treatments with high amounts of irrigation h after gdd15 6 750 generated 114 and 27 more yield than low 0 mm d 1 and medium 3 2 mm d 1 irrigation capacities and used 122 and 29 more water respectively tables 3 and 5 low capacity irrigations l of 0 mm d 1 generated 127 less profit than capacity irrigations of 6 4 mm d 1 and a 151 decrease on the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 medium capacity irrigations m of 3 2 mm d 1 generated 127 less profit than capacity irrigations of 6 4 mm d 1 and a 43 decline on the return per mm of water applied per ha 1 tables 6 and 7 during 2010 the average l m and h irrigation capacities had yields of 1041 1517 and 1713 kg ha 1 and used 78 154 and 200 mm ha 1 respectively tables 3 and 5 gross margin was 119 96 232 43 and 276 15 per ha 1 table 6 across the h capacity irrigations the mhh treatment had the highest gross margin of 302 93 with a 1 42 per mm return on water applied tables 6 and 7 the llh treatment had comparable gross margins of 261 48 and generated the most return on water applied of 1 79 per mm tables 6 and 7 in 2013 there was a 191 82 difference between the h and l irrigation capacitates and a 92 67 difference between the h and m treatments table 6 5 conclusions this four year experiment analyzed the impact of irrigation timing and capacity on 27 cotton treatments conducted at the texas a m research center in halfway texas using a low energy precision application irrigation system under extreme weather conditions across all years of the study results indicate that early season irrigation that attempted to bank moisture in the soil did not significantly increase yield and decreased profitability however treatments with high irrigation capacities during the crop maturation period achieved the highest yield gross margin and return on water applied on average the high irrigation capacity treatments generated the most revenue and also had the highest variable cost due to increased pumping making it comparable to the gross margin on the medium capacity treatments

10778,the maximum efficiency attainable by surface irrigation in any particular situation is determined largely by the soil infiltration characteristic and the flow rate onto the field performance evaluations have suggested that higher flow rates than those traditionally recommended can lead to increases of about 20 in the application efficiency of bay irrigation across the dairy regions of southern australia however substantially reduced irrigation durations are required to realise these efficiency gains and greater precision is required in the selection and management of these shorter durations in this paper infiltration characteristic curves representative of the predominant cracking and non cracking soils of the region are used in the surface irrigation simulation model sisco for a range of bay lengths and soil moisture deficits to determine i the flow rates required to achieve the maximum efficiency on the bay irrigated soils of southern australia and ii the means for real time estimation of optimum irrigation durations the aim is provision of guidance to irrigators seeking higher efficiency through the use of higher flow rates real time estimation of optimum time to cut off must recognise the substantial variations in infiltration within a soil type and with time due to changes in antecedent moisture content and hence must be adaptive to the conditions prevailing at the time of any irrigation a method for estimating time to cut off previously developed for furrow irrigation is extended to the hydraulically more complex case of bay irrigation the method is based on simple linear relationships between the advance time to a nominated point part way down the field and the time to cut off its application to the management of irrigations is demonstrated using data from multiple irrigations of a single bay under varying soil moisture conditions keywords surface irrigation border check irrigation infiltration simulation application efficiency optimization time to cut off 1 introduction despite the evidence that well designed and managed surface irrigation systems have the potential to deliver high application efficiencies most commercial systems still appear to be operating with significantly lower and highly variable efficiencies the reason for this can be traced to the use of lower than optimal flow rates and more particularly the use of inappropriate times to cut off for example in the australian cotton industry smith et al 2005 have shown that increasing the furrow inflow rates to 6 l s and reducing the time to cut off tco would potentially raise the average application efficiency from the previous low of 50 to an improved 75 more recent evaluations of furrow irrigation performance in that industry montgomery and wigginton 2008 have confirmed that adoption of higher flow rates has led to average application efficiencies in excess of 70 as a result the cotton industry is estimated to have saved 28 5 g l of water per annum and achieved an industry improvement in wue of 10 bda group 2007 selection by farmers of appropriate times to cut off remains problematic and the simulation work by smith et al 2005 suggested that raising efficiency further could only come about by selecting an individual tco for each irrigation that gives optimum performance for the prevailing conditions substantial work toward real time selection of tco has been undertaken with some success by khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 and smith et al 2018 a similar situation prevails in the bay border check irrigated dairy and fodder cropping regions in southern australia a study by the cooperative research centre for irrigation futures smith et al 2009 and gillies et al 2010 demonstrated that significant gains at least 20 in application efficiency were possible in the bay irrigation of pasture and fodder crops again by the simple expedient of doubling flow rates from 0 07 to 0 22 l s m width to 0 24 to 0 44 l s m and reducing irrigation durations for growers seeking federal government funding for on farm efficiency improvements a minimum flow rate of 0 2 ml d m width is now required gbcma et al 2012 based on the above work of smith et al 2009 and gillies et al 2010 no guidance was provided on selection of appropriate tco at these higher flow rates the very much reduced times to cut off required mean that the ability to achieve optimal performance is particularly sensitive to the cut off time for farmers to manage irrigations with these higher flow rates and shorter run times they will require as a minimum very clear and precise guidelines and it typically will necessitate real time estimation of tco more recently smith et al 2016 evaluated the irrigation performance achieved on nine farms employing automation of their irrigated bays all of which used flow rates in excess of the recommended 0 2 ml d m this study showed that with careful selection of cut off times application efficiencies in excess of 90 could be obtained routinely unfortunately some of the farmers were less diligent in their management of cut off times and did not receive the full efficiency gains that are possible through automation in other parts of the world researchers and farmers are wrestling with the same issues relating to management of bay irrigations efforts to reduce water use in the bay irrigation of lucerne alfalfa in california for example saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 have tended to ignore flow rate presumably because of infrastructure limitations and have focussed on reducing tail water by attempting to improve selection of time to cut off the purpose of the present study is to use simulation along with published infiltration and irrigation evaluation data to i determine the flow rates that will provide best performance over the range of soil types across the dairy regions of northern victoria and southern new south wales and ii assess methodologies that will allow adaptive real time estimation of optimal times to cut off 2 study area this study pertains to the southern murray darling basin region of northern victoria and southern new south wales fig 1 the landform is an alluvial plain soils have been formed by floodplain deposition from the murray river and tributary streams that have meandered over the floodplain for millennia soils range from coarse sands deposited adjacent to streams to fine textured cracking clays resulting from deposition of fine material remote from stream channels butler 1950 soil types across the region are as described in skene 1963 skene and freedman 1944 skene and harford 1964 and skene and poutsma 1962 border irrigation of perennial and annual pastures and fodder crops uses approximately 1600 g l of irrigation water annually on over 400 000 ha of irrigated land abs 2008 3 infiltration data a detailed search of the published literature drew 51 infiltration characteristics covering 15 named soil types plus a further 8 characteristics where the soil type was not specified other than in general terms of soil texture these data were originally gathered for a variety of purposes using of various measurement methods ranging from point measurements using ring infiltrometers tisdall 1950 robertson et al 2004 and recirculating infiltrometers turral and malano 1996 to field averages where the irrigation bay was the infiltrometer in this latter group methods included volume balance approaches such as the two point method maheshwari et al 1988 hume 1993 to least squares fitting using hydrodynamic models turral 1996 austin and prendergast 1997 smith et al 2009 gillies et al 2010 only in a very few instances was the soil moisture deficit at the time of the measurement specified in the source publication the source data were reported in a variety of formats to suit the simulation model used in this study the infiltration data were converted to the form of the three parameter modified kostiakov equation 1 i k t a f o τ where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm a and k are fitted parameters fo is the final or steady infiltration rate mm min and τ is the infiltration time min the feature most evident from the infiltration data is the very substantial variation in infiltration within a field within a soil type and between soil types this is supported by the results of selle et al 2011 who showed that the within field and within soil type variation in final infiltration rate were not dissimilar in magnitude averaging infiltration over an irrigated bay as is done by any measurement that uses the bay as the infiltrometer masks some of the within field variation however the within soil type variation means that infiltration cannot be estimated from the soil descriptions provided by the available soil surveys this poses a real challenge for the development of irrigation management guidelines which as a consequence need to be based on objective hydraulic criteria rather than on the basis of soil type the data also suggest that the soils in the region are substantially more permeable than indicated by reports such as those by mehta and wang 2005 and selle et al 2011 based on point measurements of the soil hydraulic properties this has significant implications for irrigation management the potential magnitude of deep percolation losses and accessions to groundwater resulting from over irrigation the other feature evident from the data is that the soils fall clearly into two key groups cracking and non cracking although it should be noted that different occurrences of a particular soil might fall into either group however soil cracking is a readily identifiable characteristic and farmers should have no difficulty in identifying into which group their soils fall in the cracking group of soils the parameter a in the modified kostiakov equation is zero or very small and the k parameter represents the instantaneous initial infiltration or crack fill this in effect reduces the equation to the two parameter linear equation as used in the aim model of austin and prendergast 1997 2 i z c r f o τ where zcr is an instantaneous crack fill mm the crack fill is a function of the soil moisture deficit zreq and for lemnos loam is typically taken to be robertson et al 2004 3 z c r 0 75 z r e q the steady infiltration rate for these soils ranges from 0 to about 5 mm h but is thought to be strongly skewed toward the lower values mehta and wang 2005 it is often simply taken to be 1 mm h e g robertson et al 2004 the published infiltration data compiled in this study are biased toward the cracking group of soils partly because it contains some of the more prevalent soils of the region such as lemnos loam and kerang clay four infiltration curves fig 2 were selected to represent these cracking soils c1 final infiltration rate 1 mm h deficit 40 mm a 0 08 k 0 020 fo 0 0000167 m min c2 final

a 0 08 k 0 032 fo 0 00005 m min in the case of the non cracking soils there is insufficient data to give any understanding of how the infiltration characteristic for a particular soil might vary if at all with deficit hence the strategy used here was to select three infiltration characteristics fig 3 representative of the range of characteristics encountered each of which is based on the published data for a named soil the soils are n1 low permeability based on wanalta loam or similar a 0 4 k 0 0045 fo 0 0 approximately equivalent to a usda 0 15 light clay n2 moderate permeability cobram loam a

optimisation objective for each of the case study soils irrigations were simulated using the sisco hydraulic simulation model gillies and smith 2015 for a range of flow rates and for three bay lengths for each combination of length and flow rate the irrigation was optimised to determine the duration of inflow or time to cut off tco that would give maximum application efficiency ea run off from the end of the bay was set to 5 to ensure that the irrigation always reached the downstream end of the bay this is a small margin and may at times be insufficient compensate for errors in the estimation of parameters such as the manning n the implications of this and the control requirements have been discussed in later sections of the paper for many mostly cracking soil types in the region the deficit is replenished rapidly via the process of crack fill hence the 5 runoff condition also typically ensures that the irrigation is adequate in meeting the requirements of the crop the other usual performance parameters of requirement efficiency er and uniformity were also calculated for each irrigation along with an estimate of the deep percolation loss the optimisation objective used in studies such as this is always subjective individual researchers and growers place different values on the key performance parameters depending on their particular circumstances for example it is not uncommon for the requirement efficiency to be set at 100 meaning complete replenishment of the soil moisture deficit e g feyen and zerihun 1999 such a strategy inevitably results in substantial runoff and deep drainage volumes that reduce application efficiency significantly and arguably is not a valid strategy on the more permeable soils or when water is in short supply as well as reduced application efficiency it also leads to reduced water use efficiency wue this was well illustrated by uniwater 2008 who showed substantial increases in wue on irrigated lucerne by reducing cut off times below those required for 100 er an alternative strategy sometimes used is to maximise uniformity e g finger and morris 2012 this is only valid if er is substantially less than 100 if er is 100 then the uniformity of moisture stored in the root zone is by definition 100 and this maximisation objective is non sensical 4 2 simulation results the full set of results covers a very large number of combinations of soil type moisture deficit field length inflow rate slope and crop type manning n typical results for the cracking and non cracking soil groups are provided in figs 4 and 5 respectively as plots of the key performance measures ea and er versus flow rate the optimum time to cut off tco and the distance reached by the irrigation advance xco at the point of cut off are also shown on these plots in these plots as in most cases simulated the application efficiencies initially show a rising trend with increasing flow rate until reaching a plateau at some particular flow rate the magnitude of this flow rate is a function of the soil type crop density bay length and soil moisture deficit being higher for the more permeable soils denser crops longer bays and higher deficits at or just before the point of maximum ea the requirement efficiency er was generally adequate 95 thus defining the preferred flow rate at this flow rate the irrigation durations tco were typically about 2 3 hours except for the very long bays and high deficits the exceptions to the above were the cracking soil types with a short bay and low deficit where the application efficiency was essentially constant at all flow rates these data show that application efficiencies in excess of 90 are possible on many soils in the region through the use of flow rates higher than those recommended in the earlier extension guidelines of lavis et al 2006 the exceptions are for longer bays on the more permeable soils with small moisture deficits where maximum application efficiencies reduce to below 80 it must be stressed that these are maximum possible application efficiencies and assume perfect selection and control of irrigation duration tco few farmers would be achieving maximum efficiencies at their current flow rates and without assistance with selection of tco would certainly not achieve them if they adopted higher flow rates the simulations suggest preferred flow rates for cracking soils of 6 ml d ha for irrigation of pasture with soil moisture deficits up to about 50 mm this should increase to 8 ml d ha for irrigation of deep rooted fodder crops with deficits in the order 80 100 mm for pasture on non cracking soils the recommended flow rates depend on the soil permeability with 6 10 and 14 ml d ha recommended for lowly moderately and more highly permeable soils respectively for a 400 m long 50 m wide bay the above flow rates correspond to unit rates of 0 24 0 4 and 0 56 ml d m width or 2 8 4 6 and 6 7 l s m width respectively again these rates should be increased by 2 ml d ha for higher deficits in some instances the recommended flow rates might exceed the supply rate available in which case growers will have to balance the potential small loss of application efficiency with the cost of reducing bay widths to increase the flow rate per unit width at these higher flow rates the optimised times to cut off are much shorter than those required for the lower flow rates traditionally used it also means that cut off will occur well before the advance has reach the halfway point down the field posing a significant challenge to any procedure employed to estimate the time to cut off one factor not accounted for explicitly in the above simulations that might limit application efficiencies on some sites is residual water stored in the micro topography of the bay after the irrigation is finished this factor is most significant in bays which are on heavier soils on low slopes imprecisely graded with dense pasture and where traffic by stock has generated substantial micro relief campbell 1988 an early attempt to quantify this residual water is contained in the report by campbell 1988 who measured residual depths of from 1 1 to 12 5 mm on two bays with slopes of 1 750 and 1 1500 respectively with the larger values occurring on the flatter bay in a detailed water balance of a particularly long duration and inefficient irrigation on a bay with heavy clay soil gilfedder et al 2000 showed that on the particular site 20 mm of water remained on the surface of the bay 20 h after the irrigation for modern steeper and well graded bays and where high flow rates and much shorter irrigation durations are employed this term should be small in cases where the infiltration characteristic has been determined from irrigation advance data this depth of residual water is most likely already embedded in the estimated infiltration characteristic most probably in the initial infiltration term k and has thus been accounted for in the efficiency calculations there is no evidence in the literature of significant residual water occurring on the non cracking soil types 5 toward a method for real time selection of time to cut off 5 1 the challenge recent work on furrow irrigation in the australian cotton industry by khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 and smith et al 2018 has led to two equally effective methods for estimation tco in real time they differ in complexity but both only require one measurement of the irrigation advance taken relatively late in the irrigation however it is not known how these methods might translate to bay irrigation in australia bay irrigation differs from furrow in a number of significant ways firstly with lengths ranging from about 200 to 600 m bays are much shorter than the 600 to 1500 m furrows used in the cotton industry secondly the hydraulic resistance to the irrigation flow provided by the crop or soil surface as represented by the parameter n in the manning equation is typically much greater and more variable than in a clean furrow for example the manning n for a summer pasture or fodder crop can be anywhere in the range 0 1 to 0 36 whereas n for a bare furrow is usually taken to be 0 04 this means that in a typical bay at times at or near cut off there is a far greater volume of water contained in temporary storage in the advancing irrigation flow this is illustrated in fig 6 for an efficient irrigation on a hypothetical irrigation bay employing a high flow rate and short time to cut off at the point of cut off 2 h between 50 and 60 of the water applied to the field is still on the field the problem is compounded by the substantial difficulty in accurately estimating the volume of this surface ponding finally because of the much shorter times to cut off any sensing and calculations required to estimate tco and the subsequent decision to turn the flow off have to be made much earlier in the irrigation typically before the advance has reached 40 of the length and more quickly than in furrow irrigation to be effective methods for selection of tco need to be simple to apply involve the minimum of measurement and calculation on the part of farmers but at the same time be adaptive to changes in the key variables of flow rate soil moisture deficit and crop density the rate of advance of the wetting front down the bay integrates the effects of most of the relevant variables including those above it is also something that irrigators can measure relatively simply it is also assumed that irrigators will at least also know the inflow rate into their bays some simplification of the problem can result if farmers irrigate each time at the same soil moisture deficit thus elimination problems caused by variation of the infiltration characteristic of the bay and if they use the same and constant flow rate each time they irrigate this is now possible in the region under consideration following full automation of the supply system 5 2 the options from an examination of the literature three methods appeared worthy of consideration viz 1 the use of a hydrodynamic model in a manner similar to the autofurrow model of khatri and smith 2006 and koech et al 2014 2 a volume balance approach following on from the work of saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 and 3 simple unique empirical relationships for each bay linking tco with the rate of advance to some nominated point down the bay similar to that used in furrow irrigation by smith et al 2018 the autofurrow method for the real time selection of tco in furrows khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 requires measurements only of the inflow rate and advance to a single point the main features of this optimization process are the use of a model infiltration curve and a scaling process to describe the current soil infiltration characteristic measurement of the inflow rate to the furrows measurement of the water advance at a point at least midway down the furrow an assumed constant manning n and a hydraulic simulation program based on the full hydrodynamic model to predict the optimum time to cut off to apply this method to bay irrigation requires additional measurements for example additional advance points and or flow depths to enable estimation of the manning n parameter for the crop or pasture growing in the bay even so a major difficulty arises because n and the infiltration parameter k both influence the rate of advance in a similar manner that is an increase in either parameter causes the advance to slow however they have opposing effects on the volume of surface ponding hence multiple measurements of flow depth are required to isolate the values of these two parameters it is easily shown through simulation that the number and location at or near the downstream end of the field of sensors and measurements required to identify the correct values of n and k make this approach prohibitive as a practical approach for farmers to employ this issue with the sensor locations was first intimated by walker 2005 and further demonstrated by gillies and smith 2015 during the initial testing of the sisco model saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 proposed the use of a simple volume balance approach and applied it to bay irrigated lucerne in southern california with mixed results the method utilises measurement of advance at two points as well as an estimate of the average depth of surface ponding two issues that limit the application of this method are immediately evident first is the use of a very much simplified infiltration equation that consisted only of the initial rapid infiltration term k and which neglected any continuing infiltration described by fo for many of the soils of the region which display a non negligible continuing infiltration the method will underestimate the depth or volume of infiltration and consequently will underestimate the tco thus introducing the real possibility that the advance will not reach the end of the field there is no obvious way to introduce the continuing infiltration into the volume balance analysis the second issue is the fact that the calculation of the infiltration term and hence tco is very sensitive to the estimated value of the average depth of water on the field estimating this term from a limited number only two of depth measurements is highly problematic for furrow irrigation on the heavy clay soils in the australian cotton growing regions smith et al 2018 showed that for a particular field there exists a simple linear relationship between tco and the time of the irrigation advance to a nominated point at least 50 of the distance down the furrow this relationship was shown to be independent of the flow rate and the soil moisture deficit knowledge of which was not required the method was shown to provide robust estimates of tco that resulted in high application efficiencies the remainder of the present paper will focus on the possible application of this approach to bay irrigated pasture and fodder crops 5 3 relationship between tco and advance time for irrigation bays the simulations used in the previous section to establish preferred flow rates involved optimisation to give maximum ea and 5 runoff for a wide range of the key variables here these same data are used to explore the relationship between advance time and optimum tco for this purpose the advance down the bay was represented by the time taken to reach a point 3 8th of the distance down the bay tadv this distance used for the advance time was selected arbitrarily but in all cases the advance time was less than the tco hence would give the farmer time to make the control decision an example of the results in this case for each of the cracking and non cracking soil types c1 c2 c3 c4 n1 n2 n3 for summer pasture n 0 26 on a hypothetical bay 400 m long and with an inflow rate of 2 31 l s m width are presented in fig 7 the two lines representing the cracking soils c1 c3 c2 c4 were each calculated for various values of the infiltration parameter k for the non cracking soils n1 n2 and n3 a single value of the soil moisture deficit was used for each case the results show linear relationships between tco and tadv it should be noted here that changing the values of the key parameters will result in different relationships changing the point used for the advance measurement simply results in another family of straight lines as does altering the inflow rate or manning n similarly changing the target runoff from 5 to reflect a different risk or uncertainty also results in another family of straight lines for the cracking soil the soil infiltration characteristic and in particular the rapid initial infiltration are known to be a function of the soil moisture deficit eq 3 and associated text the majority of the infiltration occurs in the first few minutes that water is present on the surface with only relatively small depths infiltrating after that time this tends to result in a relatively uniform rate of advance because the two lines for the cracking soils are each for various values of the infiltration parameter k and they therefore represent varying deficits suggesting that the relationships for these soils are independent of the soil moisture deficit this is consistent with the similar result for furrow irrigation on cracking soils smith et al 2018 the difference between them is the effect of the different rates of continuing infiltration represented by different values of the parameter fo 1 mm h for c1 c3 and 3 mm h for c2 c4 the non cracking soils vary from the cracking soils in that the relationship between the infiltration characteristic and the soil moisture deficit is not well known the three non cracking soils n1 n2 n3 are in order of increasing infiltration increasing k the results for which fall on a single straight line fig 7 for the given flow rate deficit and crop condition this difference in infiltration between the three soils was primarily intended to show how the advance vs tco relationship might change with increasing soil permeability however it also might show the effect of increasing soil moisture deficit assuming the infiltration curve varies with deficit by varying the parameter k as with the cracking soils then the relationship for these soils might also be largely independent of the soil moisture deficit note that while the selection of the optimum tco might be independent of the deficit the resulting application efficiency is very much dependent on it the values of tco for the non cracking soils are typically higher than for the cracking soils at the same flow rate this reflects the very different shape of the infiltration curves and the greater ongoing infiltration that occurs at later times the greater permeability also results in lower maximum application efficiencies the previous furrow irrigation work by smith et al 2018 showed that for furrows the relationship between advance and tco was also independent of inflow rate this not the case for bay irrigation as illustrated in fig 8 which shows the relationships for a cracking c1 soil each line corresponding to a particular flow rate and represents the results for a range of soil moisture deficits ranging from 30 to 60 mm the cause of the difference between the results for bay and furrow irrigation appears to lie in the higher value of the manning n for pasture and the very short advance distances necessarily used in this analysis the matter is further complicated by the fact that a different set of curves also results for different crop densities that is for different values of the manning n fig 9 in this figure curves are presented for a single flow rate and for bare soil n 0 05 sparse annual pasture or fodder crop n 0 1 summer pasture n 0 26 and a very thick summer pasture or crop n 0 3 the difference caused by the manning n can be explained by recourse to a simple volume balance for a given deficit and the same flow rate the same tco will be required in each case to apply the correct volume of water to satisfy the deficit the higher the manning n means greater flow depths greater temporary storage of water on the surface of the bay and hence slower advance a similar situation applies to the non cracking soils while not presented here the relationship between tadv and tco is also dependent on the length of the bay 5 4 sensitivity analysis the relationship for the cracking soil c1 presented in fig 7 is 4 tco 3 19 tadv 235 using the same data as used to develop this relationship the sensitivity of the irrigation performance to changes or errors in the soil moisture deficit flow rate and manning n were assessed by varying each of those parameters by 10 table 1 as expected a change in the deficit of 10 causes only a minor change in performance with the application efficiency changing by 2 however performance is a little more sensitive to changes in the inflow rate and manning n a 10 change in these parameters causing about a 5 change in performance and possible instances of failure to reach the end of the field for irrigators in the goulburn murray irrigation district of northern victoria full automation of the supply system has provided them with constant and precisely known flow rates removing the likelihood of errors or uncertainties in flow rates the uncertainty involved in estimating the manning n is more problematic however this can be countered effectively by either erring toward higher values of n or by aiming for a slightly higher runoff volume when establishing the tco tadv relationship either approach provides an additional margin of safety irrigating with a consistent flow rate at a consistent soil moisture deficit will help remove some uncertainty 5 5 management implications to illustrate application of the method to real on farm management of irrigations data from five sequential irrigations in a single bay planted to maize being grown for fodder were used these data were obtained in an evaluation of automated bay irrigation undertaken in 2014 by smith et al 2018 and reported in that paper as farm d the bay is 400 m long and 50 m wide with an average slope of 1 916 soil type is a heavy clay loam each of the five irrigations were monitored and evaluated with continuous measurement of the inflow hydrograph and the flow depths at three points down the field infiltration parameters and the manning n were determined by a calibration process using the simulation model sisco gillies and smith 2015 and the performance measures ea er runoff and deep drainage estimated again using the sisco model inflow rate was the same for each irrigation at 14 ml d but the soil moisture deficit prior to each irrigation varied wildly table 2 resulting in infiltration characteristics of very different magnitude fig 10 the manning n increased from 0 06 to 0 09 throughout the sequence table 2 in addition to the actual performance achieved by the farmer each irrigation was optimised using sisco with the results also given in table 2 to develop the relationship between tco and the time of advance to the 3 8th distance for a particular bay at least one irrigation at the site must be evaluated as described above for farm d the relationship was developed from the data from the first irrigation 29 jan 14 by varying the deficit and hence the infiltration parameter k and optimising as above with the result given by the trend line in fig 11 the relationship is 5 tco 2 89 tadv 65 5 tco for all five optimised irrigations are also plotted against the corresponding advance time to the 3 8th distance in fig 11 finally the irrigation performance that would have been achieved had the remaining irrigations been controlled by equation 5 are presented in the final columns of table 2 the significant issues with the management of irrigations on farm d are a lowly permeable soil with an unusual infiltration characteristic the uncertain and varying deficit and the variation in manning n in his attempt to satisfy the soil moisture deficit the farmer used excessively long irrigation durations tco the consequences of which were low application efficiencies and large volumes of runoff table 2 runoff in fact was the sole loss at each irrigation there were no deep percolation losses the optimisations of the individual irrigations undertaken with the benefit of hindsight show that very much higher application efficiencies could have been obtained through substantial reductions in irrigation duration which would vary in accordance with the deficit however in all cases the optimised irrigations failed to fully satisfy the deficit because the farm is fully automated this under irrigation is not a major issue it simply means that the next irrigation will be required a little sooner it also might lead to some yield improvement through a reduction in waterlogging of these heavy soils it is worth noting at this point that the deficits were measured using an un calibrated capacitance probe and that while the relativity between irrigations would likely be correct the magnitudes of the deficits may not be had the irrigations been controlled by equation 5 in conjunction with a single advance measurement located 150 m from the head of the bay the efficiencies obtained would have been very much improved from those obtained by the farmer table 2 the equation accommodates the varying soil moisture deficits and varying infiltration but does not account for the increases in the manning n with time as the crop develops hence the efficiencies that would have been obtained in the latter part of the season are slightly sub optimal while one data set is not sufficient to allow firm conclusions to be drawn it does illustrate the potential of the simple approach for estimating optimal tco based on a measured time of advance to a nominated point it has the advantage of requiring only a single sensor in each bay but does require full monitoring and evaluation of one irrigation to enable the relationship between advance time and optimal tco to be developed high flow rate bay irrigation with its attendant early cut off is a radical departure from the traditional practice in northern victoria it does carry some risk but offers high rewards in terms of high application efficiencies minimal deep percolation losses reduced waterlogging of surface soils and reduced accessions to the water table those irrigators who have adopted the practice have not all achieved these rewards smith et al 2018 and those who have did so by trial and error the method described in this paper offers improved performance to all adopters 6 conclusions published data on soil infiltration properties across the murray dairy region of southern australia were used in a simulation study of bay irrigation performance it has confirmed that flow rates higher than those recommended by previous guidelines have the potential to deliver higher application efficiencies for bay irrigated pasture and fodder crops across this region preferred flow rates for the major soil groups are recommended these higher flow rates result in much shorter irrigation durations or times to cut off and consequently greater accuracy and precision in the selection and management of time to cut off is required the same simulation data were used to illustrate the relationships that exist between the rate of advance of the wetting front down an irrigated bay and the optimum time to cut off for that bay it is shown that if a bay is managed consistently that is irrigated at a consistent soil moisture deficit and consistent flow rate a simple linear function can be used to estimate the tco from a single advance measurement taken relatively early in the irrigation data from multiple irrigations of a commercial crop performed under normal farmer management demonstrated the potential of the simple relationship between tadv and tco to improve management of real irrigations 
10778,the maximum efficiency attainable by surface irrigation in any particular situation is determined largely by the soil infiltration characteristic and the flow rate onto the field performance evaluations have suggested that higher flow rates than those traditionally recommended can lead to increases of about 20 in the application efficiency of bay irrigation across the dairy regions of southern australia however substantially reduced irrigation durations are required to realise these efficiency gains and greater precision is required in the selection and management of these shorter durations in this paper infiltration characteristic curves representative of the predominant cracking and non cracking soils of the region are used in the surface irrigation simulation model sisco for a range of bay lengths and soil moisture deficits to determine i the flow rates required to achieve the maximum efficiency on the bay irrigated soils of southern australia and ii the means for real time estimation of optimum irrigation durations the aim is provision of guidance to irrigators seeking higher efficiency through the use of higher flow rates real time estimation of optimum time to cut off must recognise the substantial variations in infiltration within a soil type and with time due to changes in antecedent moisture content and hence must be adaptive to the conditions prevailing at the time of any irrigation a method for estimating time to cut off previously developed for furrow irrigation is extended to the hydraulically more complex case of bay irrigation the method is based on simple linear relationships between the advance time to a nominated point part way down the field and the time to cut off its application to the management of irrigations is demonstrated using data from multiple irrigations of a single bay under varying soil moisture conditions keywords surface irrigation border check irrigation infiltration simulation application efficiency optimization time to cut off 1 introduction despite the evidence that well designed and managed surface irrigation systems have the potential to deliver high application efficiencies most commercial systems still appear to be operating with significantly lower and highly variable efficiencies the reason for this can be traced to the use of lower than optimal flow rates and more particularly the use of inappropriate times to cut off for example in the australian cotton industry smith et al 2005 have shown that increasing the furrow inflow rates to 6 l s and reducing the time to cut off tco would potentially raise the average application efficiency from the previous low of 50 to an improved 75 more recent evaluations of furrow irrigation performance in that industry montgomery and wigginton 2008 have confirmed that adoption of higher flow rates has led to average application efficiencies in excess of 70 as a result the cotton industry is estimated to have saved 28 5 g l of water per annum and achieved an industry improvement in wue of 10 bda group 2007 selection by farmers of appropriate times to cut off remains problematic and the simulation work by smith et al 2005 suggested that raising efficiency further could only come about by selecting an individual tco for each irrigation that gives optimum performance for the prevailing conditions substantial work toward real time selection of tco has been undertaken with some success by khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 and smith et al 2018 a similar situation prevails in the bay border check irrigated dairy and fodder cropping regions in southern australia a study by the cooperative research centre for irrigation futures smith et al 2009 and gillies et al 2010 demonstrated that significant gains at least 20 in application efficiency were possible in the bay irrigation of pasture and fodder crops again by the simple expedient of doubling flow rates from 0 07 to 0 22 l s m width to 0 24 to 0 44 l s m and reducing irrigation durations for growers seeking federal government funding for on farm efficiency improvements a minimum flow rate of 0 2 ml d m width is now required gbcma et al 2012 based on the above work of smith et al 2009 and gillies et al 2010 no guidance was provided on selection of appropriate tco at these higher flow rates the very much reduced times to cut off required mean that the ability to achieve optimal performance is particularly sensitive to the cut off time for farmers to manage irrigations with these higher flow rates and shorter run times they will require as a minimum very clear and precise guidelines and it typically will necessitate real time estimation of tco more recently smith et al 2016 evaluated the irrigation performance achieved on nine farms employing automation of their irrigated bays all of which used flow rates in excess of the recommended 0 2 ml d m this study showed that with careful selection of cut off times application efficiencies in excess of 90 could be obtained routinely unfortunately some of the farmers were less diligent in their management of cut off times and did not receive the full efficiency gains that are possible through automation in other parts of the world researchers and farmers are wrestling with the same issues relating to management of bay irrigations efforts to reduce water use in the bay irrigation of lucerne alfalfa in california for example saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 have tended to ignore flow rate presumably because of infrastructure limitations and have focussed on reducing tail water by attempting to improve selection of time to cut off the purpose of the present study is to use simulation along with published infiltration and irrigation evaluation data to i determine the flow rates that will provide best performance over the range of soil types across the dairy regions of northern victoria and southern new south wales and ii assess methodologies that will allow adaptive real time estimation of optimal times to cut off 2 study area this study pertains to the southern murray darling basin region of northern victoria and southern new south wales fig 1 the landform is an alluvial plain soils have been formed by floodplain deposition from the murray river and tributary streams that have meandered over the floodplain for millennia soils range from coarse sands deposited adjacent to streams to fine textured cracking clays resulting from deposition of fine material remote from stream channels butler 1950 soil types across the region are as described in skene 1963 skene and freedman 1944 skene and harford 1964 and skene and poutsma 1962 border irrigation of perennial and annual pastures and fodder crops uses approximately 1600 g l of irrigation water annually on over 400 000 ha of irrigated land abs 2008 3 infiltration data a detailed search of the published literature drew 51 infiltration characteristics covering 15 named soil types plus a further 8 characteristics where the soil type was not specified other than in general terms of soil texture these data were originally gathered for a variety of purposes using of various measurement methods ranging from point measurements using ring infiltrometers tisdall 1950 robertson et al 2004 and recirculating infiltrometers turral and malano 1996 to field averages where the irrigation bay was the infiltrometer in this latter group methods included volume balance approaches such as the two point method maheshwari et al 1988 hume 1993 to least squares fitting using hydrodynamic models turral 1996 austin and prendergast 1997 smith et al 2009 gillies et al 2010 only in a very few instances was the soil moisture deficit at the time of the measurement specified in the source publication the source data were reported in a variety of formats to suit the simulation model used in this study the infiltration data were converted to the form of the three parameter modified kostiakov equation 1 i k t a f o τ where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm a and k are fitted parameters fo is the final or steady infiltration rate mm min and τ is the infiltration time min the feature most evident from the infiltration data is the very substantial variation in infiltration within a field within a soil type and between soil types this is supported by the results of selle et al 2011 who showed that the within field and within soil type variation in final infiltration rate were not dissimilar in magnitude averaging infiltration over an irrigated bay as is done by any measurement that uses the bay as the infiltrometer masks some of the within field variation however the within soil type variation means that infiltration cannot be estimated from the soil descriptions provided by the available soil surveys this poses a real challenge for the development of irrigation management guidelines which as a consequence need to be based on objective hydraulic criteria rather than on the basis of soil type the data also suggest that the soils in the region are substantially more permeable than indicated by reports such as those by mehta and wang 2005 and selle et al 2011 based on point measurements of the soil hydraulic properties this has significant implications for irrigation management the potential magnitude of deep percolation losses and accessions to groundwater resulting from over irrigation the other feature evident from the data is that the soils fall clearly into two key groups cracking and non cracking although it should be noted that different occurrences of a particular soil might fall into either group however soil cracking is a readily identifiable characteristic and farmers should have no difficulty in identifying into which group their soils fall in the cracking group of soils the parameter a in the modified kostiakov equation is zero or very small and the k parameter represents the instantaneous initial infiltration or crack fill this in effect reduces the equation to the two parameter linear equation as used in the aim model of austin and prendergast 1997 2 i z c r f o τ where zcr is an instantaneous crack fill mm the crack fill is a function of the soil moisture deficit zreq and for lemnos loam is typically taken to be robertson et al 2004 3 z c r 0 75 z r e q the steady infiltration rate for these soils ranges from 0 to about 5 mm h but is thought to be strongly skewed toward the lower values mehta and wang 2005 it is often simply taken to be 1 mm h e g robertson et al 2004 the published infiltration data compiled in this study are biased toward the cracking group of soils partly because it contains some of the more prevalent soils of the region such as lemnos loam and kerang clay four infiltration curves fig 2 were selected to represent these cracking soils c1 final infiltration rate 1 mm h deficit 40 mm a 0 08 k 0 020 fo 0 0000167 m min c2 final

a 0 08 k 0 032 fo 0 00005 m min in the case of the non cracking soils there is insufficient data to give any understanding of how the infiltration characteristic for a particular soil might vary if at all with deficit hence the strategy used here was to select three infiltration characteristics fig 3 representative of the range of characteristics encountered each of which is based on the published data for a named soil the soils are n1 low permeability based on wanalta loam or similar a 0 4 k 0 0045 fo 0 0 approximately equivalent to a usda 0 15 light clay n2 moderate permeability cobram loam a

optimisation objective for each of the case study soils irrigations were simulated using the sisco hydraulic simulation model gillies and smith 2015 for a range of flow rates and for three bay lengths for each combination of length and flow rate the irrigation was optimised to determine the duration of inflow or time to cut off tco that would give maximum application efficiency ea run off from the end of the bay was set to 5 to ensure that the irrigation always reached the downstream end of the bay this is a small margin and may at times be insufficient compensate for errors in the estimation of parameters such as the manning n the implications of this and the control requirements have been discussed in later sections of the paper for many mostly cracking soil types in the region the deficit is replenished rapidly via the process of crack fill hence the 5 runoff condition also typically ensures that the irrigation is adequate in meeting the requirements of the crop the other usual performance parameters of requirement efficiency er and uniformity were also calculated for each irrigation along with an estimate of the deep percolation loss the optimisation objective used in studies such as this is always subjective individual researchers and growers place different values on the key performance parameters depending on their particular circumstances for example it is not uncommon for the requirement efficiency to be set at 100 meaning complete replenishment of the soil moisture deficit e g feyen and zerihun 1999 such a strategy inevitably results in substantial runoff and deep drainage volumes that reduce application efficiency significantly and arguably is not a valid strategy on the more permeable soils or when water is in short supply as well as reduced application efficiency it also leads to reduced water use efficiency wue this was well illustrated by uniwater 2008 who showed substantial increases in wue on irrigated lucerne by reducing cut off times below those required for 100 er an alternative strategy sometimes used is to maximise uniformity e g finger and morris 2012 this is only valid if er is substantially less than 100 if er is 100 then the uniformity of moisture stored in the root zone is by definition 100 and this maximisation objective is non sensical 4 2 simulation results the full set of results covers a very large number of combinations of soil type moisture deficit field length inflow rate slope and crop type manning n typical results for the cracking and non cracking soil groups are provided in figs 4 and 5 respectively as plots of the key performance measures ea and er versus flow rate the optimum time to cut off tco and the distance reached by the irrigation advance xco at the point of cut off are also shown on these plots in these plots as in most cases simulated the application efficiencies initially show a rising trend with increasing flow rate until reaching a plateau at some particular flow rate the magnitude of this flow rate is a function of the soil type crop density bay length and soil moisture deficit being higher for the more permeable soils denser crops longer bays and higher deficits at or just before the point of maximum ea the requirement efficiency er was generally adequate 95 thus defining the preferred flow rate at this flow rate the irrigation durations tco were typically about 2 3 hours except for the very long bays and high deficits the exceptions to the above were the cracking soil types with a short bay and low deficit where the application efficiency was essentially constant at all flow rates these data show that application efficiencies in excess of 90 are possible on many soils in the region through the use of flow rates higher than those recommended in the earlier extension guidelines of lavis et al 2006 the exceptions are for longer bays on the more permeable soils with small moisture deficits where maximum application efficiencies reduce to below 80 it must be stressed that these are maximum possible application efficiencies and assume perfect selection and control of irrigation duration tco few farmers would be achieving maximum efficiencies at their current flow rates and without assistance with selection of tco would certainly not achieve them if they adopted higher flow rates the simulations suggest preferred flow rates for cracking soils of 6 ml d ha for irrigation of pasture with soil moisture deficits up to about 50 mm this should increase to 8 ml d ha for irrigation of deep rooted fodder crops with deficits in the order 80 100 mm for pasture on non cracking soils the recommended flow rates depend on the soil permeability with 6 10 and 14 ml d ha recommended for lowly moderately and more highly permeable soils respectively for a 400 m long 50 m wide bay the above flow rates correspond to unit rates of 0 24 0 4 and 0 56 ml d m width or 2 8 4 6 and 6 7 l s m width respectively again these rates should be increased by 2 ml d ha for higher deficits in some instances the recommended flow rates might exceed the supply rate available in which case growers will have to balance the potential small loss of application efficiency with the cost of reducing bay widths to increase the flow rate per unit width at these higher flow rates the optimised times to cut off are much shorter than those required for the lower flow rates traditionally used it also means that cut off will occur well before the advance has reach the halfway point down the field posing a significant challenge to any procedure employed to estimate the time to cut off one factor not accounted for explicitly in the above simulations that might limit application efficiencies on some sites is residual water stored in the micro topography of the bay after the irrigation is finished this factor is most significant in bays which are on heavier soils on low slopes imprecisely graded with dense pasture and where traffic by stock has generated substantial micro relief campbell 1988 an early attempt to quantify this residual water is contained in the report by campbell 1988 who measured residual depths of from 1 1 to 12 5 mm on two bays with slopes of 1 750 and 1 1500 respectively with the larger values occurring on the flatter bay in a detailed water balance of a particularly long duration and inefficient irrigation on a bay with heavy clay soil gilfedder et al 2000 showed that on the particular site 20 mm of water remained on the surface of the bay 20 h after the irrigation for modern steeper and well graded bays and where high flow rates and much shorter irrigation durations are employed this term should be small in cases where the infiltration characteristic has been determined from irrigation advance data this depth of residual water is most likely already embedded in the estimated infiltration characteristic most probably in the initial infiltration term k and has thus been accounted for in the efficiency calculations there is no evidence in the literature of significant residual water occurring on the non cracking soil types 5 toward a method for real time selection of time to cut off 5 1 the challenge recent work on furrow irrigation in the australian cotton industry by khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 and smith et al 2018 has led to two equally effective methods for estimation tco in real time they differ in complexity but both only require one measurement of the irrigation advance taken relatively late in the irrigation however it is not known how these methods might translate to bay irrigation in australia bay irrigation differs from furrow in a number of significant ways firstly with lengths ranging from about 200 to 600 m bays are much shorter than the 600 to 1500 m furrows used in the cotton industry secondly the hydraulic resistance to the irrigation flow provided by the crop or soil surface as represented by the parameter n in the manning equation is typically much greater and more variable than in a clean furrow for example the manning n for a summer pasture or fodder crop can be anywhere in the range 0 1 to 0 36 whereas n for a bare furrow is usually taken to be 0 04 this means that in a typical bay at times at or near cut off there is a far greater volume of water contained in temporary storage in the advancing irrigation flow this is illustrated in fig 6 for an efficient irrigation on a hypothetical irrigation bay employing a high flow rate and short time to cut off at the point of cut off 2 h between 50 and 60 of the water applied to the field is still on the field the problem is compounded by the substantial difficulty in accurately estimating the volume of this surface ponding finally because of the much shorter times to cut off any sensing and calculations required to estimate tco and the subsequent decision to turn the flow off have to be made much earlier in the irrigation typically before the advance has reached 40 of the length and more quickly than in furrow irrigation to be effective methods for selection of tco need to be simple to apply involve the minimum of measurement and calculation on the part of farmers but at the same time be adaptive to changes in the key variables of flow rate soil moisture deficit and crop density the rate of advance of the wetting front down the bay integrates the effects of most of the relevant variables including those above it is also something that irrigators can measure relatively simply it is also assumed that irrigators will at least also know the inflow rate into their bays some simplification of the problem can result if farmers irrigate each time at the same soil moisture deficit thus elimination problems caused by variation of the infiltration characteristic of the bay and if they use the same and constant flow rate each time they irrigate this is now possible in the region under consideration following full automation of the supply system 5 2 the options from an examination of the literature three methods appeared worthy of consideration viz 1 the use of a hydrodynamic model in a manner similar to the autofurrow model of khatri and smith 2006 and koech et al 2014 2 a volume balance approach following on from the work of saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 and 3 simple unique empirical relationships for each bay linking tco with the rate of advance to some nominated point down the bay similar to that used in furrow irrigation by smith et al 2018 the autofurrow method for the real time selection of tco in furrows khatri and smith 2006 koech et al 2014 requires measurements only of the inflow rate and advance to a single point the main features of this optimization process are the use of a model infiltration curve and a scaling process to describe the current soil infiltration characteristic measurement of the inflow rate to the furrows measurement of the water advance at a point at least midway down the furrow an assumed constant manning n and a hydraulic simulation program based on the full hydrodynamic model to predict the optimum time to cut off to apply this method to bay irrigation requires additional measurements for example additional advance points and or flow depths to enable estimation of the manning n parameter for the crop or pasture growing in the bay even so a major difficulty arises because n and the infiltration parameter k both influence the rate of advance in a similar manner that is an increase in either parameter causes the advance to slow however they have opposing effects on the volume of surface ponding hence multiple measurements of flow depth are required to isolate the values of these two parameters it is easily shown through simulation that the number and location at or near the downstream end of the field of sensors and measurements required to identify the correct values of n and k make this approach prohibitive as a practical approach for farmers to employ this issue with the sensor locations was first intimated by walker 2005 and further demonstrated by gillies and smith 2015 during the initial testing of the sisco model saha et al 2011 and arnold et al 2014 proposed the use of a simple volume balance approach and applied it to bay irrigated lucerne in southern california with mixed results the method utilises measurement of advance at two points as well as an estimate of the average depth of surface ponding two issues that limit the application of this method are immediately evident first is the use of a very much simplified infiltration equation that consisted only of the initial rapid infiltration term k and which neglected any continuing infiltration described by fo for many of the soils of the region which display a non negligible continuing infiltration the method will underestimate the depth or volume of infiltration and consequently will underestimate the tco thus introducing the real possibility that the advance will not reach the end of the field there is no obvious way to introduce the continuing infiltration into the volume balance analysis the second issue is the fact that the calculation of the infiltration term and hence tco is very sensitive to the estimated value of the average depth of water on the field estimating this term from a limited number only two of depth measurements is highly problematic for furrow irrigation on the heavy clay soils in the australian cotton growing regions smith et al 2018 showed that for a particular field there exists a simple linear relationship between tco and the time of the irrigation advance to a nominated point at least 50 of the distance down the furrow this relationship was shown to be independent of the flow rate and the soil moisture deficit knowledge of which was not required the method was shown to provide robust estimates of tco that resulted in high application efficiencies the remainder of the present paper will focus on the possible application of this approach to bay irrigated pasture and fodder crops 5 3 relationship between tco and advance time for irrigation bays the simulations used in the previous section to establish preferred flow rates involved optimisation to give maximum ea and 5 runoff for a wide range of the key variables here these same data are used to explore the relationship between advance time and optimum tco for this purpose the advance down the bay was represented by the time taken to reach a point 3 8th of the distance down the bay tadv this distance used for the advance time was selected arbitrarily but in all cases the advance time was less than the tco hence would give the farmer time to make the control decision an example of the results in this case for each of the cracking and non cracking soil types c1 c2 c3 c4 n1 n2 n3 for summer pasture n 0 26 on a hypothetical bay 400 m long and with an inflow rate of 2 31 l s m width are presented in fig 7 the two lines representing the cracking soils c1 c3 c2 c4 were each calculated for various values of the infiltration parameter k for the non cracking soils n1 n2 and n3 a single value of the soil moisture deficit was used for each case the results show linear relationships between tco and tadv it should be noted here that changing the values of the key parameters will result in different relationships changing the point used for the advance measurement simply results in another family of straight lines as does altering the inflow rate or manning n similarly changing the target runoff from 5 to reflect a different risk or uncertainty also results in another family of straight lines for the cracking soil the soil infiltration characteristic and in particular the rapid initial infiltration are known to be a function of the soil moisture deficit eq 3 and associated text the majority of the infiltration occurs in the first few minutes that water is present on the surface with only relatively small depths infiltrating after that time this tends to result in a relatively uniform rate of advance because the two lines for the cracking soils are each for various values of the infiltration parameter k and they therefore represent varying deficits suggesting that the relationships for these soils are independent of the soil moisture deficit this is consistent with the similar result for furrow irrigation on cracking soils smith et al 2018 the difference between them is the effect of the different rates of continuing infiltration represented by different values of the parameter fo 1 mm h for c1 c3 and 3 mm h for c2 c4 the non cracking soils vary from the cracking soils in that the relationship between the infiltration characteristic and the soil moisture deficit is not well known the three non cracking soils n1 n2 n3 are in order of increasing infiltration increasing k the results for which fall on a single straight line fig 7 for the given flow rate deficit and crop condition this difference in infiltration between the three soils was primarily intended to show how the advance vs tco relationship might change with increasing soil permeability however it also might show the effect of increasing soil moisture deficit assuming the infiltration curve varies with deficit by varying the parameter k as with the cracking soils then the relationship for these soils might also be largely independent of the soil moisture deficit note that while the selection of the optimum tco might be independent of the deficit the resulting application efficiency is very much dependent on it the values of tco for the non cracking soils are typically higher than for the cracking soils at the same flow rate this reflects the very different shape of the infiltration curves and the greater ongoing infiltration that occurs at later times the greater permeability also results in lower maximum application efficiencies the previous furrow irrigation work by smith et al 2018 showed that for furrows the relationship between advance and tco was also independent of inflow rate this not the case for bay irrigation as illustrated in fig 8 which shows the relationships for a cracking c1 soil each line corresponding to a particular flow rate and represents the results for a range of soil moisture deficits ranging from 30 to 60 mm the cause of the difference between the results for bay and furrow irrigation appears to lie in the higher value of the manning n for pasture and the very short advance distances necessarily used in this analysis the matter is further complicated by the fact that a different set of curves also results for different crop densities that is for different values of the manning n fig 9 in this figure curves are presented for a single flow rate and for bare soil n 0 05 sparse annual pasture or fodder crop n 0 1 summer pasture n 0 26 and a very thick summer pasture or crop n 0 3 the difference caused by the manning n can be explained by recourse to a simple volume balance for a given deficit and the same flow rate the same tco will be required in each case to apply the correct volume of water to satisfy the deficit the higher the manning n means greater flow depths greater temporary storage of water on the surface of the bay and hence slower advance a similar situation applies to the non cracking soils while not presented here the relationship between tadv and tco is also dependent on the length of the bay 5 4 sensitivity analysis the relationship for the cracking soil c1 presented in fig 7 is 4 tco 3 19 tadv 235 using the same data as used to develop this relationship the sensitivity of the irrigation performance to changes or errors in the soil moisture deficit flow rate and manning n were assessed by varying each of those parameters by 10 table 1 as expected a change in the deficit of 10 causes only a minor change in performance with the application efficiency changing by 2 however performance is a little more sensitive to changes in the inflow rate and manning n a 10 change in these parameters causing about a 5 change in performance and possible instances of failure to reach the end of the field for irrigators in the goulburn murray irrigation district of northern victoria full automation of the supply system has provided them with constant and precisely known flow rates removing the likelihood of errors or uncertainties in flow rates the uncertainty involved in estimating the manning n is more problematic however this can be countered effectively by either erring toward higher values of n or by aiming for a slightly higher runoff volume when establishing the tco tadv relationship either approach provides an additional margin of safety irrigating with a consistent flow rate at a consistent soil moisture deficit will help remove some uncertainty 5 5 management implications to illustrate application of the method to real on farm management of irrigations data from five sequential irrigations in a single bay planted to maize being grown for fodder were used these data were obtained in an evaluation of automated bay irrigation undertaken in 2014 by smith et al 2018 and reported in that paper as farm d the bay is 400 m long and 50 m wide with an average slope of 1 916 soil type is a heavy clay loam each of the five irrigations were monitored and evaluated with continuous measurement of the inflow hydrograph and the flow depths at three points down the field infiltration parameters and the manning n were determined by a calibration process using the simulation model sisco gillies and smith 2015 and the performance measures ea er runoff and deep drainage estimated again using the sisco model inflow rate was the same for each irrigation at 14 ml d but the soil moisture deficit prior to each irrigation varied wildly table 2 resulting in infiltration characteristics of very different magnitude fig 10 the manning n increased from 0 06 to 0 09 throughout the sequence table 2 in addition to the actual performance achieved by the farmer each irrigation was optimised using sisco with the results also given in table 2 to develop the relationship between tco and the time of advance to the 3 8th distance for a particular bay at least one irrigation at the site must be evaluated as described above for farm d the relationship was developed from the data from the first irrigation 29 jan 14 by varying the deficit and hence the infiltration parameter k and optimising as above with the result given by the trend line in fig 11 the relationship is 5 tco 2 89 tadv 65 5 tco for all five optimised irrigations are also plotted against the corresponding advance time to the 3 8th distance in fig 11 finally the irrigation performance that would have been achieved had the remaining irrigations been controlled by equation 5 are presented in the final columns of table 2 the significant issues with the management of irrigations on farm d are a lowly permeable soil with an unusual infiltration characteristic the uncertain and varying deficit and the variation in manning n in his attempt to satisfy the soil moisture deficit the farmer used excessively long irrigation durations tco the consequences of which were low application efficiencies and large volumes of runoff table 2 runoff in fact was the sole loss at each irrigation there were no deep percolation losses the optimisations of the individual irrigations undertaken with the benefit of hindsight show that very much higher application efficiencies could have been obtained through substantial reductions in irrigation duration which would vary in accordance with the deficit however in all cases the optimised irrigations failed to fully satisfy the deficit because the farm is fully automated this under irrigation is not a major issue it simply means that the next irrigation will be required a little sooner it also might lead to some yield improvement through a reduction in waterlogging of these heavy soils it is worth noting at this point that the deficits were measured using an un calibrated capacitance probe and that while the relativity between irrigations would likely be correct the magnitudes of the deficits may not be had the irrigations been controlled by equation 5 in conjunction with a single advance measurement located 150 m from the head of the bay the efficiencies obtained would have been very much improved from those obtained by the farmer table 2 the equation accommodates the varying soil moisture deficits and varying infiltration but does not account for the increases in the manning n with time as the crop develops hence the efficiencies that would have been obtained in the latter part of the season are slightly sub optimal while one data set is not sufficient to allow firm conclusions to be drawn it does illustrate the potential of the simple approach for estimating optimal tco based on a measured time of advance to a nominated point it has the advantage of requiring only a single sensor in each bay but does require full monitoring and evaluation of one irrigation to enable the relationship between advance time and optimal tco to be developed high flow rate bay irrigation with its attendant early cut off is a radical departure from the traditional practice in northern victoria it does carry some risk but offers high rewards in terms of high application efficiencies minimal deep percolation losses reduced waterlogging of surface soils and reduced accessions to the water table those irrigators who have adopted the practice have not all achieved these rewards smith et al 2018 and those who have did so by trial and error the method described in this paper offers improved performance to all adopters 6 conclusions published data on soil infiltration properties across the murray dairy region of southern australia were used in a simulation study of bay irrigation performance it has confirmed that flow rates higher than those recommended by previous guidelines have the potential to deliver higher application efficiencies for bay irrigated pasture and fodder crops across this region preferred flow rates for the major soil groups are recommended these higher flow rates result in much shorter irrigation durations or times to cut off and consequently greater accuracy and precision in the selection and management of time to cut off is required the same simulation data were used to illustrate the relationships that exist between the rate of advance of the wetting front down an irrigated bay and the optimum time to cut off for that bay it is shown that if a bay is managed consistently that is irrigated at a consistent soil moisture deficit and consistent flow rate a simple linear function can be used to estimate the tco from a single advance measurement taken relatively early in the irrigation data from multiple irrigations of a commercial crop performed under normal farmer management demonstrated the potential of the simple relationship between tadv and tco to improve management of real irrigations

boundary the rockwool layer and extension disallowed saturation at the lower soil boundary while permitting movement of water out of the soil and leachate collection ben gal and shani 2002 the leachate was further drained to a scaling system placed in a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 7 m outside the vineyard fig 1a during the winter of 2011 a four year old vine was replanted in each tank the lysimeter vines were treated with the same growing practices as the local commercial vineyard except for irrigation each lysimeter was irrigated with a tailor made computer controlled system crystal vision kibbutz samar israel with irrigation amounts that exceeded the estimated daily water consumption of vines by 20 30 thus ensuring optimum soil water conditions allen et al 1998 in this paper we considered the data of five growing seasons between 2013 and 2017 the time series data from the six lysimeters were averaged and occasional missing values were determined using a weighted moving average algorithm with a simple moving average window 4 days applied with the imputets package in r moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 whole plant leaf area of each lysimeter grown vine was quantified using leaf area index lai indirect measurements with a canopy analysis system sunscan model ss1 r3 bf3 delta t devices cambridge u lai was measured once a week close to midday with zenith angle under 30 the lai for each vine one in each lysimeter was calculated from 31 observations of equal spacing 10 cm for further information on lai measurement techniques and validation see netzer et al 2009 and munitz et al 2019 the six values one for each lysimeter grown vine were averaged a linear interpolation between each consecutive pair of mean lai values was performed to generate daily lai values using zoo package in r zeileis and grothendieck 2005 weather data were obtained from a meteorological station located in the vineyard for further details regarding the sensors and equipment see munitz et al 2019 the meteorological data included hourly measurements from which only the data gathered between 06 00 and 18 00 1 1 during the growing season sunset occurs after 19 00 defined as active hours of transpiration dragoni et al 2006 were selected and averaged daily mean values of meteorological data were acquired for temperature tmean wind speed measured at 10 m height u10 and relative humidity rhmean daily total solar radiation rn was an accumulation of 10 min solar radiation measures missing values were filled based on measurements from talmon regional meteorological station located 20 km from kida vineyard at an altitude of 638 m above sea level 2 2 2 determining phenological growth stages in the vineyard the growing season was segmented into five phenological stages munitz et al 2019 rogiers et al 2017 stage 0 from bud break to bloom stage 1 from full bloom to bunch closure stage 2 from bunch closure to veraison stage 3 from veraison to harvest and stage 4 post harvest until leaf defoliation table 1 whole seasons were defined as beginning on april 1 and ending on september 30 each year while specific start dates of each stage varied between seasons analyzing within seasonal patterns of water consumption with regard to the growth stages required uniform start dates for the different stages for all five seasons therefore the data is presented according to averaged start date for the five growing seasons 2 3 temporal dependence of crop evapotranspiration and its drivers temporal patterns analyses of vine etc and its drivers throughout growing seasons and phenological stages may benefit from higher accuracy levels when the time dependent structure i e is non stationarity and the strong seasonal component of the time series dataset are considered moreover if the dataset is indeed temporally autocorrelated then the relationships between the response and predictor variables should incorporate temporal components in order to account for variability in time a time series is considered non stationary when its statistical properties i e mean variance and covariance are not constant over time this may be evaluated using a statistical test for checking independence in a time series in this study we used the box pierce test to check for non stationarity of etc the meteorological variables and lai additionally we applied the autocorrelation function acf to the etc time series to check for correlations between different lags k where k 183 since each season has 183 observations days in addition we applied the partial acf pacf to check the correlation at a certain lag after removing the effect of any correlations at shorter lags cowpertwait and metcalfe 2009 the autocorrelation for a specific lag is comprised of both the direct and indirect correlations between observations where indirect correlations are a linear function of the correlation of a certain lag with lags at intervening time steps the pacf seeks to remove these effects and define only the direct temporal correlations between observations at any lag the significant lags indicated the extent of dependence of the time series or its autocorrelation the box pierce test acf and pacf were carried out using stats package in r r core team 2013 2 4 multiple nonlinear regression using generalized additive models in order to fulfill specific objective 2 and characterize the response of etc to its predicting variables throughout the growing season and for each phenological stage a regression model was required the relationships between etc and the meteorological variables as well as the vegetative predictor lai were not linear therefore a non linear multiple regression model was selected the generalized additive model gam is an additive model technique where the influence of each covariate is captured through a smooth function hastie and tibshirani 1986 and the smoothness estimation integrated into the model wood 2012 these non parametric scatterplot smoothers can be applied to the covariates to maximize the association to the dependent variable the smooth patterns of the covariates can be either linear or non linear which provides high flexibility to gam in this study we used the spline function for smoothing the covariates see appendix a gam allows control of the smoothness of the predictor functions and their wiggliness to penalize models with overly complicated component functions and to avoid overfitting wood 2012 the dataset that was used was time dependent meaning that both the dependent variable i e etc and the independent variables did not change at a constant rate over time therefore two additional predictors were added to the model to control for temporal variability and trend ramsay et al 2003 days of season 1 183 beginning april 1 and ending september 30 and seasons 1 5 categorizing the growing seasons between 2013 and 2017 respectively this was done to quantify the extent of influence that time had on the relationship between etc and its covariates and control for the variation explained by time dependent predictors the model included seven predictor variables u10 rn tmean rhmean lai days of season days and seasons gam was applied to the entire dataset and then to each of the growth stages for the five consecutive growing seasons using mgcv package in r wood 2017 the following formula eq 1 schematically represents the gam model 1 etc ƒ 1 lai ƒ2 tmean ƒ3 rhmean ƒ4 rn ƒ5 u10 ƒ6 days ƒ7 seasons ε where ƒ 1 ƒ 2 ƒ 3 ƒ 4 ƒ 5 and ƒ 6 are the smooth functions estimated by the model for each of the predictor variables and ε is the error term the formula for all of the six models entire seasons five growth stages was calculated using the same parameters and specified penalized cubic regression spline smoothing functions for all seven covariates each receiving a different number of degrees of freedom associated with the spline smooth see appendix a for further details on spline smoothing function the distribution of the response variable was defined as gaussian the association between the predictors and the response variable was evaluated using several statistics provided by the model the first is the pseudo adjusted r2 that defines the extent of variability of the response variable explained by the smooth terms i e the spline function of the predictors penalized according to the number of predictors in the model moreover an approximate significance p value for each smooth term enabled us to determine which smooth terms were significantly different from zero indicating a certain contribution to the model and an association to the response variable the model performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse between measured and fitted values of etc using metrics package in r hamner et al 2018 additionally a normalized root mean squared error to the range of the measured values of the response variable nrmserange was calculated so that the model performance could be compared between the six different analyses the gam output provides a generalized cross validation gcv score which estimates the model prediction error the gam results allowed for retrieving the ri of the different smooth terms on etc which provided an indication regarding the rank and the extent of influence that each predictor variable had on water consumption during each phenological stage we used caret package in r kuhn 2008 to derive the relative variable importance for each of the six growth stages examined finally a pattern of the response of etc to the two most influential variables of the model was extracted excluding the seasons covariate this was performed using either a contour plot or a 3 dimentional grid plot that enabled viewing the combined effect between two covariates on etc 2 5 integration of crop evapotranspiration and leaf area index and their relationships in accordance with specific objective number 3 the relationship between the lai and etc throughout the growing season and for each phenological growth stage was quantified this was done by computing the area under the curve auc for both lai and etc against days of season on a whole season scale seasons 2013 2017 and for each phenological stage this analysis was conducted using desctools package in r signorell et al 2019 the resulting values were divided by 5 seasons in order to get the mean auc per stage or entire season and divided again by the duration of each stage and by 183 days for the entire season to determine the daily mean auc values of etc and lai for each stage and the entire season maximum lai values for the mean seasonal and phenological stage profiles of lai values were extracted using tsrepr package in r laurinec 2018 finally the etc auc value was divided by the lai auc value for each stage and for the entire season in order to determine the ratio between etc and lai for these periods 3 results 3 1 temporal dependence of etc the non stationary structure of the time series of etc and its predictors was evaluated using the box pierce test which resulted in a significant autocorrelation structure of the etc time series at k 183 days χ 48 702 df 183 p 01 the five predictors u10 tmean rhmean rn and lai were all temporally autocorrelated as well p 01 for all cases fig 2 a shows the seasonal structure of the measured etc data across five growing seasons while the inter seasonal variation was quantified according to the growth stages fig 2 b shows the acf plot for k 183 with y axis having correlation r values ranging between 0 63 and 1 the plot demonstrates strong dependencies between smaller lags with k 9 having r 0 8 negative correlations were determined for 46 k 140 the pacf fig 2 c indicates significant temporal dependencies at k 5 lai tmean and rn had significant autocorrelations at k 4 rhmean had significant autocorrelations at k 3 and u10 did not show temporal autocorrelations in pacf 3 2 multiple nonlinear regression using generalized additive models the gams for each phenological stage and the entire season resulted in medium high adjusted r2 values and low nrmserange values and gcv scores table 2 higher gcv scores were determined for the entire season period and stage 1 indicating a slightly lower performance of these models fig 3 shows the ri of each predictor of vine etc per stage and for the entire season overall the temporal variables seasons and days were highly dominant in explaining etc variance with ri percentage ranges of 10 58 33 03 and 10 58 44 81 respectively among the meteorological and lai covariates there was a high shift of importance percentages across the different stages while lai was the strongest driver for the entire season and during stages 0 and 3 44 81 59 57 and 33 54 respectively tmean had the highest influence during stages 1 and 2 48 14 and 23 36 respectively stage 4 was most influenced by seasons 32 58 followed by rhmean 20 42 rn and u10 consistently had the lowest impact on etc throughout the growing season the gam analyses showed that several smoothed covariates did not significantly impact the model the smooth terms for rn for the entire season analysis rhmean u10 and rn for stage 0 rn for stage 1 and tmean for stage 4 analyses the relationships between the the smooth terms of the covariates that were included in the gam analyses and etc are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 is a contour diagram that shows the daily relationship between the smooth terms of lai and etc and identifies temporal patterns associated with this relationship the main patterns are defined in fig 4 as follows a a during stage 0 etc was highly variable and the amount of leaf area had varying influence on etc depending on the day of season within the stage etc values increased over time b during stage 1 the same portion of leaf area as in stage 0 generated higher rates of evapotranspiration however this trend was unstable and shifted sharply c stage 2 which had the longest duration 52 days was characterized by the highest etc values for any specific lai value actual lai values during this stage ranged between 0 79 and 1 18 d etc dynamics during stage 3 had similar features as in stage 1 only with a reversed direction high variablity of lai as this stage progressed and influenced the patterns of etc e the post harvest stage 4 showed patterns of lower etc rates however these were still higher values than during stage 0 for similar levels of leaf coverage water consumption during different stages was unequally affected by the various predictors fig 5 presents the relationships between the two most affecting covariates smooth terms in gam excluding seasons fig 5a is a 3 dimensional representation of the two most influencing covariates during the entire season as presented in fig 4 fig 5b illustrates the low etc values that corresponded to stage 0 with increasing values as time advanced at this stage lower lai values affected etc as much as higher lai values ranges of 0 0 4 and 0 8 1 during stage 1 fig 5c temperature ri 48 14 was plotted against lai ri 17 84 to examine their combined effect on water consumption higher temperature along with larger canopy cover were related to higher values of etc during stage 2 tmean was again a strong driver and was plotted against days fig 5d generating fluctuations in water consumption throughout this stage etc increased with higher tmean values while values of tmean 35 c for all days were characterized by decreased etc rates during stage 3 fig 5e etc progressively decreased with time with larger values of lai having more impact on etc at the beginning of this stage in the beginning of stage 4 fig 5f rhmean had a strong negative influence on water consumption while the second half of this stage was characterized by a moderate decrease in etc as rhmean increased during this stage etc continued to steadily decrease with time 3 3 integration of crop evapotranspiration and leaf area index and their relationships the daily mean etc that was calculated for the entire season using the auc analysis was 3 7 mm day 1 table 3 stage 0 and stage 4 had lower daily means while stage 2 had the highest daily mean of water consumption daily mean lai was 0 81 for the entire season while stage 3 had the highest daily mean value daily mean etc values were highly variable during stages 1 3 ranging between 3 87 and 5 22 mm day 1 while lai values were quite constant ranging between 0 95 and 1 01 maximum lai for seasonal means of each stage was similar during stages 1 4 range 0 98 1 08 while the value for stage 0 was 0 77 the ratio between water consumption and leaf area l day 1 m 2 was highest during stage 2 and lowest during stage 0 the value of the ratio between etc and lai integrations were similar for stages 0 and 4 4 discussion the structure of etc throughout the growing seasons was time dependent and influenced by meteorological and physiological processes to quantify etc patterns based on data collected during five consecutive growing seasons we chose a non linear regression model that enabled identifying the relative influence and pattern of each covariate on water consumption lai was found to have the strongest impact on etc among the meteorological and vegetative covariates and therefore was more thoroughly analyzed for patterns and variations during the different phenological stages 4 1 temporal autocorrelation the choice of a regression model used for analyzing relations between variables determines the success of the model performance the information that is extracted from the data and the interpretation of patterns and relationships between covariates therefore a regression model should be chosen based on the dataset its structure the number of observations and multiple variables and statistical parameters associated with these variables the presence of temporal autocorrelation in time series datasets should be acknowledged and considered in the process of modeling lag models such as acf and pacf are effective in defining the structure of the dataset and selecting the suitable model for analysis of the data bhaskaran et al 2013 the box pierce test results indicated that all of the variables constructing this study s dataset aside from u10 were non stationary and therefore the analysis of etc and its drivers should control for time dependency there are numerous techniques to model autocorrelated time series including transformation of the data to obtain stationarity using logarithms brockwell and davis 2002 differencing box and pierce 1970 box cox transformation box and cox 1964 and others however in our current study the etc variable as well as most of its predictors displayed a seasonal recursive structure that was time dependent and the autocorrelated structure of the data was important for the detection of patterns for the entire season and the growth stages that composed it accounting for the temporally varying response variable was done in this case by incorporating time variables i e days and season dominici et al 2002 the time variables which are associated with temporal dynamics enabled capture rather than elimination of the seasonal and within seasonal patterns of the data 4 2 within season temporal patterns of etc and its drivers the patterns that were defined for etc and the multiple factors that influenced its intra seasonal characteristics were quantified and analyzed using three techniques first ri of each of the meteorological and canopy covariates as well as the time components on etc were computed at the whole season scale and during each growth stage second the pattern of the relationships between etc and its drivers was defined throughout the season at unit resolution i e days c etc third the interrelations of the covariates and their effect on etc were quantified at the phenological stage scale seven covariates were considered and only the most influential ones for each growth stage are presented and discussed the time covariates days and seasons had pronounced effects on etc variability days was highly dominant for the entire season fig 3 because of the seasonal structure of the data fig 2a during stage 0 when vegetative growth was rapid and demonstrated a steep increase in values munitz et al 2019 lai was found to have a very strong effect on etc nearly 60 this corresponds to the findings of williams and ayars 2005 and ohana levi et al 2019 that showed a high impact of lai on etc throughout the season canopy area lai in vineyards for wine production undergo considerable agro technical management hedging topping unfertile shoot removal and wire lifting throughout the growing season subsequently affecting water consumption levels stages 1 and 2 were characterized by stabilization of leaf area development table 3 and further increase in etc values especially during stage 1 during stage 2 etc reached its highest values tmean was a strong driver during these stages since june july and august corresponding to stages 1 and 2 are characterized by constant high temperatures that generated higher evapotranspiration rates stage 3 marked a rapid decrease in etc values due to physiological deterioration and stomatal closure as well as a decrease in solar radiation hours therefore during this stage lai was again the most influential covariate ri 33 54 the post harvest period stage 4 was highly influenced by rhmean this was due to lack of influence of the other covariates temperature was still high and constant during stage 4 and had a non significant effect on the regression model while water consumption sharply decreased due to low stomatal conductivity in senescing leaves ben asher et al 2006 netzer et al 2009 fig b1 therefore the time covariates days and seasons as well as rhmean provided the majority of ri summing up to 73 29 the seasons covariate was found to highly affect etc the 2015 growing season was characterized by lower etc values relative to the other seasons fig 2 owing to two major phenomena the first had to do with late leaf emergence during stage 0 that year generating lower etc rates than usual stage 0 during 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 growing seasons displayed mean etc values ranging between 1 34 1 69 mm day 1 while during stage 0 of 2015 the mean etc was 1 01 mm day 1 this corresponds to lower tmean values during this period in 2015 mean temperatures of 17 93 c in 2015 compared to a range of 19 7 21 29 c for all other seasons which most likely affected the normal vegetative development of the canopy while also generating low etc values the rest of the season was characterized by lower etc values although neither lai nor tmean were statistically different from the other growing seasons in an attempt to understand the reasons for this exceptional phenomenon we checked stomatal conductance gs data stomata control the gas fluxes from and into the leaves gs represents the rate of passage of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere stomatal conductivity values are useful indicators for physiological functionality and viability abiotic stress causing factors like salinity or drought as well as biotic stressors lead to decrease in stomatal function midday gs measurements available for the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons see appendix b for further detail at one week interval measures were coupled into two week intervals to generate a larger number of observations for higher statistical accuracy the findings show that 50 of the measures of gs during 2015 were significantly lower than gs values measured in 2013 and 2014 growing seasons mostly during stages 2 and 3 while g s values for 2013 and 2014 were similar fig b1 table b1 equivalent trends were found for non lysimeter commercial vines in the field indicating an environmental effect during 2015 which limited stomatal conductivity during the second half of stage 2 and in stages 3 4 we then examined vapor pressure deficit vpd for the five seasons as a function of tmean and rhmean which also indicated statistically different values for 2015 compared to the other seasons during stage 4 table b3 furthermore the standard deviation for gs in 2015 was much higher with 1494 5 kpa compared to a range of 1201 1 1365 9 kpa during the other four growing seasons table b2 this corresponds to previous knowledge regarding stomatal response in grapevines to increasing vpd zhang et al 2011 rogiers et al 2017 stomatal conductivity affects water consumption thus the unusual gs values during the second half of the 2015 growing season could explain the lower than normal etc values although seasonal etc trends are usually similar among seasons handling of these datasets should carefully consider environmental impacts that might cause specific or seasonal deviations e g williams et al 2003 the seasonal pattern of etc and its drivers was quantified using gam based on the dataset of five consecutive growing seasons we provided the pattern of the most influential variables lai and days which together provided ri of 67 28 to etc variability leaf area response to time affects etc in an inconsistent fashion along the season generally higher etc values corresponded to higher lai values throughout the season since a larger area of leaves generates more transpiration however this gradient in etc increase together with lai showed a non linear pattern and high variability of change in water consumption along the lai scale from our data analysis it is clear that at each stage etc dynamics and patterns were affected by different processes occurring at the plant level and associated with the meteorological drivers along with temporal effects the results also demonstrate an association between the starting and ending days of the phenological stages and the dynamics of etc in fig 4 for example large shifts in etc levels and accompanying response to lai occur in proximity to the division between phenological stages black dotted lines defined according to flowering and berry development similar to etc the developmental stages of grapevine are affected by meteorological conditions and leaf area status greer and weedon 2013 martínez lüscher et al 2016 verdenal et al 2017 therefore the seasonal dynamics of the phenological stages may serve as a proxy for etc levels during stage 0 young leaves generated lower etc rates due to lower stomatal activity kriedemann et al 1970 petrie et al 2000 munitz et al 2016 fig b1 the effect of lai on etc during this stage was highly variable figs 4 5b due to several processes occurring concurrently the ratio between evaporation and transpiration changes as the canopy develops shading more soil surface area and altering the total effect on water consumption montoro et al 2016 munitz et al 2019 additionally as leaf area develops the variability of age among the leaves increases with leaves of different ages producing different rates of transpiration due to varying stomatal conductivity greer 2012 in stage 1 there was an increase in the number of new leaves more frequent mechanical interventions in controlling the canopy size as well as high variability in most of the meteorological drivers therefore the changes in vine water consumption were inconsistent over this stage fig 4 with tmean being the most dominant driver generating higher etc values with increases in temperature moreover high temperatures may accelerate vegetative growth affecting etc the last few days in stage 1 were characterized by a more moderate effect on etc due to the decrease in stomatal conductivity as a response to higher vpd values associated with higher temperatures syvertsen and levy 1982 stage 2 with a duration of 52 days was characterized by higher stability of etc values fig 4 tmean was the most influential covariate with higher values producing increased water consumption fig 5d however once temperature increased above the optimal conditions photosynthetic activity became less efficient while transpiration was still high the consequent response of stomatal closure to regulate transpiration causing etc to decrease at temperatures higher than 35 c was similarly reported in studies conducted on other plants including cotton wheat and red spruce lu et al 1998 day 2000 the large variability in etc response to time may be attributed to shifts in canopy structure due to management processes such as wire lifting and hedging conducted during this stage williams and ayars 2005 whole plant water consumption is driven by stomatal conductivity of a large variation of leaves of different phenological ages each transpiring different amounts of water this variation depends on the leaves physiological age position e g exposed to the sun shaded by canopy etc and agro technical leaf treatment removal of leaves leaves moved from shaded to exposed positions etc the interventions may have caused the resulting fluctuations of etc as a function of days there was a gradual decrease in etc during stage 3 lower stomatal conductivity during this stage fig b1 was associated with shorter days with less day light hours and lower solar radiation load pieruschka et al 2010 williams et al 2012 evapotranspiration decreased as stage 3 progressed due to lower transpiration rates and physiological deterioration hunter and visser 2017 stage 4 was characterized by lower levels of water consumption corresponding to decrease in g s values processes associated with canopy aging occurred in the post harvest stage the vines became increasingly subjected to physical and environmental drivers effects with higher rhmean values ri 20 42 negatively affecting etc values pereira et al 2011 4 3 crop evapotranspiration leaf area index relations the relationship between lai and etc was quantified for each phenological stage as another approach to determine the intra seasonal dynamics of water consumption and its most dominant driver table 3 our findings of etc dynamics throughout the growing season correspond to other works that considered phenological growth stage analyses in vines lópez urrea et al 2012 the highest change in lai occurred in the spring between stages 0 and 1 due to rapid leaf growth during stage 0 during this stage the difference between daily mean lai and maximum lai for seasonal means was also maximal indicating a steep growing curve correspondingly etc showed an accelerated increase in values between these stages during stages 1 3 canopy manipulations were conducted resulting in a very low variability of lai values with very low differences between daily lai means and maximum lai additionally stages 1 and 2 represented 60 120 days since bud break during which new leaves emerge continuously creating a consistent presence of 50 60 day old leaves characterized by high photosynthetic rates and high stomatal conductivity schubert et al 1996 etc during these periods therefore was highly variable due to successive development of new leaves along with higher temperature levels as the growing seasons progressed the etc lai ratio provided daily mean water consumption as mm day 1 per unit 1 m2 m 2 leaf area during one day for each phenological stage and for the entire period table 3 these dynamics are associated with the highest difference in ratios between stages 1 and 2 difference of 1 48 mm day 1 of water consumption per unit leaf area lai values were at their peak during stage 3 while etc was found to decrease due to leaf aging and decreased stomatal conductivity as well as meteorological effects mainly increase in rhmean values and possibly due to decrease in daylight hours which directly affect stomatal activity fig b1 during stage 4 mean seasonal maximum lai deviated from daily mean lai but not as much as during stage 0 the effect of the presence of fruit on etc requires scientific attention while some have reported that stomatal conductance was not affected by the presence or absence of fruit petrie et al 2000 others reported higher stomatal conductance when fruit load is higher naor et al 1997 the lysimeter system provides accurate means to measure the effect of fruit load on etc at the whole plant level during all the years of this study we did not record any significant differences in water consumption levels before and immediately after harvest during 2017 all the clusters were removed from the grapevines in three of the six lysimeters at the bloom time no significant differences were found between etc levels of the vines with and without clusters signifying that the etc lai ratio is a representative measure of vine transpiration rate per leaf area 5 summary and conclusions water consumption throughout the grapevine growing seasons is highly variable this study used non linear modeling techniques to quantify etc temporal patterns as well as the dynamics and interrelations among the factors affecting etc during the growing season the analyses were performed at the phenological stage scale as commonly shown in studies that explore various types of within seasonal dynamics and used a long term dataset composed of five consecutive growing seasons which is sufficient to infer patterns of evapotranspiration and its drivers for cabernet sauvignon vines grown in similar conditions the dataset was treated as time series acknowledging its temporal autocorrelation and accounting for time dependencies and effects a non linear regression model that accounted for temporal variations both daily and seasonally produced highly accurate fitted values and enabled reliable quantification of the ri and dynamics of each covariate for each growth stage temporal variations of meteorological variables as well as vegetative patterns were found to have a strong interchangeable influence on water consumption with growing amounts of data that are time dependent from agricultural fields complex modeling techniques that can account for temporal non stationarity and non linear distributions should be developed and applied to studies that involve inter and intra seasonal pattern analysis moreover the modeling process of temporal patterns and relations between different covariates and water consumption may be further developed and used for etc prediction and may facilitate wine grape production while assessing etc as the basis for applying deficit irrigation phenological growth stages are linked to water consumption dynamics since these two factors are affected by similar drivers predictions of etc may also make use of these interactions and phenological stages may be incorporated as an additional predictor variable this study focused on etc lai relations since water consumption is highly affected by leaf area but also due to the high potential of intervention and management effects on vineyard canopy properties while environmental meteorological factors may not be controlled and altered leaf area may be easily modified and changed its structure can be reshaped and its development partially constrained therefore it is imperative to deepen research regarding the interrelations between leaf area and meteorological factors as well as the effect of these non linear relations on water consumption both inter and intra seasonally to enhance knowledge and implications for vineyard

additive models gams extend the approach of generalized linear models by including smooth functions of the covariates in order to address non linear relationships between response and explanatory variables maindonald 2010 in this study the smoothing of the covariates was accomplished with spline functions a spline curve is a piecewise polynomial curve that joins two or more polynomial curves where the locations of the joints are defined as knots durrleman and simon 1989 eilers and marx 2002 the shape of the spline can be controlled through the choice of number of knots and their exact location to allow flexibility where the trend shifts rapidly and at the same time avoid overfitting where the trend does not fluctuate much another choice that must be made is the degree of polynomials to be used between knots for example polynomial of degree 1 is a straight line the individual curves for each segment need to meet at the knots in a smooth fashion to create a continuous curve for polynomials of degree n both the spline function and the first n 1 derivatives are continuous at the knots cubic splines as used in this study are simply splines with polynomial degree of 3 if k knots are used fitting a polynomial of degree n in cubic regression spline n 3 requires k n 1 regression parameters which includes the intercept in our case k 3 1 higher order splines require more degrees of freedom as the order of splines increase durrleman and simon 1989 croxford 2016 higher number of knots might result in overfitting of the model if the sample size is small a small number of observations should be used in order to ensure that there are some observations between two knots representing the variability of the covariate and fitting the polynomial if the sample size is large and the covariate changes rapidly it is appropriate to use a large number of knots the locations of the knots are spaced by the model so that there is a sufficient number of observations between two consecutive knots durrleman and simon 1989 an optimal number of knots will lead to an intermediate amount of smoothing that does not cause under or overfitting of the data in penalized splines the coefficients or weights of the regression model are constrained in order to optimize the fit and avoid overfitting by the model weights are assigned to the splines to penalize overfitting and at the same time allow the splines to fit the data griggs 2013 the regression model treats the smoothed covariates as variables in the model thus enabling use of any regression model with associated outputs such as significance levels of the covariates their ri model performance etc durrleman and simon 1989 fig a1 shows the outputs of the smooth functions generated by the gam model

the maximum edf k 1 edf values that are much smaller than k 1 are not effective and will not smooth the covariate with a sufficient amount of knots wood 2017 the edf value reflects an estimate of the number of parameters that are needed to represent the smooth function and is an indication of the amount of non linearity of the smooth term for example u10 daily mean wind speed has an edf value of 1 meaning that the model penalized the smooth term to a simple linear relationship an edf larger than 1 defines a more complex non linear pattern wieling 2018 appendix b during the growing seasons of 2013 2015 stomatal conductance gs of the six lysimeter grown vines was measured on a weekly basis measurements were conducted each season between the second week of may and the second week of september three leaves from each of the vines were measured each week summing up to 18 measured leaves gs was measured at solar noon using a portable gas analyzer li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa equipped with a 6 cm2 chamber measurements were conducted at light intensity of 1000 ppfd 6400 02b led light source 10 blue ambient humidity and temperature reference co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol

were discarded due to malfunction of the device that resulted in outlier values occasional measurements were also eliminated due to outliers and inconsistencies with the general levels of stomatal conductance during specific sampling days the measured gs values are represented in fig b1 stomatal conductance levels during the first week of the sampled seasons were usually low in this case excluding the 2013 growing season followed by quite stable values until stage 3 week 32 then a gradual decrease in gs continues until the end of the growing seasons e g williams et al 2012 in 2015 gs values were found to decrease during the second half of stage 2 week 29 with smaller ranges of values concentrated around the median table b1 summarizes the differences between the unusual values measured in 2015 and those of 2013 and 2014 to understand the differences between gs values during 2015 and the other two growing seasons vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated as a function of tmean and rhmean for the growing seasons that were studied 2013 2017 the results tables b2 and b3 show that the vpd values for 2015 were found to vary considerably more than for the rest of the seasons with higher standard deviation values in addition inter seasonal comparison revealed that for stage 4 2015 had significantly different vpd values than for the other growing seasons during

10779,evapotranspiration etc levels are influenced by the area of plant canopy atmospheric conditions plant physiology and soil water relations which are all subjected to changes throughout the growing season understanding temporal trends variability and interactions between etc and its governing factors is valuable for modeling predictions and vineyard water management our research objective was to quantify temporal patterns of etc of cabernet sauvignon grapevines and affecting meteorological temperature relative humidity radiation wind speed and vegetative leaf area factors during the growing season and within five phenological growth stages 0 4 temporal variability of etc was modeled using five consecutive seasons of lysimeter time series data capturing the non stationary nature of the data in terms of seasonality trends and within seasonal patterns the temporal dependence of etc and its drivers throughout growing seasons was evaluated using the box pierce test autocorrelation function acf and partial acf patterns of the relations between etc and its covariates were quantified using multiple nonlinear regression the generalized additive model gam at the full growing season scale and for each phenological stage further examination on the effect of leaf area on etc was conducted using area under curve calculations and etc leaf area ratio the results demonstrate temporal autocorrelation structure of the data supporting the incorporation of time variables in the gam each phenological stage had a unique composition of relative importance of the covariates with variation in etc being largely explained by time variables ordinarily etc in early season stage 0 and at late season stage 3 approaching harvest was mostly influenced by leaf area dynamics while in mid season it was highly affected by temperature the gam enabled quantification of within seasonal patterns of interrelations between covariates and their effects on etc and revealed inter seasonal variability due to dissimilar meteorological conditions agro technical management affects canopy dimensions and structure thus influencing etc leaf area relations keywords phenological

affected by the structure and area of the plant canopy atmospheric conditions plant physiology e g stomatal response to various processes including canopy senescence atmospheric evaporation rates and biotic factors and soil related conditions allen et al 1998 munitz et al 2019 numerous techniques have been suggested to determine etc including in situ or lysimeter based measurements of water

true context of growing vegetation pereira et al 2015 have been established as an accurate source of water consumption data hargreaves 1974 wright 1990 etc measurements in vines are documented by using either drainage lysimeters evans et al 1993 netzer et al 2009 munitz et al 2019 or weighing lysimeters williams et al 2003 lópez urrea et al 2012 irrigation management in agricultural crops often aspires to decrease water input and provide more efficient water use practices as a method to increase crop profitability in wine grape cultivation there is a paramount demand to acquire accurate etc data to support deficit irrigation modeling which in red wine grapes is fundamental for determining the amount of grapes and their quality and thus wine value van leeuwen et al 2009 munitz et al 2016 shtein et al 2017 netzer et al 2019 quantification of etc is widely used to assess the amount of water consumed by the plant where it is imperative to assess crop water demand to design irrigation systems lópez urrea et al 2006 develop irrigation models munitz et al 2016 2019 netzer et al 2019 and increase efficiency in vineyard management multiple factors and drivers affect etc patterns throughout the growing season weather parameters crop characteristics and environmental conditions allen et al 1998 including their temporal variability dynamics and interrelations are all expected to influence etc variability defining the factors that affect dynamics throughout the season and evaluating expected physiological and vegetative performance may assist in understanding etc patterns and provide projection models for vineyards with no direct etc measurements lopez urrea et al 2012 used weighing lysimeters in a vitis vinifera cv tempranillo vineyard to quantify etc variability and related processes that effected it including canopy cover picón toro et al 2012 also studied tempranillo grapevines by using a long term lysimeteric derived dataset to assess the relationship between water consumption canopy size and associated thermal time williams et al 2003 studied the relationships between etc associated factors such as leaf area net radiation and temperature in thompson seedless grapevines in california the same experiment also recognized the association between leaf area and vine water consumption johnson et al 2005 in a study conducted in spain montoro et al 2017 fitted several linear regression models to evaluate the strengths of relations between tempranillo grapevine transpiration derived from lysimeters and several meterological variables acquired from a weather station these included relative humidiy global solar radiation air temperature wind speed vapour pressure deficit and nocturnal co2 flux their findings show a strong relationship between transpiration and air temperature r2 0 85 followed by wind speed r2 0 73 etc drivers frequently feature non linear relationships that should be considered while modeling these impacts furthermore as etc time series as well as most of its drivers are measured at a high temporal resolution the temporal variability and autocorrelation of datasets are critical for understanding processes and their interactions the temporal pattern of etc and its associated affecting factors should be accounted for using a regression model while capturing the non stationarity of the data in terms of seasonality long term trends daily variations and within seasonal patterns other disciplines have successfully incorporated such an approach with non stationary meteorological data for example urban ozone levels were associated with various non stationary meteorological predictors accounting for temporal effects using seasonal terms in a regression model bloomfield et al 1996 in a regression analysis of atmospheric conditions affecting human mortality in alabama and pennsylvania time of season was incorporated as a predictor to account for intra seasonal timing of mortality events and consecutive days was an additional input that controlled for temporal variations of the data smoyer et al 2000 in a study conducted in oslo a set of meteorological predictors along with traffic volume were chosen to analyze air pollution applying a generalized additive model gam with two time variables day number which controlled for long term seasonal variation in the dataset and hour of day accounting for diurnal time dependencies of the covariates aldrin and haff 2005 at a given location grapevine etc variability is usually similar over different seasons aside from specific variations due to particular distinct meteorological events e g montoro et al 2008 along each season there is high variability in vine water consumption as the crop growth cycle progresses evans et al 1993 zhang et al 2010 lópez urrea et al 2012 munitz et al 2019 commonly studies classify within seasonal sub periods such as phenological growth stages or months for specific definition of intra seasonal variation in crop related dynamics azevedo et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 lópez urrea et al 2012 while some studies have dealt with the impact of meteorological and vegetative factors on vine water consumption lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2017 wang et al 2019 there is still a lack of information on relative importance ri of each predictor on water consumption to the best of our knowledge no work has dealt with quantifying the intra seasonal variability of the interrelations of meteorological and vegetative factors affecting water consumption in grapevines the objective of this study was to quantify the temporal patterns of etc and its drivers for cabernet sauvignon vines during the growing season specific objectives were 1 to examine temporal autoregressive features of etc and its drivers throughout the growing season 2 to identify temporal patterns of the relations between etc and meteorological covariates as well as a vegetative predictor at the full season scale and for each phenological growth stage and 3 to quantify the relationship between lai and etc for the entire growing season and for each growth stage 2 methodology 2 1 study site this study was based on experimental data collected by and specified in munitz et al 2019 the vineyard is located in the central mountain region of israel lat 32 2 n long 35 e at an altitude of 759 m above sea level the climate is semi arid mediterranean with rainfall events commonly occurring during winter multiannual average of 415 mm and warm dry summers the experiment was conducted in the kida commercial vineyard planted in 2007 with vitis vinifera cabernet sauvignon vines and trained to a 2 m high vertical shoot positioning vsp trellis system with two foliage wires vine spacing was 3 m between rows and 1 5 m between neighboring vines with a density of 2222 vines per hectare and rows oriented east west 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 monitoring crop evapotranspiration leaf area index and meteorological factors the etc dataset was acquired from six drainage lysimeters fig 1 located in the second row of the kida vineyard the system included six polyethylene 1 47 m3 containers 1 3 m high x1 2 m diameter filled with local terra rossa soil 36 4 sand 30 6 silt and 33 clay with bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 buried in the ground with their surfaces aligned with the soil surface the lysimeters each included a bottom layer of highly conductive porous rockwool media in contact with the soil and two drainage pipes connected to the base of each tank extending the rockwool downward 40 cm from the bottom soil boundary the rockwool layer and extension disallowed saturation at the lower soil boundary while permitting movement of water out of the soil and leachate collection ben gal and shani 2002 the leachate was further drained to a scaling system placed in a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 7 m outside the vineyard fig 1a during the winter of 2011 a four year old vine was replanted in each tank the lysimeter vines were treated with the same growing practices as the local commercial vineyard except for irrigation each lysimeter was irrigated with a tailor made computer controlled system crystal vision kibbutz samar israel with irrigation amounts that exceeded the estimated daily water consumption of vines by 20 30 thus ensuring optimum soil water conditions allen et al 1998 in this paper we considered the data of five growing seasons between 2013 and 2017 the time series data from the six lysimeters were averaged and occasional missing values were determined using a weighted moving average algorithm with a simple moving average window 4 days applied with the imputets package in r moritz and bartz beielstein 2017 whole plant leaf area of each lysimeter grown vine was quantified using leaf area index lai indirect measurements with a canopy analysis system sunscan model ss1 r3 bf3 delta t devices cambridge u lai was measured once a week close to midday with zenith angle under 30 the lai for each vine one in each lysimeter was calculated from 31 observations of equal spacing 10 cm for further information on lai measurement techniques and validation see netzer et al 2009 and munitz et al 2019 the six values one for each lysimeter grown vine were averaged a linear interpolation between each consecutive pair of mean lai values was performed to generate daily lai values using zoo package in r zeileis and grothendieck 2005 weather data were obtained from a meteorological station located in the vineyard for further details regarding the sensors and equipment see munitz et al 2019 the meteorological data included hourly measurements from which only the data gathered between 06 00 and 18 00 1 1 during the growing season sunset occurs after 19 00 defined as active hours of transpiration dragoni et al 2006 were selected and averaged daily mean values of meteorological data were acquired for temperature tmean wind speed measured at 10 m height u10 and relative humidity rhmean daily total solar radiation rn was an accumulation of 10 min solar radiation measures missing values were filled based on measurements from talmon regional meteorological station located 20 km from kida vineyard at an altitude of 638 m above sea level 2 2 2 determining phenological growth stages in the vineyard the growing season was segmented into five phenological stages munitz et al 2019 rogiers et al 2017 stage 0 from bud break to bloom stage 1 from full bloom to bunch closure stage 2 from bunch closure to veraison stage 3 from veraison to harvest and stage 4 post harvest until leaf defoliation table 1 whole seasons were defined as beginning on april 1 and ending on september 30 each year while specific start dates of each stage varied between seasons analyzing within seasonal patterns of water consumption with regard to the growth stages required uniform start dates for the different stages for all five seasons therefore the data is presented according to averaged start date for the five growing seasons 2 3 temporal dependence of crop evapotranspiration and its drivers temporal patterns analyses of vine etc and its drivers throughout growing seasons and phenological stages may benefit from higher accuracy levels when the time dependent structure i e is non stationarity and the strong seasonal component of the time series dataset are considered moreover if the dataset is indeed temporally autocorrelated then the relationships between the response and predictor variables should incorporate temporal components in order to account for variability in time a time series is considered non stationary when its statistical properties i e mean variance and covariance are not constant over time this may be evaluated using a statistical test for checking independence in a time series in this study we used the box pierce test to check for non stationarity of etc the meteorological variables and lai additionally we applied the autocorrelation function acf to the etc time series to check for correlations between different lags k where k 183 since each season has 183 observations days in addition we applied the partial acf pacf to check the correlation at a certain lag after removing the effect of any correlations at shorter lags cowpertwait and metcalfe 2009 the autocorrelation for a specific lag is comprised of both the direct and indirect correlations between observations where indirect correlations are a linear function of the correlation of a certain lag with lags at intervening time steps the pacf seeks to remove these effects and define only the direct temporal correlations between observations at any lag the significant lags indicated the extent of dependence of the time series or its autocorrelation the box pierce test acf and pacf were carried out using stats package in r r core team 2013 2 4 multiple nonlinear regression using generalized additive models in order to fulfill specific objective 2 and characterize the response of etc to its predicting variables throughout the growing season and for each phenological stage a regression model was required the relationships between etc and the meteorological variables as well as the vegetative predictor lai were not linear therefore a non linear multiple regression model was selected the generalized additive model gam is an additive model technique where the influence of each covariate is captured through a smooth function hastie and tibshirani 1986 and the smoothness estimation integrated into the model wood 2012 these non parametric scatterplot smoothers can be applied to the covariates to maximize the association to the dependent variable the smooth patterns of the covariates can be either linear or non linear which provides high flexibility to gam in this study we used the spline function for smoothing the covariates see appendix a gam allows control of the smoothness of the predictor functions and their wiggliness to penalize models with overly complicated component functions and to avoid overfitting wood 2012 the dataset that was used was time dependent meaning that both the dependent variable i e etc and the independent variables did not change at a constant rate over time therefore two additional predictors were added to the model to control for temporal variability and trend ramsay et al 2003 days of season 1 183 beginning april 1 and ending september 30 and seasons 1 5 categorizing the growing seasons between 2013 and 2017 respectively this was done to quantify the extent of influence that time had on the relationship between etc and its covariates and control for the variation explained by time dependent predictors the model included seven predictor variables u10 rn tmean rhmean lai days of season days and seasons gam was applied to the entire dataset and then to each of the growth stages for the five consecutive growing seasons using mgcv package in r wood 2017 the following formula eq 1 schematically represents the gam model 1 etc ƒ 1 lai ƒ2 tmean ƒ3 rhmean ƒ4 rn ƒ5 u10 ƒ6 days ƒ7 seasons ε where ƒ 1 ƒ 2 ƒ 3 ƒ 4 ƒ 5 and ƒ 6 are the smooth functions estimated by the model for each of the predictor variables and ε is the error term the formula for all of the six models entire seasons five growth stages was calculated using the same parameters and specified penalized cubic regression spline smoothing functions for all seven covariates each receiving a different number of degrees of freedom associated with the spline smooth see appendix a for further details on spline smoothing function the distribution of the response variable was defined as gaussian the association between the predictors and the response variable was evaluated using several statistics provided by the model the first is the pseudo adjusted r2 that defines the extent of variability of the response variable explained by the smooth terms i e the spline function of the predictors penalized according to the number of predictors in the model moreover an approximate significance p value for each smooth term enabled us to determine which smooth terms were significantly different from zero indicating a certain contribution to the model and an association to the response variable the model performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse between measured and fitted values of etc using metrics package in r hamner et al 2018 additionally a normalized root mean squared error to the range of the measured values of the response variable nrmserange was calculated so that the model performance could be compared between the six different analyses the gam output provides a generalized cross validation gcv score which estimates the model prediction error the gam results allowed for retrieving the ri of the different smooth terms on etc which provided an indication regarding the rank and the extent of influence that each predictor variable had on water consumption during each phenological stage we used caret package in r kuhn 2008 to derive the relative variable importance for each of the six growth stages examined finally a pattern of the response of etc to the two most influential variables of the model was extracted excluding the seasons covariate this was performed using either a contour plot or a 3 dimentional grid plot that enabled viewing the combined effect between two covariates on etc 2 5 integration of crop evapotranspiration and leaf area index and their relationships in accordance with specific objective number 3 the relationship between the lai and etc throughout the growing season and for each phenological growth stage was quantified this was done by computing the area under the curve auc for both lai and etc against days of season on a whole season scale seasons 2013 2017 and for each phenological stage this analysis was conducted using desctools package in r signorell et al 2019 the resulting values were divided by 5 seasons in order to get the mean auc per stage or entire season and divided again by the duration of each stage and by 183 days for the entire season to determine the daily mean auc values of etc and lai for each stage and the entire season maximum lai values for the mean seasonal and phenological stage profiles of lai values were extracted using tsrepr package in r laurinec 2018 finally the etc auc value was divided by the lai auc value for each stage and for the entire season in order to determine the ratio between etc and lai for these periods 3 results 3 1 temporal dependence of etc the non stationary structure of the time series of etc and its predictors was evaluated using the box pierce test which resulted in a significant autocorrelation structure of the etc time series at k 183 days χ 48 702 df 183 p 01 the five predictors u10 tmean rhmean rn and lai were all temporally autocorrelated as well p 01 for all cases fig 2 a shows the seasonal structure of the measured etc data across five growing seasons while the inter seasonal variation was quantified according to the growth stages fig 2 b shows the acf plot for k 183 with y axis having correlation r values ranging between 0 63 and 1 the plot demonstrates strong dependencies between smaller lags with k 9 having r 0 8 negative correlations were determined for 46 k 140 the pacf fig 2 c indicates significant temporal dependencies at k 5 lai tmean and rn had significant autocorrelations at k 4 rhmean had significant autocorrelations at k 3 and u10 did not show temporal autocorrelations in pacf 3 2 multiple nonlinear regression using generalized additive models the gams for each phenological stage and the entire season resulted in medium high adjusted r2 values and low nrmserange values and gcv scores table 2 higher gcv scores were determined for the entire season period and stage 1 indicating a slightly lower performance of these models fig 3 shows the ri of each predictor of vine etc per stage and for the entire season overall the temporal variables seasons and days were highly dominant in explaining etc variance with ri percentage ranges of 10 58 33 03 and 10 58 44 81 respectively among the meteorological and lai covariates there was a high shift of importance percentages across the different stages while lai was the strongest driver for the entire season and during stages 0 and 3 44 81 59 57 and 33 54 respectively tmean had the highest influence during stages 1 and 2 48 14 and 23 36 respectively stage 4 was most influenced by seasons 32 58 followed by rhmean 20 42 rn and u10 consistently had the lowest impact on etc throughout the growing season the gam analyses showed that several smoothed covariates did not significantly impact the model the smooth terms for rn for the entire season analysis rhmean u10 and rn for stage 0 rn for stage 1 and tmean for stage 4 analyses the relationships between the the smooth terms of the covariates that were included in the gam analyses and etc are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 is a contour diagram that shows the daily relationship between the smooth terms of lai and etc and identifies temporal patterns associated with this relationship the main patterns are defined in fig 4 as follows a a during stage 0 etc was highly variable and the amount of leaf area had varying influence on etc depending on the day of season within the stage etc values increased over time b during stage 1 the same portion of leaf area as in stage 0 generated higher rates of evapotranspiration however this trend was unstable and shifted sharply c stage 2 which had the longest duration 52 days was characterized by the highest etc values for any specific lai value actual lai values during this stage ranged between 0 79 and 1 18 d etc dynamics during stage 3 had similar features as in stage 1 only with a reversed direction high variablity of lai as this stage progressed and influenced the patterns of etc e the post harvest stage 4 showed patterns of lower etc rates however these were still higher values than during stage 0 for similar levels of leaf coverage water consumption during different stages was unequally affected by the various predictors fig 5 presents the relationships between the two most affecting covariates smooth terms in gam excluding seasons fig 5a is a 3 dimensional representation of the two most influencing covariates during the entire season as presented in fig 4 fig 5b illustrates the low etc values that corresponded to stage 0 with increasing values as time advanced at this stage lower lai values affected etc as much as higher lai values ranges of 0 0 4 and 0 8 1 during stage 1 fig 5c temperature ri 48 14 was plotted against lai ri 17 84 to examine their combined effect on water consumption higher temperature along with larger canopy cover were related to higher values of etc during stage 2 tmean was again a strong driver and was plotted against days fig 5d generating fluctuations in water consumption throughout this stage etc increased with higher tmean values while values of tmean 35 c for all days were characterized by decreased etc rates during stage 3 fig 5e etc progressively decreased with time with larger values of lai having more impact on etc at the beginning of this stage in the beginning of stage 4 fig 5f rhmean had a strong negative influence on water consumption while the second half of this stage was characterized by a moderate decrease in etc as rhmean increased during this stage etc continued to steadily decrease with time 3 3 integration of crop evapotranspiration and leaf area index and their relationships the daily mean etc that was calculated for the entire season using the auc analysis was 3 7 mm day 1 table 3 stage 0 and stage 4 had lower daily means while stage 2 had the highest daily mean of water consumption daily mean lai was 0 81 for the entire season while stage 3 had the highest daily mean value daily mean etc values were highly variable during stages 1 3 ranging between 3 87 and 5 22 mm day 1 while lai values were quite constant ranging between 0 95 and 1 01 maximum lai for seasonal means of each stage was similar during stages 1 4 range 0 98 1 08 while the value for stage 0 was 0 77 the ratio between water consumption and leaf area l day 1 m 2 was highest during stage 2 and lowest during stage 0 the value of the ratio between etc and lai integrations were similar for stages 0 and 4 4 discussion the structure of etc throughout the growing seasons was time dependent and influenced by meteorological and physiological processes to quantify etc patterns based on data collected during five consecutive growing seasons we chose a non linear regression model that enabled identifying the relative influence and pattern of each covariate on water consumption lai was found to have the strongest impact on etc among the meteorological and vegetative covariates and therefore was more thoroughly analyzed for patterns and variations during the different phenological stages 4 1 temporal autocorrelation the choice of a regression model used for analyzing relations between variables determines the success of the model performance the information that is extracted from the data and the interpretation of patterns and relationships between covariates therefore a regression model should be chosen based on the dataset its structure the number of observations and multiple variables and statistical parameters associated with these variables the presence of temporal autocorrelation in time series datasets should be acknowledged and considered in the process of modeling lag models such as acf and pacf are effective in defining the structure of the dataset and selecting the suitable model for analysis of the data bhaskaran et al 2013 the box pierce test results indicated that all of the variables constructing this study s dataset aside from u10 were non stationary and therefore the analysis of etc and its drivers should control for time dependency there are numerous techniques to model autocorrelated time series including transformation of the data to obtain stationarity using logarithms brockwell and davis 2002 differencing box and pierce 1970 box cox transformation box and cox 1964 and others however in our current study the etc variable as well as most of its predictors displayed a seasonal recursive structure that was time dependent and the autocorrelated structure of the data was important for the detection of patterns for the entire season and the growth stages that composed it accounting for the temporally varying response variable was done in this case by incorporating time variables i e days and season dominici et al 2002 the time variables which are associated with temporal dynamics enabled capture rather than elimination of the seasonal and within seasonal patterns of the data 4 2 within season temporal patterns of etc and its drivers the patterns that were defined for etc and the multiple factors that influenced its intra seasonal characteristics were quantified and analyzed using three techniques first ri of each of the meteorological and canopy covariates as well as the time components on etc were computed at the whole season scale and during each growth stage second the pattern of the relationships between etc and its drivers was defined throughout the season at unit resolution i e days c etc third the interrelations of the covariates and their effect on etc were quantified at the phenological stage scale seven covariates were considered and only the most influential ones for each growth stage are presented and discussed the time covariates days and seasons had pronounced effects on etc variability days was highly dominant for the entire season fig 3 because of the seasonal structure of the data fig 2a during stage 0 when vegetative growth was rapid and demonstrated a steep increase in values munitz et al 2019 lai was found to have a very strong effect on etc nearly 60 this corresponds to the findings of williams and ayars 2005 and ohana levi et al 2019 that showed a high impact of lai on etc throughout the season canopy area lai in vineyards for wine production undergo considerable agro technical management hedging topping unfertile shoot removal and wire lifting throughout the growing season subsequently affecting water consumption levels stages 1 and 2 were characterized by stabilization of leaf area development table 3 and further increase in etc values especially during stage 1 during stage 2 etc reached its highest values tmean was a strong driver during these stages since june july and august corresponding to stages 1 and 2 are characterized by constant high temperatures that generated higher evapotranspiration rates stage 3 marked a rapid decrease in etc values due to physiological deterioration and stomatal closure as well as a decrease in solar radiation hours therefore during this stage lai was again the most influential covariate ri 33 54 the post harvest period stage 4 was highly influenced by rhmean this was due to lack of influence of the other covariates temperature was still high and constant during stage 4 and had a non significant effect on the regression model while water consumption sharply decreased due to low stomatal conductivity in senescing leaves ben asher et al 2006 netzer et al 2009 fig b1 therefore the time covariates days and seasons as well as rhmean provided the majority of ri summing up to 73 29 the seasons covariate was found to highly affect etc the 2015 growing season was characterized by lower etc values relative to the other seasons fig 2 owing to two major phenomena the first had to do with late leaf emergence during stage 0 that year generating lower etc rates than usual stage 0 during 2013 2014 2016 and 2017 growing seasons displayed mean etc values ranging between 1 34 1 69 mm day 1 while during stage 0 of 2015 the mean etc was 1 01 mm day 1 this corresponds to lower tmean values during this period in 2015 mean temperatures of 17 93 c in 2015 compared to a range of 19 7 21 29 c for all other seasons which most likely affected the normal vegetative development of the canopy while also generating low etc values the rest of the season was characterized by lower etc values although neither lai nor tmean were statistically different from the other growing seasons in an attempt to understand the reasons for this exceptional phenomenon we checked stomatal conductance gs data stomata control the gas fluxes from and into the leaves gs represents the rate of passage of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere stomatal conductivity values are useful indicators for physiological functionality and viability abiotic stress causing factors like salinity or drought as well as biotic stressors lead to decrease in stomatal function midday gs measurements available for the 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons see appendix b for further detail at one week interval measures were coupled into two week intervals to generate a larger number of observations for higher statistical accuracy the findings show that 50 of the measures of gs during 2015 were significantly lower than gs values measured in 2013 and 2014 growing seasons mostly during stages 2 and 3 while g s values for 2013 and 2014 were similar fig b1 table b1 equivalent trends were found for non lysimeter commercial vines in the field indicating an environmental effect during 2015 which limited stomatal conductivity during the second half of stage 2 and in stages 3 4 we then examined vapor pressure deficit vpd for the five seasons as a function of tmean and rhmean which also indicated statistically different values for 2015 compared to the other seasons during stage 4 table b3 furthermore the standard deviation for gs in 2015 was much higher with 1494 5 kpa compared to a range of 1201 1 1365 9 kpa during the other four growing seasons table b2 this corresponds to previous knowledge regarding stomatal response in grapevines to increasing vpd zhang et al 2011 rogiers et al 2017 stomatal conductivity affects water consumption thus the unusual gs values during the second half of the 2015 growing season could explain the lower than normal etc values although seasonal etc trends are usually similar among seasons handling of these datasets should carefully consider environmental impacts that might cause specific or seasonal deviations e g williams et al 2003 the seasonal pattern of etc and its drivers was quantified using gam based on the dataset of five consecutive growing seasons we provided the pattern of the most influential variables lai and days which together provided ri of 67 28 to etc variability leaf area response to time affects etc in an inconsistent fashion along the season generally higher etc values corresponded to higher lai values throughout the season since a larger area of leaves generates more transpiration however this gradient in etc increase together with lai showed a non linear pattern and high variability of change in water consumption along the lai scale from our data analysis it is clear that at each stage etc dynamics and patterns were affected by different processes occurring at the plant level and associated with the meteorological drivers along with temporal effects the results also demonstrate an association between the starting and ending days of the phenological stages and the dynamics of etc in fig 4 for example large shifts in etc levels and accompanying response to lai occur in proximity to the division between phenological stages black dotted lines defined according to flowering and berry development similar to etc the developmental stages of grapevine are affected by meteorological conditions and leaf area status greer and weedon 2013 martínez lüscher et al 2016 verdenal et al 2017 therefore the seasonal dynamics of the phenological stages may serve as a proxy for etc levels during stage 0 young leaves generated lower etc rates due to lower stomatal activity kriedemann et al 1970 petrie et al 2000 munitz et al 2016 fig b1 the effect of lai on etc during this stage was highly variable figs 4 5b due to several processes occurring concurrently the ratio between evaporation and transpiration changes as the canopy develops shading more soil surface area and altering the total effect on water consumption montoro et al 2016 munitz et al 2019 additionally as leaf area develops the variability of age among the leaves increases with leaves of different ages producing different rates of transpiration due to varying stomatal conductivity greer 2012 in stage 1 there was an increase in the number of new leaves more frequent mechanical interventions in controlling the canopy size as well as high variability in most of the meteorological drivers therefore the changes in vine water consumption were inconsistent over this stage fig 4 with tmean being the most dominant driver generating higher etc values with increases in temperature moreover high temperatures may accelerate vegetative growth affecting etc the last few days in stage 1 were characterized by a more moderate effect on etc due to the decrease in stomatal conductivity as a response to higher vpd values associated with higher temperatures syvertsen and levy 1982 stage 2 with a duration of 52 days was characterized by higher stability of etc values fig 4 tmean was the most influential covariate with higher values producing increased water consumption fig 5d however once temperature increased above the optimal conditions photosynthetic activity became less efficient while transpiration was still high the consequent response of stomatal closure to regulate transpiration causing etc to decrease at temperatures higher than 35 c was similarly reported in studies conducted on other plants including cotton wheat and red spruce lu et al 1998 day 2000 the large variability in etc response to time may be attributed to shifts in canopy structure due to management processes such as wire lifting and hedging conducted during this stage williams and ayars 2005 whole plant water consumption is driven by stomatal conductivity of a large variation of leaves of different phenological ages each transpiring different amounts of water this variation depends on the leaves physiological age position e g exposed to the sun shaded by canopy etc and agro technical leaf treatment removal of leaves leaves moved from shaded to exposed positions etc the interventions may have caused the resulting fluctuations of etc as a function of days there was a gradual decrease in etc during stage 3 lower stomatal conductivity during this stage fig b1 was associated with shorter days with less day light hours and lower solar radiation load pieruschka et al 2010 williams et al 2012 evapotranspiration decreased as stage 3 progressed due to lower transpiration rates and physiological deterioration hunter and visser 2017 stage 4 was characterized by lower levels of water consumption corresponding to decrease in g s values processes associated with canopy aging occurred in the post harvest stage the vines became increasingly subjected to physical and environmental drivers effects with higher rhmean values ri 20 42 negatively affecting etc values pereira et al 2011 4 3 crop evapotranspiration leaf area index relations the relationship between lai and etc was quantified for each phenological stage as another approach to determine the intra seasonal dynamics of water consumption and its most dominant driver table 3 our findings of etc dynamics throughout the growing season correspond to other works that considered phenological growth stage analyses in vines lópez urrea et al 2012 the highest change in lai occurred in the spring between stages 0 and 1 due to rapid leaf growth during stage 0 during this stage the difference between daily mean lai and maximum lai for seasonal means was also maximal indicating a steep growing curve correspondingly etc showed an accelerated increase in values between these stages during stages 1 3 canopy manipulations were conducted resulting in a very low variability of lai values with very low differences between daily lai means and maximum lai additionally stages 1 and 2 represented 60 120 days since bud break during which new leaves emerge continuously creating a consistent presence of 50 60 day old leaves characterized by high photosynthetic rates and high stomatal conductivity schubert et al 1996 etc during these periods therefore was highly variable due to successive development of new leaves along with higher temperature levels as the growing seasons progressed the etc lai ratio provided daily mean water consumption as mm day 1 per unit 1 m2 m 2 leaf area during one day for each phenological stage and for the entire period table 3 these dynamics are associated with the highest difference in ratios between stages 1 and 2 difference of 1 48 mm day 1 of water consumption per unit leaf area lai values were at their peak during stage 3 while etc was found to decrease due to leaf aging and decreased stomatal conductivity as well as meteorological effects mainly increase in rhmean values and possibly due to decrease in daylight hours which directly affect stomatal activity fig b1 during stage 4 mean seasonal maximum lai deviated from daily mean lai but not as much as during stage 0 the effect of the presence of fruit on etc requires scientific attention while some have reported that stomatal conductance was not affected by the presence or absence of fruit petrie et al 2000 others reported higher stomatal conductance when fruit load is higher naor et al 1997 the lysimeter system provides accurate means to measure the effect of fruit load on etc at the whole plant level during all the years of this study we did not record any significant differences in water consumption levels before and immediately after harvest during 2017 all the clusters were removed from the grapevines in three of the six lysimeters at the bloom time no significant differences were found between etc levels of the vines with and without clusters signifying that the etc lai ratio is a representative measure of vine transpiration rate per leaf area 5 summary and conclusions water consumption throughout the grapevine growing seasons is highly variable this study used non linear modeling techniques to quantify etc temporal patterns as well as the dynamics and interrelations among the factors affecting etc during the growing season the analyses were performed at the phenological stage scale as commonly shown in studies that explore various types of within seasonal dynamics and used a long term dataset composed of five consecutive growing seasons which is sufficient to infer patterns of evapotranspiration and its drivers for cabernet sauvignon vines grown in similar conditions the dataset was treated as time series acknowledging its temporal autocorrelation and accounting for time dependencies and effects a non linear regression model that accounted for temporal variations both daily and seasonally produced highly accurate fitted values and enabled reliable quantification of the ri and dynamics of each covariate for each growth stage temporal variations of meteorological variables as well as vegetative patterns were found to have a strong interchangeable influence on water consumption with growing amounts of data that are time dependent from agricultural fields complex modeling techniques that can account for temporal non stationarity and non linear distributions should be developed and applied to studies that involve inter and intra seasonal pattern analysis moreover the modeling process of temporal patterns and relations between different covariates and water consumption may be further developed and used for etc prediction and may facilitate wine grape production while assessing etc as the basis for applying deficit irrigation phenological growth stages are linked to water consumption dynamics since these two factors are affected by similar drivers predictions of etc may also make use of these interactions and phenological stages may be incorporated as an additional predictor variable this study focused on etc lai relations since water consumption is highly affected by leaf area but also due to the high potential of intervention and management effects on vineyard canopy properties while environmental meteorological factors may not be controlled and altered leaf area may be easily modified and changed its structure can be reshaped and its development partially constrained therefore it is imperative to deepen research regarding the interrelations between leaf area and meteorological factors as well as the effect of these non linear relations on water consumption both inter and intra seasonally to enhance knowledge and implications for vineyard

additive models gams extend the approach of generalized linear models by including smooth functions of the covariates in order to address non linear relationships between response and explanatory variables maindonald 2010 in this study the smoothing of the covariates was accomplished with spline functions a spline curve is a piecewise polynomial curve that joins two or more polynomial curves where the locations of the joints are defined as knots durrleman and simon 1989 eilers and marx 2002 the shape of the spline can be controlled through the choice of number of knots and their exact location to allow flexibility where the trend shifts rapidly and at the same time avoid overfitting where the trend does not fluctuate much another choice that must be made is the degree of polynomials to be used between knots for example polynomial of degree 1 is a straight line the individual curves for each segment need to meet at the knots in a smooth fashion to create a continuous curve for polynomials of degree n both the spline function and the first n 1 derivatives are continuous at the knots cubic splines as used in this study are simply splines with polynomial degree of 3 if k knots are used fitting a polynomial of degree n in cubic regression spline n 3 requires k n 1 regression parameters which includes the intercept in our case k 3 1 higher order splines require more degrees of freedom as the order of splines increase durrleman and simon 1989 croxford 2016 higher number of knots might result in overfitting of the model if the sample size is small a small number of observations should be used in order to ensure that there are some observations between two knots representing the variability of the covariate and fitting the polynomial if the sample size is large and the covariate changes rapidly it is appropriate to use a large number of knots the locations of the knots are spaced by the model so that there is a sufficient number of observations between two consecutive knots durrleman and simon 1989 an optimal number of knots will lead to an intermediate amount of smoothing that does not cause under or overfitting of the data in penalized splines the coefficients or weights of the regression model are constrained in order to optimize the fit and avoid overfitting by the model weights are assigned to the splines to penalize overfitting and at the same time allow the splines to fit the data griggs 2013 the regression model treats the smoothed covariates as variables in the model thus enabling use of any regression model with associated outputs such as significance levels of the covariates their ri model performance etc durrleman and simon 1989 fig a1 shows the outputs of the smooth functions generated by the gam model applied for the entire season scale the smooth function y axis is centered to a mean of 0 the number in parentheses signifies the estimated degrees of freedom edf attributed to each smoothed covariate the maximum edf k 1 edf values that are much smaller than k 1 are not effective and will not smooth the covariate with a sufficient amount of knots wood 2017 the edf value reflects an estimate of the number of parameters that are needed to represent the smooth function and is an indication of the amount of non linearity of the smooth term for example u10 daily mean wind speed has an edf value of 1 meaning that the model penalized the smooth term to a simple linear relationship an edf larger than 1 defines a more complex non linear pattern wieling 2018 appendix b during the growing seasons of 2013 2015 stomatal conductance gs of the six lysimeter grown vines was measured on a weekly basis measurements were conducted each season between the second week of may and the second week of september three leaves from each of the vines were measured each week summing up to 18 measured leaves gs was measured at solar noon using a portable gas analyzer li 6400 li cor lincoln ne usa equipped with a 6 cm2 chamber measurements were conducted at light intensity of 1000 ppfd 6400 02b led light source 10 blue ambient humidity and temperature reference co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 and air flow rate of 500 μmol s 1 at the beginning of each measurements day a full calibration procedure recommended by the manufacturer was conducted sampling measurements during week 23 in 2013 were discarded due to malfunction of the device that resulted in outlier values occasional measurements were also eliminated due to outliers and inconsistencies with the general levels of stomatal conductance during specific sampling days the measured gs values are represented in fig b1 stomatal conductance levels during the first week of the sampled seasons were usually low in this case excluding the 2013 growing season followed by quite stable values until stage 3 week 32 then a gradual decrease in gs continues until the end of the growing seasons e g williams et al 2012 in 2015 gs values were found to decrease during the second half of stage 2 week 29 with smaller ranges of values concentrated around the median table b1 summarizes the differences between the unusual values measured in 2015 and those of 2013 and 2014 to understand the differences between gs values during 2015 and the other two growing seasons vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated as a function of tmean and rhmean for the growing seasons that were studied 2013 2017 the results tables b2 and b3 show that the vpd values for 2015 were found to vary considerably more than for the rest of the seasons with higher standard deviation values in addition inter seasonal comparison revealed that for stage 4 2015 had significantly different vpd values than for the other growing seasons during stage 4 aside from 2013 table b3
