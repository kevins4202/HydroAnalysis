15595,multiple reactive intermediates have been proposed to be involved in peroxydisulfate pds activation by zerovalent iron zvi including sulfate radical so4 produced via iron oxide shell mediated electron transfer ferryl ion species fe iv formed from fe ii pds interaction and hydroxyl radical oh generated by zvi aerobic oxygenation in this study evolution of the relative role of these intermediates in microscale and nanoscale zvi mzvi vs nzvi activated pds processes is comparatively investigated by using a methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso probe that selectively reacts with fe iv to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 interestingly during pmso transformation by mzvi pds process yields of pmso2 η pmso2 exhibit three stage behavior that they first increase to a maximum 80 but lower than 100 stage i and then plateau for a period stage ii followed by a decrease phase stage iii accordingly the relative role of fe iv in pmso transformation is unceasingly improved in stage i and subsequently reaches equilibrium with that of free radicals in stage ii while it finally decreases in stage iii similar η pmso2 evolution trends are obtained in nzvi pds process except that the η pmso2 increase in stage i is negligible possibly due to the exceptional fast nzvi dissolution it was further clarified by tert butyl alcohol scavenging assay that in addition to fe iv the free radical involved in stages i and ii is so4 while oh was dominant in stage iii moreover studies on o2 effect reveal that zvi aerobic oxygenation participates in mzvi corrosion during the entire process while it is only involved in nzvi corrosion when pds content is reduced to a low concentration indicating that the reactivities of pds and o2 are similar in mzvi corrosion but differ greatly in nzvi corrosion additionally effects of reactant dose and ph on η pmso2 evolution are also explored dynamics of the relative role of different reactive oxidants should be taken into account in further applications of zvi pds in situ chemical remediation technology considering their different chemistries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microscale zerovalent iron nanoscale zerovalent iron peroxydisulfate sulfate radical ferryl ion hydroxyl radical data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction peroxydisulfate pds based advanced oxidation processes aops have been intensively investigated in the past two decades as an expedient in situ chemical oxidation approach for remediating contaminated groundwater lee et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2018a in practical applications pds is often activated to produce reactive oxidants to enhance decontamination efficiency giannakis et al 2021 benefitting from several advantages including environmentally friendly features and excellent activation efficiency iron based activators have gained popularity hou et al 2021 liang et al 2021 oh and lim 2019 xiao et al 2018 iron activator was originally used as a soluble ferrous ion fe ii salt chen et al 2022 rastogi et al 2009a 2009b anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the latest literature documents that fe ii pds process transforms methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to its aqueous ferryl ion feiv o2 represented as fe iv involved products i e methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso2 rather than free radical involved products wang et al 2019a 2018 the pmso probe assay ascertained that the primary reactive oxidant formed in fe ii pds process is fe iv eq 1 rather than sulfate radical so4 or its secondary radical hydroxyl radical oh wang et al 2019a 2018 luo et al 2022 1 fe2 s2o8 2 h2o feivo2 2so4 2 2h notably fe ii pds process suffers from heavy competitive consumption of the formed reactive oxidants by unavoidable excess fe ii meng et al 2022 wang et al 2019b liang et al 2004 hence zerovalent iron zvi which is commonly injected into the subsurface or encapsulated in a permeable reactive barrier is applied as an alternative fe ii supplier liang and zhou 2022 ahn et al 2021 kim et al 2018 by using pmso as a probe multiple reactive intermediates were unprecedentedly identified to be involved in zvi activated pds process in our very recent work wang et al 2020 i so4 is produced from the heterogeneous activation of pds by zvi through conductive iron oxide shell mediated electron transfer eq 2 ii fe iv is generated from the homogeneous catalysis of pds by fe ii released from nzvi corrosion eq 1 iii additionally oh produced from fenton reaction triggered by o2 induced corrosion of zvi eqs 3 6 may also contribute to the contaminant degradation in zvi pds process in aerobic water liu et al 2018b kim et al 2015 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee et al 2008 hug and leupin 2003 2 fe0 2s2o8 2 fe2 2so4 2so4 2 3 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 4 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 5 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh frequently used zvi particles range from nanoscale zvi nzvi to microscale zvi mzvi according to their dimensions much work thus far has focused on the different features between nzvi and mzvi in microstructure activation reactivity and decontamination efficiency for instance signorini et al 2003 reported that zvi oxide shell content was size dependent that the relative fraction of magnetite fe3o4 vs maghemite γ fe2o3 increased with increasing core dimensions different iron oxides were proposed to impact the electron delivery capability from the zvi core to its surface kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2010 wilhelm 1979 moreover it was reported that the high specific area of nzvi induced rapid release of fe ii while mzvi could achieve higher reactive oxidant production and final removal efficiency of contaminants by restricting fe ii release at a slower rate and reducing the consumption of the in situ formed reactive oxidants at the surface of mzvi zhu et al 2016 lee et al 2014 al shamsi and thomson 2013 ruhl and jekel 2012 dong et al 2010 however no study has been devoted to exploring the discrepancies between nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes in controlling the relative contribution of fe iv so4 and oh for this purpose the relative roles of fe iv and free radicals so4 oh in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes in aerobic water were comparatively investigated in this study by using pmso as the probe with a focus on monitoring evolution of the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 ratio of the generated pmso2 to the abated pmso in each process two nzvi and two mzvi from commercial sources were selected for comparison meanwhile variations in pds decomposition and total dissolved iron fe tot were systematically quantified moreover the effects of tert butyl alcohol t buoh scavenger and dissolved oxygen on pmso transformation were explored to discriminate the possible contribution of oh during the entire process in addition the impacts of the reactant dose and solution ph on the relative contributions of different reactive oxidants in both processes were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials pmso 97 pmso2 98 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 99 9 were obtained from sigma aldrich sodium persulfate na2s2o8 99 and t buoh 98 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd commercial nzvi 99 was purchased from macklin nzvimc and aladdin nzvial commercial mzvi 99 9 was obtained from j k scientific ltd mzvijk and sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd mzvisp all zvi was stored in a vacuum glove box prior to experiments sem images of the selected nzvi and mzvi are presented in fig s1 which shows that nzvi were spherical nanoparticles with core sizes ranging from 10 100 nm while mzvi were irregular particles 10 100 µm in size all other chemicals were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm supplied by a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma 2 2 experimental procedure all experiments were conducted in a 1 l cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor stirred by a glass stirrer at room temperature 20 1 c the pre weighed zvi was added to the solution containing pmso and pds to initiate a reaction solutions at ph 3 were adjusted using hclo4 while ph values of 4 5 and 7 were buffered with 10 mm sodium acetate and sodium borate respectively the deaeration experiments were carried out by sparging nitrogen gas for 30 min prior to the reaction and during the entire experiment samples 0 85 ml collected at predetermined times were immediately quenched by 0 1 ml 2 m dmso and acidified by 0 05 ml diluted hclo4 and then filtered via a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter before analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc parallel samples were withdrawn simultaneously and filtered immediately for analysis of pds and total dissolved iron fe tot all experiments were performed in triplicate and the averaged data are presented with their standard deviations 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pds was quantified by a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 fe tot was spectrophotometrically analyzed by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method keenan and sedlak 2008 pmso and pmso2 were determined by hplc waters 2695 analysis with uv absorbance detection at 230 nm and 215 nm respectively wang et al 2018 2019a 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of pmso transformation in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 1 1 pds decomposition zvi dissolution and pmso degradation the transformation of pmso by various mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes was comparatively investigated over a long period 6 h under typical conditions pmso 0 200 µm pds 0 500 µm mzvi 0 nzvi 0 0 05 g l 895 µm and ph 3 with simultaneously monitoring pds decomposition and zvi dissolution i e fe tot in nzvimc pds and nzvial pds processes pds was completely depleted within 30 min and 45 min respectively fig 1 a comparatively pds decomposed at relatively slower rates in mzvi cases in which it was completely depleted until approximately 1 h and 2 h in mzvijk and mzvisp activated pds processes respectively fig 1a which was rationalized by the smaller specific area of mzvi moreover although the initial dissolution of mzvi was apparently slower than that of nzvi the final fe tot at 6 h fe tot 6h obtained in mzvi cases was higher than that in nzvi cases fig 1b specifically fe tot at 15 min decreased in the order of 541 µm nzvimc 254 µm nzvial 148 µm mzvijk 137 µm mzvisp however fe tot 6h increased in the order of 485 µm nzvial 820 µm nzvimc 873 µm mzvijk 882 µm mzvisp in which mzvi was nearly depleted in both mzvi pds processes furthermore it was observed that the initial degradation rate of pmso in nzvi pds processes was faster than that in mzvi pds processes while the ultimate pmso degradation extent δ pmso 6h in mzvi pds processes was slightly higher fig 1c in particular pmso degradation at 15 min δ pmso 15min decreased from 125 µm and 111 µm in nzvimc and nzvial cases to 87 µm and 83 µm in mzvijk and mzvisp cases respectively however δ pmso 6h decreased in the opposite order 179 µm mzvisp 177 µm mzvijk 169 µm nzvial 166 µm nzvimc this observation was rationalized by the slower fe ii release in mzvi pds processes than in nzvi pds processes fig 1b which reduced the competitive consumption of the formed reactive oxidants 3 1 2 pmso2 production and yield as shown in fig 1d pmso2 production δ pmso2 was quickly accumulated to a maximum in these four mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes after which pmso2 was gradually degraded for instance in nzvimc pds process δ pmso2 was increased to about 95 µm at 15 min and then it was progressively decreased to 83 µm at 6 h in mzvijk pds process δ pmso2 increased to the maximum 124 µm within 1 h and subsequently gradually reduced to 101 µm at 6 h the initial accumulation of pmso2 was attributed to the continuous formation of fe iv by the pds fe ii reaction eq 1 while the subsequent gradual consumption of pmso2 was possibly rationalized by the formation of oh via eqs 3 6 which was verified by a t buoh scavenging assay see below furthermore it was observed that the time dependent profile of the η pmso2 value in mzvi pds processes exhibited an obvious three stage behavior fig 1e in mzvijk pds process the η pmso2 value significantly increased from 59 at 2 5 min to about 80 at 15 min stage i and then remained constant at 80 during 15 45 min stage ii followed by a continuous slow decrease from this maximum to 57 at 6 h stage iii a similar η pmso2 evolution pattern was also observed in mzvisp pds process the increase of η pmso2 in stage i implied that the role of fe iv in pmso transformation initially increased relative to that of free radicals and then the relative contribution of fe iv and free radicals kept balance in stage ii after which the proportion of fe iv was gradually reduced comparatively the initial increase in η pmso2 stage i was not observed in nzvi pds processes fig 1e specifically in nzvimc pds process the η pmso2 value remained constant at about 80 before 15 min stage ii which was consistent with the results of our recent study wang et al 2020 thereafter the η pmso2 value gradually decreased to 50 at 6 h stage iii similarly in nzvial pds process the η pmso2 value kept constant at about 80 before it began to decrease at 30 min the negligible stage i obtained in nzvi activated pds processes was probably attributed to the fact that the significant fast nzvi dissolution fig 1b dramatically accelerated the improvement of the relative fraction of fe iv by promoting the fe ii pds interaction eq 1 a closer inspection of the incipient transformation of pmso in nzvimc pds process by intensive sampling in the preliminary stage revealed that η pmso2 was increased from 13 at 15 s to 80 at 2 min stage i and then kept constant at about 80 after 2 min stage ii fig s2 this observation further supported the former inference that stage i was completed at an extremely fast speed in nzvi pds processes 3 2 probing the relative roles of so4 and oh in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 2 1 effect of t buoh the pmso probe assay unprecedently disclosed the time dependent three stage evolution of the relative contributions of fe iv and free radicals so4 and or oh in mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes to further clarify the relative roles of so4 and oh the effect of t buoh 20 mm on pmso 200 µm transformation in mzvijk pds and nzvimc pds 0 05 g l 500 µm processes was explored at ph 3 both pmso probe 3 61 109 m 1 s 1 and t buoh 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 exhibit high reactivity towards oh wang et al 2018 buxton et al 1988 in contrast the second order rate constant of pmso with so4 3 17 108 m 1 s 1 and fe iv 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 is several orders of magnitude higher than that of t buoh with so4 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 and fe iv 60 m 1 s 1 respectively wang et al 2018 pestovsky and bakac 2006 2004 neta et al 1996 this distinction indicated that t buoh is superior in distinguishing oh from both of so4 and fe iv in nzvimc pds process δ pmso was increased to about 125 µm at 15 min in both processes with and without t buoh but after 15 min pmso degradation was significantly suppressed in process with adding t buoh fig 2 a moreover δ pmso2 increased to the maximum at 15 min followed by a decrease phase in the control process without t buoh as mentioned before the addition of t buoh had a negligible effect on pmso2 formation before 15 min but obviously inhibited the degradation of the newly formed pmso2 after 15 min observed in the control process fig 2b additionally fig 2c shows that the calculated η pmso2 value in the process with t buoh remained at 80 during the entire process while it remained constant at 80 before 15 min stage ii and then gradually decreased stage iii in the control case similarly δ pmso and δ pmso2 in mzvijk pds process with t buoh were roughly equal to those obtained in the control case without t buoh before 45 min and afterward it was observed that the addition of t buoh inhibited pmso degradation and promoted pmso2 production fig 2d and 2e as such the η pmso2 values obtained in mzvijk pds process with and without t buoh were similar before 45 min gradually increasing to 80 at 15 min stage i and then remaining constant within 45 min stage ii fig 2f subsequently the η pmso2 value kept at 80 after 45 min in case with t buoh which was different from the decreasing trend obtained in the control case after 45 min stage iii fig 2f taken together t buoh significantly suppressed pmso transformation in both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes in stage iii but showed negligible effect during stage i and stage ii this result clarified that so4 rather than oh was the primary free radical formed by both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes in stage i and stage ii as depicted by the red patches in fig 2 instead oh dominated in stage iii which was responsible for the degradation of the newly formed pmso2 and the decrease in the η pmso2 value in stage iii as depicted by the blue patches in fig 2 this inference was in accordance with the high reaction rate between oh and pmso2 3 08 109 m 1 s 1 which was two orders of magnitude faster than that of so4 and pmso2 2 75 107 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2018 3 2 2 effect of dissolved o2 tracing the pathway of producing oh the effect of dissolved o2 on pmso 200 µm transformation in the processes of activating pds 500 µm by nzvimc and mzvijk 0 05 g l at ph 3 was comparatively investigated as shown in fig 3 a fe tot obtained in nzvimc pds processes without o2 was almost identical to that obtained in the control case with o2 before 15 min but then nzvimc dissolution was inhibited by removing o2 that fe tot at 6 h was decreased from 820 µm in the process with o2 to 745 µm in the absence of o2 moreover pds was completely depleted at 30 min in both processes with and without o2 at similar rates fig 3b further the removal of o2 had a negligible effect on pmso transformation in nzvimc pds process before 15 min stage ii but significantly inhibited the degradation of pmso and pmso2 after 15 min stage iii see details in text s1 and fig s2 by contrast in mzvijk pds process mzvijk dissolution was significantly slowed down during the entire process by removing o2 and fe tot at 6 h was significantly reduced from 873 µm in the presence of o2 to only 349 µm with bubbling n2 fig 3c the slower release of fe ii resulted in the less effective decomposition of pds in mzvijk pds process by removing o2 and the pds depletion time was postponed from 1 h in the presence of o2 to 2 h in the absence of o2 fig 3d as a result pmso transformation in mzvijk pds process was inhibited by removing o2 see details in text s1 and fig s3 the discrepancies in the dissolved o2 effect between nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes revealed that zvi aerobic oxygenation participated in the whole course stages i iii of mzvijk pds process while it only occurred in nzvimc pds process at stage iii where pds was nearly depleted as illustrated by scheme 1 this distinction suggested that pds is far more reactive than o2 in interacting with nzvi however pds and o2 might show comparable reactivity in competitively corroding mzvi notably the former t buoh assay identified that oh only participated in pmso transformation in stage iii of mzvijk pds process rather than the entire process this result indicated that h2o2 produced by the mzvi o2 interaction eqs 3 5 was not effectively transferred to oh eq 6 in stage i and stage ii of mzvijk pds process which was probably attributed to the initial strong competitive consumption of fe ii by sufficient pds and the invalid consumption of h2o2 on the mzvi surface with producing inert oh scheme 1 this inference was also stated by lee et al 2014 who found that 90 of the in situ generated h2o2 in zvi o2 process was consumed on the zvi surface 3 3 parameters affecting the evolution of reactive oxidants relative role in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on pds decomposition and pmso transformation in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was investigated under typical conditions pds 0 500 µm zvi 0 0 05 g l pmso 0 200 µm ph 3 7 as shown in fig s3 pds decomposition in mzvial pds process was slower than that in nzvimc pds process at ph 3 and 4 however δ pds 6h in mzvial pds process was 303 and 123 µm at ph 5 and 7 respectively which was several times higher than that in nzvimc pds process in which δ pds 6h was only 63 µm at ph 5 and 32 µm at ph 7 fig s4 this result implied that mzvi had higher reactivity toward decomposing pds at near neutral ph than nzvi moreover as shown in figs 4 a and 4b both δ pmso and δ pmso2 decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 in mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes but mzvial pds process achieved higher pmso transformation efficiency under the entire ph conditions of 3 7 see fig s5 for the time dependent variation in pmso and pmso2 the good performance of mzvial pds process at acidic ph was attributed to the weaker competitive consumption of the reactive intermediates induced by the slower release of fe ii fig 1b while the faster pds decomposition may account for its exceptional removal efficiency under near neutral conditions fig s4 further a clearly defined three stage evolution of η pmso2 was obtained in mzvial pds process at ph 3 as mentioned before comparatively the η pmso2 value remained at a high level 90 until 30 min and then decreased gradually to 67 at 6 h in mzvial pds process at ph 4 fig 4c at ph 5 the η pmso2 value experienced a long increase period where it increased from 33 to 74 during 2 h stage i and then stabilized at this maximum in stage ii within 6 h in mzvial pds process fig 4c data on the evolution of η pmso2 value at ph 7 was not show due to no pmso2 production was obtained in mzvial pds process at ph 7 fig 4b a similar ph dependent evolution trend of the η pmso2 value was also observed in nzvimc pds process fig 4d the high initial η pmso2 value obtained at ph 4 in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was ascribed to the stronger scavenging effect of ch3cooh buffer on so4 8 8 20 104 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1996 criquet and leitner 2009 herrmann et al 1999 relative to that on fe iv 3 1 m 1 s 1 ph 0 jacobsen et al 1998 which apparently enhanced the relative contribution of fe iv to pmso transformation in the initial stage moreover the obviously prolonged stage i at ph 5 was probably attributed to several factors including i the decrease in the oxidation capability of fe iv wang et al 2022 lu et al 2018 bataineh et al 2012 louwerse et al 2008 and ii the reduction of available fe ii at high ph caused by the slower corrosion of zvi by h the precipitation of aqueous iron and the passivation of the zvi surface by precipitation wang et al 2020 kim et al 2018 which significantly suppressed the formation of fe iv through the fe ii pds interaction eq 1 3 3 2 effect of zvi initial concentration the effect of zvi initial concentration was investigated at ph 3 by varying nzvimc 0 or mzvijk 0 from 0 01 g l to 0 1 g l i e 179 µm to 1790 µm fixing pds 0 and pmso 0 at 500 µm and 200 µm respectively consistent with common sense in both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes a higher zvi 0 resulted in a faster increase in fe tot and a higher final fe tot which was accompanied by faster pds decomposition fig s6 moreover as expected the increase in zvi 0 initially induced faster pmso degradation but simultaneously led to a lower δ pmso 6h fig s7 due to the competitive consumption of fe iv so4 and oh by excess fe ii mártire et al 2002 buxton et al 1997 buxton et al 1988 7 feivo2 fe2 2h 2fe3 h2o k 1 40 105 m 1 s 1 ph 1 8 so4 fe2 fe3 so4 2 k 4 6 109 m 1 s 1 9 oh fe2 fe3 oh k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 further the increase in zvi 0 also accelerated the rate of producing pmso2 initially but reduced the maximum of pmso2 production fig s7 which was rationalized by the stronger aerobic oxygenation of zvi in stage iii with more remaining zvi additionally the three stage evolution of the calculated η pmso2 value was observed in mzvial pds process in each case that it first increased to the maximum 80 stage i and then maintained constant at it stage ii followed by a final decrease phase stage iii fig 5 a with increasing mzvial 0 from 0 01 to 0 1 g l the duration of stage i was shortened from 2 h to 12 5 min and afterward conversion from stage ii to stage iii was put forward from 6 h to 15 min as depicted by fig 5b the accelerated increase in the relative contribution of fe iv versus so4 in stage i by increasing mzvi 0 was ascribed to the significantly enhanced release of fe ii fig s6 the precursor of fe iv eq 1 meanwhile the promoted pds consumption advanced the time of generating oh by mzvi aerobic corrosion in mzvial pds process which was responsible for the earlier appearance of stage iii with increasing mzvi 0 in nzvimc pds process the calculated η pmso2 value initially kept constant at about 80 for a period stage ii and then progressively decreased stage iii while stage i was still not observed in each case fig 5c as illustrated in fig 5d the duration of stage ii was significantly shortened from 6 h to 2 5 min with increasing nzvimc 0 from 0 01 g l to 0 1 g l similar to the case of mzvial pds process fig 5b the earlier onset of stage iii by increasing nzvimc 0 in nzvimc pds process could also be rationalized by the faster release of fe ii and the enhanced decomposition of pds fig s6 3 3 3 effect of pds initial concentration the influence of pds 0 100 1000 µm on pmso 200 µm transformation in mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was investigated at fixed zvi 0 0 02 g l interestingly the increase in pds 0 significantly promoted pds decomposition in both processes while its effect on accelerating zvi dissolution was below the anticipated value fig s8 for instance in mzvial pds process δ pds at 30 min sharply increased from 76 µm to 393 µm with increasing pds 0 from 100 µm to 1000 µm while fe tot at 30 min moderately increased from 94 µm to 154 µm figs s8a and s7b similarly in nzvimc pds process δ pds at 15 min was significantly increased from 90 to 405 µm by varying pds 0 from 100 to 1000 µm but fe tot at 15 min was slightly increased from 201 to 237 µm figs s8c and s8d as illustrated in scheme 1 pds was heterogeneously activated by zvi with releasing fe ii or homogeneously catalyzed by the released fe ii in zvi pds process accordingly the increase in pds 0 primarily enhanced the fe ii pds interaction by forming fe iv eq 1 while weakly influenced zvi corrosion by producing so4 eq 2 this inference was consistent with the observation that the acceleration of pmso transformation by increasing pds 0 in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was mainly ascribed to the significantly promoted production of fe iv rather than so4 see details in text s2 and figs s9 and s10 as shown in fig 6 a the η pmso2 value increased from 34 at 2 5 min to 67 below 80 at 30 min stage i and then immediately decreased to 42 within 6 h stage iii in mzvial pds process at 100 µm pds 0 the disappearance of stage ii was attributed to the fact that pds was depleted before the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 reached a balance in stage i at relatively low pds 0 at 250 µm to 1000 µm pds 0 evolution of η pmso2 value showed the three stage behavior in mzvial pds process fig 6a moreover with increasing pds 0 from 250 µm to 1000 µm the duration of stage i was shortened from 45 min to 15 min however the conversion from stage ii to stage iii was postponed from 1 h to 4 h as illustrated in fig 6b the accelerated accumulation of the relative contribution of fe iv in stage i was rationalized by the significantly enhanced fe ii pds interaction by increasing pds 0 as discussed above the prolonged stage ii was attributed to the fact that the promotion of pds 0 inhibited the transformation from h2o2 to oh during mzvi aerobic corrosion by competitively capturing fe ii as depicted by scheme 1 in nzvimc pds process the η pmso2 value maintained constant at about 80 before 15 min stage ii followed by a progressive decrease phase within 6 h stage iii at 100 µm pds 0 while it remained constant at 80 until 6 h stage ii at 250 1000 µm pds 0 figs 6c and 6d similar to mzvial pds process the high efficiency of increasing pds 0 in promoting the contribution of fe iv relative to that of so4 and suppressing oh formation was responsible for the significantly prolonged stage ii in mzvi pds 4 conclusions this study provides new insight into the time dependent evolution of the relative contributions of fe iv generated by the fe ii pds reaction so4 formed through direct electron transfer from the zvi core to pds and oh produced by zvi aerobic oxygenation in mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes by using pmso as the probe the main conclusions are as follows i in mzvi pds process role of fe iv relative to so4 is initially progressively promoted stage i and subsequently achieves equilibrium for a period stage ii afterward the relative role of oh gradually takes the lead when pds is nearly depleted stage iii similar evolution trends of the relative role of fe iv and free radicals so4 oh are observed in nzvi pds process except that the initial increase in the relative contribution of fe iv stage i is negligible due to the exceptional rapid release of fe ii from nzvi dissolution ii in mzvi pds process dissolved o2 participates in corroding mzvi during entire process stages i iii however h2o2 produced by mzvi o2 interaction is not effectively transferred to oh before stage iii which is rationalized by the competitive consumption of fe ii by sufficient pds initially and the invalid consumption of h2o2 on mzvi surface by contrast zvi aerobic oxygenation occurred at stage iii rather than the whole course in nzvi pds process when pds is consumed to a low level this difference indicates that the gap between the reactivity of pds and o2 toward mzvi is much narrower than that toward nzvi iii a relatively high ph prolongs the period of achieving the balance of the relative contribution of fe iv and free radicals i e stage i which is probably attributed to the decrease in the oxidation capability of fe iv and the reduction of available fe ii with increasing ph iv the increase of zvi initial concentration shortens stage i and advances the conversion from stage ii to stage iii because higher zvi 0 promotes fe iv accumulation by enhancing fe ii release and accelerating pds decomposition which advances the time of generating oh by zvi aerobic corrosion v the promotion of pds initial concentration shortens stage i but prolongs stage ii and postpones the conversion from stage ii to stage iii due to the high efficiency of increasing pds 0 in accelerating fe iv formation by enhancing fe ii pds interaction and suppressing the transformation from h2o2 to oh by competitively capturing fe ii the marked distinctions in chemical properties and oxidative behaviors between fe iv so4 and oh have been well documented in our very recent work wang et al 2022 specifically aqueous fe iv is less reactive than oh so4 but possesses a longer lifetime and is more selective in oxidizing background concomitants wang et al 2022 moreover fe iv oxidizes organics through diverse reaction pathways e g hydrogen atom hydride oxygen atom and electron transfer as well as electrophilic addition while oh and so4 prefer to degrade organic contaminants via hydrogen atom abstraction and electron transfer respectively wang et al 2022 accordingly dynamics of the relative roles of fe iv so4 and oh would induce time dependent changeover in the decontamination mechanism in both mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes which cannot be overlooked in future

15595,multiple reactive intermediates have been proposed to be involved in peroxydisulfate pds activation by zerovalent iron zvi including sulfate radical so4 produced via iron oxide shell mediated electron transfer ferryl ion species fe iv formed from fe ii pds interaction and hydroxyl radical oh generated by zvi aerobic oxygenation in this study evolution of the relative role of these intermediates in microscale and nanoscale zvi mzvi vs nzvi activated pds processes is comparatively investigated by using a methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso probe that selectively reacts with fe iv to produce methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 interestingly during pmso transformation by mzvi pds process yields of pmso2 η pmso2 exhibit three stage behavior that they first increase to a maximum 80 but lower than 100 stage i and then plateau for a period stage ii followed by a decrease phase stage iii accordingly the relative role of fe iv in pmso transformation is unceasingly improved in stage i and subsequently reaches equilibrium with that of free radicals in stage ii while it finally decreases in stage iii similar η pmso2 evolution trends are obtained in nzvi pds process except that the η pmso2 increase in stage i is negligible possibly due to the exceptional fast nzvi dissolution it was further clarified by tert butyl alcohol scavenging assay that in addition to fe iv the free radical involved in stages i and ii is so4 while oh was dominant in stage iii moreover studies on o2 effect reveal that zvi aerobic oxygenation participates in mzvi corrosion during the entire process while it is only involved in nzvi corrosion when pds content is reduced to a low concentration indicating that the reactivities of pds and o2 are similar in mzvi corrosion but differ greatly in nzvi corrosion additionally effects of reactant dose and ph on η pmso2 evolution are also explored dynamics of the relative role of different reactive oxidants should be taken into account in further

processes aops have been intensively investigated in the past two decades as an expedient in situ chemical oxidation approach for remediating contaminated groundwater lee et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 liu et al 2018a in practical applications pds is often activated to produce reactive oxidants to enhance decontamination efficiency giannakis et al 2021 benefitting from several advantages including environmentally friendly features and excellent activation efficiency iron based activators have gained popularity hou et al 2021 liang et al 2021 oh and lim 2019 xiao et al 2018 iron activator was originally used as a soluble ferrous ion fe ii salt chen et al 2022 rastogi et al 2009a 2009b anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 the latest literature documents that fe ii pds process transforms methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso to its aqueous ferryl ion feiv o2 represented as fe iv involved products i e methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso2 rather than free radical involved products wang et al 2019a 2018 the pmso probe assay ascertained that the primary reactive oxidant formed in fe ii pds process is fe iv eq 1 rather than sulfate radical so4 or its secondary radical hydroxyl radical oh wang et al 2019a 2018 luo et al 2022 1 fe2 s2o8 2 h2o feivo2 2so4 2 2h notably fe ii pds process suffers from heavy competitive consumption of the formed reactive oxidants by unavoidable excess fe ii meng et al 2022 wang et al 2019b liang et al 2004 hence zerovalent iron zvi which is commonly injected into the subsurface or encapsulated in a permeable reactive barrier is applied as an alternative fe ii supplier liang and zhou 2022 ahn et al 2021 kim et al 2018 by using pmso as a probe multiple reactive intermediates were unprecedentedly identified to be involved in zvi activated pds process in our very recent work wang et al 2020 i so4 is produced from the heterogeneous activation of pds by zvi through conductive iron oxide shell mediated electron transfer eq 2 ii fe iv is generated from the homogeneous catalysis of pds by fe ii released from nzvi corrosion eq 1 iii additionally oh produced from fenton reaction triggered by o2 induced corrosion of zvi eqs 3 6 may also contribute to the contaminant degradation in zvi pds process in aerobic water liu et al 2018b kim et al 2015 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee et al 2008 hug and leupin 2003 2 fe0 2s2o8 2 fe2 2so4 2so4 2 3 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 4 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 5 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh frequently used zvi particles range from nanoscale zvi nzvi to microscale zvi mzvi according to their dimensions much work thus far has focused on the different features between nzvi and mzvi in microstructure activation reactivity and decontamination efficiency for instance signorini et al 2003 reported that zvi oxide shell content was size dependent that the relative fraction of magnetite fe3o4 vs maghemite γ fe2o3 increased with increasing core dimensions different iron oxides were proposed to impact the electron delivery capability from the zvi core to its surface kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2010 wilhelm 1979 moreover it was reported that the high specific area of nzvi induced rapid release of fe ii while mzvi could achieve higher reactive oxidant production and final removal efficiency of contaminants by restricting fe ii release at a slower rate and reducing the consumption of the in situ formed reactive oxidants at the surface of mzvi zhu et al 2016 lee et al 2014 al shamsi and thomson 2013 ruhl and jekel 2012 dong et al 2010 however no study has been devoted to exploring the discrepancies between nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes in controlling the relative contribution of fe iv so4 and oh for this purpose the relative roles of fe iv and free radicals so4 oh in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes in aerobic water were comparatively investigated in this study by using pmso as the probe with a focus on monitoring evolution of the yield of pmso2 η pmso2 ratio of the generated pmso2 to the abated pmso in each process two nzvi and two mzvi from commercial sources were selected for comparison meanwhile variations in pds decomposition and total dissolved iron fe tot were systematically quantified moreover the effects of tert butyl alcohol t buoh scavenger and dissolved oxygen on pmso transformation were explored to discriminate the possible contribution of oh during the entire process in addition the impacts of the reactant dose and solution ph on the relative contributions of different reactive oxidants in both processes were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials pmso 97 pmso2 98 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 99 9 were obtained from sigma aldrich sodium persulfate na2s2o8 99 and t buoh 98 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd commercial nzvi 99 was purchased from macklin nzvimc and aladdin nzvial commercial mzvi 99 9 was obtained from j k scientific ltd mzvijk and sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd mzvisp all zvi was stored in a vacuum glove box prior to experiments sem images of the selected nzvi and mzvi are presented in fig s1 which shows that nzvi were spherical nanoparticles with core sizes ranging from 10 100 nm while mzvi were irregular particles 10 100 µm in size all other chemicals were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm supplied by a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma 2 2 experimental procedure all experiments were conducted in a 1 l cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor stirred by a glass stirrer at room temperature 20 1 c the pre weighed zvi was added to the solution containing pmso and pds to initiate a reaction solutions at ph 3 were adjusted using hclo4 while ph values of 4 5 and 7 were buffered with 10 mm sodium acetate and sodium borate respectively the deaeration experiments were carried out by sparging nitrogen gas for 30 min prior to the reaction and during the entire experiment samples 0 85 ml collected at predetermined times were immediately quenched by 0 1 ml 2 m dmso and acidified by 0 05 ml diluted hclo4 and then filtered via a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter before analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc parallel samples were withdrawn simultaneously and filtered immediately for analysis of pds and total dissolved iron fe tot all experiments were performed in triplicate and the averaged data are presented with their standard deviations 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pds was quantified by a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 fe tot was spectrophotometrically analyzed by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method keenan and sedlak 2008 pmso and pmso2 were determined by hplc waters 2695 analysis with uv absorbance detection at 230 nm and 215 nm respectively wang et al 2018 2019a 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of pmso transformation in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 1 1 pds decomposition zvi dissolution and pmso degradation the transformation of pmso by various mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes was comparatively investigated over a long period 6 h under typical conditions pmso 0 200 µm pds 0 500 µm mzvi 0 nzvi 0 0 05 g l 895 µm and ph 3 with simultaneously monitoring pds decomposition and zvi dissolution i e fe tot in nzvimc pds and nzvial pds processes pds was completely depleted within 30 min and 45 min respectively fig 1 a comparatively pds decomposed at relatively slower rates in mzvi cases in which it was completely depleted until approximately 1 h and 2 h in mzvijk and mzvisp activated pds processes respectively fig 1a which was rationalized by the smaller specific area of mzvi moreover although the initial dissolution of mzvi was apparently slower than that of nzvi the final fe tot at 6 h fe tot 6h obtained in mzvi cases was higher than that in nzvi cases fig 1b specifically fe tot at 15 min decreased in the order of 541 µm nzvimc 254 µm nzvial 148 µm mzvijk 137 µm mzvisp however fe tot 6h increased in the order of 485 µm nzvial 820 µm nzvimc 873 µm mzvijk 882 µm mzvisp in which mzvi was nearly depleted in both mzvi pds processes furthermore it was observed that the initial degradation rate of pmso in nzvi pds processes was faster than that in mzvi pds processes while the ultimate pmso degradation extent δ pmso 6h in mzvi pds processes was slightly higher fig 1c in particular pmso degradation at 15 min δ pmso 15min decreased from 125 µm and 111 µm in nzvimc and nzvial cases to 87 µm and 83 µm in mzvijk and mzvisp cases respectively however δ pmso 6h decreased in the opposite order 179 µm mzvisp 177 µm mzvijk 169 µm nzvial 166 µm nzvimc this observation was rationalized by the slower fe ii release in mzvi pds processes than in nzvi pds processes fig 1b which reduced the competitive consumption of the formed reactive oxidants 3 1 2 pmso2 production and yield as shown in fig 1d pmso2 production δ pmso2 was quickly accumulated to a maximum in these four mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes after which pmso2 was gradually degraded for instance in nzvimc pds process δ pmso2 was increased to about 95 µm at 15 min and then it was progressively decreased to 83 µm at 6 h in mzvijk pds process δ pmso2 increased to the maximum 124 µm within 1 h and subsequently gradually reduced to 101 µm at 6 h the initial accumulation of pmso2 was attributed to the continuous formation of fe iv by the pds fe ii reaction eq 1 while the subsequent gradual consumption of pmso2 was possibly rationalized by the formation of oh via eqs 3 6 which was verified by a t buoh scavenging assay see below furthermore it was observed that the time dependent profile of the η pmso2 value in mzvi pds processes exhibited an obvious three stage behavior fig 1e in mzvijk pds process the η pmso2 value significantly increased from 59 at 2 5 min to about 80 at 15 min stage i and then remained constant at 80 during 15 45 min stage ii followed by a continuous slow decrease from this maximum to 57 at 6 h stage iii a similar η pmso2 evolution pattern was also observed in mzvisp pds process the increase of η pmso2 in stage i implied that the role of fe iv in pmso transformation initially increased relative to that of free radicals and then the relative contribution of fe iv and free radicals kept balance in stage ii after which the proportion of fe iv was gradually reduced comparatively the initial increase in η pmso2 stage i was not observed in nzvi pds processes fig 1e specifically in nzvimc pds process the η pmso2 value remained constant at about 80 before 15 min stage ii which was consistent with the results of our recent study wang et al 2020 thereafter the η pmso2 value gradually decreased to 50 at 6 h stage iii similarly in nzvial pds process the η pmso2 value kept constant at about 80 before it began to decrease at 30 min the negligible stage i obtained in nzvi activated pds processes was probably attributed to the fact that the significant fast nzvi dissolution fig 1b dramatically accelerated the improvement of the relative fraction of fe iv by promoting the fe ii pds interaction eq 1 a closer inspection of the incipient transformation of pmso in nzvimc pds process by intensive sampling in the preliminary stage revealed that η pmso2 was increased from 13 at 15 s to 80 at 2 min stage i and then kept constant at about 80 after 2 min stage ii fig s2 this observation further supported the former inference that stage i was completed at an extremely fast speed in nzvi pds processes 3 2 probing the relative roles of so4 and oh in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 2 1 effect of t buoh the pmso probe assay unprecedently disclosed the time dependent three stage evolution of the relative contributions of fe iv and free radicals so4 and or oh in mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes to further clarify the relative roles of so4 and oh the effect of t buoh 20 mm on pmso 200 µm transformation in mzvijk pds and nzvimc pds 0 05 g l 500 µm processes was explored at ph 3 both pmso probe 3 61 109 m 1 s 1 and t buoh 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 exhibit high reactivity towards oh wang et al 2018 buxton et al 1988 in contrast the second order rate constant of pmso with so4 3 17 108 m 1 s 1 and fe iv 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 is several orders of magnitude higher than that of t buoh with so4 4 0 105 m 1 s 1 and fe iv 60 m 1 s 1 respectively wang et al 2018 pestovsky and bakac 2006 2004 neta et al 1996 this distinction indicated that t buoh is superior in distinguishing oh from both of so4 and fe iv in nzvimc pds process δ pmso was increased to about 125 µm at 15 min in both processes with and without t buoh but after 15 min pmso degradation was significantly suppressed in process with adding t buoh fig 2 a moreover δ pmso2 increased to the maximum at 15 min followed by a decrease phase in the control process without t buoh as mentioned before the addition of t buoh had a negligible effect on pmso2 formation before 15 min but obviously inhibited the degradation of the newly formed pmso2 after 15 min observed in the control process fig 2b additionally fig 2c shows that the calculated η pmso2 value in the process with t buoh remained at 80 during the entire process while it remained constant at 80 before 15 min stage ii and then gradually decreased stage iii in the control case similarly δ pmso and δ pmso2 in mzvijk pds process with t buoh were roughly equal to those obtained in the control case without t buoh before 45 min and afterward it was observed that the addition of t buoh inhibited pmso degradation and promoted pmso2 production fig 2d and 2e as such the η pmso2 values obtained in mzvijk pds process with and without t buoh were similar before 45 min gradually increasing to 80 at 15 min stage i and then remaining constant within 45 min stage ii fig 2f subsequently the η pmso2 value kept at 80 after 45 min in case with t buoh which was different from the decreasing trend obtained in the control case after 45 min stage iii fig 2f taken together t buoh significantly suppressed pmso transformation in both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes in stage iii but showed negligible effect during stage i and stage ii this result clarified that so4 rather than oh was the primary free radical formed by both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes in stage i and stage ii as depicted by the red patches in fig 2 instead oh dominated in stage iii which was responsible for the degradation of the newly formed pmso2 and the decrease in the η pmso2 value in stage iii as depicted by the blue patches in fig 2 this inference was in accordance with the high reaction rate between oh and pmso2 3 08 109 m 1 s 1 which was two orders of magnitude faster than that of so4 and pmso2 2 75 107 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2018 3 2 2 effect of dissolved o2 tracing the pathway of producing oh the effect of dissolved o2 on pmso 200 µm transformation in the processes of activating pds 500 µm by nzvimc and mzvijk 0 05 g l at ph 3 was comparatively investigated as shown in fig 3 a fe tot obtained in nzvimc pds processes without o2 was almost identical to that obtained in the control case with o2 before 15 min but then nzvimc dissolution was inhibited by removing o2 that fe tot at 6 h was decreased from 820 µm in the process with o2 to 745 µm in the absence of o2 moreover pds was completely depleted at 30 min in both processes with and without o2 at similar rates fig 3b further the removal of o2 had a negligible effect on pmso transformation in nzvimc pds process before 15 min stage ii but significantly inhibited the degradation of pmso and pmso2 after 15 min stage iii see details in text s1 and fig s2 by contrast in mzvijk pds process mzvijk dissolution was significantly slowed down during the entire process by removing o2 and fe tot at 6 h was significantly reduced from 873 µm in the presence of o2 to only 349 µm with bubbling n2 fig 3c the slower release of fe ii resulted in the less effective decomposition of pds in mzvijk pds process by removing o2 and the pds depletion time was postponed from 1 h in the presence of o2 to 2 h in the absence of o2 fig 3d as a result pmso transformation in mzvijk pds process was inhibited by removing o2 see details in text s1 and fig s3 the discrepancies in the dissolved o2 effect between nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes revealed that zvi aerobic oxygenation participated in the whole course stages i iii of mzvijk pds process while it only occurred in nzvimc pds process at stage iii where pds was nearly depleted as illustrated by scheme 1 this distinction suggested that pds is far more reactive than o2 in interacting with nzvi however pds and o2 might show comparable reactivity in competitively corroding mzvi notably the former t buoh assay identified that oh only participated in pmso transformation in stage iii of mzvijk pds process rather than the entire process this result indicated that h2o2 produced by the mzvi o2 interaction eqs 3 5 was not effectively transferred to oh eq 6 in stage i and stage ii of mzvijk pds process which was probably attributed to the initial strong competitive consumption of fe ii by sufficient pds and the invalid consumption of h2o2 on the mzvi surface with producing inert oh scheme 1 this inference was also stated by lee et al 2014 who found that 90 of the in situ generated h2o2 in zvi o2 process was consumed on the zvi surface 3 3 parameters affecting the evolution of reactive oxidants relative role in nzvi pds and mzvi pds processes 3 3 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on pds decomposition and pmso transformation in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was investigated under typical conditions pds 0 500 µm zvi 0 0 05 g l pmso 0 200 µm ph 3 7 as shown in fig s3 pds decomposition in mzvial pds process was slower than that in nzvimc pds process at ph 3 and 4 however δ pds 6h in mzvial pds process was 303 and 123 µm at ph 5 and 7 respectively which was several times higher than that in nzvimc pds process in which δ pds 6h was only 63 µm at ph 5 and 32 µm at ph 7 fig s4 this result implied that mzvi had higher reactivity toward decomposing pds at near neutral ph than nzvi moreover as shown in figs 4 a and 4b both δ pmso and δ pmso2 decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 in mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes but mzvial pds process achieved higher pmso transformation efficiency under the entire ph conditions of 3 7 see fig s5 for the time dependent variation in pmso and pmso2 the good performance of mzvial pds process at acidic ph was attributed to the weaker competitive consumption of the reactive intermediates induced by the slower release of fe ii fig 1b while the faster pds decomposition may account for its exceptional removal efficiency under near neutral conditions fig s4 further a clearly defined three stage evolution of η pmso2 was obtained in mzvial pds process at ph 3 as mentioned before comparatively the η pmso2 value remained at a high level 90 until 30 min and then decreased gradually to 67 at 6 h in mzvial pds process at ph 4 fig 4c at ph 5 the η pmso2 value experienced a long increase period where it increased from 33 to 74 during 2 h stage i and then stabilized at this maximum in stage ii within 6 h in mzvial pds process fig 4c data on the evolution of η pmso2 value at ph 7 was not show due to no pmso2 production was obtained in mzvial pds process at ph 7 fig 4b a similar ph dependent evolution trend of the η pmso2 value was also observed in nzvimc pds process fig 4d the high initial η pmso2 value obtained at ph 4 in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was ascribed to the stronger scavenging effect of ch3cooh buffer on so4 8 8 20 104 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1996 criquet and leitner 2009 herrmann et al 1999 relative to that on fe iv 3 1 m 1 s 1 ph 0 jacobsen et al 1998 which apparently enhanced the relative contribution of fe iv to pmso transformation in the initial stage moreover the obviously prolonged stage i at ph 5 was probably attributed to several factors including i the decrease in the oxidation capability of fe iv wang et al 2022 lu et al 2018 bataineh et al 2012 louwerse et al 2008 and ii the reduction of available fe ii at high ph caused by the slower corrosion of zvi by h the precipitation of aqueous iron and the passivation of the zvi surface by precipitation wang et al 2020 kim et al 2018 which significantly suppressed the formation of fe iv through the fe ii pds interaction eq 1 3 3 2 effect of zvi initial concentration the effect of zvi initial concentration was investigated at ph 3 by varying nzvimc 0 or mzvijk 0 from 0 01 g l to 0 1 g l i e 179 µm to 1790 µm fixing pds 0 and pmso 0 at 500 µm and 200 µm respectively consistent with common sense in both nzvimc pds and mzvijk pds processes a higher zvi 0 resulted in a faster increase in fe tot and a higher final fe tot which was accompanied by faster pds decomposition fig s6 moreover as expected the increase in zvi 0 initially induced faster pmso degradation but simultaneously led to a lower δ pmso 6h fig s7 due to the competitive consumption of fe iv so4 and oh by excess fe ii mártire et al 2002 buxton et al 1997 buxton et al 1988 7 feivo2 fe2 2h 2fe3 h2o k 1 40 105 m 1 s 1 ph 1 8 so4 fe2 fe3 so4 2 k 4 6 109 m 1 s 1 9 oh fe2 fe3 oh k 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 further the increase in zvi 0 also accelerated the rate of producing pmso2 initially but reduced the maximum of pmso2 production fig s7 which was rationalized by the stronger aerobic oxygenation of zvi in stage iii with more remaining zvi additionally the three stage evolution of the calculated η pmso2 value was observed in mzvial pds process in each case that it first increased to the maximum 80 stage i and then maintained constant at it stage ii followed by a final decrease phase stage iii fig 5 a with increasing mzvial 0 from 0 01 to 0 1 g l the duration of stage i was shortened from 2 h to 12 5 min and afterward conversion from stage ii to stage iii was put forward from 6 h to 15 min as depicted by fig 5b the accelerated increase in the relative contribution of fe iv versus so4 in stage i by increasing mzvi 0 was ascribed to the significantly enhanced release of fe ii fig s6 the precursor of fe iv eq 1 meanwhile the promoted pds consumption advanced the time of generating oh by mzvi aerobic corrosion in mzvial pds process which was responsible for the earlier appearance of stage iii with increasing mzvi 0 in nzvimc pds process the calculated η pmso2 value initially kept constant at about 80 for a period stage ii and then progressively decreased stage iii while stage i was still not observed in each case fig 5c as illustrated in fig 5d the duration of stage ii was significantly shortened from 6 h to 2 5 min with increasing nzvimc 0 from 0 01 g l to 0 1 g l similar to the case of mzvial pds process fig 5b the earlier onset of stage iii by increasing nzvimc 0 in nzvimc pds process could also be rationalized by the faster release of fe ii and the enhanced decomposition of pds fig s6 3 3 3 effect of pds initial concentration the influence of pds 0 100 1000 µm on pmso 200 µm transformation in mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was investigated at fixed zvi 0 0 02 g l interestingly the increase in pds 0 significantly promoted pds decomposition in both processes while its effect on accelerating zvi dissolution was below the anticipated value fig s8 for instance in mzvial pds process δ pds at 30 min sharply increased from 76 µm to 393 µm with increasing pds 0 from 100 µm to 1000 µm while fe tot at 30 min moderately increased from 94 µm to 154 µm figs s8a and s7b similarly in nzvimc pds process δ pds at 15 min was significantly increased from 90 to 405 µm by varying pds 0 from 100 to 1000 µm but fe tot at 15 min was slightly increased from 201 to 237 µm figs s8c and s8d as illustrated in scheme 1 pds was heterogeneously activated by zvi with releasing fe ii or homogeneously catalyzed by the released fe ii in zvi pds process accordingly the increase in pds 0 primarily enhanced the fe ii pds interaction by forming fe iv eq 1 while weakly influenced zvi corrosion by producing so4 eq 2 this inference was consistent with the observation that the acceleration of pmso transformation by increasing pds 0 in both mzvial pds and nzvimc pds processes was mainly ascribed to the significantly promoted production of fe iv rather than so4 see details in text s2 and figs s9 and s10 as shown in fig 6 a the η pmso2 value increased from 34 at 2 5 min to 67 below 80 at 30 min stage i and then immediately decreased to 42 within 6 h stage iii in mzvial pds process at 100 µm pds 0 the disappearance of stage ii was attributed to the fact that pds was depleted before the relative contribution of fe iv and so4 reached a balance in stage i at relatively low pds 0 at 250 µm to 1000 µm pds 0 evolution of η pmso2 value showed the three stage behavior in mzvial pds process fig 6a moreover with increasing pds 0 from 250 µm to 1000 µm the duration of stage i was shortened from 45 min to 15 min however the conversion from stage ii to stage iii was postponed from 1 h to 4 h as illustrated in fig 6b the accelerated accumulation of the relative contribution of fe iv in stage i was rationalized by the significantly enhanced fe ii pds interaction by increasing pds 0 as discussed above the prolonged stage ii was attributed to the fact that the promotion of pds 0 inhibited the transformation from h2o2 to oh during mzvi aerobic corrosion by competitively capturing fe ii as depicted by scheme 1 in nzvimc pds process the η pmso2 value maintained constant at about 80 before 15 min stage ii followed by a progressive decrease phase within 6 h stage iii at 100 µm pds 0 while it remained constant at 80 until 6 h stage ii at 250 1000 µm pds 0 figs 6c and 6d similar to mzvial pds process the high efficiency of increasing pds 0 in promoting the contribution of fe iv relative to that of so4 and suppressing oh formation was responsible for the significantly prolonged stage ii in mzvi pds 4 conclusions this study provides new insight into the time dependent evolution of the relative contributions of fe iv generated by the fe ii pds reaction so4 formed through direct electron transfer from the zvi core to pds and oh produced by zvi aerobic oxygenation in mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes by using pmso as the probe the main conclusions are as follows i in mzvi pds process role of fe iv relative to so4 is initially progressively promoted stage i and subsequently achieves equilibrium for a period stage ii afterward the relative role of oh gradually takes the lead when pds is nearly depleted stage iii similar evolution trends of the relative role of fe iv and free radicals so4 oh are observed in nzvi pds process except that the initial increase in the relative contribution of fe iv stage i is negligible due to the exceptional rapid release of fe ii from nzvi dissolution ii in mzvi pds process dissolved o2 participates in corroding mzvi during entire process stages i iii however h2o2 produced by mzvi o2 interaction is not effectively transferred to oh before stage iii which is rationalized by the competitive consumption of fe ii by sufficient pds initially and the invalid consumption of h2o2 on mzvi surface by contrast zvi aerobic oxygenation occurred at stage iii rather than the whole course in nzvi pds process when pds is consumed to a low level this difference indicates that the gap between the reactivity of pds and o2 toward mzvi is much narrower than that toward nzvi iii a relatively high ph prolongs the period of achieving the balance of the relative contribution of fe iv and free radicals i e stage i which is probably attributed to the decrease in the oxidation capability of fe iv and the reduction of available fe ii with increasing ph iv the increase of zvi initial concentration shortens stage i and advances the conversion from stage ii to stage iii because higher zvi 0 promotes fe iv accumulation by enhancing fe ii release and accelerating pds decomposition which advances the time of generating oh by zvi aerobic corrosion v the promotion of pds initial concentration shortens stage i but prolongs stage ii and postpones the conversion from stage ii to stage iii due to the high efficiency of increasing pds 0 in accelerating fe iv formation by enhancing fe ii pds interaction and suppressing the transformation from h2o2 to oh by competitively capturing fe ii the marked distinctions in chemical properties and oxidative behaviors between fe iv so4 and oh have been well documented in our very recent work wang et al 2022 specifically aqueous fe iv is less reactive than oh so4 but possesses a longer lifetime and is more selective in oxidizing background concomitants wang et al 2022 moreover fe iv oxidizes organics through diverse reaction pathways e g hydrogen atom hydride oxygen atom and electron transfer as well as electrophilic addition while oh and so4 prefer to degrade organic contaminants via hydrogen atom abstraction and electron transfer respectively wang et al 2022 accordingly dynamics of the relative roles of fe iv so4 and oh would induce time dependent changeover in the decontamination mechanism in both mzvi pds and nzvi pds processes which cannot be overlooked in future

firstly indicated that persistent free radicals pfrs rather than chemical composition and material structure dominated paa activation and organic radicals ro was proved to be the major reactive species through electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection the mixture of psd and ssd caused the synergy of inorganic metals and organic matters through pyrolysis processes resulting in larger specific surface area ssa 110 71 m2 g more abundant electron donating groups e g c o oh and massive defects id ig 1 519 of ps sdbc than p sdbc and s sdbc which eventually promoted pfrs formation a fascinating phenomenon was observed in ps sdbc paa system that the active sites of pfrs could be regenerated by ro attacking onto ps sdbc which contributed to the wide ph applicability and continuous stability of ps sdbc paa system in practical wastewater treatment this study not only significantly deepened the understanding of the reaction mechanism between paa and biochar but also provided a

wastewater considering the biomass for biochar preparation were easily obtained and widely available from plant animal waste and sludge zhao et al 2021b the usage of biochar for paa activation was expected to have large application potential and deserved to be deeply investigated among the abovementioned raw biomass converting sludge into functional biochar by simple thermal treatment becomes an increasingly attractive reutilization way for the massive amounts of sludge produced in recent decades chen et al 2020 noteworthily sludge feedstock produced in different wastewater treatment

sites under pyrolysis which is benefit to improve the catalytic performance of produced biochar in aops wang et al 2020a at present secondary sludge ssd with abundant organics was the major feedstock for sdbc yin et al 2019 during pyrolysis process organics in ssd would form functional groups in sdbc which facilitated to mediate reactive species production in aops chen et al 2020 however the inherent aggregation caused by the interlinkage among the organic macromolecules would also take place during pyrolysis process which inhibited the exposure of active sites in sdbc at the same time zhao et al 2021a in addition the active sites provided by functional groups e g c o oh would be inactivated as activation process proceeding due to the oxidation of reactive species these negative effects severely limited the activation efficiency and practical application of s sdbc biochar derived from ssd in aops therefore a valid strategy for reinforcing catalytic performance of sdbc was necessary to be explored previous studies identified that the introduction of metal species in sludge would disperse and stabilize the macromolecules due to its strong affinity towards functional groups e g nh2 c o oh which was apt to improve the dispersibility and form layered porous structure in sdbc zhao et al 2021a in addition metal species immobilized on the sdbc could act as electron shuttles promoting electron circulation and thus lightening the inactive of active sites recently zhu et al zhu et al 2018 found that the coexistence of metal species and macromolecules under pyrolysis were favorable to form unpaired electron domains namely persistent free radicals pfrs pfrs exhibited stronger electron transfer capacity even than electron rich function groups contributing to an excellent catalytic performance of sdbc zhen et al 2021 though metal species show advantages on regulation the property of sdbc previous studies usually introduced metal species into sdbc from metal salts which required complicated preparation operations chen et al 2020 wang et al 2017 considering this situation it drove us to search a new way for preparing outstanding sdbc since various inorganic oxides in sewage could be removed in primary sedimentation process and ferric chloride might be added for coagulation the primary sludge psd produced during primary sedimentation was actually endowed with a large number of metal species aiyuk et al 2004 kalogo et al 2000 therefore using the mixture of psd and ssd as feedstock could provide both inorganic metals and organic matters in pyrolysis process which might improve dispersity and increase the production of active sites like pfrs in the produced biochar ps sdbc resulting in the facilitation of paa activation ability however the mixture of psd and ssd to improve the performance of sdbc was rarely investigated especially in paa activation processes for wastewater treatment in this study a novel mixed sludge derived biochar ps sdbc was synthesized by pyrolysis of ssd and psd mixture for paa activation to remove chlorophenols in wastewater p chlorophenol 4 cp was chosen as the representative chlorophenol pollutants in experiments firstly various characterizations were conducted to investigate the improvement of physiochemical properties of ps sdbc subsequently the promoting effect of paa activation by ps sdbc was evaluated in 4 cp removal experiments furthermore the dominated factor of ps sdbc to activate paa was investigated and the produced major reactive species were identified finally the production and evolution of pfrs were clarified to propose a brand new mechanism for paa activation by ps sdbc this study would provide a potential scheme for removing contaminants in wastewater with

sludge derived biochar ps sdbc physiochemical characteristics were investigated to uncover instinct properties of mixed sludge derived biochar ps sdbc superior to the agglomeration occurred in p sdbc and s sdbc fig 1 a and 1b well dispersed particles were formed in ps sdbc fig 1c indicating the improvement of dispersive performance by mixing primary sludge psd with secondary sludge ssd for preparing ps sdbc in addition ps sdbc exhibited improved specific surface area ssa 110 71 m2 g and increased micropore ratio 71 84 compared with s sdbc 82 66 m2 g 26 38 and p sdbc 107 24 m2 g 30 17 fig 1d and fig s1 those features including dispersibility ssa and porosity were tightly related to the chemical compositions of precursors zhao et al 2021b with the mixture of psd and ssd dominant sources of inorganic oxides in psd and organic components in ssd would break the linkage among the macromolecules and agglomeration of metal colloids occurred in each individual sludge under pyrolysis process leading to the outstanding structured ps sdbc zhao et al 2021b deeper investigation on functional groups and element composition was conducted to explore further improvement of physiochemical properties of ps sdbc ftir spectra were applied to investigate the functional groups in fig 2 a the peaks intensity in ps sdbc increased with elevating ratio of ssd in precursors except the broad band at 3420 cm 1 attributing to the oh stretching vibration zhu et al 2020 this was ascribed to the higher organic component content in ssd than that in psd fig s2 and text s4 the organic matters in ssd i e hydroquinone or catechol with the characteristic peaks around 1300 400 cm 1 and 1558 cm 1 had been in situ reduced into various aromatic compounds in ps sdbc after pyrolysis under high temperature as evidenced by enhanced peaks of ps sdbc at 1558 cm 1 c c and c o 1032 cm 1 co cc and cn and 777 cm 1 ch yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 such amount of electron rich functional groups c o co and cn easily apt to form electron donating carbon domains which was believed to play crucial roles on peroxides activation xu and wang 2012 this result was further confirmed by xps characterization fig s3 the fitted peaks assigned to c c 284 4 ev cc 284 8 ev and co 285 4 ev and oc 531 9 ev o c 531 11 ev and lattice oxygen 530 5 ev deconvoluted from c 1 s and o 1 s peaks respectively wang et al 2020a were obviously observed as consistent with ftir analysis meanwhile the strong electron rich heteroatom n was also found corresponding to pyridinic n 398 5 ev pyrrolic n 400 ev and graphitic n 401 2 ev zhu et al 2018 especially the proportion of graphitic n increased significantly in p5s5 sdbc fig s4 due to high temperature pyrolysis moreover xrd spectra fig 2b showed that the c peaks at 2θo 44 assigning to 001 reflection plane only could be found in s sdbc p3s7 sdbc and p5s5 sdbc that contain higher ratio of ssd this implied that higher content of ssd contributed to more graphitic layers formation in ps sdbc collectively gaining from the advantage that mixing ssd containing high content organic matters with psd facilitated to the formation of active electron donor sites in ps sdbc zhou et al 2015 besides the advantage of abundant metal based inorganics al ca cu fe k mg mn contained in psd facilitated to form metal mediated electron shuttles sites in ps sdbc table s1 the ftir results fig s2 showed that the oh stretching vibration corresponding to water molecules and fe oh in psd was stronger than that in ssd owing to the dominant sources of metals e g fe in psd as confirmed by the fe oh peaks at 569 cm 1 wei et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 typical metals peaks of fe 2p al 2p were observed in xps spectrum of p5s5 sdbc which was also confirmed by eds result fig s5 the peaks belonging to fe2o3 disappeared in p5s5 sdbc fig 2b and fig s6 suggesting that the fe3 was reduced to fe2 in pyrolysis process novais et al 2018 fe 2p range of the xps spectra fig 2c and fig s3 also identified that the fe3 712 3 ev was converted to fe2 709 9 ev after calcination in p5s5 sdbc the reduction of metal species was believed to ultimately affect the electronic configurations of p5s5 sdbc for instance the production of defects and disorder zhu et al 2021 which is signifacant to evaluate the catalytic performance of catalysts in raman spectra fig 2d the intensity ratios of d band 1349 4 cm 1 versus g band 1597 7 cm 1 id ig fig s7 representing the defects level in graphitic carbon layers increased obviously in ps sdbc 1 103 1 519 compared with p sdbc 0 210 and s sdbc 0 645 ho et al 2019 wang et al 2020a especially for the p5s5 sdbc 1 519 it could be explained by that the organic matters coexisted with metal species disoriented the uniformly conjugated electronic nets of carbon skeleton under ps sdbc pyrolysis zhao et al 2021a this behavior caused an imbalanced electron distribution due to the electronegativity difference between electron rich groups and metal sites and ultimately the massive defects formation in ps sdbc zhao et al 2021a since defects in carbon possessed rich delocalized and unpaired electrons they would provide a convenient channel for electron transport and was expected to promote the catalytic performance of ps sdbc yin et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 based on above results benefitting from advantageous sources of inorganic metals and organic matters offered by psd and ssd respectively the obtained mix sludge derived ps sdbc possessed outstanding structure rich electron donor groups and massive electronic defects which were regarded as the crucial factors to regulate the catalytic performance of ps sdbc for paa activation 3 2 catalytic performance of ps sdbc towards paa for 4 cp removal the catalytic performance of ps sdbc towards paa activation were evaluated regarding the 4 cp as target organic pollutant 4 cp could only be slightly removed 17 and 8 by paa and ps sdbc alone fig 3 a and fig s8 respectively while a significant promotion could be observed in sdbc paa systems fig 3a c obviously the catalytic performance of ps sdbc 85 100 outperformed the p sdbc 75 and s sdbc 69 more importantly p5s5 sdbc exhibited the most excellent performance for 4 cp removal 100 within 60 min fig 3a this was ascribed to the largest active sites exposed on the per unit area of p5s5 sdbc among all obtained ps sdbc fig s9a b therefore p5s5 sdbc was chosen as the representative catalyst for the subsequent studies effects of p5s5 sdbc dosage and paa concentration were investigated to obtain the optimum reaction conditions for 4 cp degradation with the initial dose of p5s5 sdbc increased from 0 05 to 0 30 g l the kobs of 4 cp removal elevated from 0 00283 1 m min to 0 0591 1 m min after 60 min reaction but no further increase occurred when the catalyst dose continued to grow to 0 40 g l kobs 0 0509 1 m min fig 3b and fig s9c generally more active sites could be provided for paa activation with higher concentration of catalysts however excess amounts of catalysts would cause agglomeration phenomenon jawad et al 2018 najjar et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 together with the insufficient paa concentration limiting further improvement of removal efficiency in p5s5 sdbc paa system similar with the dosage effect of catalysts removal of 4 cp was accelerated with paa concentration increasing from 0 6 to 1 8 mm and then an inhibition 19 was observed as the paa dose increased to 2 4 mm fig 3c and fig s9d this adverse effect was identified as the competitive consumption of generated radicals by excessive paa with 4 cp commonly observed in previous study yang et al 2022 as the fabricated paa solution contained both paa and h2o2 h2o2 concentration would increase with the elevation of paa dose which might influence the removal of 4 cp to further identify the role of h2o2 in p5s5 sdbc paa system removal of 4 cp with h2o2 concentration at equivalent to that in paa solution 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 mm was investigated fig s10a negligible enhancement of 4 cp removal was observed with increasing of h2o2 concentrations fig s10b indicating that paa was the main oxidant activated by p5s5 sdbc for 4 cp removal in p5s5 sdbc paa system since p5s5 sdbc paa system exhibited excellent performance for 4 cp removal the effect of ph was conducted to further investigate the suitability of this system with the reaction proceeding the solution ph kept stable when the initial ph was 3 and 5 fig s11a while a small ph decrease 1 0 was observed when the initial values of ph were 7 9 and 11 which might be due to the formed acidic intermediate products from the higher removal rate of 4 cp fig s11b the removal of 4 cp increased with ph varying from 3 to 9 and slightly decreased when the ph further up to 11 fig 3d as reported ph changes altered the stability of paa paa would keep self stable in the acetic condition while appeared self decomposition at ph over the pka 8 2 of paa this drove most paa related aops to exhibit the satisfactory contaminants removal efficiency at ph 7 8 but poor removal efficiency at ph 11 dong et al 2022 du et al 2018 wang et al 2020c interestingly inconsistent with previous studies the 4 cp removal didn t obey this rule the optimal ph for 4 cp removal was 9 and maintained high efficiency with ph extending to 11 in p5s5 sdbc paa system when ph exceeding pka 8 2 of paa the conjugate base form paa of paa was dominant which would show severe self decomposition together with electronic repulsion to p5s5 sdbc phpzc 4 9 fig s12 wang et al 2020c in this case the 4 cp removal should be relatively difficult when ph exceeded pka of paa based on above analysis but the anomaly phenomenon emerged in this study suggesting that other factors except for charge characteristics dominated p5s5 sdbc activated paa process during 4 cp removal 3 3 critical role of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc for paa activation the activation performance of biochar towards paa might be determined by multiple factors including chemical composition e g functional groups and metal species material structure e g specific surface area and porosity and electronic nature e g defects and pfrs kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2015 in order to further reveal the dominant factor on regulating activation performance of p5s5 sdbc the correlation between properties of catalysts and removal efficiency of 4 cp was systematically explored it could be obtained that the intensity of functional groups followed the order of s sdbc p3s7 sdbc p5s5 sdbc p7s3 sdbc p sdbc fig 2a absolutely different from the trend of kobs with p5s5 sdbc paa p7s3 sdbc paa p3s7 sdbc paa p sdbc paa s sdbc paa fig s9 in addition no relation could be found between the metal oxides fig 2b or leaching metal ions fig s13 in prepared biochar with the counterpart s catalytic performance fig s9 these results indicated that the chemical composition of ps sdbc played the minor role on paa activation as for the material structure the poor linear relationships fig s14 of ssa vs kobs r2 0 610 and porosity vs kobs r2 0 245 excluded them on dominating the catalytic performance of ps sdbc in paa activation therefore electronic nature e g defects and pfrs of ps sdbc might be the critical role on regulating the paa activation for 4 cp removal carbon defects localized in an imperfect graphitic structure made their π electrons to be not confined by the edge carbons this case induced the unstable electronic state namely delocalized and unpaired electrons which could transfer to paa to accomplish activation zhao et al 2021b as expected a higher content of defects in ps sdbc apparently led a higher kobs for 4 cp removal in ps sdbc paa system fig 4 a implying that carbon defects in ps sdbc might contribute to paa activation nevertheless the unperfect linear relation r2 0 718 seems to be indicative of that carbon defects were not the direct decisive factor on regulating catalytic performance of ps sdbc in paa activation the carbon defects dominant peroxide activation usually involved a complex electron transfer process between oxidants and catalysts though both delocalized and unpaired electron in carbon defects could contribute to electron transfer during activation process compared with the high energy barrier of complexation dissociation process in paa activation by delocalized electron the direct single electron transfer activation triggered by super active unpaired electrons in defects was more available wu et al 2021a the unpaired electron configuration denoted as pfrs in carbon materials was frequently identified as the dominant active site in some peroxide activation processes including h2o2 pms and so on wu et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 thus the formation of pfrs in prepared biochar were determined by epr signals g factor 2 0021 2 0043 fig 4b covering carbon centered radicals carbon centered radicals with adjacent oxygen atoms and oxygen centered radicals the intensities of pfrs followed the order of p5s5 sdbc p7s3 sdbc p3s7 sdbc p sdbc s sdbc which showed a perfect linear relation of pfrs intensity vs kobs r2 0 900 fig 4c evidently emphasizing the direct role of pfrs in ps sdbc on regulating the paa activation for 4 cp removal a positive correlation between edcs and pfrs intensity fig s15 identified that the pfrs could improve the electron transfer capacity of the prepared biochar thus promote activation efficiency for further confirmation a common pfrs scavenger of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added in ps sdbc paa system fang et al 2014b as shown in fig 4d the removal of 4 cp was greatly suppressed and the decomposition of paa was almost completely inhibited in p5s5 sdbc paa system those results definitely confirmed that pfrs acted as dominant active sites of ps sdbc for regulating paa activation thus the correlation between defects and kobs was due to the positively promotion of the carbon centered pfrs by defects fig s16 however besides the defects the coexistence of the electron donating groups e g c o oh fig s2 and metal species e g fe fig 2b also facilitated the formation of oxygen centered pfrs in ps sdbc because the trace transition metals could act as electron acceptors to obtain delocalized π electrons from organics to induce them to form pfrs fang et al 2014a 2014b as evidenced by the conversion of fe3 to fe2 fig s3 and fig 2c fang et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 in addition the formation of graphitic n fig s4 could well retain the unpaired electrons via conjugating with neighboring π electrons and was also favorable to form and stabilize the pfrs in ps sdbc wu et al 2021b zhen et al 2021 zhong et al 2018 therefore pfrs endowed by defects was the direct factor deciding paa activation in ps sdbc compared with s sdbc and p sdbc proper mixture of ssd with psd increased the formation of defects on ps sdbc which promoted the production of pfrs for more efficient paa activation during 4 cp removal process 3 4 reactive species for 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system to uncover the paa activation process triggered by pfrs of ps sdbc the types of reactive species formed in this system were systematically studied previous reports chen et al 2020 fang et al 2017 wu et al 2021b yang et al 2016 zhen et al 2021 found that pfrs were capable of mediating ros e g o2 1o2 and oh production via single electron transfer process in peroxides activation system what s more paa activation could also generate ro e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh by carbonaceous materials wang et al 2021a 2020b zhou et al 2015 thus quenching experiments and epr measurement were used to gain insight into the involved reactive species in p5s5 sdbc paa system no inhibition effect fig 5 a and fig s17 on 4 cp removal was observed in p5s5 sdbc paa system with the addition of excess tba and sod as ho and o2 scavengers respectively k t b a h o 6 0 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 k s o d o 2 2 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 suggesting that the role of ho and o2 could be ignored in 4 cp degradation process butler and hoey 1986 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 while an obvious decay in 4 cp removal was achieved after the addition of ffa 91 and 2 4 hd 83 in p5s5 sdbc paa system ffa was commonly used as the quencher of 1o2 k f f a 1 o 2 1 2 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 and 2 4 hd was the co quenching agent of oh peroxyl roo and acylperoxyl rc o oo radicals kim et al 2020 since the role of oh was excluded fig 5a above scavenging results indicated that 1o2 and ro might dominate the 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system epr experiments were further conducted to provide direct evidence for the existence of reactive species different from scavenging experimental results when using temp as the scavenger of 1o2 tempo singles 1 1 1 fig s18a were largely reduced in p5s5 sdbc paa system compared with paa alone system indicating that the formation of tempo was resulted from the reaction between temp and paa or h2o2 rather than 1o2 moreover paa decomposition was enhanced from 8 to 43 fig s18b after the addition of ffa these results collectively suggested that the inhibition effect of ffa on 4 cp removal was ascribed to the paa decomposition rather than the oxidation effect of 1o2 thus the contribution of 1o2 to 4 cp removal could be ignored nevertheless the effect of 2 4 hd on paa decomposition was negligible dmpo was further added to identify the presence of ro in epr experiments obvious signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 were observed in single paa system due to the self decomposition of h2o2 fig 5b but transferred into dmpox 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 after the addition of p5s5 sdbc due to the formation of short lived dmpo ro adduct implying the production of ro from the activation of paa by p5s5 sdbc wu et al 2020 thus it could be concluded that ro was the major reactive species for 4 cp removal in p5s5 sdbc paa system based on above analysis pfrs of p5s5 sdbc was the active site to activate paa and ro was primarily produced in this process for 4 cp degradation epr results indicated that the intensity of ro and pfrs increased with the increasing of ph from 3 to 9 fig 5b and 5c which was consistent with the removal of 4 cp with changes of ph further confirming the proposed activation process in p5s5 sdbc paa system however the pristine pfrs was formed through the pyrolysis of psd and ssd mixtures before reacting with paa whose intensity was influenced by the sludge properties and pyrolysis conditions instead of the ph values in paa activation process thus the increased intensity of pfrs with increasing of ph suggested that there existed uncovered reaction schemes of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc paa system indicating that the activation mechanism of paa by pfrs was more complex than that expected 3 5 regeneration of pfrs during paa activation in p5s5 sdbc paa system pfrs always initiate the peroxide activation by single electron transfer while in turn result in the variation of pfrs concentration fang et al 2014b wu et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 zhen et al 2021 for further making clear the evolution of pfrs of ps sdbc during paa activation process edc and eac measurements were conducted in p5s5 sdbc paa system as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b the edc and eac of p5s5 sdbc paa calculated respectively from meo and mer results changed obviously compared with that of p5s5 sdbc and paa alone as indicated electron transfer indeed appeared in p5s5 sdbc paa system while the current edc results was unconventional theoretically paa would compete with the electrode for electrons from pfrs to be activated resulting in a decrease in edc of p5s5 sdbc paa fig 6d however its edc increased in this study fig 6a and s18a similar result was also found in our previous study when using the n doped carbon to activate pms ascribing to the formation and regeneration of pfrs in catalyst during activation process zhen et al 2021 it was demonstrated that carbonaceous materials could not only donor the electrons to peroxides for generation of reactive species but also accept the electrons from the reactive species e g oh and so4 and peroxides to form pfrs in catalysts moreno castilla et al 2010 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2018 therefore it was reasonable to deduce that the abnormal phenomenon observed in edc results was due to that paa could be activated by pfrs while in turn the generated ro and paa tended to re react with p5s5 sdbc resulting in the regeneration of pfrs fig 6f for confirmation 2 4 hd and 4 cp was respectively introduced into electrochemical cell containing p5s5 sdbc and paa as expected the edc decreased and eac increased with the addition of 2 4 hd and 4 cp fig 6a b and fig s19a b the introduction of 2 4 hd and 4 cp could consume the ro and then prevent pfrs regeneration which intercepted the electrons transfer from the pfrs to electrode edc mode fig 6d and paa eac mode fig 6e thus respectively decreasing electron accumulation on electrode edc mode and promoting the electron outflow from electrode to paa eac mode moreover paa decomposition fig s20 decreased in the presence of 2 4 hd which might ascribe to the quenching of ro to inhibit the regeneration of pfrs further resulting in impaired activation of paa besides an already identified ro involvement system of co2 paa was applied to pretreat the p5s5 sdbc noteworthily the pretreated p5s5 sdbc was washed five times with deionized water then transferred to a vacuum drying oven and dried at 50 c for 12 h to remove residual co2 in the p5s5 sdbc afterwards it was observed that the epr signal belonging to pfrs enhanced for pretreated p5s5 sdbc fig s21a as well as the degradation of 4 cp improved in counterpart p5s5 sdbc paa system fig s21b these results firmly confirmed the occurrence of pfrs regeneration in p5s5 sdbc during paa activation the regeneration of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc paa system well explained the variation of pfrs intensities with ph changes as acidic dissociation for pfrs precursors e g catechols hydroquinones and phenols enhanced with ph increasing ph 3 9 maskos et al 2013 which contributed to the reaction between ro and p5s5 sdbc and the subsequent regeneration of pfrs while this effect would be restricted with ph continuing to increase ph 9 11 due to the less production of ro by paa self decomposition together with the competitive consumption of ro by oh additionally the g factors of pfrs observed from the used p5s5 sdbc that obtain from the p5s5 sdbc paa system under different ph conditions 2 0033 2 0045 and co2 paa process 2 0036 2 0043 were slightly shifted toward the larger value fig 5c and fig s21a indicating that the regenerated pfrs were carbon centered radicals with adjacent oxygen atoms and oxygen centered radicals this evolution of pfrs regulated the activation of paa and the subsequent 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system based on above analysis a novel paa activation method based on pfrs of p5s5 sdbc was detailed elucidated ro could be produced through the reaction between pfrs and paa for pollutants oxidation and pfrs could be regenerated from reaction between ro paa and p5s5 sdbc this overall reaction scheme not only extended the ph applicability but also facilitated to the continuous stability of the system over 80 catalytic efficiency could be well maintained after four cycles fig s22 and a satisfactory 4 cp removal only 10 less than that in di water was also observed in secondary effluent fig 6c in addition the leaching concentration of heavy metals in reaction solution was negligible table s1 thus its impact on the environment was insignificant furthermore the structure of the used p5s5 sdbc was almost any damaged fig s23 which was conducive to the removal of biochar from the reaction solution by means of filtration it could avoid secondary pollution caused by heavy metals and organic matters contained in the biochar these results indicated a potential usage of pfrs for paa activation in practical application compared with commonly reported carbonaceous materials pfrs widely existed in biochar with lower cost and easier preparation procedures moreover through the mixture of ssd and psd in this study the intensity of pfrs in the produced biochar could be further promoted by the combination of both abundant inorganic metals and organic compounds during pyrolysis which provided a possibility for sludge disposal and aops building at the same time in wastewater treatment processes 3 6 degradation pathway of 4 cp in p5s5 sdbc paa system the degradation pathway of 4 cp was also analyzed by lc ms as shown in table s2 by considering the identified products and previous literatures a schematic of degradation pathway for 4 cp was proposed fig 7 ali et al 2021 li et al 2018a 2018b aforementioned discussion proved that the main reactive radical accounting for 4 cp degradation in the p5s5 sdbc paa process was ro rather than ho the detected hydroxyl 4 cp derivative op 9 indicated that hydroxylation reaction took place on the benzene ring which would be explained by the formation of c centered radical cation through electron transfer from organic compounds to ro consequently the hydrolysis of c centered radical cation led to hydroxylated product generation which further reacted with dissolved o2 along with dichlorination resulting in the production of hydroxy 1 4 benzoquine op 8 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquine was further deconstructed by ro into short chain aliphatic carboxylic acids including glycolic acid op 1 oxalic acid op 2 e 2 4 pentadienoic acid op 4 propanedioic acid op 5 and fumaric acid op 7 etc through ring opening reactions it suggested that the hydroxylation dechlorination and ring opening were the most prominent pathways in paa p5s5 sdbc system for 4 cp degradation 4 conclusion this study presented a brand new preparation way of a sludge derived biochar ps sdbc by pyrolysis of mixture of primary sludge psd and secondary sludge ssd benefitting from advantageous sources of inorganic metals and organic matters offered by the psd and ssd the obtained ps sdbc exhibited outstanding structure rich electron donor groups and massive electronic defects which promoted the formation of abundant pfrs in ps sdbc pfrs equipped with unpaired electrons in p5s5 sdbc were firstly identified as critical active sites for paa activaiton which could mediate single electron transfer to paa to produce ro for pollutants oxidation the ps sdbc paa system exhibited outperformed catalytic performance for 4 cp removal through the dichlorination hydroxylation and ring opening pathway from ph 7 to 11 noteworthily the active site of pfrs in this system could be regenerated as activation proceeding this manner endowed the ps sdbc paa system with wide ph applicability and continuous stability for 4 cp removal in practical application which provided an alternative scheme for establishing an effective paa based

15596,peracetic acid paa based advanced oxidation processes aops were increasingly identified as the alternative scheme in wastewater treatment cost effective and easily available catalyst for activation of paa was in urgent demand for promoting engineering application process in this study a new type of biochar catalyst derived from pyrolysis of mixture of primary sludge psd and secondary sludge ssd was prepared and showed effective paa activation ability the degradation of p chlorophenol 4 cp improved with paa activation by mixed sludge derived biochar ps sdbc than secondary sludge derived biochar s sdbc and primary sludge derived biochar p sdbc and the highest removal efficiency achieved by ps sdbc with the psd ssd ratio of 5 5 kobs 0 057 1 m min ph 9 correlation analysis firstly indicated that persistent free radicals pfrs rather than chemical composition and material structure dominated paa activation and organic radicals ro was proved to be the major reactive species through electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection the mixture of psd and ssd caused the synergy of inorganic metals and organic matters through pyrolysis processes resulting in larger specific surface area ssa 110 71 m2 g more abundant electron donating groups e g c o oh and massive defects id ig 1 519 of ps sdbc than p sdbc and s sdbc which eventually promoted pfrs formation a fascinating phenomenon was observed in ps sdbc paa system that the active sites of pfrs could be regenerated by ro attacking onto ps sdbc which contributed to the wide ph applicability and continuous stability of ps sdbc paa system in practical wastewater treatment this study not only significantly deepened the understanding of the reaction mechanism between paa and biochar but also provided a

cost effective and easily available chen et al 2020 biochar which is produced from the pyrolysis of biomass has been reported as an emerging carbonaceous material with high catalytic activity towards

wastewater considering the biomass for biochar preparation were easily obtained and widely available from plant animal waste and sludge zhao et al 2021b the usage of biochar for paa activation was expected to have large application potential and deserved to be deeply investigated among the abovementioned raw biomass converting sludge into functional biochar by simple thermal treatment becomes an increasingly attractive reutilization way for the massive amounts of sludge produced in recent decades chen et al 2020 noteworthily sludge feedstock produced in different wastewater treatment processes e g primary sludge secondary sludge and dewatered sludge contains various organic and inorganic compositions which usually have significant impacts on the constitutions and subsequent catalytic performance of sludge derived biochar sdbc chen et al 2020 especially organic compounds e g catechols hydroquinones phenols and metal elements e g al fe contained in sludge could form active sites under pyrolysis which is benefit to improve the catalytic performance of produced biochar in aops wang et al 2020a at present secondary sludge ssd with abundant organics was the major feedstock for sdbc yin et al 2019 during pyrolysis process organics in ssd would form functional groups in sdbc which facilitated to mediate reactive species production in aops chen et al 2020 however the inherent aggregation caused by the interlinkage among the organic macromolecules would also take place during pyrolysis process which inhibited the exposure of active sites in sdbc at the same time zhao et al 2021a in addition the active sites provided by functional groups e g c o oh would be inactivated as activation process proceeding due to the oxidation of reactive species these negative effects severely limited the activation efficiency and practical application of s sdbc biochar derived from ssd in aops therefore a valid strategy for reinforcing catalytic performance of sdbc was necessary to be explored previous studies identified that the introduction of metal species in sludge would disperse and stabilize the macromolecules due to its strong affinity towards functional groups e g nh2 c o oh which was apt to improve the dispersibility and form layered porous structure in sdbc zhao et al 2021a in addition metal species immobilized on the sdbc could act as electron shuttles promoting electron circulation and thus lightening the inactive of active sites recently zhu et al zhu et al 2018 found that the coexistence of metal species and macromolecules under pyrolysis were favorable to form unpaired electron domains namely persistent free radicals pfrs pfrs exhibited stronger electron transfer capacity even than electron rich function groups contributing to an excellent catalytic performance of sdbc zhen et al 2021 though metal species show advantages on regulation the property of sdbc previous studies usually introduced metal species into sdbc from metal salts which required complicated preparation operations chen et al 2020 wang et al 2017 considering this situation it drove us to search a new way for preparing outstanding sdbc since various inorganic oxides in sewage could be removed in primary sedimentation process and ferric chloride might be added for coagulation the primary sludge psd produced during primary sedimentation was actually endowed with a large number of metal species aiyuk et al 2004 kalogo et al 2000 therefore using the mixture of psd and ssd as feedstock could provide both inorganic metals and organic matters in pyrolysis process which might improve dispersity and increase the production of active sites like pfrs in the produced biochar ps sdbc resulting in the facilitation of paa activation ability however the mixture of psd and ssd to improve the performance of sdbc was rarely investigated especially in paa activation processes for wastewater treatment in this study a novel mixed sludge derived biochar ps sdbc was synthesized by pyrolysis of ssd and psd mixture for paa activation to remove chlorophenols in wastewater p chlorophenol 4 cp was chosen as the representative chlorophenol pollutants in experiments firstly various characterizations were conducted to investigate the improvement of physiochemical properties of ps sdbc subsequently the promoting effect of paa activation by ps sdbc was evaluated in 4 cp removal experiments furthermore the dominated factor of ps sdbc to activate paa was investigated and the produced major reactive species were identified finally the production and evolution of pfrs were clarified to propose a brand new mechanism for paa activation by ps sdbc this study would provide a potential scheme for removing contaminants in wastewater with paa activation and realizing the reutilization of domestic sludge at the same time 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents psd and ssd were obtained from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in harbin

sludge derived biochar ps sdbc physiochemical characteristics were investigated to uncover instinct properties of mixed sludge derived biochar ps sdbc superior to the agglomeration occurred in p sdbc and s sdbc fig 1 a and 1b well dispersed particles were formed in ps sdbc fig 1c indicating the improvement of dispersive performance by mixing primary sludge psd with secondary sludge ssd for preparing ps sdbc in addition ps sdbc exhibited improved specific surface area ssa 110 71 m2 g and increased micropore ratio 71 84 compared with s sdbc 82 66 m2 g 26 38 and p sdbc 107 24 m2 g 30 17 fig 1d and fig s1 those features including dispersibility ssa and porosity were tightly related to the chemical compositions of precursors zhao et al 2021b with the mixture of psd and ssd dominant sources of inorganic oxides in psd and organic components in ssd would break the linkage among the macromolecules and agglomeration of metal colloids occurred in each individual sludge under pyrolysis process leading to the outstanding structured ps sdbc zhao et al 2021b deeper investigation on functional groups and element composition was conducted to explore further improvement of physiochemical properties of ps sdbc ftir spectra were applied to investigate the functional groups in fig 2 a the peaks intensity in ps sdbc increased with elevating ratio of ssd in precursors except the broad band at 3420 cm 1 attributing to the oh stretching vibration zhu et al 2020 this was ascribed to the higher organic component content in ssd than that in psd fig s2 and text s4 the organic matters in ssd i e hydroquinone or catechol with the characteristic peaks around 1300 400 cm 1 and 1558 cm 1 had been in situ reduced into various aromatic compounds in ps sdbc after pyrolysis under high temperature as evidenced by enhanced peaks of ps sdbc at 1558 cm 1 c c and c o 1032 cm 1 co cc and cn and 777 cm 1 ch yu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 such amount of electron rich functional groups c o co and cn easily apt to form electron donating carbon domains which was believed to play crucial roles on peroxides activation xu and wang 2012 this result was further confirmed by xps characterization fig s3 the fitted peaks assigned to c c 284 4 ev cc 284 8 ev and co 285 4 ev and oc 531 9 ev o c 531 11 ev and lattice oxygen 530 5 ev deconvoluted from c 1 s and o 1 s peaks respectively wang et al 2020a were obviously observed as consistent with ftir analysis meanwhile the strong electron rich heteroatom n was also found corresponding to pyridinic n 398 5 ev pyrrolic n 400 ev and graphitic n 401 2 ev zhu et al 2018 especially the proportion of graphitic n increased significantly in p5s5 sdbc fig s4 due to high temperature pyrolysis moreover xrd spectra fig 2b showed that the c peaks at 2θo 44 assigning to 001 reflection plane only could be found in s sdbc p3s7 sdbc and p5s5 sdbc that contain higher ratio of ssd this implied that higher content of ssd contributed to more graphitic layers formation in ps sdbc collectively gaining from the advantage that mixing ssd containing high content organic matters with psd facilitated to the formation of active electron donor sites in ps sdbc zhou et al 2015 besides the advantage of abundant metal based inorganics al ca cu fe k mg mn contained in psd facilitated to form metal mediated electron shuttles sites in ps sdbc table s1 the ftir results fig s2 showed that the oh stretching vibration corresponding to water molecules and fe oh in psd was stronger than that in ssd owing to the dominant sources of metals e g fe in psd as confirmed by the fe oh peaks at 569 cm 1 wei et al 2020 as shown in fig s3 typical metals peaks of fe 2p al 2p were observed in xps spectrum of p5s5 sdbc which was also confirmed by eds result fig s5 the peaks belonging to fe2o3 disappeared in p5s5 sdbc fig 2b and fig s6 suggesting that the fe3 was reduced to fe2 in pyrolysis process novais et al 2018 fe 2p range of the xps spectra fig 2c and fig s3 also identified that the fe3 712 3 ev was converted to fe2 709 9 ev after calcination in p5s5 sdbc the reduction of metal species was believed to ultimately affect the electronic configurations of p5s5 sdbc for instance the production of defects and disorder zhu et al 2021 which is signifacant to evaluate the catalytic performance of catalysts in raman spectra fig 2d the intensity ratios of d band 1349 4 cm 1 versus g band 1597 7 cm 1 id ig fig s7 representing the defects level in graphitic carbon layers increased obviously in ps sdbc 1 103 1 519 compared with p sdbc 0 210 and s sdbc 0 645 ho et al 2019 wang et al 2020a especially for the p5s5 sdbc 1 519 it could be explained by that the organic matters coexisted with metal species disoriented the uniformly conjugated electronic nets of carbon skeleton under ps sdbc pyrolysis zhao et al 2021a this behavior caused an imbalanced electron distribution due to the electronegativity difference between electron rich groups and metal sites and ultimately the massive defects formation in ps sdbc zhao et al 2021a since defects in carbon possessed rich delocalized and unpaired electrons they would provide a convenient channel for electron transport and was expected to promote the catalytic performance of ps sdbc yin et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 based on above results benefitting from advantageous sources of inorganic metals and organic matters offered by psd and ssd respectively the obtained mix sludge derived ps sdbc possessed outstanding structure rich electron donor groups and massive electronic defects which were regarded as the crucial factors to regulate the catalytic performance of ps sdbc for paa activation 3 2 catalytic performance of ps sdbc towards paa for 4 cp removal the catalytic performance of ps sdbc towards paa activation were evaluated regarding the 4 cp as target organic pollutant 4 cp could only be slightly removed 17 and 8 by paa and ps sdbc alone fig 3 a and fig s8 respectively while a significant promotion could be observed in sdbc paa systems fig 3a c obviously the catalytic performance of ps sdbc 85 100 outperformed the p sdbc 75 and s sdbc 69 more importantly p5s5 sdbc exhibited the most excellent performance for 4 cp removal 100 within 60 min fig 3a this was ascribed to the largest active sites exposed on the per unit area of p5s5 sdbc among all obtained ps sdbc fig s9a b therefore p5s5 sdbc was chosen as the representative catalyst for the subsequent studies effects of p5s5 sdbc dosage and paa concentration were investigated to obtain the optimum reaction conditions for 4 cp degradation with the initial dose of p5s5 sdbc increased from 0 05 to 0 30 g l the kobs of 4 cp removal elevated from 0 00283 1 m min to 0 0591 1 m min after 60 min reaction but no further increase occurred when the catalyst dose continued to grow to 0 40 g l kobs 0 0509 1 m min fig 3b and fig s9c generally more active sites could be provided for paa activation with higher concentration of catalysts however excess amounts of catalysts would cause agglomeration phenomenon jawad et al 2018 najjar et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 together with the insufficient paa concentration limiting further improvement of removal efficiency in p5s5 sdbc paa system similar with the dosage effect of catalysts removal of 4 cp was accelerated with paa concentration increasing from 0 6 to 1 8 mm and then an inhibition 19 was observed as the paa dose increased to 2 4 mm fig 3c and fig s9d this adverse effect was identified as the competitive consumption of generated radicals by excessive paa with 4 cp commonly observed in previous study yang et al 2022 as the fabricated paa solution contained both paa and h2o2 h2o2 concentration would increase with the elevation of paa dose which might influence the removal of 4 cp to further identify the role of h2o2 in p5s5 sdbc paa system removal of 4 cp with h2o2 concentration at equivalent to that in paa solution 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 mm was investigated fig s10a negligible enhancement of 4 cp removal was observed with increasing of h2o2 concentrations fig s10b indicating that paa was the main oxidant activated by p5s5 sdbc for 4 cp removal in p5s5 sdbc paa system since p5s5 sdbc paa system exhibited excellent performance for 4 cp removal the effect of ph was conducted to further investigate the suitability of this system with the reaction proceeding the solution ph kept stable when the initial ph was 3 and 5 fig s11a while a small ph decrease 1 0 was observed when the initial values of ph were 7 9 and 11 which might be due to the formed acidic intermediate products from the higher removal rate of 4 cp fig s11b the removal of 4 cp increased with ph varying from 3 to 9 and slightly decreased when the ph further up to 11 fig 3d as reported ph changes altered the stability of paa paa would keep self stable in the acetic condition while appeared self decomposition at ph over the pka 8 2 of paa this drove most paa related aops to exhibit the satisfactory contaminants removal efficiency at ph 7 8 but poor removal efficiency at ph 11 dong et al 2022 du et al 2018 wang et al 2020c interestingly inconsistent with previous studies the 4 cp removal didn t obey this rule the optimal ph for 4 cp removal was 9 and maintained high efficiency with ph extending to 11 in p5s5 sdbc paa system when ph exceeding pka 8 2 of paa the conjugate base form paa of paa was dominant which would show severe self decomposition together with electronic repulsion to p5s5 sdbc phpzc 4 9 fig s12 wang et al 2020c in this case the 4 cp removal should be relatively difficult when ph exceeded pka of paa based on above analysis but the anomaly phenomenon emerged in this study suggesting that other factors except for charge characteristics dominated p5s5 sdbc activated paa process during 4 cp removal 3 3 critical role of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc for paa activation the activation performance of biochar towards paa might be determined by multiple factors including chemical composition e g functional groups and metal species material structure e g specific surface area and porosity and electronic nature e g defects and pfrs kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 wang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2015 in order to further reveal the dominant factor on regulating activation performance of p5s5 sdbc the correlation between properties of catalysts and removal efficiency of 4 cp was systematically explored it could be obtained that the intensity of functional groups followed the order of s sdbc p3s7 sdbc p5s5 sdbc p7s3 sdbc p sdbc fig 2a absolutely different from the trend of kobs with p5s5 sdbc paa p7s3 sdbc paa p3s7 sdbc paa p sdbc paa s sdbc paa fig s9 in addition no relation could be found between the metal oxides fig 2b or leaching metal ions fig s13 in prepared biochar with the counterpart s catalytic performance fig s9 these results indicated that the chemical composition of ps sdbc played the minor role on paa activation as for the material structure the poor linear relationships fig s14 of ssa vs kobs r2 0 610 and porosity vs kobs r2 0 245 excluded them on dominating the catalytic performance of ps sdbc in paa activation therefore electronic nature e g defects and pfrs of ps sdbc might be the critical role on regulating the paa activation for 4 cp removal carbon defects localized in an imperfect graphitic structure made their π electrons to be not confined by the edge carbons this case induced the unstable electronic state namely delocalized and unpaired electrons which could transfer to paa to accomplish activation zhao et al 2021b as expected a higher content of defects in ps sdbc apparently led a higher kobs for 4 cp removal in ps sdbc paa system fig 4 a implying that carbon defects in ps sdbc might contribute to paa activation nevertheless the unperfect linear relation r2 0 718 seems to be indicative of that carbon defects were not the direct decisive factor on regulating catalytic performance of ps sdbc in paa activation the carbon defects dominant peroxide activation usually involved a complex electron transfer process between oxidants and catalysts though both delocalized and unpaired electron in carbon defects could contribute to electron transfer during activation process compared with the high energy barrier of complexation dissociation process in paa activation by delocalized electron the direct single electron transfer activation triggered by super active unpaired electrons in defects was more available wu et al 2021a the unpaired electron configuration denoted as pfrs in carbon materials was frequently identified as the dominant active site in some peroxide activation processes including h2o2 pms and so on wu et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 thus the formation of pfrs in prepared biochar were determined by epr signals g factor 2 0021 2 0043 fig 4b covering carbon centered radicals carbon centered radicals with adjacent oxygen atoms and oxygen centered radicals the intensities of pfrs followed the order of p5s5 sdbc p7s3 sdbc p3s7 sdbc p sdbc s sdbc which showed a perfect linear relation of pfrs intensity vs kobs r2 0 900 fig 4c evidently emphasizing the direct role of pfrs in ps sdbc on regulating the paa activation for 4 cp removal a positive correlation between edcs and pfrs intensity fig s15 identified that the pfrs could improve the electron transfer capacity of the prepared biochar thus promote activation efficiency for further confirmation a common pfrs scavenger of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was added in ps sdbc paa system fang et al 2014b as shown in fig 4d the removal of 4 cp was greatly suppressed and the decomposition of paa was almost completely inhibited in p5s5 sdbc paa system those results definitely confirmed that pfrs acted as dominant active sites of ps sdbc for regulating paa activation thus the correlation between defects and kobs was due to the positively promotion of the carbon centered pfrs by defects fig s16 however besides the defects the coexistence of the electron donating groups e g c o oh fig s2 and metal species e g fe fig 2b also facilitated the formation of oxygen centered pfrs in ps sdbc because the trace transition metals could act as electron acceptors to obtain delocalized π electrons from organics to induce them to form pfrs fang et al 2014a 2014b as evidenced by the conversion of fe3 to fe2 fig s3 and fig 2c fang et al 2014b zhu et al 2018 in addition the formation of graphitic n fig s4 could well retain the unpaired electrons via conjugating with neighboring π electrons and was also favorable to form and stabilize the pfrs in ps sdbc wu et al 2021b zhen et al 2021 zhong et al 2018 therefore pfrs endowed by defects was the direct factor deciding paa activation in ps sdbc compared with s sdbc and p sdbc proper mixture of ssd with psd increased the formation of defects on ps sdbc which promoted the production of pfrs for more efficient paa activation during 4 cp removal process 3 4 reactive species for 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system to uncover the paa activation process triggered by pfrs of ps sdbc the types of reactive species formed in this system were systematically studied previous reports chen et al 2020 fang et al 2017 wu et al 2021b yang et al 2016 zhen et al 2021 found that pfrs were capable of mediating ros e g o2 1o2 and oh production via single electron transfer process in peroxides activation system what s more paa activation could also generate ro e g ch3c o o ch3c o oo and oh by carbonaceous materials wang et al 2021a 2020b zhou et al 2015 thus quenching experiments and epr measurement were used to gain insight into the involved reactive species in p5s5 sdbc paa system no inhibition effect fig 5 a and fig s17 on 4 cp removal was observed in p5s5 sdbc paa system with the addition of excess tba and sod as ho and o2 scavengers respectively k t b a h o 6 0 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 k s o d o 2 2 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 suggesting that the role of ho and o2 could be ignored in 4 cp degradation process butler and hoey 1986 cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 while an obvious decay in 4 cp removal was achieved after the addition of ffa 91 and 2 4 hd 83 in p5s5 sdbc paa system ffa was commonly used as the quencher of 1o2 k f f a 1 o 2 1 2 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 and 2 4 hd was the co quenching agent of oh peroxyl roo and acylperoxyl rc o oo radicals kim et al 2020 since the role of oh was excluded fig 5a above scavenging results indicated that 1o2 and ro might dominate the 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system epr experiments were further conducted to provide direct evidence for the existence of reactive species different from scavenging experimental results when using temp as the scavenger of 1o2 tempo singles 1 1 1 fig s18a were largely reduced in p5s5 sdbc paa system compared with paa alone system indicating that the formation of tempo was resulted from the reaction between temp and paa or h2o2 rather than 1o2 moreover paa decomposition was enhanced from 8 to 43 fig s18b after the addition of ffa these results collectively suggested that the inhibition effect of ffa on 4 cp removal was ascribed to the paa decomposition rather than the oxidation effect of 1o2 thus the contribution of 1o2 to 4 cp removal could be ignored nevertheless the effect of 2 4 hd on paa decomposition was negligible dmpo was further added to identify the presence of ro in epr experiments obvious signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 were observed in single paa system due to the self decomposition of h2o2 fig 5b but transferred into dmpox 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 after the addition of p5s5 sdbc due to the formation of short lived dmpo ro adduct implying the production of ro from the activation of paa by p5s5 sdbc wu et al 2020 thus it could be concluded that ro was the major reactive species for 4 cp removal in p5s5 sdbc paa system based on above analysis pfrs of p5s5 sdbc was the active site to activate paa and ro was primarily produced in this process for 4 cp degradation epr results indicated that the intensity of ro and pfrs increased with the increasing of ph from 3 to 9 fig 5b and 5c which was consistent with the removal of 4 cp with changes of ph further confirming the proposed activation process in p5s5 sdbc paa system however the pristine pfrs was formed through the pyrolysis of psd and ssd mixtures before reacting with paa whose intensity was influenced by the sludge properties and pyrolysis conditions instead of the ph values in paa activation process thus the increased intensity of pfrs with increasing of ph suggested that there existed uncovered reaction schemes of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc paa system indicating that the activation mechanism of paa by pfrs was more complex than that expected 3 5 regeneration of pfrs during paa activation in p5s5 sdbc paa system pfrs always initiate the peroxide activation by single electron transfer while in turn result in the variation of pfrs concentration fang et al 2014b wu et al 2021b zhu et al 2018 zhen et al 2021 for further making clear the evolution of pfrs of ps sdbc during paa activation process edc and eac measurements were conducted in p5s5 sdbc paa system as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b the edc and eac of p5s5 sdbc paa calculated respectively from meo and mer results changed obviously compared with that of p5s5 sdbc and paa alone as indicated electron transfer indeed appeared in p5s5 sdbc paa system while the current edc results was unconventional theoretically paa would compete with the electrode for electrons from pfrs to be activated resulting in a decrease in edc of p5s5 sdbc paa fig 6d however its edc increased in this study fig 6a and s18a similar result was also found in our previous study when using the n doped carbon to activate pms ascribing to the formation and regeneration of pfrs in catalyst during activation process zhen et al 2021 it was demonstrated that carbonaceous materials could not only donor the electrons to peroxides for generation of reactive species but also accept the electrons from the reactive species e g oh and so4 and peroxides to form pfrs in catalysts moreno castilla et al 2010 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2018 therefore it was reasonable to deduce that the abnormal phenomenon observed in edc results was due to that paa could be activated by pfrs while in turn the generated ro and paa tended to re react with p5s5 sdbc resulting in the regeneration of pfrs fig 6f for confirmation 2 4 hd and 4 cp was respectively introduced into electrochemical cell containing p5s5 sdbc and paa as expected the edc decreased and eac increased with the addition of 2 4 hd and 4 cp fig 6a b and fig s19a b the introduction of 2 4 hd and 4 cp could consume the ro and then prevent pfrs regeneration which intercepted the electrons transfer from the pfrs to electrode edc mode fig 6d and paa eac mode fig 6e thus respectively decreasing electron accumulation on electrode edc mode and promoting the electron outflow from electrode to paa eac mode moreover paa decomposition fig s20 decreased in the presence of 2 4 hd which might ascribe to the quenching of ro to inhibit the regeneration of pfrs further resulting in impaired activation of paa besides an already identified ro involvement system of co2 paa was applied to pretreat the p5s5 sdbc noteworthily the pretreated p5s5 sdbc was washed five times with deionized water then transferred to a vacuum drying oven and dried at 50 c for 12 h to remove residual co2 in the p5s5 sdbc afterwards it was observed that the epr signal belonging to pfrs enhanced for pretreated p5s5 sdbc fig s21a as well as the degradation of 4 cp improved in counterpart p5s5 sdbc paa system fig s21b these results firmly confirmed the occurrence of pfrs regeneration in p5s5 sdbc during paa activation the regeneration of pfrs in p5s5 sdbc paa system well explained the variation of pfrs intensities with ph changes as acidic dissociation for pfrs precursors e g catechols hydroquinones and phenols enhanced with ph increasing ph 3 9 maskos et al 2013 which contributed to the reaction between ro and p5s5 sdbc and the subsequent regeneration of pfrs while this effect would be restricted with ph continuing to increase ph 9 11 due to the less production of ro by paa self decomposition together with the competitive consumption of ro by oh additionally the g factors of pfrs observed from the used p5s5 sdbc that obtain from the p5s5 sdbc paa system under different ph conditions 2 0033 2 0045 and co2 paa process 2 0036 2 0043 were slightly shifted toward the larger value fig 5c and fig s21a indicating that the regenerated pfrs were carbon centered radicals with adjacent oxygen atoms and oxygen centered radicals this evolution of pfrs regulated the activation of paa and the subsequent 4 cp degradation in p5s5 sdbc paa system based on above analysis a novel paa activation method based on pfrs of p5s5 sdbc was detailed elucidated ro could be produced through the reaction between pfrs and paa for pollutants oxidation and pfrs could be regenerated from reaction between ro paa and p5s5 sdbc this overall reaction scheme not only extended the ph applicability but also facilitated to the continuous stability of the system over 80 catalytic efficiency could be well maintained after four cycles fig s22 and a satisfactory 4 cp removal only 10 less than that in di water was also observed in secondary effluent fig 6c in addition the leaching concentration of heavy metals in reaction solution was negligible table s1 thus its impact on the environment was insignificant furthermore the structure of the used p5s5 sdbc was almost any damaged fig s23 which was conducive to the removal of biochar from the reaction solution by means of filtration it could avoid secondary pollution caused by heavy metals and organic matters contained in the biochar these results indicated a potential usage of pfrs for paa activation in practical application compared with commonly reported carbonaceous materials pfrs widely existed in biochar with lower cost and easier preparation procedures moreover through the mixture of ssd and psd in this study the intensity of pfrs in the produced biochar could be further promoted by the combination of both abundant inorganic metals and organic compounds during pyrolysis which provided a possibility for sludge disposal and aops building at the same time in wastewater treatment processes 3 6 degradation pathway of 4 cp in p5s5 sdbc paa system the degradation pathway of 4 cp was also analyzed by lc ms as shown in table s2 by considering the identified products and previous literatures a schematic of degradation pathway for 4 cp was proposed fig 7 ali et al 2021 li et al 2018a 2018b aforementioned discussion proved that the main reactive radical accounting for 4 cp degradation in the p5s5 sdbc paa process was ro rather than ho the detected hydroxyl 4 cp derivative op 9 indicated that hydroxylation reaction took place on the benzene ring which would be explained by the formation of c centered radical cation through electron transfer from organic compounds to ro consequently the hydrolysis of c centered radical cation led to hydroxylated product generation which further reacted with dissolved o2 along with dichlorination resulting in the production of hydroxy 1 4 benzoquine op 8 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquine was further deconstructed by ro into short chain aliphatic carboxylic acids including glycolic acid op 1 oxalic acid op 2 e 2 4 pentadienoic acid op 4 propanedioic acid op 5 and fumaric acid op 7 etc through ring opening reactions it suggested that the hydroxylation dechlorination and ring opening were the most prominent pathways in paa p5s5 sdbc system for 4 cp degradation 4 conclusion this study presented a brand new preparation way of a sludge derived biochar ps sdbc by pyrolysis of mixture of primary sludge psd and secondary sludge ssd benefitting from advantageous sources of inorganic metals and organic matters offered by the psd and ssd the obtained ps sdbc exhibited outstanding structure rich electron donor groups and massive electronic defects which promoted the formation of abundant pfrs in ps sdbc pfrs equipped with unpaired electrons in p5s5 sdbc were firstly identified as critical active sites for paa activaiton which could mediate single electron transfer to paa to produce ro for pollutants oxidation the ps sdbc paa system exhibited outperformed catalytic performance for 4 cp removal through the dichlorination hydroxylation and ring opening pathway from ph 7 to 11 noteworthily the active site of pfrs in this system could be regenerated as activation proceeding this manner endowed the ps sdbc paa system with wide ph applicability and continuous stability for 4 cp removal in practical application which provided an alternative scheme for establishing an effective paa based

15597,groundwater contaminated with arsenic as must be treated prior to drinking as human exposure to as at toxic levels can cause various diseases including cancer conventional aeration filtration applied to anaerobic arsenite as iii contaminated groundwater can remove as iii by co oxidizing native iron fe ii and as iii with oxygen o2 however the as iii removal efficiency of conventional aeration can be low in part because of incomplete as iii oxidation to readily sorbed arsenate as v in this work we investigated a new approach to enhance as iii co removal with native fe ii by the anaerobic addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 prior to aeration experiments were performed to co oxidize fe ii and as iii with h2o2 anaerobically o2 aerobically and by sequentially adding of h2o2 and o2 aqueous as iii and as v measurements after the reaction were coupled with solid phase speciation by fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas we found that complete anaerobic oxidation of 100 µm fe ii with 100 µm h2o2 resulted in co removal of 95 of 7 µm as iii compared to 44 with 8 0 9 0 mg l dissolved o2 furthermore we found that with 100 µm fe ii the initial fe ii h2o2 ratio was a critical parameter to remove 7 µm as iii to below the 10 µg l 0 13 µm who guideline where ratios of 1 4 mol mol fe ii h2o2 led to as iii removal matching that of 7 µm as v the improved as iii removal with h2o2 was found to occur partly because of the well established enhanced efficiency of as iii oxidation in fe ii h2o2 systems relatively to fe ii o2 systems however the xas results unambiguously demonstrated that a large factor in the improved as iii removal was also due to a systematic decrease in crystallinity and thus increase in specific surface area of the generated fe iii oxyhydr oxides from lepidocrocite in the fe ii o2 system to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates in the fe ii h2o2 system the combined roles of h2o2 enhanced as iii oxidation and structural modification can be easily overlooked when only aqueous species are measured but this dual impact must be considered for accurate predictions of as removal in groundwater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic iron hydrogen peroxide groundwater drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estimated 94 220 million people are exposed to naturally occurring arsenic as in groundwater mainly as arsenite as iii at levels above the world health organization who drinking water guideline of 10 µg l 0 13 µm podgorski and berg 2020 exposure to as contaminated water can pose major threats to human health causing diseases such as skin bladder and lung cancers reproductive disorders and neuro developmental problems in children kapaj et al 2006 tseng 1977 therefore it is crucial that groundwater contaminated with toxic levels of as be treated prior to drinking conventional aeration filtration is a common treatment method that involves aerating anaerobic as iii rich groundwater that contains co occurring iron fe ii followed by filtration of the generated solids gude et al 2016 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 this method relies on as iii and fe ii co oxidation by o2 to form particulate fe iii oxyhydr oxides or fe solids that can bind as bora et al 2016 gude et al 2016 compared to other techniques aeration filtration is advantageous as it is economically attractive no dosing of chemicals is required it removes various groundwater contaminants fe ii ammonium manganese simultaneously and it generates biologically stable drinking water low in nutrients thereby ensuring microbial safety in distribution networks annaduzzaman et al 2021a gude et al 2017 while conventional aeration filtration is applied widely in groundwater treatment and fe solids are very good adsorbents for as this conventional approach can be ineffective for as iii removal which often demands additional dosing of fe to meet drinking water guidelines annaduzzaman et al 2018 annaduzzaman et al 2021b sharma et al 2016 for example previous studies have shown that co removal of as iii with fe ii through aeration filtration only yields between 8 50 removal depending on the initial as concentration as fe ratio and the presence of other competing ions i e manganese phosphate van genuchten and ahmad 2020 holm and wilson 2006 li et al 2016 the low efficacy of as iii co removal with native fe ii during aeration filtration can be due to several factors first fe solids generated by aeration by o2 can be moderately crystalline ahmad et al 2019 with a lower reactive specific surface area than the poorly ordered fe solids generated with stronger oxidants such as hocl and kmno4 ahmad et al 2019 second fe solids have orders of magnitude lower sorption affinity for as iii than oxidized arsenate as v and as iii oxidation during aeration is slow and partial bissen and frimmel 2003 gude et al 2017 roberts et al 2004 third the relatively high ph resulting from co2 g degassing during groundwater aeration creates a less favourable environment for as v adsorption annaduzzaman et al 2021b dixit and hering 2003 which can be minimized by avoiding aeration thus the co removal of groundwater as iii with native fe ii can be optimized by forming poorly ordered solids with high reactive surface area and by co oxidizing as iii effectively and rapidly prior to aeration to minimize ph increase induced by co2 g efflux the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an attractive option for anaerobic as iii and fe ii co oxidation because h2o2 reacts rapidly with fe ii and is relatively inexpensive to generate on or off site and is considered a green alternative to harsher chemical oxidants because of its non toxic reaction products bandaru et al 2020 pham et al 2012a 2012b additionally h2o2 is an intermediate formed during fe ii oxidation by o2 hug and leupin 2003 and may as such be considered a natural additive in anaerobic groundwater treatment in principle the presence of h2o2 in as iii and fe ii rich solutions is beneficial because it oxidizes fe ii at a rate four orders of magnitude higher than o2 bandaru et al 2020 king and farlow 2000 king 1998 which can result in the generation of poorly ordered fe iii solids bandaru et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 in addition while direct as iii oxidation by h2o2 is kinetically limited the oxidation of fe ii by h2o2 leads to a high stoichiometric yield of reactive oxygen species ros such as oh or fe iv that can effectively oxidize as iii hug and leupin 2003 the theoretical ros yield per mol of oxidized fe ii is 1 1 for h2o2 compared to 1 3 for o2 hug and leupin 2003 which would translate to more as iii co oxidation per mole of oxidized fe ii if h2o2 is applied while fenton type systems i e those containing fe ii h2o2 have been investigated in the context of as iii removal previously bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 most studies performed are over dosing h2o2 in solutions open to the atmosphere initially containing o2 careful control of the h2o2 input and thus the fe ii h2o2 ratio could thus be more effective particularly in the case of treating anaerobic groundwater because it can optimize the use of natural fe ii minimize the consumption of h2o2 and can avoid an increase in ph due to co2 g efflux in this study a novel approach is therefore proposed to enhance as iii removal in groundwater with the native fe ii through anaerobic oxidation of the native fe ii by h2o2 prior to aeration moreover we compared the impact of oxidizing fe ii with o2 aerobically h2o2 anaerobically and sequentially with h2o2 anaerobically followed by o2 aerobically on as iii removal the reactions were tracked by aqueous as iii and as v speciation measurements and by characterization of the solid reaction products by synchrotron based fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas in addition we examined the impact of under and over dosage of h2o2 anaerobically on the extent of fe ii and as iii co oxidation finally we validated this approach by studying h2o2 addition to fe ii containing raw anaerobic groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare all experimental solutions and was spiked with to 2 5 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl by dissolving 0 32 g of sodium bicarbonate j t bakertm and 0 88 g of sodium chloride j t bakertm in 1 5 l the concentration of nahco3 2 5 mm and nacl 10 mm were selected to achieve an alkalinity and conductivity 990 µs cm similar to previous studies in synthetic groundwater ahmad et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2012 as iii as v and fe ii were added from stock solutions which were freshly prepared daily stock solutions were generated by dissolving defined amounts of sodium meta arsenite naaso2 or sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to ultrapure water and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to 1 mm hcl respectively h2o2 stock solutions were also freshly diluted with defined volumes of the 30 w w h2o2 solution sigma aldrich in ultrapure water for ph adjustment 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh merck millipore was used 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 3 c in 2 l glass jars with perforated lids fig s1 the jars initially contained 1 l of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm with 2 5 mm nahco3 10 mm nacl and 7 µm as iii or as v the solution was then purged with n2 g to obtain dissolved o2 concentrations of 0 1 mg l and the ph was set to 7 3 7 5 next fe ii was added to the o2 purged solution the oxidation of fe ii was initiated by dosing h2o2 or o2 alone or by sequentially dosing h2o2 followed by o2 h2o2 o2 to dose o2 an air pump was used to raise the dissolved o2 to 8 0 9 0 mg l from initial levels of 0 1 mg l after adding fe ii the solution was mixed with a magnetic stirrer labinco l23 at 150 rpm for 30 min after fe ii oxidation began in h2o2 experiments n2 g was continuously purged throughout the mixing period to minimize the impact of atmospheric o2 influx and to maintain dissolved o2 levels 0 1 mg l for the sequential h2o2 o2 experiments partial fe ii oxidation was performed first by adding h2o2 and mixing for 5 min under continuous n2 g purging dissolved o2 0 1 mg l followed by o2 dosing using the air pump dissolved o2 8 0 9 0 mg l for the remaining 25 min the ph of all solutions was maintained between 7 3 7 5 during experiments by manual additions of 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the ph and dissolved o2 were monitored using a multimeter wtwtm multilinetm multi 3630 ids 2 3 experimental conditions to determine the impact of various fe ii oxidant conditions on as iii co removal experiments were performed in the h2o2 o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems by completely oxidizing 100 µm fe ii with 100 µm h2o2 anaerobically 8 0 9 0 mg l o2 aerobically or sequentially by 5 10 20 or 40 µm h2o2 anaerobically followed by o2 aerobically another set of experiments was performed to examine the effect of h2o2 concentration and thus fe ii h2o2 ratio on the co oxidation and removal of 100 µm fe ii and 7 µm as iii for these experiments the h2o2 concentrations i e 10 20 40 60 100 200 300 and 400 µm were selected to span the stoichiometric amount required for total fe ii oxidation a set of experiments was also repeated with initial 7 µm as v in place of as iii in addition to laboratory tests experiments were performed using raw dutch groundwater which was obtained directly from the influent of a drinking water treatment plant for these experiments the raw anaerobic water initial composition given in table s1 was spiked with 7 µm as iii the removal of as iii was investigated by completely oxidizing the groundwater native fe ii with either h2o2 or o2 in the h2o2 experiments with raw groundwater n2 g was not used to decrease the dissolved o2 to 0 1 mg l all experiments were replicated at least twice a schematic overview of the experimental conditions is shown in fig s1 2 4 chemical analysis during the 30 min reaction time filtered and unfiltered water samples were collected at 0 2 5 10 20 and 30 min filtration was performed with 0 2 µm polyethersulfone filters macherey nagel gmbh co kg immediately after collection the samples were acidified with 1 v v ultrapure nitric acid rotipuran ultra 69 to stop further reactions and dissolve any solids acidified samples were stored at 4 c until analysis we refer to fe measured in the filtered solution as fe ii which we verified by measuring fe ii in a subset of filtered samples using an fe cell test kit merck millipore for dissolved as speciation we followed the approach described in gude et al 2018 which is based on using an anionic exchange resin amberlite ira 402 chlorite to separate non ionic as iii and negatively charged as v the unfiltered samples were used to determine the total fe and fe iii concentration where the difference between total fe and dissolved fe represented the fe iii the samples were analyzed for as and fe in triplicates by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analytikal jena model plasmaquant ms 2 5 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 5 1 data collection solids for xas analysis were collected using filter papers at the end of the oxidation experiments the filter papers with solids attached were stored at 80 c before affixing the sample filter and solids to custom sample holders using kapton tape fe and as k edge xas data were collected at beam line 2 2 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa fe k edge xas data were recorded at room temperature out to k 13 å 1 and as k edge xas data were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures 80 k in fluorescence mode out to k 14 å 1 for beam calibration the maximum of the first derivative of fe 0 and au 0 foils was set to 7112 ev and 11919 ev for fe and as data respectively spectral alignment averaging and background subtraction of individual spectra were performed using sixpack software webb 2005 following standard procedures described in van genuchten et al 2012 extraction of the fe k edge exafs spectra was performed using k3 weighting and the fe k edge exafs spectra were fourier transformed over the k range 2 to 11 å 1 using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 2 5 2 data analysis the fe k edge exafs spectra were analysed by liner combination fits lcfs k 2 11 å 1 with the sixpack software webb 2005 using the exafs spectra of three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides moderately crystalline lepidocrocite lp nanocrystalline 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh and highly disordered oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide oxy hfo these three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides were selected based on previous studies that report these references reproduced the fe iii solids generated by fe ii oxidation using a range of chemical oxidants ahmad et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2014 the fraction of the three references in each experimental sample derived from the lcfs was normalized to one the as k edge xanes spectra were analyzed by lcfs using sixpack software to determine the fraction of adsorbed as iii and as v the lcfs were performed with a fit range of 11860 to 11880 ev using reference spectra of as iii and as v adsorbed to 2 line ferrihydrite in the lcfs negative fractions of the reference spectra were not allowed and the component sum was not constrained to 1 the concentration of adsorbed as iii and as v was calculated by multiplying the lcf derived fraction of as iii and as v by the concentration of total as removed from solution determined by icp ms we use the as k edge xas data primarily to determine the oxidation state of as bound to the solid phase shell by shell fits of the exafs spectra were not performed partly because many of our samples contained multiple as oxidation states which complicates the interpretation of shell fits van genuchten et al 2012 van genuchten and ahmad 2020 further details on xas sample preparation and data collection are given in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid phase fe structure and its relation to fe ii oxidation kinetics fig 1 a and b shows the fe k edge exafs spectra and corresponding fourier transforms of the three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the experimental samples generated in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems comparing the exafs spectral features of lp 2lfh and oxy hfo a peak can be observed in lp near 7 84 å 1 which dampened in 2lfh and disappeared in oxy hfo in addition the first oscillation from 4 5 å 1 is asymmetric in lp but becomes more symmetric for 2lfh and oxy hfo with the oscillations at k 8 å 1 becoming more broad with lower amplitude from lp to 2lfh to oxy hfo these features are consistent with a progressive decrease in structural order from lp to 2lfh to oxy hfo toner et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2012 visual comparison of the exafs spectra of the experimental solids indicates that the exafs spectrum of the sample generated by o2 oxidation closely matched the line shape and phase of the lp exafs spectrum however a gradual and systematic shift in exafs features from lp to 2lfh and oxy hfo was observed with an increasing concentration of initial h2o2 and thus increasing fraction of fe ii oxidized by h2o2 as shown in the fourier transform fig 1 b these changes in the exafs spectra of the samples correspond to a systematic decrease in the amplitude of second shell peak which arises from fe fe atomic pairs suggesting a progressive decrease in structural order with increasing h2o2 concentration toner et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2012 we assign the second shell peak with fe fe atomic pairs because no other atoms can be present in the second shell of fe at high enough concentrations to contribute significantly to this peak i e as can occur in the second shell but its concentration in the solid phase is too low to be detected in the fe data the lcfs of the exafs spectra fig 1 c table s2 confirmed the decrease in fe iii precipitate crystallinity with increasing initial h2o2 concentration the lcfs indicated that the highest fraction of moderately crystalline lp was present in the sample generated by o2 oxidation of fe ii the fraction of lp in the solids derived by lcfs decreased systematically in favor of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates 2lfh and oxy hfo with increasing fe ii oxidation by h2o2 lp was not detected in the experiments where 100 of fe ii was oxidized by h2o2 instead the solids generated by fe ii oxidation with h2o2 consisted of 100 poorly ordered fe iii precipitates fig 1 c table s2 such formation of a higher fraction of poorly ordered fe solids with h2o2 compared to o2 is consistent with the previously reported impact of fe ii oxidation rate on fe iii precipitate structure ahmad et al 2019 bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 the low oxidation rate of fe ii with o2 allows the presence of aqueous fe ii to catalyze the crystallization of freshly precipitated fe iii precursors into lp ahmad et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 by contrast h2o2 oxidizes aqueous fe ii too rapidly to permit any fe ii catalyzed crystallization of newly formed fe iii precipitates ahmad et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 to verify rapid fe ii oxidation with h2o2 the kinetics of fe iii generation was tested over 30 min for the same oxidation conditions fig 1 d as used to generate the solids for xas analysis i e oxidation of 100µm fe ii in the o2 h2o2 and h2o2 o2 systems it was observed that all the fe ii was oxidized within 10 min regardless of the oxidant fig 1 d however with 100 µm h2o2 complete fe ii oxidation was faster 2 min than with o2 between 5 10 min which is in line with previous research bandaru et al 2020 king and farlow 2000 king 1998 in the sequential experiments with initial 5 10 20 or 40 µm h2o2 fe ii oxidation was fast but incomplete with the expected stoichiometric 2 1 mol mol ratio of fe ii oxidation by h2o2 observed for all h2o2 experiments this 2 1 stoichiometry led to residual fe ii concentrations of 85 76 64 and 17 µm at 5 min using h2o2 dosages of 5 10 20 and 40 µm respectively with the remaining fe ii oxidized by o2 added by aeration at t 5 min these results show that anaerobic fe ii oxidation with h2o2 closely followed the expected 2 1 ratio and favoured the formation of poorly ordered fe iii solids in contrast to o2 due to its more rapid oxidation rate with fe ii 3 2 as iii removal by fe solids fig 2 a shows the co removal of initial 7 0 5 µm as iii when oxidizing 100 3 µm fe ii in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems comparing the different oxidant conditions as iii removal was the lowest in the o2 system where the residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min was 3 8 0 2 µm 44 removal in the sequential h2o2 o2 system as iii removal was moderate and the residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min decreased systematically 3 6 0 2 2 9 0 4 2 6 0 1 and 1 3 0 10 µm with increasing initial h2o2 concentration 5 10 20 and 40 µm h2o2 the most removal of initial as iii was observed using 100 µm h2o2 with a residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min of 0 4 0 1 µm 95 removal thus the poorest as removal was observed when fe ii was oxidized by o2 alone and removal increased with an increase in the fraction of fe ii oxidized by h2o2 this trend is consistent with the increasing fraction of poorly ordered fe solids with increasing initial h2o2 concentration fig 1 c as observed in the previous section fig 2 b shows the as k edge xanes spectra of samples generated in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems with the lcfs of the xanes spectra reported in table s3 the xanes spectra show that as v was the dominant species adsorbed on the solids based on the position of the absorption maximum near 11875 ev the predominance of solid phase as v was confirmed by the xanes lcfs table s3 this suggests effective sorption of as v generated via as iii oxidation by ros formed during fe ii reactions with both o2 or h2o2 since direct oxidation of as iii by o2 or h2o2 in the experimental time frame 30 min was not feasible hug and leupin 2003 combining the aqueous as iii removal results with the measurements of as oxidation state on the solids with xanes lcfs and in solution with anionic exchange resins yields the speciation plot given in fig 2 c this plot reveals that while overall aqueous as iii removal increased with increasing initial h2o2 concentration the majority of as bound to the solids was always as v and the majority of residual aqueous as was as iii for all oxidant conditions for example in the o2 system as v accounted for 2 2 µm of the total adsorbed as content of 3 0 µm 72 whereas 80 of the 3 8 µm residual as was as iii similarly in the h2o2 system as v was 100 of the adsorbed as and as iii accounted for 72 of the 0 4 µm residual as these trends were reproduced in the sequential h2o2 o2 system fig 2 c and are consistent with the orders of magnitude higher sorption affinity of as v than as iii roberts et al 2004 although the fraction of as v and as iii bound to the solids was similar among many of the samples the total amount of oxidized as iii increased with increasing h2o2 concentration i e total as v increased from 2 9 µm in the o2 system to 6 µm in the h2o2 system the increase in as iii oxidation with h2o2 concentration is consistent with more effective ros generation when fe ii is oxidized by h2o2 compared to o2 hug and leupin 2003 which is attributed to the 1 1 stoichiometric yield of ros when fe ii reacts with h2o2 compared to the 1 3 yield of ros when fe ii reacts with o2 combining the as speciation plots in fig 2 c and the solid phase fe speciation plots in fig 1 c uncovers a key finding about the anaerobic co oxidation of as iii and fe ii by h2o2 comparing the overall as removal between the o2 experiment and the sequential 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment showed a decrease in the residual as concentration from 3 8 µm to 1 3 µm a difference of 2 5 µm as when 40 µm h2o2 was applied whereas for the same samples the total amount of oxidized as iii was 2 9 µm for the o2 experiment and 4 8 µm for the sequential 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment a difference of only 1 9 µm as the higher overall as removal efficacy for the 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment cannot be attributed to an increase in as iii oxidation alone therefore the results indicate that the higher reactive surface area of the poorly ordered solids generated by fe ii oxidation with h2o2 played a critical role in improving overall as removal efficacy 3 3 under and over dosage of h2o2 experiments were performed to identify any benefit from dosing h2o2 below or above the stoichiometric amount required to anaerobically oxidize 100 3 µm fe ii fig 3 a shows the concentration of oxidized fe ii and the corresponding removal of the initial 7 0 2 µm as iii as a function of different h2o2 dosages 10 400 µm at t 30 min as the h2o2 concentration increased the concentration of oxidized fe ii also increased up to the complete oxidation of fe ii at h2o2 concentrations above 60 µm for h2o2 dosages below 60 µm i e under dosage 10 40 µm only partial oxidation of 100 3 µm fe ii was observed 20 80 oxidation however the ratio of generated fe iii to dosed h2o2 remained around 2 1 mol mol for all conditions fig 3 a indicating that the 2 1 stoichiometry of fe ii oxidation by h2o2 was maintained the results from the sequential h2o2 o2 experiments were consistent with the findings mentioned above increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 40 µm which is below the required amount for 100 fe ii oxidation resulted in improved as removal due to the formation of more fe iii precipitates section 3 1 and 3 2 for instance with 10 µm h2o2 the residual as concentration t 30 min was 4 8 0 2 µm 31 removal which decreased to 1 7 0 1 µm 76 removal with 40 µm h2o2 fig 3 a however we also observed that increasing the h2o2 concentration above the amount required to completely oxidize 100 3 µm fe ii i e over dosage also improved as iii removal for example when the h2o2 dosage increased from 60 to 400 µm i e over dosage the dissolved as concentration at t 30 min decreased from 0 6 0 1 92 removal to 0 1 0 1 µm 98 5 removal which resulted in as levels below the who recommended limit 0 13 µm fig 3 a this increase in as removal can be explained by the oxidation of as iii to as v via ros formed by decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of fe iii precipitates lin and gurol 1998 with subsequent sorption of as v finally we noted that the removal of the initial 7 0 2 µm as iii with 400 µm h2o2 98 5 removal was almost equal to the removal of the initial 7 0 5 µm as v 99 3 removal at 60 µm h2o2 when a similar fe dosage of 100 3 µm was used fig 3 b this result highlights the advantage of using h2o2 because previous fe ii based as removal studies with only o2 dosing have always reported higher removals of initial as v compared to as iii kumar et al 2004 roberts et al 2004 roy et al 2020 wan et al 2011 3 4 application to raw anaerobic groundwater to validate that enhanced as iii co removal can be achieved by adding h2o2 to groundwater containing native fe ii experiments were performed with raw anaerobic groundwater rich in fe ii co occurring as iii and other native dissolved species such as phosphorous total p and manganese mn fig 4 shows the removal of initial as iii mn and total p from raw anaerobic groundwater with fe iii generation over 30 min consistent with the laboratory experiments sections 3 1 and 3 2 all groundwater native fe ii was oxidized with h2o2 and rapidly formed precipitates within 2 min whereas o2 oxidation of fe ii required the full 30 min of the experiment during the h2o2 dosing experiment as iii was also quickly removed with 97 6 as iii removal measured in 2 min when the native fe ii in groundwater was oxidized by o2 as iii removal continued over the full 30 min reaction duration and at the end of the experiment 1 3 0 1 µm residual as 81 removal remained in solution while our experiments with natural groundwater were consistent with the laboratory experiments i e h2o2 addition outperformed aeration some key differences were observed first compared to the laboratory experiments raw groundwater samples showed a better removal of as iii for both h2o2 and o2 oxidation second the difference between as iii removal using h2o2 or o2 was smaller for the raw groundwater experiments the less distinct as removal of h2o2 and o2 oxidants applied to natural groundwater could be attributed to the four times higher fe ii concentration in natural groundwater than in the laboratory experiments which suggests that optimal conditions for enhancing as removal by h2o2 addition occur at lower initial fe ii levels additionally the optimal removal of as iii with h2o2 in groundwater containing low levels of native fe ii can also be impacted by the presence of other native species that can compete for adsorption sites and ros for example phosphorous in groundwater is present mainly as phosphate po4 3 and studies have shown its competition with as v for adsorption sites on fe solids roberts et al 2004 as observed in fig 4 along with the removal of as iii total p removal was also observed for both h2o2 and o2 experiments but the removal of total p was different for the different oxidants in the o2 experiment the rate and amount of total p removal was higher than as iii whereas the h2o2 experiment did not display a substantial difference between as iii and total p removal this result can be explained by the availability of sufficient sorption sites for both as and p on the fe solids owing to the formation of poorly ordered solids during h2o2 oxidation the high fe ii concentration 424 12 µm and to the enhanced oxidation of as iii using h2o2 however in situations where native fe ii is low a possible lower co removal of as iii could be expected due to competition with po4 3 for adsorption sites apart from po4 3 groundwater can also contain dissolved mn which might impact as iii co removal with native fe ii for instance previous studies have reported that mn in groundwater which is present as mn ii can compete with as iii for ros yielding oxidized mn iii that partially incorporates into the co precipitating fe iii solids ahmad et al 2019 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 however as shown in fig 4 mn removal was relatively low for both h2o2 19 removal and o2 13 removal suggesting that mn iii formation was not substantial however since identifying the solid phase speciation of mn was beyond the scope of this study it is not clear whether there was any competition between mn ii and as iii for the generated ros 3 5 implications for groundwater treatment we observed improved as iii removal when co existing fe ii was oxidized by h2o2 rather than o2 the ratio of as iii removed to fe iii generated increased from 0 03 to 0 06 mol mol when 100 µm fe ii was completely oxidized with either 8 0 9 0 mg l o2 or 100 µm h2o2 respectively indicating substantially less fe is required for equivalent as removal with h2o2 the application of such fenton type systems i e fe ii h2o2 to improve as iii removal from water has been reported previously for example krishna et al 2001 showed that initial treatment of 2 mg l as iii with 100 mg l fe ii and 100 µl l of 30 h2o2 followed by passing through zero valent iron columns and a sand bed achieved as removal to 10 µg l who guideline in addition wang et al 2013 observed that oxidizing 20 µm fe ii with 50 µm h2o2 at ph 7 0 resulted in 70 oxidation of 20 µm as iii compared to just 2 5 while oxidizing the fe ii with o2 while these studies are useful they interpret their results primarily by improved as iii co oxidation by ros and did not focus on the influence of fe iii precipitate structure in this study we also observed that the improved as iii co removal by h2o2 is partly attributed to the well established enhanced efficiency of as iii oxidation in fe ii h2o2 systems due to higher stoichiometric yield of ros compared to fe ii o2 systems bandaru et al 2020 hug and leupin 2003 however our results explicitly showed that the fe iii precipitate structure played a major role in improving as iii removal the fe k edge exafs analysis performed in this study indicated a systematic decrease in precipitate crystallinity i e increase in reactive specific surface area from moderately crystalline lp in the o2 system to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with h2o2 fig 1 c this impact of fe iii precipitate structure is often overlooked in fe based as removal techniques but we show that the type of fe iii precipitates must be considered to accurately predict as removal in groundwater treatment our results also indicated that oxidizing the groundwater native fe ii anaerobically with h2o2 prior to aeration filtration can be used to leverage the full potential of native fe ii for as iii treatment depending on the initial as fe and fe h2o2 ratios this novel approach can remove as iii to below drinking water standards achieving a high as iii removal which is often difficult with conventional aeration filtration the optimal use of native fe ii via h2o2 oxidation can help to avoid the need for additional fe dosage as fecl3 in situations where oxidizing native fe ii by aeration is not sufficient to meet as drinking water limits this reduction of fe dosage will also lower the volume of generated fe sludge and thus lower the frequency of filter backwashing additionally anaerobic oxidation of fe ii with h2o2 prior to aeration will not result in the same increase in groundwater ph as is observed during aeration due to degassing of co2 g as long as fe ii is oxidized maintaining a low ph is advantageous because as v adsorption to fe solids decreases with increasing ph annaduzzaman et al 2021b dixit and hering 2003 usage of other strong oxidants such as kmno4 or naocl during aeration filtration has been reported previously effectively oxidizing as iii and also generating poorly ordered fe solids van genuchten and ahmad 2020 however compared to those oxidants h2o2 is considered a green oxidant because its by products namely h2o and o2 are benign goyal et al 2020 pham et al 2012b zhao et al 2019 recent studies have also shown that h2o2 can be electrochemically generated in situ bandaru et al 2020 which eliminates the necessity to maintain chemical stocks of h2o2 on site thus decreasing the supply chain for operating groundwater treatment plants the results in this work suggest that oxidizing groundwater native fe ii with h2o2 anaerobically prior to aeration filtration can be a novel approach to optimize the co removal of toxic as iii however our study did not take into account potentially different environmental scenarios that can impact as iii removal for example the laboratory experiments were performed in controlled conditions with a fixed fe ii as iii ratio and ph and without the presence of other competing ions while a set of experiments with raw anaerobic groundwater was performed the advantage of oxidizing native fe ii with h2o2 over o2 for as iii co removal diminished most likely due to the high concentration of native fe ii in the experiments with real groundwater although 1 mol of h2o2 is sufficient to oxidize 2 mol of fe ii an excess h2o2 was dosed to minimize the impact of any atmospheric o2 influx and to ensure complete oxidation of the native fe ii by h2o2 in absence of n2 g dosage as in laboratory experiments while our laboratory investigations and tests in real groundwater highlight the potential benefits of h2o2 dosing it is recommended to perform further studies with real anaerobic groundwater under various environmental conditions with optimization of the h2o2 dosage to further validate the novelty of the proposed approach overall the advantage of anaerobic h2o2 oxidation of native fe ii for as iii removal is that it can be easily implemented in conventional or decentralized systems to treat as contaminated groundwater without major changes in infrastructure and without substantial increases in treatment costs conclusions in this study we showed a novel approach where the co removal of groundwater as iii with native fe ii can be enhanced by oxidizing the fe ii anaerobically with h2o2 prior to aeration filtration rather than conventionally by aeration or o2 under aerobic conditions the enhanced as iii co removal with h2o2 was partly due to generation of a larger fraction of poorly ordered fe iii solids with a higher reactive specific surface area compared to moderately crystalline fe iii solids generated by o2 as well as the generation of more ros per mole of fe ii when dosing h2o2 1 1 compared to o2 1 3 thus favouring as iii oxidation to readily adsorbed as v hence we propose the application of h2o2 a green oxidant for anaerobic fe ii and as iii co oxidation in groundwater treatment prior to aeration to optimize native fe ii usage

15597,groundwater contaminated with arsenic as must be treated prior to drinking as human exposure to as at toxic levels can cause various diseases including cancer conventional aeration filtration applied to anaerobic arsenite as iii contaminated groundwater can remove as iii by co oxidizing native iron fe ii and as iii with oxygen o2 however the as iii removal efficiency of conventional aeration can be low in part because of incomplete as iii oxidation to readily sorbed arsenate as v in this work we investigated a new approach to enhance as iii co removal with native fe ii by the anaerobic addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 prior to aeration experiments were performed to co oxidize fe ii and as iii with h2o2 anaerobically o2 aerobically and by sequentially adding of h2o2 and o2 aqueous as iii and as v measurements after the reaction were coupled with solid phase speciation by fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas we found that complete anaerobic oxidation of 100 µm fe ii with 100 µm h2o2 resulted in co removal of 95 of 7 µm as iii compared to 44 with 8 0 9 0 mg l dissolved o2 furthermore we found that with 100 µm fe ii the initial fe ii h2o2 ratio was a critical parameter to remove 7 µm as iii to below the 10 µg l 0 13 µm who guideline where ratios of 1 4 mol mol fe ii h2o2 led to as iii removal matching that of 7 µm as v the improved as iii removal with h2o2 was found to occur partly because of the well established enhanced efficiency of as iii oxidation in fe ii h2o2 systems relatively to fe ii o2 systems however the xas results unambiguously demonstrated that a large factor in the improved as iii removal was also due to a systematic decrease in crystallinity and thus increase in specific surface area of the generated fe iii oxyhydr oxides from lepidocrocite in the fe ii o2 system to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates in the fe ii h2o2 system the combined roles of h2o2 enhanced as iii oxidation and structural modification can be easily overlooked when only aqueous species are measured but this dual impact must be considered for accurate predictions of as removal in groundwater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic iron hydrogen peroxide groundwater drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an estimated 94 220 million people are exposed to naturally occurring arsenic as in groundwater mainly as arsenite as iii at levels above the world health organization who drinking water guideline of 10 µg l 0 13 µm podgorski and berg 2020 exposure to as contaminated water can pose major threats to human health causing diseases such as skin bladder and lung cancers reproductive disorders and neuro developmental problems in children kapaj et al 2006 tseng 1977 therefore it is crucial that groundwater contaminated with toxic levels of as be treated prior to drinking conventional aeration filtration is a common treatment method that involves aerating anaerobic as iii rich groundwater that contains co occurring iron fe ii followed by filtration of the generated solids gude et al 2016 hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 this method relies on as iii and fe ii co oxidation by o2 to form particulate fe iii oxyhydr oxides or fe solids that can bind as bora et al 2016 gude et al 2016 compared to other techniques aeration filtration is advantageous as it is economically attractive no dosing of chemicals is required it removes various groundwater contaminants fe ii ammonium manganese simultaneously and it generates biologically stable drinking water low in nutrients thereby ensuring microbial safety in distribution networks annaduzzaman et al 2021a gude et al 2017 while conventional aeration filtration is applied widely in groundwater treatment and fe solids are very good adsorbents for as this conventional approach can be ineffective for as iii removal which often demands additional dosing of fe to meet drinking water guidelines annaduzzaman et al 2018 annaduzzaman et al 2021b sharma et al 2016 for example previous studies have shown that co removal of as iii with fe ii through aeration filtration only yields between 8 50 removal depending on the initial as concentration as fe ratio and the presence of other competing ions i e manganese phosphate van genuchten and ahmad 2020 holm and wilson 2006 li et al 2016 the low efficacy of as iii co removal with native fe ii during aeration filtration can be due to several factors first fe solids generated by aeration by o2 can be moderately crystalline ahmad et al 2019 with a lower reactive specific surface area than the poorly ordered fe solids generated with stronger oxidants such as hocl and kmno4 ahmad et al 2019 second fe solids have orders of magnitude lower sorption affinity for as iii than oxidized arsenate as v and as iii oxidation during aeration is slow and partial bissen and frimmel 2003 gude et al 2017 roberts et al 2004 third the relatively high ph resulting from co2 g degassing during groundwater aeration creates a less favourable environment for as v adsorption annaduzzaman et al 2021b dixit and hering 2003 which can be minimized by avoiding aeration thus the co removal of groundwater as iii with native fe ii can be optimized by forming poorly ordered solids with high reactive surface area and by co oxidizing as iii effectively and rapidly prior to aeration to minimize ph increase induced by co2 g efflux the addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is an attractive option for anaerobic as iii and fe ii co oxidation because h2o2 reacts rapidly with fe ii and is relatively inexpensive to generate on or off site and is considered a green alternative to harsher chemical oxidants because of its non toxic reaction products bandaru et al 2020 pham et al 2012a 2012b additionally h2o2 is an intermediate formed during fe ii oxidation by o2 hug and leupin 2003 and may as such be considered a natural additive in anaerobic groundwater treatment in principle the presence of h2o2 in as iii and fe ii rich solutions is beneficial because it oxidizes fe ii at a rate four orders of magnitude higher than o2 bandaru et al 2020 king and farlow 2000 king 1998 which can result in the generation of poorly ordered fe iii solids bandaru et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 in addition while direct as iii oxidation by h2o2 is kinetically limited the oxidation of fe ii by h2o2 leads to a high stoichiometric yield of reactive oxygen species ros such as oh or fe iv that can effectively oxidize as iii hug and leupin 2003 the theoretical ros yield per mol of oxidized fe ii is 1 1 for h2o2 compared to 1 3 for o2 hug and leupin 2003 which would translate to more as iii co oxidation per mole of oxidized fe ii if h2o2 is applied while fenton type systems i e those containing fe ii h2o2 have been investigated in the context of as iii removal previously bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 most studies performed are over dosing h2o2 in solutions open to the atmosphere initially containing o2 careful control of the h2o2 input and thus the fe ii h2o2 ratio could thus be more effective particularly in the case of treating anaerobic groundwater because it can optimize the use of natural fe ii minimize the consumption of h2o2 and can avoid an increase in ph due to co2 g efflux in this study a novel approach is therefore proposed to enhance as iii removal in groundwater with the native fe ii through anaerobic oxidation of the native fe ii by h2o2 prior to aeration moreover we compared the impact of oxidizing fe ii with o2 aerobically h2o2 anaerobically and sequentially with h2o2 anaerobically followed by o2 aerobically on as iii removal the reactions were tracked by aqueous as iii and as v speciation measurements and by characterization of the solid reaction products by synchrotron based fe and as k edge x ray absorption spectroscopy xas in addition we examined the impact of under and over dosage of h2o2 anaerobically on the extent of fe ii and as iii co oxidation finally we validated this approach by studying h2o2 addition to fe ii containing raw anaerobic groundwater 2 materials and methods

88 g of sodium chloride j t bakertm in 1 5 l the concentration of nahco3 2 5 mm and nacl 10 mm were selected to achieve an alkalinity and conductivity 990 µs cm similar to previous studies in synthetic groundwater ahmad et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2012 as iii as v and fe ii were added from stock solutions which were freshly prepared daily stock solutions were generated by dissolving defined amounts of sodium meta arsenite naaso2 or sodium arsenate dibasic heptahydrate na2haso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to ultrapure water and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich to 1 mm hcl respectively h2o2 stock solutions were also freshly diluted with defined volumes of the 30 w w h2o2 solution sigma aldrich in ultrapure water for ph adjustment 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh merck millipore was used 2 2 experimental setup and procedure the experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 3 c in 2 l glass jars with perforated lids fig s1 the jars initially contained 1 l of ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm with 2 5 mm nahco3 10 mm nacl and 7 µm as iii or as v the solution was then purged with n2 g to obtain dissolved o2 concentrations of 0 1 mg l and the ph was set to 7 3 7 5 next fe ii was added to the o2 purged solution the oxidation of fe ii was initiated by dosing h2o2 or o2 alone or by sequentially dosing h2o2 followed by o2 h2o2 o2 to dose o2 an air pump was used to raise the dissolved o2 to 8 0 9 0 mg l from initial levels of 0 1 mg l after adding fe ii the solution was mixed with a magnetic stirrer labinco l23 at 150 rpm for 30 min after fe ii oxidation began in h2o2 experiments n2 g was continuously purged throughout the mixing period to minimize the impact of atmospheric o2 influx and to maintain dissolved o2 levels 0 1 mg l for the sequential h2o2 o2 experiments partial fe ii oxidation was performed first by adding h2o2 and mixing for 5 min under continuous n2 g purging dissolved o2 0 1 mg l followed by o2 dosing using the air pump dissolved o2 8 0 9 0 mg l for the remaining 25 min the ph of all solutions was maintained between 7 3 7 5 during experiments by manual additions of 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl the ph and dissolved o2 were monitored using a multimeter wtwtm multilinetm multi 3630 ids 2 3 experimental conditions to determine the impact of various fe ii oxidant conditions on as iii co removal experiments were performed in the h2o2 o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems by completely oxidizing 100 µm fe ii with 100 µm h2o2 anaerobically 8 0 9 0 mg l o2 aerobically or sequentially by 5 10 20 or 40 µm h2o2 anaerobically followed by o2 aerobically another set of experiments was performed to examine the effect of h2o2 concentration and thus fe ii h2o2 ratio on the co oxidation and removal of 100 µm fe ii and 7 µm as iii for these experiments the h2o2 concentrations i e 10 20 40 60 100 200 300 and 400 µm were selected to span the stoichiometric amount required for total fe ii oxidation a set of experiments was also repeated with initial 7 µm as v in place of as iii in addition to laboratory tests experiments were performed using raw dutch groundwater which was obtained directly from the influent of a drinking water treatment plant for these experiments the raw anaerobic water initial composition given in table s1 was spiked with 7 µm as iii the removal of as iii was investigated by completely oxidizing the groundwater native fe ii with either h2o2 or o2 in the h2o2 experiments with raw groundwater n2 g was not used to decrease the dissolved o2 to 0 1 mg l all experiments were replicated at least twice a schematic overview of the experimental conditions is shown in fig s1 2 4 chemical analysis during the 30 min reaction time filtered and unfiltered water samples were collected at 0 2 5 10 20 and 30 min filtration was performed with 0 2 µm polyethersulfone filters macherey nagel gmbh co kg immediately after collection the samples were acidified with 1 v v ultrapure nitric acid rotipuran ultra 69 to stop further reactions and dissolve any solids acidified samples were stored at 4 c until analysis we refer to fe measured in the filtered solution as fe ii which we verified by measuring fe ii in a subset of filtered samples using an fe cell test kit merck millipore for dissolved as speciation we followed the approach described in gude et al 2018 which is based on using an anionic exchange resin amberlite ira 402 chlorite to separate non ionic as iii and negatively charged as v the unfiltered samples were used to determine the total fe and fe iii concentration where the difference between total fe and dissolved fe represented the fe iii the samples were analyzed for as and fe in triplicates by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms analytikal jena model plasmaquant ms 2 5 x ray absorption spectroscopy 2 5 1 data collection solids for xas analysis were collected using filter papers at the end of the oxidation experiments the filter papers with solids attached were stored at 80 c before affixing the sample filter and solids to custom sample holders using kapton tape fe and as k edge xas data were collected at beam line 2 2 of the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl menlo park usa fe k edge xas data were recorded at room temperature out to k 13 å 1 and as k edge xas data were recorded at liquid nitrogen temperatures 80 k in fluorescence mode out to k 14 å 1 for beam calibration the maximum of the first derivative of fe 0 and au 0 foils was set to 7112 ev and 11919 ev for fe and as data respectively spectral alignment averaging and background subtraction of individual spectra were performed using sixpack software webb 2005 following standard procedures described in van genuchten et al 2012 extraction of the fe k edge exafs spectra was performed using k3 weighting and the fe k edge exafs spectra were fourier transformed over the k range 2 to 11 å 1 using a kaiser bessel window with dk of 3 å 1 2 5 2 data analysis the fe k edge exafs spectra were analysed by liner combination fits lcfs k 2 11 å 1 with the sixpack software webb 2005 using the exafs spectra of three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides moderately crystalline lepidocrocite lp nanocrystalline 2 line ferrihydrite 2lfh and highly disordered oxyanion rich hydrous ferric oxide oxy hfo these three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides were selected based on previous studies that report these references reproduced the fe iii solids generated by fe ii oxidation using a range of chemical oxidants ahmad et al 2019 van genuchten et al 2018 van genuchten et al 2014 the fraction of the three references in each experimental sample derived from the lcfs was normalized to one the as k edge xanes spectra were analyzed by lcfs using sixpack software to determine the fraction of adsorbed as iii and as v the lcfs were performed with a fit range of 11860 to 11880 ev using reference spectra of as iii and as v adsorbed to 2 line ferrihydrite in the lcfs negative fractions of the reference spectra were not allowed and the component sum was not constrained to 1 the concentration of adsorbed as iii and as v was calculated by multiplying the lcf derived fraction of as iii and as v by the concentration of total as removed from solution determined by icp ms we use the as k edge xas data primarily to determine the oxidation state of as bound to the solid phase shell by shell fits of the exafs spectra were not performed partly because many of our samples contained multiple as oxidation states which complicates the interpretation of shell fits van genuchten et al 2012 van genuchten and ahmad 2020 further details on xas sample preparation and data collection are given in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 solid phase fe structure and its relation to fe ii oxidation kinetics fig 1 a and b shows the fe k edge exafs spectra and corresponding fourier transforms of the three reference fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the experimental samples generated in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems comparing the exafs spectral features of lp 2lfh and oxy hfo a peak can be observed in lp near 7 84 å 1 which dampened in 2lfh and disappeared in oxy hfo in addition the first oscillation from 4 5 å 1 is asymmetric in lp but becomes more symmetric for 2lfh and oxy hfo with the oscillations at k 8 å 1 becoming more broad with lower amplitude from lp to 2lfh to oxy hfo these features are consistent with a progressive decrease in structural order from lp to 2lfh to oxy hfo toner et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2012 visual comparison of the exafs spectra of the experimental solids indicates that the exafs spectrum of the sample generated by o2 oxidation closely matched the line shape and phase of the lp exafs spectrum however a gradual and systematic shift in exafs features from lp to 2lfh and oxy hfo was observed with an increasing concentration of initial h2o2 and thus increasing fraction of fe ii oxidized by h2o2 as shown in the fourier transform fig 1 b these changes in the exafs spectra of the samples correspond to a systematic decrease in the amplitude of second shell peak which arises from fe fe atomic pairs suggesting a progressive decrease in structural order with increasing h2o2 concentration toner et al 2009 van genuchten et al 2012 we assign the second shell peak with fe fe atomic pairs because no other atoms can be present in the second shell of fe at high enough concentrations to contribute significantly to this peak i e as can occur in the second shell but its concentration in the solid phase is too low to be detected in the fe data the lcfs of the exafs spectra fig 1 c table s2 confirmed the decrease in fe iii precipitate crystallinity with increasing initial h2o2 concentration the lcfs indicated that the highest fraction of moderately crystalline lp was present in the sample generated by o2 oxidation of fe ii the fraction of lp in the solids derived by lcfs decreased systematically in favor of poorly ordered fe iii precipitates 2lfh and oxy hfo with increasing fe ii oxidation by h2o2 lp was not detected in the experiments where 100 of fe ii was oxidized by h2o2 instead the solids generated by fe ii oxidation with h2o2 consisted of 100 poorly ordered fe iii precipitates fig 1 c table s2 such formation of a higher fraction of poorly ordered fe solids with h2o2 compared to o2 is consistent with the previously reported impact of fe ii oxidation rate on fe iii precipitate structure ahmad et al 2019 bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 the low oxidation rate of fe ii with o2 allows the presence of aqueous fe ii to catalyze the crystallization of freshly precipitated fe iii precursors into lp ahmad et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 by contrast h2o2 oxidizes aqueous fe ii too rapidly to permit any fe ii catalyzed crystallization of newly formed fe iii precipitates ahmad et al 2019 pedersen et al 2005 to verify rapid fe ii oxidation with h2o2 the kinetics of fe iii generation was tested over 30 min for the same oxidation conditions fig 1 d as used to generate the solids for xas analysis i e oxidation of 100µm fe ii in the o2 h2o2 and h2o2 o2 systems it was observed that all the fe ii was oxidized within 10 min regardless of the oxidant fig 1 d however with 100 µm h2o2 complete fe ii oxidation was faster 2 min than with o2 between 5 10 min which is in line with previous research bandaru et al 2020 king and farlow 2000 king 1998 in the sequential experiments with initial 5 10 20 or 40 µm h2o2 fe ii oxidation was fast but incomplete with the expected stoichiometric 2 1 mol mol ratio of fe ii oxidation by h2o2 observed for all h2o2 experiments this 2 1 stoichiometry led to residual fe ii concentrations of 85 76 64 and 17 µm at 5 min using h2o2 dosages of 5 10 20 and 40 µm respectively with the remaining fe ii oxidized by o2 added by aeration at t 5 min these results show that anaerobic fe ii oxidation with h2o2 closely followed the expected 2 1 ratio and favoured the formation of poorly ordered fe iii solids in contrast to o2 due to its more rapid oxidation rate with fe ii 3 2 as iii removal by fe solids fig 2 a shows the co removal of initial 7 0 5 µm as iii when oxidizing 100 3 µm fe ii in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems comparing the different oxidant conditions as iii removal was the lowest in the o2 system where the residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min was 3 8 0 2 µm 44 removal in the sequential h2o2 o2 system as iii removal was moderate and the residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min decreased systematically 3 6 0 2 2 9 0 4 2 6 0 1 and 1 3 0 10 µm with increasing initial h2o2 concentration 5 10 20 and 40 µm h2o2 the most removal of initial as iii was observed using 100 µm h2o2 with a residual dissolved as concentration t 30 min of 0 4 0 1 µm 95 removal thus the poorest as removal was observed when fe ii was oxidized by o2 alone and removal increased with an increase in the fraction of fe ii oxidized by h2o2 this trend is consistent with the increasing fraction of poorly ordered fe solids with increasing initial h2o2 concentration fig 1 c as observed in the previous section fig 2 b shows the as k edge xanes spectra of samples generated in the o2 h2o2 and sequential h2o2 o2 systems with the lcfs of the xanes spectra reported in table s3 the xanes spectra show that as v was the dominant species adsorbed on the solids based on the position of the absorption maximum near 11875 ev the predominance of solid phase as v was confirmed by the xanes lcfs table s3 this suggests effective sorption of as v generated via as iii oxidation by ros formed during fe ii reactions with both o2 or h2o2 since direct oxidation of as iii by o2 or h2o2 in the experimental time frame 30 min was not feasible hug and leupin 2003 combining the aqueous as iii removal results with the measurements of as oxidation state on the solids with xanes lcfs and in solution with anionic exchange resins yields the speciation plot given in fig 2 c this plot reveals that while overall aqueous as iii removal increased with increasing initial h2o2 concentration the majority of as bound to the solids was always as v and the majority of residual aqueous as was as iii for all oxidant conditions for example in the o2 system as v accounted for 2 2 µm of the total adsorbed as content of 3 0 µm 72 whereas 80 of the 3 8 µm residual as was as iii similarly in the h2o2 system as v was 100 of the adsorbed as and as iii accounted for 72 of the 0 4 µm residual as these trends were reproduced in the sequential h2o2 o2 system fig 2 c and are consistent with the orders of magnitude higher sorption affinity of as v than as iii roberts et al 2004 although the fraction of as v and as iii bound to the solids was similar among many of the samples the total amount of oxidized as iii increased with increasing h2o2 concentration i e total as v increased from 2 9 µm in the o2 system to 6 µm in the h2o2 system the increase in as iii oxidation with h2o2 concentration is consistent with more effective ros generation when fe ii is oxidized by h2o2 compared to o2 hug and leupin 2003 which is attributed to the 1 1 stoichiometric yield of ros when fe ii reacts with h2o2 compared to the 1 3 yield of ros when fe ii reacts with o2 combining the as speciation plots in fig 2 c and the solid phase fe speciation plots in fig 1 c uncovers a key finding about the anaerobic co oxidation of as iii and fe ii by h2o2 comparing the overall as removal between the o2 experiment and the sequential 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment showed a decrease in the residual as concentration from 3 8 µm to 1 3 µm a difference of 2 5 µm as when 40 µm h2o2 was applied whereas for the same samples the total amount of oxidized as iii was 2 9 µm for the o2 experiment and 4 8 µm for the sequential 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment a difference of only 1 9 µm as the higher overall as removal efficacy for the 40 µm h2o2 o2 experiment cannot be attributed to an increase in as iii oxidation alone therefore the results indicate that the higher reactive surface area of the poorly ordered solids generated by fe ii oxidation with h2o2 played a critical role in improving overall as removal efficacy 3 3 under and over dosage of h2o2 experiments were performed to identify any benefit from dosing h2o2 below or above the stoichiometric amount required to anaerobically oxidize 100 3 µm fe ii fig 3 a shows the concentration of oxidized fe ii and the corresponding removal of the initial 7 0 2 µm as iii as a function of different h2o2 dosages 10 400 µm at t 30 min as the h2o2 concentration increased the concentration of oxidized fe ii also increased up to the complete oxidation of fe ii at h2o2 concentrations above 60 µm for h2o2 dosages below 60 µm i e under dosage 10 40 µm only partial oxidation of 100 3 µm fe ii was observed 20 80 oxidation however the ratio of generated fe iii to dosed h2o2 remained around 2 1 mol mol for all conditions fig 3 a indicating that the 2 1 stoichiometry of fe ii oxidation by h2o2 was maintained the results from the sequential h2o2 o2 experiments were consistent with the findings mentioned above increasing the h2o2 concentration from 10 40 µm which is below the required amount for 100 fe ii oxidation resulted in improved as removal due to the formation of more fe iii precipitates section 3 1 and 3 2 for instance with 10 µm h2o2 the residual as concentration t 30 min was 4 8 0 2 µm 31 removal which decreased to 1 7 0 1 µm 76 removal with 40 µm h2o2 fig 3 a however we also observed that increasing the h2o2 concentration above the amount required to completely oxidize 100 3 µm fe ii i e over dosage also improved as iii removal for example when the h2o2 dosage increased from 60 to 400 µm i e over dosage the dissolved as concentration at t 30 min decreased from 0 6 0 1 92 removal to 0 1 0 1 µm 98 5 removal which resulted in as levels below the who recommended limit 0 13 µm fig 3 a this increase in as removal can be explained by the oxidation of as iii to as v via ros formed by decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of fe iii precipitates lin and gurol 1998 with subsequent sorption of as v finally we noted that the removal of the initial 7 0 2 µm as iii with 400 µm h2o2 98 5 removal was almost equal to the removal of the initial 7 0 5 µm as v 99 3 removal at 60 µm h2o2 when a similar fe dosage of 100 3 µm was used fig 3 b this result highlights the advantage of using h2o2 because previous fe ii based as removal studies with only o2 dosing have always reported higher removals of initial as v compared to as iii kumar et al 2004 roberts et al 2004 roy et al 2020 wan et al 2011 3 4 application to raw anaerobic groundwater to validate that enhanced as iii co removal can be achieved by adding h2o2 to groundwater containing native fe ii experiments were performed with raw anaerobic groundwater rich in fe ii co occurring as iii and other native dissolved species such as phosphorous total p and manganese mn fig 4 shows the removal of initial as iii mn and total p from raw anaerobic groundwater with fe iii generation over 30 min consistent with the laboratory experiments sections 3 1 and 3 2 all groundwater native fe ii was oxidized with h2o2 and rapidly formed precipitates within 2 min whereas o2 oxidation of fe ii required the full 30 min of the experiment during the h2o2 dosing experiment as iii was also quickly removed with 97 6 as iii removal measured in 2 min when the native fe ii in groundwater was oxidized by o2 as iii removal continued over the full 30 min reaction duration and at the end of the experiment 1 3 0 1 µm residual as 81 removal remained in solution while our experiments with natural groundwater were consistent with the laboratory experiments i e h2o2 addition outperformed aeration some key differences were observed first compared to the laboratory experiments raw groundwater samples showed a better removal of as iii for both h2o2 and o2 oxidation second the difference between as iii removal using h2o2 or o2 was smaller for the raw groundwater experiments the less distinct as removal of h2o2 and o2 oxidants applied to natural groundwater could be attributed to the four times higher fe ii concentration in natural groundwater than in the laboratory experiments which suggests that optimal conditions for enhancing as removal by h2o2 addition occur at lower initial fe ii levels additionally the optimal removal of as iii with h2o2 in groundwater containing low levels of native fe ii can also be impacted by the presence of other native species that can compete for adsorption sites and ros for example phosphorous in groundwater is present mainly as phosphate po4 3 and studies have shown its competition with as v for adsorption sites on fe solids roberts et al 2004 as observed in fig 4 along with the removal of as iii total p removal was also observed for both h2o2 and o2 experiments but the removal of total p was different for the different oxidants in the o2 experiment the rate and amount of total p removal was higher than as iii whereas the h2o2 experiment did not display a substantial difference between as iii and total p removal this result can be explained by the availability of sufficient sorption sites for both as and p on the fe solids owing to the formation of poorly ordered solids during h2o2 oxidation the high fe ii concentration 424 12 µm and to the enhanced oxidation of as iii using h2o2 however in situations where native fe ii is low a possible lower co removal of as iii could be expected due to competition with po4 3 for adsorption sites apart from po4 3 groundwater can also contain dissolved mn which might impact as iii co removal with native fe ii for instance previous studies have reported that mn in groundwater which is present as mn ii can compete with as iii for ros yielding oxidized mn iii that partially incorporates into the co precipitating fe iii solids ahmad et al 2019 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten and peña 2017 however as shown in fig 4 mn removal was relatively low for both h2o2 19 removal and o2 13 removal suggesting that mn iii formation was not substantial however since identifying the solid phase speciation of mn was beyond the scope of this study it is not clear whether there was any competition between mn ii and as iii for the generated ros 3 5 implications for groundwater treatment we observed improved as iii removal when co existing fe ii was oxidized by h2o2 rather than o2 the ratio of as iii removed to fe iii generated increased from 0 03 to 0 06 mol mol when 100 µm fe ii was completely oxidized with either 8 0 9 0 mg l o2 or 100 µm h2o2 respectively indicating substantially less fe is required for equivalent as removal with h2o2 the application of such fenton type systems i e fe ii h2o2 to improve as iii removal from water has been reported previously for example krishna et al 2001 showed that initial treatment of 2 mg l as iii with 100 mg l fe ii and 100 µl l of 30 h2o2 followed by passing through zero valent iron columns and a sand bed achieved as removal to 10 µg l who guideline in addition wang et al 2013 observed that oxidizing 20 µm fe ii with 50 µm h2o2 at ph 7 0 resulted in 70 oxidation of 20 µm as iii compared to just 2 5 while oxidizing the fe ii with o2 while these studies are useful they interpret their results primarily by improved as iii co oxidation by ros and did not focus on the influence of fe iii precipitate structure in this study we also observed that the improved as iii co removal by h2o2 is partly attributed to the well established enhanced efficiency of as iii oxidation in fe ii h2o2 systems due to higher stoichiometric yield of ros compared to fe ii o2 systems bandaru et al 2020 hug and leupin 2003 however our results explicitly showed that the fe iii precipitate structure played a major role in improving as iii removal the fe k edge exafs analysis performed in this study indicated a systematic decrease in precipitate crystallinity i e increase in reactive specific surface area from moderately crystalline lp in the o2 system to poorly ordered fe iii precipitates with h2o2 fig 1 c this impact of fe iii precipitate structure is often overlooked in fe based as removal techniques but we show that the type of fe iii precipitates must be considered to accurately predict as removal in groundwater treatment our results also indicated that oxidizing the groundwater native fe ii anaerobically with h2o2 prior to aeration filtration can be used to leverage the full potential of native fe ii for as iii treatment depending on the initial as fe and fe h2o2 ratios this novel approach can remove as iii to below drinking water standards achieving a high as iii removal which is often difficult with conventional aeration filtration the optimal use of native fe ii via h2o2 oxidation can help to avoid the need for additional fe dosage as fecl3 in situations where oxidizing native fe ii by aeration is not sufficient to meet as drinking water limits this reduction of fe dosage will also lower the volume of generated fe sludge and thus lower the frequency of filter backwashing additionally anaerobic oxidation of fe ii with h2o2 prior to aeration will not result in the same increase in groundwater ph as is observed during aeration due to degassing of co2 g as long as fe ii is oxidized maintaining a low ph is advantageous because as v adsorption to fe solids decreases with increasing ph annaduzzaman et al 2021b dixit and hering 2003 usage of other strong oxidants such as kmno4 or naocl during aeration filtration has been reported previously effectively oxidizing as iii and also generating poorly ordered fe solids van genuchten and ahmad 2020 however compared to those oxidants h2o2 is considered a green oxidant because its by products namely h2o and o2 are benign goyal et al 2020 pham et al 2012b zhao et al 2019 recent studies have also shown that h2o2 can be electrochemically generated in situ bandaru et al 2020 which eliminates the necessity to maintain chemical stocks of h2o2 on site thus decreasing the supply chain for operating groundwater treatment plants the results in this work suggest that oxidizing groundwater native fe ii with h2o2 anaerobically prior to aeration filtration can be a novel approach to optimize the co removal of toxic as iii however our study did not take into account potentially different environmental scenarios that can impact as iii removal for example the laboratory experiments were performed in controlled conditions with a fixed fe ii as iii ratio and ph and without the presence of other competing ions while a set of experiments with raw anaerobic groundwater was performed the advantage of oxidizing native fe ii with h2o2 over o2 for as iii co removal diminished most likely due to the high concentration of native fe ii in the experiments with real groundwater although 1 mol of h2o2 is sufficient to oxidize 2 mol of fe ii an excess h2o2 was dosed to minimize the impact of any atmospheric o2 influx and to ensure complete oxidation of the native fe ii by h2o2 in absence of n2 g dosage as in laboratory experiments while our laboratory investigations and tests in real groundwater highlight the potential benefits of h2o2 dosing it is recommended to perform further studies with real anaerobic groundwater under various environmental conditions with optimization of the h2o2 dosage to further validate the novelty of the proposed approach overall the advantage of anaerobic h2o2 oxidation of native fe ii for as iii removal is that it can be easily implemented in conventional or decentralized systems to treat as contaminated groundwater without major changes in infrastructure and without substantial increases in treatment costs conclusions in this study we showed a novel approach where the co removal of groundwater as iii with native fe ii can be enhanced by oxidizing the fe ii anaerobically with h2o2 prior to aeration filtration rather than conventionally by aeration or o2 under aerobic conditions the enhanced as iii co removal with h2o2 was partly due to generation of a larger fraction of poorly ordered fe iii solids with a higher reactive specific surface area compared to moderately crystalline fe iii solids generated by o2 as well as the generation of more ros per mole of fe ii when dosing h2o2 1 1 compared to o2 1 3 thus favouring as iii oxidation to readily adsorbed as v hence we propose the application of h2o2 a green oxidant for anaerobic fe ii and as iii co oxidation in groundwater treatment prior to aeration to optimize native fe ii usage

exercises sunderland et al 2018 and large pfas plumes have been detected in groundwater supplies near fire training areas particularly near airports and military installations in recent years hu et al 2016 gobelius et al 2017 mussabek et al 2019 pfass pose major challenges for remediation due to their high stability mobility in aquifers and chemical recalcitrance to in situ treatment schemes common for groundwater remediation like in situ chemical oxidation vecitis et al 2009 thus treatment of groundwater pfas is most often accomplished by ex situ adsorption processes typically granular activated carbon gac kucharzyk et al 2017 while gac is a low cost media its performance is limited by rapid bed exhaustion a large requisite contact time and significant inhibition by groundwater co constituents like natural organic matter nom du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 this leads to high media usage rates necessitating frequent replacement and off site disposal or regeneration of large quantities of sorbent media rahman et al 2014 an alternative to gac anion exchange resins aers are receiving increased attention for pfas treatment conventional aers used in water treatment e g for nitrate are often regenerable using a concentrated salt brine e g 5 10 nacl to reverse the equilibrium and recover the resin s adsorption capacity however strong affinity between pfass and aers necessitates the addition of organic cosolvent to salt brines e g 70 methanol in nacl brine to regenerate resins boyer et al 2021 recently resin manufacturers have introduced aers with very high affinities for pfass that are operated as single use products designed to be disposed or incinerated upon exhaustion boodoo et al 2019 while this limits operational lifetimes for the resins it simplifies the treatment train by eliminating the need for aer regeneration and waste brine cosolvent management infrastructure furthermore the high selectivity of these resins for pfass coupled with the trace levels of pfass detected at most sites potentially allows for extended operation e g 1 year before media replacement while a growing number of studies report effective treatment of pfass using aers most reports are limited to batch adsorption and bench scale continuous flow studies carter and farrell 2010 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019 fang et al 2021 tests of single use pfas selective aers confirm their higher affinity for pfass especially long chain structures like pfos perfluorooctane sulfonate and pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid compared to conventional regenerable aers fang et al 2021 while single use aers share many of the same properties of some regenerable resins e g a polystyrene backbone and quaternary amine functional groups these sorbents benefit from the inclusion of longer chain hydrocarbon moieties within the cationic amine functional group that increase hydrophobicity near the active site of adsorption leading to greater sorbent affinity for pfass batch adsorption experiments have also shown that pfas adsorption to aers is less affected by nom than gac the presence of nom reduced gac adsorption capacity for pfass by up to 75 compared to only 10 for aers dixit et al 2021a kothawala et al 2017 while groundwater sources often have low nom levels 5 mg l these organic co constituents can compete for exchange sites particularly for humic acids that are ubiquitous in groundwater maimati et al 2018 dixit et al 2020a batch studies are supported by column treatment studies showing longer periods of time before pfas breakthrough for aers relative to gac zeng et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 two recent reports by liu et al 2019 under review tested gac and single use aers for treatment of a dilute pfas contaminated groundwater finding the aers to have greater adsorption capacity than gac single use aers treated 6 7 times more contaminated groundwater than gac on a sorbent mass normalized basis prior to pfas breakthrough however there are no reports comparing the effectiveness of regenerable and single use aers for extended treatment of real pfas contaminated groundwater nor have these aers been compared when treating highly concentrated source zones e g 10 μg l σpfas requiring remedial action finally prior pilot studies have not examined the effects of variable empty bed contact times ebcts which refer to the time one empty bed of water resides in the sorbent bed on aer efficacy this contribution describes the results of a field pilot study and subsequent sorbent analyses aimed at improving understanding of pfas removal by aers under continuous flow conditions five commercial aers both polystyrene and polyacrylic were compared for pfas treatment at an afff impacted source zone including two regenerable resins and three single use resins with a range of functional groups and porosities this system treated 180 000 bed volumes bvs with a combined ebct of two minutes for the first two media vessels in each column while 750 000 bvs were treated through the lead vessel 30 sec ebct in each column the goals of this field pilot were to evaluate 1 regenerable vs single use resin performance 2 the sorbent properties most important for pfas removal 3 the effects of ebct on pfas elution 4 identify structure reactivity patterns among pfass and relate individual pfas breakthrough behavior with batch derived adsorption parameters and 5 how to best optimize ion exchange system configuration the thomas model was fit to breakthrough data to provide objective quantification of breakthrough parameters for individual pfass on each resin postmortem analysis of the spent resins was performed to characterize adsorption zones for individual pfass along each sorbent column to obtain a deeper understanding of how competitive adsorption among target pfass influences sorbent capacity and analyte breakthrough breakthrough data and postmortem adsorbate profiles were used to identify important factors including site specific treatment criteria that will determine media usage rates murs across a range of diverse sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 field pilot design five resins were compared down selected from a larger group studied in batch systems fang et al 2021 these aers reflect the diversity of resin properties table 1 that are commonly used in removing organic anions as no aer used in this pilot shares the same porosity functional group polymer and regenerability while a major focus of the study was to compare regenerable and single use aers other assessments of resin properties were considered including polystyrene vs polyacrylic backbone and macroporous 20 100 nm pore size vs gel type resins 1 2 nm pore size maximum exchange capacities for chloride and maximum capacities for pfos adsorption measured in batch isotherms fang et al 2021 are also listed in table 1 all aers were obtained from manufacturers in the chloride form and were used as received although a860 was not found to be among the most effective resins in adsorbing pfass in previous batch equilibrium adsorption studies fang et al 2021 the polyacrylic resin was included in the study to compare with similar polystyrene resins a520e in particular shares the same porosity regenerability uniformity and particle size range as a860 this enabled assessment of the importance of polymer backbone in pfas adsorption from groundwater under field conditions and comparison of relative resin performance trends in batch versus continuous flow operation furthermore while our earlier batch adsorption data suggested poor performance of a860 other recent reports have indicated that the resin is effective in adsorbing pfass from groundwater dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021a the pilot study was conducted at a u s department of defense site located in the willow grove pa area where elevated groundwater pfas concentrations have been documented due to historical releases of afff leeson et al 2020 total detected sourcewater pfas concentrations ranged from 30 55 μg l more than 400 times greater than the epa s lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l pfos pfoa combined goode and senior 2020 resin quantities in each vessel were designed to allow prolonged pfas loading while maintaining a vessel to particle diameter ratio 40 to prevent preferential flow paths due to walling effects tian et al 2016 the pilot system was outfitted with 24 individual vessels packed with resin arranged in eight parallel columns fig 1 each containing three vessels in series with sample ports before and after each vessel full pilot details are summarized in section sm 1 of the supplementary material sm for each column the first two vessels in series contained the same resin with the first vessel providing an ebct of 30 sec and the second providing an additional 90 sec ebct thus influent waters pass through the given resin for a total of 2 min ebct consistent with manufacturer recommendations for single use pfas selective resins boodoo et al 2019 while recommendations for some resins particularly regenerable aers are 3 5 min ebct the same ebcts were used for all resins to enable appropriate comparisons on a bed volume equivalent basis for three of the aers purolite a860 a520e and pfa694e duplicate columns were included to assess variability in breakthrough data duplicate columns were not included for calgon calres 2301 and dowex psr2 due to system flow constraints although a third vessel of aer with 1 3 min of additional ebct was included in the system design breakthrough of nearly all these vessels was excluded from analysis due to cost considerations and poor performance of the resin used in the third vessel of most columns purolite a860 analysis of effluent from the third vessel was conducted where a third segment of purolite a520e and a860 was added to provide 1 min additional ebct providing a 3 min total ebct consistent with manufacturer recommendations for this regenerable aer this also allowed us to compare breakthrough data for 0 5 2 and 3 min ebct for the same resin 2 2 pilot system operation operation of the pilot system was conducted over the course of 36 weeks july 2020 march 2021 with weekly samples collected from the influent and effluent of each resin vessel operation occurred continuously with minimal stoppages for maintenance e g the changeout of 10 μm pretreatment bag filters located upstream of the field pilot intake a total of 3600 ml min 0 95 gpm was drawn from a slipstream of a larger onsite treatment system and pumped through the resins providing each parallel column with 450 ml min 0 12 gpm of groundwater treated water was routed back into the feedwater of the larger onsite treatment system to comply with discharge permits flow control valves along with both analog and digital flowmeters were included in every column to maintain desired flows that were monitored using a labview national instruments remote interface 2 3 fitting of field pilot breakthrough curves breakthrough data for individual pfass were fit using the thomas model which yielded sigmoidal curves to more objectively estimate bvs treated before breakthrough this function was chosen from a larger list of nonlinear curve fits due to its documented utility and accuracy in fitting pfas adsorption breakthrough curves and its simplicity as a two parameter function that does not rely on extensive fitting factors grieco et al 2021 schaefer et al 2019 effluent c c0 values exceeding 1 0 were fixed at this value before least square fitting since the major goal was to identify bvs at which different thresholds for breakthrough e g 10 of influent concentrations or 70 ng l were reached rather than providing a prediction of the full breakthrough profile further details are provided in section 5 of the sm 2 4 postmortem characterization of pfas adsorption zones upon completion of the pilot study the vessels of used resin were transported from the site back to the colorado school of mines for postmortem analysis the first two vessels from each column were frozen and cross sectioned into five fractions before measuring the concentrations of adsorbed pfass in each section resin from each column fraction was completely mixed to ensure homogeneity before extraction extraction of adsorbed pfass from the resins was accomplished using a 90 9 1 wt methanol water ammonium chloride mixture three rounds of extraction 100 mg resin in 25 ml extract solution 24 h were performed before pooling extracts for analysis validation of this extraction procedure was conducted by recovering 95 of a known quantity of pfos the major pfas with the highest affinity for the resins fang et al 2021 that was pre loaded onto virgin resins 2 5 analytical methods pfass were analyzed using either a sciex x500r qtof high resolution mass spectrometer or a sciex 5500 qtrap triple quad mass spectrometer using an established method murray et al 2019 analytes were first separated on a phenomenex gemini c18 lc column 5 μm particle size 110 å pore size using fisher scientific optima lcms grade water methanol and isopropanol as eluents further method details are provided in section sm 2 analysis of select groundwater co constituents was also conducted at various timepoints throughout the study including total organic carbon toc major ions ph alkalinity and turbidity details in section sm 2 3 results 3 1 site and sourcewater characterization twelve pfass including the c4 c8 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas c3 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas and the fluorotelomer acid 6 2 fts were consistently detected in the sourcewater above quantifiable limits table 2 collectively these analytes had a total pfas concentration ranging from 30 000 55 000 ng l pfos 22 500 ng l accounted for 57 of the total pfas as a subclass pfsas also dominated comprising 78 of total pfas mass whereas pfcas constituted 15 and 6 2 fts the remainder the predominance of pfsas is consistent with other afff impacted sites hu et al 2016 a small number of additional nontarget pfass mostly perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide precursors were detected using a suspect screening protocol mcdonough et al 2020a semi quantitative estimates of concentration for suspect analytes that were consistently detected ranged from 0 1 0 5 μg l representing less than 3 of the total detected pfass table 2 also includes water quality parameters and concentrations of important groundwater co constituents detected at the site including dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of non target anions were well below the levels expected to compete with pfass for available exchange sites and the doc range of 0 7 1 3 mg l is consistent with global median groundwater concentrations fang et al 2021 mcdonough et al 2020b additional details on pfas and co constituent concentrations are provided in section sm 3 3 2 pfas treatment with regenerable aers the pilot test included two regenerable aers a polyacrylic resin a860 and a polystyrene resin a520e the polyacrylic a860 performed very poorly at a 2 min ebct with all pfass being detected in effluent samples after just 960 bvs or 32 h of system operation and all pfaas reached 90 of influent concentrations within 10 000 bvs fig s4 1 thus further discussion of this resin s performance is limited fig 2a shows breakthrough curves for individual pfaas from effluent of the second vessel in each column 2 min total ebct for the regenerable polystyrene resin a520e and the three single use resins in fig 2b d pfa694e calres 2301 and psr2 to be discussed in section 3 3 for a520e fig 2a both short and long chain pfcas as well as 6 2 fts shown separately in fig s4 2 eluted through the column fully in 75 000 bvs whereas most pfsas did not fully elute even after treating 180 000 bvs short chain pfsas were first detected at 50 000 bvs with only pfprs and pfbs reaching complete breakthrough within 180 000 bvs by the end of the pilot test intermediate length pfsas pfpes and pfhxs reached 50 breakthrough but pfos the dominant pfas detected in the sourcewater reached only 4 breakthrough for pfass that fully broke through many samples showed effluent concentrations that exceeded influent concentrations sometimes reaching 170 of the influent values consistent with competitive displacement of lower affinity pfass by higher affinity structures like pfos as observed in prior studies mccleaf et al 2017 gao et al 2017 while complete breakthrough of many pfass was not be observed for 2 min ebct fig 2a more complete breakthrough was observed in effluent collected following 30 sec of ebct fig 3a where 700 000 bvs were treated during the pilot study results for a520e are generally consistent with observations for 2 min ebct with rapid elution of pfcas within the first 50 000 bvs however all pfsas were also detectable within 25 000 bvs pfprs the shortest chain pfsa first reaches 50 breakthrough by 114 000 bvs whereas pfos does not exceed 50 breakthrough until 650 000 bvs comparison of breakthrough data for individual analytes on a bed volume equivalent basis figures s4 14 s4 25 shows breakthrough of most pfass at lower bvs when monitoring effluent after 30 sec ebct than 2 min ebct particularly for pfsas this can be attributed to kinetic limitations and greater opportunities for preferential flow path development in the shorter bed depths murray et al 2021 still breakthrough data collected after the shorter ebct is valuable for revealing pfsa breakthrough that would not otherwise be observed within the pilot study timescale effluent data collected from a third segment of a520e figures s4 26 s4 37 that provided an additional 1 min ebct total of 3 min ebct was similar to results for 2 min ebct reinforcing the notion that data collected with 2 min ebct likely reflects results that would be observed when using the longer recommended ebcts for regenerable resins e g 3 5 min 3 3 pfas treatment with single use aers compared to the regenerable aers much longer bvs to breakthrough were observed for most pfass using the three single use resins figs 2b d 3b d pfa694e calres2301 and psr2 with a 2 min ebct 50 breakthrough within 180 000 bvs was only observed for c6 pfcas pfhpa is initially observed in the effluent at 25 of influent levels between 150 000 and 180 000 for all three resins and pfoa is initially observed in the effluent for psr2 after 160 000 bvs nearly all pfsas remained undetected with the single use resins throughout the pilot study though some short chain pfsas were detected at trace levels after 160 000 bvs at a 2 min ebct though there is considerable scatter in the sourcewater concentrations of 6 2 fts and the resulting breakthrough data fig s4 2 similar trends hold where single use resins show far more bvs to breakthrough than regenerable resins direct comparison of breakthrough data for individual pfass on different resins is provided in figures s4 2 s4 13 the lack of substantial breakthrough for most pfaas within 100 000 bvs using a 2 min ebct indicates that these single use aers are promising options for pfas treatment however the lack of actual breakthrough data precludes exact quantification of the extent to which these sorbents outperform regenerable aers instead data collected with 30 sec ebct fig 3 can provide some measure of comparison between resins while 50 breakthrough of short chain pfcas occurs within 100 000 bvs on all three single use resins 200 000 bvs is required for long chain pfcas in contrast to the 2 min ebct data both long and short chain pfsas are detected in the first 25 000 bvs for the single use resins at a 30 sec ebct though no compounds reach 10 of their influent concentrations until 150 000 bvs long chain compounds of regulatory concern like pfoa are better treated by all single use aers compared to the regenerable aers as pfoa does not reach 50 breakthrough on any single use resin until 300 000 bvs compared to 65 000 bvs with regenerable resins as seen in the case of regenerable resins pfsa breakthrough curves after single use aer treatment exhibit gradual breakthrough with long chain pfsas never reaching complete breakthrough by 700 000 bvs on any of the resins however aer removal of all pfass is superior for all three single use resins compared to a520e comparing single use breakthrough data between the 30 sec and 2 min ebcts for a520e figures s4 38 s4 49 reveals that the 30 sec ebct reasonably predicts 2 min breakthrough for pfcas but pfsas experience more rapid breakthrough at a 30 sec ebct indicating this contact time is inadequate for use in the field 3 4 treatment of nontarget pfass screening of suspect compounds in the sourcewater revealed four additional structures with semi quantitative estimates of concentration exceeding 100 ng l three of these four compounds were short chain fluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas with 5 carbon atoms which are uncharged at environmentally relevant ph nguyen et al 2020 extensive analysis of suspect breakthrough was precluded by the lack of internal standards needed for reliable quantitation though semi quantitative analysis showed that these structures fully broke through the aer beds within the first five weeks earlier than any of the pfaas see section sm 3 the fourth suspect compound h pfda is a c10 polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid where one fluorine on the fluoroalkyl chain has been replaced by hydrogen h pfda showed strong affinity for aers and was not detected in effluent samples from four aers analyzed throughout pilot system operation 3 5 postmortem analysis of resins after conclusion of the field pilot columns of used resin were cross sectioned and pfass were extracted from each segment to characterize the spatial distribution of adsorbed pfass along each column the first two of the five sections were derived from the initial 30 sec ebct vessel while the remaining three sections came from the second vessel in each channel that provided an additional 90 sec of ebct the resulting profiles are shown in fig 4 with each bar representing the spatial distribution of an individual pfas mass along the length of the aer column with flow proceeding from top to bottom the numbers at the top of each bar represent the percentage of total influent analyte mass that was retained by the resin over the course of the pilot i e the percentage of total sourcewater mass that did not break through consistent with the breakthrough data the adsorbed data show that the single use resins retained a much larger percentage of the sourcewater pfass than the regenerable a520e resin the retained masses of pfass were similar for all three single use resins for all resins a clear trend is apparent where pfass with higher affinity for a resin i e pfsas and long chain pfcas were more heavily concentrated in the early segments of each column whereas lower affinity compounds were primarily found in the latter segments conceptually this follows the chromatographic trends observed in the breakthrough data where the active adsorption zone of short chain pfcas has progressed further along the column by the conclusion of the study while higher affinity compounds remain concentrated in the earlier sections because nearly all the pfos mass is located in the early segments of each column whereas pfpea mainly exists in the latter segments it can be inferred that in the final days of pilot operation the majority of pfos uptake was occurring in the 30 sec ebct vessel while pfpea was primarily adsorbing in the latter segments of the second vessel additionally the absolute mass of lower affinity structures like pfpea is much higher in the latter sections e g 0 66 mg g of resin in section 5 vs 0 19 mg g in section 1 for calres 2301 consistent with an analyte that is being displaced from upstream sections by competitive adsorption of higher affinity compounds like pfos 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 analysis of pfas breakthrough behavior breakthrough of individual pfas analytes follows a chromatographic trend wherein short chain structures break through earlier than long chain homologues this phenomenon is due to the hydrophobic and van der waals forces that attract the hydrophobic nonpolar fluorocarbon tail of the pfas molecule to the hydrophobic components of the polymeric resin because overall molecular hydrophobicity increases with increasing length of the fluorocarbon tail pfas affinity for aers increases with increasing tail length leading to longer times before elution through the sorbent column boyer et al 2021 wang et al 2019 among structures with the same fluorocarbon chain length pfcas break through far earlier than pfsas indicating stronger attraction between the sulfonate head group of the pfsa and the cationic quaternary amine resin functional groups when compared to the carboxylate group of pfcas these functional groups located on the resin exchange sites attract pfas head groups via electrostatic exchange resulting in a combination of both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in aer adsorption of pfass in fact the shortest chain pfsas pfprs and pfbs are generally retained longer than the longest chain pfca pfoa surprisingly breakthrough of 6 2 fts a polyfluoroalkyl sulfonate was more similar to that observed for pfcas than even short chain pfsas demonstrating a critical effect of substitution at the α carbon position on resin affinity as expected nonionic fasa structures identified through suspect screening analysis were not effectively adsorbed by aers these trends of chain length dependent breakthrough chromatographic elution and the role of head groups are supported by existing literature mccleaf et al 2017 maimati et al 2018 wang et al 2019 with greater in depth explanation of pfas structure reactivity relationships and aer characteristic reactivity patterns available in our prior work fang et al 2021 from an operational perspective the most important distinction between these sorbents is the resins regenerability all three single use aers treat both pfcas and pfsas for many more bvs before breakthrough than either regenerable resin pfoa the pfca of primary interest to regulators is treated to non detect levels 0 1 ng l through 150 000 bvs with all single use resins 2 min ebct compared with only 31 000 bvs for the regenerable a520e and 1 000 bvs for a860 this disparity holds true for the pfsa class as well as every pfsa present in the sourcewater other than pfos is detected in a520e effluent samples within 61 000 bvs whereas long chain pfsas remain at non detect levels for 150 000 bvs with all three single use resins among the three single use resins pfas treatment performance is similar for all analytes after 2 min of ebct although some recent reports have indicated successful use of polyacrylic aers deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2021a findings from this study and recent laboratory investigations laura del moral et al 2020 dietz et al 2021 demonstrate the superiority of polystyrene aers the four polystyrene based resins removed pfsas through 40 000 bvs with complete pfos removal through 75 000 bvs whereas near immediate breakthrough was observed with the polyacrylic resin the success of a860 in prior studies might result from longer contact times e g 10 min and lengthy batch reactions that do not reflect treatment site conditions in the present study as well as the presence of elevated nom levels in the earlier bench scale studies because a860 has been found to remove nom better than polystyrene pfas selective resins dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021a the presence of higher nom levels may improve pfas adsorption by cooperative adsorption mechanisms the superiority of polystyrene based resins for pfas adsorption observed in the present study can be attributed to their greater hydrophobicity in comparison to polyacrylic based resins it is interesting to note the similar performance of three single use resins despite large differences in maximum pfos adsorption capacity measured in batch equilibrium experiments table 1 fang et al 2021 although the macroporous calres 2301 yielded a maximum batch adsorption capacity 4 times greater than either of the other two gel type single use resins breakthrough data for pfos was similar for all three resins thus other factors beyond maximum adsorption capacity control uptake and competition among pfass on these resins influent pfas concentrations is likely one such factor as other pilot scale treatment systems at lower concentration sites experienced complete pfas breakthrough after adsorption of significantly lower total pfas masses liu et al under review dixit et al 2021b other factors specific to individual aers including polymer exchange site density and functional group type have been known to play a major role in the adsorption and desorption of various pfass to aers fang et al 2021 deng et al 2010 4 2 breakthrough curve fitting using the thomas model measured pfas breakthrough data where sufficient breakthrough was observed before the pilot study ended was fit with the thomas model as shown for calres 2301 in fig 5 similar fits for other resins are provided in figures s5 1 s5 8 in the sm data for a860 was excluded since 50 breakthrough of all pfass was observed within one week of pilot operation the resulting fit derived parameters kth thomas model constant and qe resin capacity for individual sorbate uptake are listed in table s5 1 statistical variances of these fits are reasonable r2 0 9 for most analytes and sigmoid inflection points table 3 representing 50 breakthrough were obtained from these fits to serve as an objective reference point to compare various analytes breakthrough profiles fitting efforts focused on data from 30 sec ebct vessels because breakthrough was more complete within the 725 000 bvs of data collected enabling broader comparison among all pfass and resins while breakthrough was not observed for many pfaas using a 2 min ebct thomas model fits are provided in the sm for the few analytes that did breakthrough sufficiently during the pilot study although breakthrough data and model fits for 30 sec ebct are not expected to perfectly represent breakthrough when using a longer 2 min ebct it is worth noting that the model predictions of 50 breakthrough with 30 sec and 2 min ebct generally agreed for the few analytes that did experience sufficient breakthrough at a 2 min ebct to perform a model fit figure s5 9 compares the bvs at which 50 analyte breakthrough is predicted at both ebcts with the majority of analytes falling very near the 1 1 correlation line still the lack of pfsa breakthrough for single use aers at 2 min ebct during the pilot study prevents conclusions from being drawn for pfsas overall the general agreement between the two ebcts supports the use of the 30 sec data for thomas model fitting and breakthrough predictions the trends in 50 breakthrough values observed for individual pfaa resin combinations are generally consistent with trends in equilibrium ion exchange affinity constants measured in batch experiments fang et al 2021 fig 6 shows the relationship between the bvs at which breakthrough reaches 50 for different analytes table 3 and the pfas cl exchange coefficients logk ex measured for the same analyte aer combinations in batch adsorption experiments corresponding linear correlation fits for individual resins provided in figures s6 1 s6 5 these empirical correlations particularly strong for the single use aers suggest that field performance of new resins under development may be roughly estimated from batch adsorption experiments for the new resin in tandem with pilot breakthrough data already collected for existing resins where these correlations have been observed while such predictions need further validation this suggests an approach that could be used to rapidly screen and downselect new adsorbents before investing in more costly and lengthy pilot studies at a contaminated site to enable direct comparison of different aers fig 7 shows pairwise scatterplots comparing the fit derived 50 breakthrough bvs 30 sec ebct for individual analytes on each of the four polystyrene based resins the plots reinforce the superiority of all three single use aers compared to the regenerable a520e further we see that all pfsas reach their 50 breakthrough point earlier for psr2 than either pfa694e or calres 2301 while these trends are consistent for all pfsa structures the 30 sec ebct does not reflect treatment conditions in full scale systems where 2 3 min ebct is recommended thereby precluding a definitive determination of a singular optimal resin while psr2 appears to be the least effective single use aer in treating pfsas at a 30 sec ebct this resin actually shows superior treatment of short chain pfcas pfba pfpea and pfhxa when using a 2 min ebct figure 2 and s4 2 4 4 thus while selection of an optimal single use resin will depend on the breakthrough criteria that dictates resin changeout the collective data supports a conclusion that all three single use resins will be highly effective in pfas treatment 4 3 media usage rates breakthrough data and the thomas model fit derived parameters can be used to predict bvs at which different thresholds for media changeout regeneration are met e g when 10 pfos breakthrough occurs the bottom portion of table 3 summarizes bvs where different thresholds are reached including bvs treated by each resin before detection of criteria are met including detection of any pfass and detection of ucmr3 structures since these are common treatment criteria at some sites in these situations the values were derived from the raw breakthrough data observed with 2 min ebct predicting the bvs at which media replacement will be required can be directly used to calculate expected media usage rates murs for the single use aers using a changeout criteria of detection of any pfass in effluent at a site similar in concentration to this study would likely necessitate frequent vessel changeout 20 000 bvs since pfba is detectable within 21 000 bvs for all resins however sites only concerned with compounds listed under the epa s ucmr3 could treat pfas impacted waters for well over 100 000 bvs prior to detection using any of the single use resins this disparity is even more pronounced in cases where only pfsas or long chain structures are of concern for all three single use resins none of the pfsas reach 50 breakthrough before 325 000 bvs thus media replacement regeneration criteria will have a significant effect on murs although single use aers treat most pfass much longer than regenerable aers when using 50 breakthrough as the changeout regeneration criteria differences are not so large when changeout regeneration criteria is the detection of any pfass the superiority of single use aers is most pronounced for long chain pfcas and short chain pfsas using detection of ucmr3 structures as the changeout criteria is one scenario where single use resins substantially outperform regenerable aers with estimates that 7 times more water can be treated using single use resins than either of the regenerable resins this trend indicates that emphasizing more highly selected for pfass e g pfsas long chains leads to larger disparities between single use and regenerable aers finally it is worth noting that pfas concentrations mixture composition and groundwater geochemistry at given site can significantly influence breakthrough and murs this pilot test was performed at a source zone with elevated pfas concentrations i e 10 μg l and media replacement at such a site can be expected to be quite different from sites where pfas concentrations are much lower 4 4 adsorption zone identification postmortem analysis of the spatial distribution of adsorbed pfass on the resins provided a snapshot of the active adsorption zone for each analyte at the time the pilot study was completed these data reinforce the trends seen in the breakthrough data indicating long chain structures and pfsas have higher affinity for all aers than short chain structures and pfcas respectively this suggests that not only does the increased hydrophobic character of pfass with longer fluorocarbon tails lead to greater resin affinity but also that pfass with shorter tails are more easily displaced from resins due to the lower hydrophobic attraction between the target analytes and the hydrophobic resin polymer while chromatographic elution of pfas analytes is well established these adsorbate distribution profiles underscore the importance that competitive displacement mechanisms play in the breakthrough behavior of individual pfass when treating pfas mixtures in afff impacted water sources comparison of the total pfas mass found on each section shows that the total adsorbed mass decreases substantially along the length of the column on a molar basis the total pfas mass adsorbed in the first section of each single use resin is 15 fold higher than that adsorbed in last section in fact the masses extracted from section 1 exceed isotherm derived pfos capacities for calres 2301 and pfa694e possible explanations for this include size exclusion where lower molecular weight pfass may access more internal exchange sites than pfos or potential bilayer micellar formation on the surface of the aer beads that enables hydrophobic uptake beyond the electrostatic exchange capacity potential for bilayer and micellar formation has been documented for pfass adsorbing onto charged surfaces including aers dixit et al 2021b xiao et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 as well as for hemi micelle aggregation on nom macromolecules gagliano et al 2020 4 5 implications for full scale treatment operations the enhanced mass uptake in earlier sections of the column identified in the postmortem resin analyses is that sites with stringent treatment objectives may potentially reduce murs by arranging multiple sorbent vessels in series e g lead lag 1 lag 2 and operating the lead vessel to greater degrees of breakthrough before media changeout such a configuration would enable operators to replace resin with high pfas loading in the lead vessel while continuing to facilitate adsorption in the lag vessels containing resin that would otherwise be replaced during changeout of a single vessel given that the extract profiles of the spent aers imply that the earliest sections of the column have higher sorbed pfas masses than the later sections it would be expected that lengthier operation of a lead vessel would result in a greater overall pfas uptake per mass of resin and ultimately lower murs total system ebct is recommended to be 2 minutes as shorter ebcts e g 30 sec experienced more rapid detection of numerous pfas analytes this may be accomplished by multiple vessels with shorter individual ebcts thereby enabling a lead lag configuration that can achieve a total of 2 3 minutes of contact results from this field pilot study also inform operators as to how to best select resins for treatment of pfas mixtures polystyrene resins are strongly recommended due to their increased hydrophobic character while single use resins provide even greater uptake of pfass due to the specialized functional groups containing quaternary amines with long hydrocarbon chains furthering the strong hydrophobic attraction to the adsorbent however selection of an optimal resin for remediation will ultimately depend on criteria used to determine the compounds of regulatory concern and their relative concentrations in the pfas mixture sites predominated by long chain pfass would benefit from use of high capacity single use aers while sites concerned with short chain pfass may opt for regenerable resins that experience breakthrough of pfba and pfpea at similar times to single use aers pilot scale testing of aers using site sourcewater is recommended which may be paired with the correlations identified in this study to approximate expected breakthrough times for more slowly eluting compounds like pfos 5 conclusion this study compared the efficacy of regenerable and single use aers for treatment of pfas contaminated groundwater at an afff impacted source zone moreover treatment was compared at different ebcts and postmortem analysis of resins provided spatial characterization of the active zones of adsorption occurring at the time the pilot study was ended the following conclusions can be made single use resins outperform regenerable resins with the difference being greatest for long chain pfcas and pfsas as these analytes were removed by single use aers for up to 8 times the volume of water before breakthrough compared to regenerable aers for single use resins no detectable 0 1 ng l concentrations of c7 pfcas or any pfsas were observed within 150 000 bed volumes treated 2 min ebct breakthrough exceeded 50 within 180 000 bvs only for c4 c6 pfcas with similar breakthrough behavior observed for all three single use resins in comparison 90 breakthrough of all pfass was observed within 10 000 bvs for a860 while a520e experienced complete breakthrough of all pfcas within 75 000 bvs the difference in performance between single use and regenerable aer was less dramatic for short chain pfcas e g 50 pfba breakthrough was observed for all resins within 50 000 bvs cross comparison of the resins used in this study found that polystyrene aers both regenerable and single use substantially outperform polyacrylic aers as compounds like pfos were detected 100 times earlier after polyacrylic resin treatment compared to polystyrene resins with all other parameters identical adsorbate profiles obtained from spent resin extraction further validate the chain length dependent chromatographic breakthrough trends observed in the field pilot highlighting the role of competitive displacement in breakthrough behavior of pfas with lower resin affinity extraction of pfass from spent resins revealed that segments of resin located earlier in the column adsorb far greater total pfas masses than segments toward the end of the column at times even exceeding isotherm derived maximum exchange capacities this finding supports use of multiple smaller resin vessels in series to maximize uptake of long chain pfsas and increase total mass loading while minimizing competitive displacement of short chain pfcas in the lag vessels findings validate the predictive utility of batch derived ion exchange coefficients with empirical correlations being observed between these easily measured parameters fang et al 2021 and observed breakthrough behavior selecting the criteria for media changeout regeneration will heavily influence media usage rates murs although single use aers were found to outperform regenerable aers for treatment of most pfass sites subject to very stringent treatment criteria e g detection of any pfass may opt for regenerable aers since frequent replacement of resin would be cost prohibitive comparative analysis of life cycle environmental

15598,this study reports the results of an 8 month pilot study comparing both regenerable and emerging single use anion exchange resins aers for treatment of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass at a source zone impacted by historical use of aqueous film forming foam afff two regenerable purolite a860 and a520e and three single use purolite pfa694e calgon calres 2301 and dowex psr2 aers were tested in parallel collecting effluent samples after treatment for 30 sec and 2 min total empty bed contact time ebct results demonstrate that single use aers significantly outperform regenerable resins particularly for treatment of long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas no detectable concentrations of c7 pfcas or pfsas were observed within 150 000 bed volumes bvs after treatment with the single use resins 2 min ebct analysis of effluent samples following 30 sec ebct treatment shows that even the shortest chain pfsas do not reach 50 breakthrough within the first 350 000 bvs though differences in removal of short chain pfcas was less dramatic the regenerable polyacrylic a860 resin performed very poorly compared to all polystyrene resins with 90 breakthrough of all pfass occurring within 10 000 bvs the greater affinity of polystyrene resins is attributed to increased hydrophobic interactions in addition to electrostatic ion exchange analysis of breakthrough profiles reveals empirical correlation with ion exchange affinity coefficients logk ex measured in batch experiments postmortem analysis of pfass extracted from spent resins revealed chromatographic elution behavior and competition among pfass for adsorption to the resins pfsas and long chain pfcas were preferentially adsorbed to earlier sections in the aer columns whereas short chain pfcas were competitively displaced towards the later sections of the columns and into the effluent consistent with effluent concentrations of the latter structures exceeding influent values these results provide insights into the mechanisms that govern pfas adsorption to aers in real multisolute groundwater matrices and support findings from other diverse sites regarding pfas affinity elution behavior and competition for exchange sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas treatment ion exchange single use resin adsorbate distribution emerging contaminants separation technologies data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass has been documented on a global scale janousek et al 2019 although there are many sources of pfass including food packaging clothing and furniture coatings boronow et al 2019 the primary source of groundwater contamination is historical use of aqueous film forming foam afff to counter fuel fires schultz et al 2004 leeson et al 2020 since the 1940s afff has been routinely released as part of fire training exercises sunderland et al 2018 and large pfas plumes have been detected in groundwater supplies near fire training areas particularly near airports and military installations in recent years hu et al 2016 gobelius et al 2017 mussabek et al 2019 pfass pose major challenges for remediation due to their high stability mobility in aquifers and chemical recalcitrance to in situ treatment schemes common for groundwater remediation like in situ chemical oxidation vecitis et al 2009 thus treatment of groundwater pfas is most often accomplished by ex situ adsorption processes typically granular activated carbon gac kucharzyk et al 2017 while gac is a low cost media its performance is limited by rapid bed exhaustion a large requisite contact time and significant inhibition by groundwater co constituents like natural organic matter nom du et al 2014 kothawala et al 2017 this leads to high media usage rates necessitating frequent replacement and off site disposal or regeneration of large quantities of sorbent media rahman et al 2014 an alternative to gac anion exchange resins aers are receiving increased attention for pfas treatment conventional aers used in water treatment e g for nitrate are often regenerable using a concentrated salt brine e g 5 10 nacl to reverse the equilibrium and recover the resin s adsorption capacity however strong affinity between pfass and aers necessitates the addition of organic cosolvent to salt brines e g 70 methanol in nacl brine to regenerate resins boyer et al 2021 recently resin manufacturers have introduced aers with very high affinities for pfass that are operated as single use products designed to be disposed or incinerated upon exhaustion boodoo et al 2019 while this limits operational lifetimes for the resins it simplifies the treatment train by eliminating the need for aer regeneration and waste brine cosolvent management infrastructure furthermore the high selectivity of these resins for pfass coupled with the trace levels of pfass detected at most sites potentially allows for extended operation e g 1 year before media replacement while a growing number of studies report effective treatment of pfass using aers most reports are limited to batch adsorption and bench scale continuous flow studies carter and farrell 2010 zaggia et al 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 schaefer et al 2019 fang et al 2021 tests of single use pfas selective aers confirm their higher affinity for pfass especially long chain structures like pfos perfluorooctane sulfonate and pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid compared to conventional regenerable aers fang et al 2021 while single use aers share many of the same properties of some regenerable resins e g a polystyrene backbone and quaternary amine functional groups these sorbents benefit from the inclusion of longer chain hydrocarbon moieties within the cationic amine functional group that increase hydrophobicity near the active site of adsorption leading to greater sorbent affinity for pfass batch adsorption experiments have also shown that pfas adsorption to aers is less affected by nom than gac the presence of nom reduced gac adsorption capacity for pfass by up to 75 compared to only 10 for aers dixit et al 2021a kothawala et al 2017 while groundwater sources often have low nom levels 5 mg l these organic co constituents can compete for exchange sites particularly for humic acids that are ubiquitous in groundwater maimati et al 2018 dixit et al 2020a batch studies are supported by column treatment studies showing longer periods of time before pfas breakthrough for aers relative to gac zeng et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 two recent reports by liu et al 2019 under review tested gac and single use aers for treatment of a dilute pfas contaminated groundwater finding the aers to have greater adsorption capacity than gac single use aers treated 6 7 times more contaminated groundwater than gac on a sorbent mass normalized basis prior to pfas breakthrough however there are no reports comparing the effectiveness of regenerable and single use aers for extended treatment of real pfas contaminated groundwater nor have these aers been compared when treating highly concentrated source zones e g 10 μg l σpfas requiring remedial action finally prior pilot studies have not examined the effects of variable empty bed contact times ebcts which refer to the time one empty bed of water resides in the sorbent bed on aer efficacy this contribution describes the results of a field pilot study and subsequent sorbent analyses aimed at improving understanding of pfas removal by aers under continuous flow conditions five commercial aers both polystyrene and polyacrylic were compared for pfas treatment at an afff impacted source zone including two regenerable resins and three single use resins with a range of functional groups and porosities this system treated 180 000 bed volumes bvs with a combined ebct of two minutes for the first two media vessels in each column while 750 000 bvs were treated through the lead vessel 30 sec ebct in each column the goals of this field pilot were to evaluate 1 regenerable vs single use resin performance 2 the sorbent properties most important for pfas removal 3 the effects of ebct on pfas elution 4 identify structure reactivity patterns among pfass and relate individual pfas breakthrough behavior with batch derived adsorption parameters and 5 how to best optimize ion exchange system configuration the thomas model was fit to breakthrough data to provide objective quantification of breakthrough parameters for individual pfass on each resin postmortem analysis of the spent resins was performed to characterize adsorption zones for individual pfass along each sorbent column to obtain a deeper understanding of how competitive adsorption among target pfass influences sorbent capacity and analyte breakthrough breakthrough data and postmortem adsorbate profiles were used to identify important factors including site specific treatment criteria that will determine media usage rates murs across a range of diverse sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 field pilot design five resins were compared down selected from a larger group studied in batch systems fang et al 2021 these aers reflect the diversity of resin properties table 1 that are commonly used in removing organic anions as no aer used in this pilot shares the same porosity functional group polymer and regenerability while a major focus of the study was to compare regenerable and single use aers other assessments of resin properties were considered including polystyrene vs polyacrylic backbone and macroporous 20 100 nm pore size vs gel type resins 1 2 nm pore size maximum exchange capacities for chloride and maximum capacities for pfos adsorption measured in batch isotherms fang et al 2021 are also listed in table 1 all aers were obtained from manufacturers in the chloride form and were used as received although a860 was not found to be among the most effective resins in adsorbing pfass in previous batch equilibrium adsorption studies fang et al 2021 the polyacrylic resin was included in the study to compare with similar polystyrene resins a520e in particular shares the same porosity regenerability uniformity and particle size range as a860 this enabled assessment of the importance of polymer backbone in pfas adsorption from groundwater under field conditions and comparison of relative resin performance trends in batch versus continuous flow operation furthermore while our earlier batch adsorption data suggested poor performance of a860 other recent reports have indicated that the resin is effective in adsorbing pfass from groundwater dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021a the pilot study was conducted at a u s department of defense site located in the willow grove pa area where elevated groundwater pfas concentrations have been documented due to historical releases of afff leeson et al 2020 total detected sourcewater pfas concentrations ranged from 30 55 μg l more than 400 times greater than the epa s lifetime health advisory level of 70 ng l pfos pfoa combined goode and senior 2020 resin quantities in each vessel were designed to allow prolonged pfas loading while maintaining a vessel to particle diameter ratio 40 to prevent preferential flow paths due to walling effects tian et al 2016 the pilot system was outfitted with 24 individual vessels packed with resin arranged in eight parallel columns fig 1 each containing three vessels in series with sample ports before and after each vessel full pilot details are summarized in section sm 1 of the supplementary material sm for each column the first two vessels in series contained the same resin with the first vessel providing an ebct of 30 sec and the second providing an additional 90 sec ebct thus influent waters pass through the given resin for a total of 2 min ebct consistent with manufacturer recommendations for single use pfas selective resins boodoo et al 2019 while recommendations for some resins particularly regenerable aers are 3 5 min ebct the same ebcts were used for all resins to enable appropriate comparisons on a bed volume equivalent basis for three of the aers purolite a860 a520e and pfa694e duplicate columns were included to assess variability in breakthrough data duplicate columns were not included for calgon calres 2301 and dowex psr2 due to system flow constraints although a third vessel of aer with 1 3 min of additional ebct was included in the system design breakthrough of nearly all these vessels was excluded from analysis due to cost considerations and poor performance of the resin used in the third vessel of most columns purolite a860 analysis of effluent from the third vessel was conducted where a third segment of purolite a520e and a860 was added to provide 1 min additional ebct providing a 3 min total ebct consistent with manufacturer recommendations for this regenerable aer this also allowed us to compare breakthrough data for 0 5 2 and 3 min ebct for the same resin 2 2 pilot system operation operation of the pilot system was conducted over the course of 36 weeks july 2020 march 2021 with weekly samples collected from the influent and effluent of each resin vessel operation occurred continuously with minimal stoppages for maintenance e g the changeout of 10 μm pretreatment bag filters located upstream of the field pilot intake a total of 3600 ml min 0 95 gpm was drawn from a slipstream of a larger onsite treatment system and pumped through the resins providing each parallel column with 450 ml min 0 12 gpm of groundwater treated water was routed back into the feedwater of the larger onsite treatment system to comply with discharge permits flow control valves along with both analog and digital flowmeters were included in every column to maintain desired flows that were monitored using a labview national instruments remote interface 2 3 fitting of field pilot breakthrough curves breakthrough data for individual pfass were fit using the thomas model which yielded sigmoidal curves to more objectively estimate bvs treated before breakthrough this function was chosen from a larger list of nonlinear curve fits due to its documented utility and accuracy in fitting pfas adsorption breakthrough curves and its simplicity as a two parameter function that does not rely on extensive fitting factors grieco et al 2021 schaefer et al 2019 effluent c c0 values exceeding 1 0 were fixed at this value before least square fitting since the major goal was to identify bvs at which different thresholds for breakthrough e g 10 of influent concentrations or 70 ng l were reached rather than providing a prediction of the full breakthrough profile further details are provided in section 5 of the sm 2 4 postmortem characterization of pfas adsorption zones upon completion of the pilot study the vessels of used resin were transported from the site back to the colorado school of mines for postmortem analysis the first two vessels from each column were frozen and cross sectioned into five fractions before measuring the concentrations of adsorbed pfass in each section resin from each column fraction was completely mixed to ensure homogeneity before extraction extraction of adsorbed pfass from the resins was accomplished using a 90 9 1 wt methanol water ammonium chloride mixture three rounds of extraction 100 mg resin in 25 ml extract solution 24 h were performed before pooling extracts for analysis validation of this extraction procedure was conducted by recovering 95 of a known quantity of pfos the major pfas with the highest affinity for the resins fang et al 2021 that was pre loaded onto virgin resins 2 5 analytical methods pfass were analyzed using either a sciex x500r qtof high resolution mass spectrometer or a sciex 5500 qtrap triple quad mass spectrometer using an established method murray et al 2019 analytes were first separated on a phenomenex gemini c18 lc column 5 μm particle size 110 å pore size using fisher scientific optima lcms grade water methanol and isopropanol as eluents further method details are provided in section sm 2 analysis of select groundwater co constituents was also conducted at various timepoints throughout the study including total organic carbon toc major ions ph alkalinity and turbidity details in section sm 2 3 results 3 1 site and sourcewater characterization twelve pfass including the c4 c8 perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas c3 c8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas and the fluorotelomer acid 6 2 fts were consistently detected in the sourcewater above quantifiable limits table 2 collectively these analytes had a total pfas concentration ranging from 30 000 55 000 ng l pfos 22 500 ng l accounted for 57 of the total pfas as a subclass pfsas also dominated comprising 78 of total pfas mass whereas pfcas constituted 15 and 6 2 fts the remainder the predominance of pfsas is consistent with other afff impacted sites hu et al 2016 a small number of additional nontarget pfass mostly perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide precursors were detected using a suspect screening protocol mcdonough et al 2020a semi quantitative estimates of concentration for suspect analytes that were consistently detected ranged from 0 1 0 5 μg l representing less than 3 of the total detected pfass table 2 also includes water quality parameters and concentrations of important groundwater co constituents detected at the site including dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of non target anions were well below the levels expected to compete with pfass for available exchange sites and the doc range of 0 7 1 3 mg l is consistent with global median groundwater concentrations fang et al 2021 mcdonough et al 2020b additional details on pfas and co constituent concentrations are provided in section sm 3 3 2 pfas treatment with regenerable aers the pilot test included two regenerable aers a polyacrylic resin a860 and a polystyrene resin a520e the polyacrylic a860 performed very poorly at a 2 min ebct with all pfass being detected in effluent samples after just 960 bvs or 32 h of system operation and all pfaas reached 90 of influent concentrations within 10 000 bvs fig s4 1 thus further discussion of this resin s performance is limited fig 2a shows breakthrough curves for individual pfaas from effluent of the second vessel in each column 2 min total ebct for the regenerable polystyrene resin a520e and the three single use resins in fig 2b d pfa694e calres 2301 and psr2 to be discussed in section 3 3 for a520e fig 2a both short and long chain pfcas as well as 6 2 fts shown separately in fig s4 2 eluted through the column fully in 75 000 bvs whereas most pfsas did not fully elute even after treating 180 000 bvs short chain pfsas were first detected at 50 000 bvs with only pfprs and pfbs reaching complete breakthrough within 180 000 bvs by the end of the pilot test intermediate length pfsas pfpes and pfhxs reached 50 breakthrough but pfos the dominant pfas detected in the sourcewater reached only 4 breakthrough for pfass that fully broke through many samples showed effluent concentrations that exceeded influent concentrations sometimes reaching 170 of the influent values consistent with competitive displacement of lower affinity pfass by higher affinity structures like pfos as observed in prior studies mccleaf et al 2017 gao et al 2017 while complete breakthrough of many pfass was not be observed for 2 min ebct fig 2a more complete breakthrough was observed in effluent collected following 30 sec of ebct fig 3a where 700 000 bvs were treated during the pilot study results for a520e are generally consistent with observations for 2 min ebct with rapid elution of pfcas within the first 50 000 bvs however all pfsas were also detectable within 25 000 bvs pfprs the shortest chain pfsa first reaches 50 breakthrough by 114 000 bvs whereas pfos does not exceed 50 breakthrough until 650 000 bvs comparison of breakthrough data for individual analytes on a bed volume equivalent basis figures s4 14 s4 25 shows breakthrough of most pfass at lower bvs when monitoring effluent after 30 sec ebct than 2 min ebct particularly for pfsas this can be attributed to kinetic limitations and greater opportunities for preferential flow path development in the shorter bed depths murray et al 2021 still breakthrough data collected after the shorter ebct is valuable for revealing pfsa breakthrough that would not otherwise be observed within the pilot study timescale effluent data collected from a third segment of a520e figures s4 26 s4 37 that provided an additional 1 min ebct total of 3 min ebct was similar to results for 2 min ebct reinforcing the notion that data collected with 2 min ebct likely reflects results that would be observed when using the longer recommended ebcts for regenerable resins e g 3 5 min 3 3 pfas treatment with single use aers compared to the regenerable aers much longer bvs to breakthrough were observed for most pfass using the three single use resins figs 2b d 3b d pfa694e calres2301 and psr2 with a 2 min ebct 50 breakthrough within 180 000 bvs was only observed for c6 pfcas pfhpa is initially observed in the effluent at 25 of influent levels between 150 000 and 180 000 for all three resins and pfoa is initially observed in the effluent for psr2 after 160 000 bvs nearly all pfsas remained undetected with the single use resins throughout the pilot study though some short chain pfsas were detected at trace levels after 160 000 bvs at a 2 min ebct though there is considerable scatter in the sourcewater concentrations of 6 2 fts and the resulting breakthrough data fig s4 2 similar trends hold where single use resins show far more bvs to breakthrough than regenerable resins direct comparison of breakthrough data for individual pfass on different resins is provided in figures s4 2 s4 13 the lack of substantial breakthrough for most pfaas within 100 000 bvs using a 2 min ebct indicates that these single use aers are promising options for pfas treatment however the lack of actual breakthrough data precludes exact quantification of the extent to which these sorbents outperform regenerable aers instead data collected with 30 sec ebct fig 3 can provide some measure of comparison between resins while 50 breakthrough of short chain pfcas occurs within 100 000 bvs on all three single use resins 200 000 bvs is required for long chain pfcas in contrast to the 2 min ebct data both long and short chain pfsas are detected in the first 25 000 bvs for the single use resins at a 30 sec ebct though no compounds reach 10 of their influent concentrations until 150 000 bvs long chain compounds of regulatory concern like pfoa are better treated by all single use aers compared to the regenerable aers as pfoa does not reach 50 breakthrough on any single use resin until 300 000 bvs compared to 65 000 bvs with regenerable resins as seen in the case of regenerable resins pfsa breakthrough curves after single use aer treatment exhibit gradual breakthrough with long chain pfsas never reaching complete breakthrough by 700 000 bvs on any of the resins however aer removal of all pfass is superior for all three single use resins compared to a520e comparing single use breakthrough data between the 30 sec and 2 min ebcts for a520e figures s4 38 s4 49 reveals that the 30 sec ebct reasonably predicts 2 min breakthrough for pfcas but pfsas experience more rapid breakthrough at a 30 sec ebct indicating this contact time is inadequate for use in the field 3 4 treatment of nontarget pfass screening of suspect compounds in the sourcewater revealed four additional structures with semi quantitative estimates of concentration exceeding 100 ng l three of these four compounds were short chain fluoroalkane sulfonamides fasas with 5 carbon atoms which are uncharged at environmentally relevant ph nguyen et al 2020 extensive analysis of suspect breakthrough was precluded by the lack of internal standards needed for reliable quantitation though semi quantitative analysis showed that these structures fully broke through the aer beds within the first five weeks earlier than any of the pfaas see section sm 3 the fourth suspect compound h pfda is a c10 polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid where one fluorine on the fluoroalkyl chain has been replaced by hydrogen h pfda showed strong affinity for aers and was not detected in effluent samples from four aers analyzed throughout pilot system operation 3 5 postmortem analysis of resins after conclusion of the field pilot columns of used resin were cross sectioned and pfass were extracted from each segment to characterize the spatial distribution of adsorbed pfass along each column the first two of the five sections were derived from the initial 30 sec ebct vessel while the remaining three sections came from the second vessel in each channel that provided an additional 90 sec of ebct the resulting profiles are shown in fig 4 with each bar representing the spatial distribution of an individual pfas mass along the length of the aer column with flow proceeding from top to bottom the numbers at the top of each bar represent the percentage of total influent analyte mass that was retained by the resin over the course of the pilot i e the percentage of total sourcewater mass that did not break through consistent with the breakthrough data the adsorbed data show that the single use resins retained a much larger percentage of the sourcewater pfass than the regenerable a520e resin the retained masses of pfass were similar for all three single use resins for all resins a clear trend is apparent where pfass with higher affinity for a resin i e pfsas and long chain pfcas were more heavily concentrated in the early segments of each column whereas lower affinity compounds were primarily found in the latter segments conceptually this follows the chromatographic trends observed in the breakthrough data where the active adsorption zone of short chain pfcas has progressed further along the column by the conclusion of the study while higher affinity compounds remain concentrated in the earlier sections because nearly all the pfos mass is located in the early segments of each column whereas pfpea mainly exists in the latter segments it can be inferred that in the final days of pilot operation the majority of pfos uptake was occurring in the 30 sec ebct vessel while pfpea was primarily adsorbing in the latter segments of the second vessel additionally the absolute mass of lower affinity structures like pfpea is much higher in the latter sections e g 0 66 mg g of resin in section 5 vs 0 19 mg g in section 1 for calres 2301 consistent with an analyte that is being displaced from upstream sections by competitive adsorption of higher affinity compounds like pfos 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 analysis of pfas breakthrough behavior breakthrough of individual pfas analytes follows a chromatographic trend wherein short chain structures break through earlier than long chain homologues this phenomenon is due to the hydrophobic and van der waals forces that attract the hydrophobic nonpolar fluorocarbon tail of the pfas molecule to the hydrophobic components of the polymeric resin because overall molecular hydrophobicity increases with increasing length of the fluorocarbon tail pfas affinity for aers increases with increasing tail length leading to longer times before elution through the sorbent column boyer et al 2021 wang et al 2019 among structures with the same fluorocarbon chain length pfcas break through far earlier than pfsas indicating stronger attraction between the sulfonate head group of the pfsa and the cationic quaternary amine resin functional groups when compared to the carboxylate group of pfcas these functional groups located on the resin exchange sites attract pfas head groups via electrostatic exchange resulting in a combination of both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in aer adsorption of pfass in fact the shortest chain pfsas pfprs and pfbs are generally retained longer than the longest chain pfca pfoa surprisingly breakthrough of 6 2 fts a polyfluoroalkyl sulfonate was more similar to that observed for pfcas than even short chain pfsas demonstrating a critical effect of substitution at the α carbon position on resin affinity as expected nonionic fasa structures identified through suspect screening analysis were not effectively adsorbed by aers these trends of chain length dependent breakthrough chromatographic elution and the role of head groups are supported by existing literature mccleaf et al 2017 maimati et al 2018 wang et al 2019 with greater in depth explanation of pfas structure reactivity relationships and aer characteristic reactivity patterns available in our prior work fang et al 2021 from an operational perspective the most important distinction between these sorbents is the resins regenerability all three single use aers treat both pfcas and pfsas for many more bvs before breakthrough than either regenerable resin pfoa the pfca of primary interest to regulators is treated to non detect levels 0 1 ng l through 150 000 bvs with all single use resins 2 min ebct compared with only 31 000 bvs for the regenerable a520e and 1 000 bvs for a860 this disparity holds true for the pfsa class as well as every pfsa present in the sourcewater other than pfos is detected in a520e effluent samples within 61 000 bvs whereas long chain pfsas remain at non detect levels for 150 000 bvs with all three single use resins among the three single use resins pfas treatment performance is similar for all analytes after 2 min of ebct although some recent reports have indicated successful use of polyacrylic aers deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2021a findings from this study and recent laboratory investigations laura del moral et al 2020 dietz et al 2021 demonstrate the superiority of polystyrene aers the four polystyrene based resins removed pfsas through 40 000 bvs with complete pfos removal through 75 000 bvs whereas near immediate breakthrough was observed with the polyacrylic resin the success of a860 in prior studies might result from longer contact times e g 10 min and lengthy batch reactions that do not reflect treatment site conditions in the present study as well as the presence of elevated nom levels in the earlier bench scale studies because a860 has been found to remove nom better than polystyrene pfas selective resins dixit et al 2020 dixit et al 2021a the presence of higher nom levels may improve pfas adsorption by cooperative adsorption mechanisms the superiority of polystyrene based resins for pfas adsorption observed in the present study can be attributed to their greater hydrophobicity in comparison to polyacrylic based resins it is interesting to note the similar performance of three single use resins despite large differences in maximum pfos adsorption capacity measured in batch equilibrium experiments table 1 fang et al 2021 although the macroporous calres 2301 yielded a maximum batch adsorption capacity 4 times greater than either of the other two gel type single use resins breakthrough data for pfos was similar for all three resins thus other factors beyond maximum adsorption capacity control uptake and competition among pfass on these resins influent pfas concentrations is likely one such factor as other pilot scale treatment systems at lower concentration sites experienced complete pfas breakthrough after adsorption of significantly lower total pfas masses liu et al under review dixit et al 2021b other factors specific to individual aers including polymer exchange site density and functional group type have been known to play a major role in the adsorption and desorption of various pfass to aers fang et al 2021 deng et al 2010 4 2 breakthrough curve fitting using the thomas model measured pfas breakthrough data where sufficient breakthrough was observed before the pilot study ended was fit with the thomas model as shown for calres 2301 in fig 5 similar fits for other resins are provided in figures s5 1 s5 8 in the sm data for a860 was excluded since 50 breakthrough of all pfass was observed within one week of pilot operation the resulting fit derived parameters kth thomas model constant and qe resin capacity for individual sorbate uptake are listed in table s5 1 statistical variances of these fits are reasonable r2 0 9 for most analytes and sigmoid inflection points table 3 representing 50 breakthrough were obtained from these fits to serve as an objective reference point to compare various analytes breakthrough profiles fitting efforts focused on data from 30 sec ebct vessels because breakthrough was more complete within the 725 000 bvs of data collected enabling broader comparison among all pfass and resins while breakthrough was not observed for many pfaas using a 2 min ebct thomas model fits are provided in the sm for the few analytes that did breakthrough sufficiently during the pilot study although breakthrough data and model fits for 30 sec ebct are not expected to perfectly represent breakthrough when using a longer 2 min ebct it is worth noting that the model predictions of 50 breakthrough with 30 sec and 2 min ebct generally agreed for the few analytes that did experience sufficient breakthrough at a 2 min ebct to perform a model fit figure s5 9 compares the bvs at which 50 analyte breakthrough is predicted at both ebcts with the majority of analytes falling very near the 1 1 correlation line still the lack of pfsa breakthrough for single use aers at 2 min ebct during the pilot study prevents conclusions from being drawn for pfsas overall the general agreement between the two ebcts supports the use of the 30 sec data for thomas model fitting and breakthrough predictions the trends in 50 breakthrough values observed for individual pfaa resin combinations are generally consistent with trends in equilibrium ion exchange affinity constants measured in batch experiments fang et al 2021 fig 6 shows the relationship between the bvs at which breakthrough reaches 50 for different analytes table 3 and the pfas cl exchange coefficients logk ex measured for the same analyte aer combinations in batch adsorption experiments corresponding linear correlation fits for individual resins provided in figures s6 1 s6 5 these empirical correlations particularly strong for the single use aers suggest that field performance of new resins under development may be roughly estimated from batch adsorption experiments for the new resin in tandem with pilot breakthrough data already collected for existing resins where these correlations have been observed while such predictions need further validation this suggests an approach that could be used to rapidly screen and downselect new adsorbents before investing in more costly and lengthy pilot studies at a contaminated site to enable direct comparison of different aers fig 7 shows pairwise scatterplots comparing the fit derived 50 breakthrough bvs 30 sec ebct for individual analytes on each of the four polystyrene based resins the plots reinforce the superiority of all three single use aers compared to the regenerable a520e further we see that all pfsas reach their 50 breakthrough point earlier for psr2 than either pfa694e or calres 2301 while these trends are consistent for all pfsa structures the 30 sec ebct does not reflect treatment conditions in full scale systems where 2 3 min ebct is recommended thereby precluding a definitive determination of a singular optimal resin while psr2 appears to be the least effective single use aer in treating pfsas at a 30 sec ebct this resin actually shows superior treatment of short chain pfcas pfba pfpea and pfhxa when using a 2 min ebct figure 2 and s4 2 4 4 thus while selection of an optimal single use resin will depend on the breakthrough criteria that dictates resin changeout the collective data supports a conclusion that all three single use resins will be highly effective in pfas treatment 4 3 media usage rates breakthrough data and the thomas model fit derived parameters can be used to predict bvs at which different thresholds for media changeout regeneration are met e g when 10 pfos breakthrough occurs the bottom portion of table 3 summarizes bvs where different thresholds are reached including bvs treated by each resin before detection of criteria are met including detection of any pfass and detection of ucmr3 structures since these are common treatment criteria at some sites in these situations the values were derived from the raw breakthrough data observed with 2 min ebct predicting the bvs at which media replacement will be required can be directly used to calculate expected media usage rates murs for the single use aers using a changeout criteria of detection of any pfass in effluent at a site similar in concentration to this study would likely necessitate frequent vessel changeout 20 000 bvs since pfba is detectable within 21 000 bvs for all resins however sites only concerned with compounds listed under the epa s ucmr3 could treat pfas impacted waters for well over 100 000 bvs prior to detection using any of the single use resins this disparity is even more pronounced in cases where only pfsas or long chain structures are of concern for all three single use resins none of the pfsas reach 50 breakthrough before 325 000 bvs thus media replacement regeneration criteria will have a significant effect on murs although single use aers treat most pfass much longer than regenerable aers when using 50 breakthrough as the changeout regeneration criteria differences are not so large when changeout regeneration criteria is the detection of any pfass the superiority of single use aers is most pronounced for long chain pfcas and short chain pfsas using detection of ucmr3 structures as the changeout criteria is one scenario where single use resins substantially outperform regenerable aers with estimates that 7 times more water can be treated using single use resins than either of the regenerable resins this trend indicates that emphasizing more highly selected for pfass e g pfsas long chains leads to larger disparities between single use and regenerable aers finally it is worth noting that pfas concentrations mixture composition and groundwater geochemistry at given site can significantly influence breakthrough and murs this pilot test was performed at a source zone with elevated pfas concentrations i e 10 μg l and media replacement at such a site can be expected to be quite different from sites where pfas concentrations are much lower 4 4 adsorption zone identification postmortem analysis of the spatial distribution of adsorbed pfass on the resins provided a snapshot of the active adsorption zone for each analyte at the time the pilot study was completed these data reinforce the trends seen in the breakthrough data indicating long chain structures and pfsas have higher affinity for all aers than short chain structures and pfcas respectively this suggests that not only does the increased hydrophobic character of pfass with longer fluorocarbon tails lead to greater resin affinity but also that pfass with shorter tails are more easily displaced from resins due to the lower hydrophobic attraction between the target analytes and the hydrophobic resin polymer while chromatographic elution of pfas analytes is well established these adsorbate distribution profiles underscore the importance that competitive displacement mechanisms play in the breakthrough behavior of individual pfass when treating pfas mixtures in afff impacted water sources comparison of the total pfas mass found on each section shows that the total adsorbed mass decreases substantially along the length of the column on a molar basis the total pfas mass adsorbed in the first section of each single use resin is 15 fold higher than that adsorbed in last section in fact the masses extracted from section 1 exceed isotherm derived pfos capacities for calres 2301 and pfa694e possible explanations for this include size exclusion where lower molecular weight pfass may access more internal exchange sites than pfos or potential bilayer micellar formation on the surface of the aer beads that enables hydrophobic uptake beyond the electrostatic exchange capacity potential for bilayer and micellar formation has been documented for pfass adsorbing onto charged surfaces including aers dixit et al 2021b xiao et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 as well as for hemi micelle aggregation on nom macromolecules gagliano et al 2020 4 5 implications for full scale treatment operations the enhanced mass uptake in earlier sections of the column identified in the postmortem resin analyses is that sites with stringent treatment objectives may potentially reduce murs by arranging multiple sorbent vessels in series e g lead lag 1 lag 2 and operating the lead vessel to greater degrees of breakthrough before media changeout such a configuration would enable operators to replace resin with high pfas loading in the lead vessel while continuing to facilitate adsorption in the lag vessels containing resin that would otherwise be replaced during changeout of a single vessel given that the extract profiles of the spent aers imply that the earliest sections of the column have higher sorbed pfas masses than the later sections it would be expected that lengthier operation of a lead vessel would result in a greater overall pfas uptake per mass of resin and ultimately lower murs total system ebct is recommended to be 2 minutes as shorter ebcts e g 30 sec experienced more rapid detection of numerous pfas analytes this may be accomplished by multiple vessels with shorter individual ebcts thereby enabling a lead lag configuration that can achieve a total of 2 3 minutes of contact results from this field pilot study also inform operators as to how to best select resins for treatment of pfas mixtures polystyrene resins are strongly recommended due to their increased hydrophobic character while single use resins provide even greater uptake of pfass due to the specialized functional groups containing quaternary amines with long hydrocarbon chains furthering the strong hydrophobic attraction to the adsorbent however selection of an optimal resin for remediation will ultimately depend on criteria used to determine the compounds of regulatory concern and their relative concentrations in the pfas mixture sites predominated by long chain pfass would benefit from use of high capacity single use aers while sites concerned with short chain pfass may opt for regenerable resins that experience breakthrough of pfba and pfpea at similar times to single use aers pilot scale testing of aers using site sourcewater is recommended which may be paired with the correlations identified in this study to approximate expected breakthrough times for more slowly eluting compounds like pfos 5 conclusion this study compared the efficacy of regenerable and single use aers for treatment of pfas contaminated groundwater at an afff impacted source zone moreover treatment was compared at different ebcts and postmortem analysis of resins provided spatial characterization of the active zones of adsorption occurring at the time the pilot study was ended the following conclusions can be made single use resins outperform regenerable resins with the difference being greatest for long chain pfcas and pfsas as these analytes were removed by single use aers for up to 8 times the volume of water before breakthrough compared to regenerable aers for single use resins no detectable 0 1 ng l concentrations of c7 pfcas or any pfsas were observed within 150 000 bed volumes treated 2 min ebct breakthrough exceeded 50 within 180 000 bvs only for c4 c6 pfcas with similar breakthrough behavior observed for all three single use resins in comparison 90 breakthrough of all pfass was observed within 10 000 bvs for a860 while a520e experienced complete breakthrough of all pfcas within 75 000 bvs the difference in performance between single use and regenerable aer was less dramatic for short chain pfcas e g 50 pfba breakthrough was observed for all resins within 50 000 bvs cross comparison of the resins used in this study found that polystyrene aers both regenerable and single use substantially outperform polyacrylic aers as compounds like pfos were detected 100 times earlier after polyacrylic resin treatment compared to polystyrene resins with all other parameters identical adsorbate profiles obtained from spent resin extraction further validate the chain length dependent chromatographic breakthrough trends observed in the field pilot highlighting the role of competitive displacement in breakthrough behavior of pfas with lower resin affinity extraction of pfass from spent resins revealed that segments of resin located earlier in the column adsorb far greater total pfas masses than segments toward the end of the column at times even exceeding isotherm derived maximum exchange capacities this finding supports use of multiple smaller resin vessels in series to maximize uptake of long chain pfsas and increase total mass loading while minimizing competitive displacement of short chain pfcas in the lag vessels findings validate the predictive utility of batch derived ion exchange coefficients with empirical correlations being observed between these easily measured parameters fang et al 2021 and observed breakthrough behavior selecting the criteria for media changeout regeneration will heavily influence media usage rates murs although single use aers were found to outperform regenerable aers for treatment of most pfass sites subject to very stringent treatment criteria e g detection of any pfass may opt for regenerable aers since frequent replacement of resin would be cost prohibitive comparative analysis of life cycle environmental

15599,engineered short chain single stranded dna ssdna are emerging materials with various environmental applications such as aptasensor selective adsorbent and hydrological tracer however the lack of fundamental understanding on the interactions of such materials with natural organic matter nom hinders the improvement of their application performance in terms of sensitivity selectivity and stability in this study we investigated the interactions of ssdna four strands with systematically varied length and sequence with two humic acids suwannee river humic acid srha and aldrich humic acid aha and two humic like nom present in local aquatic matrices rom in river water and wom in wastewater detailed molecular level interaction mechanisms were obtained by probing the colloidal stability of the ssdna coated gold nanoparticles coupled with product characterization using a suite of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques our study revealed that π π interactions and divalent cation bridging were the major mechanisms for ssdna nom interactions ssdna preferentially interacted with nom with high aromaticity aha srha wom rom with divalent cations present especially ca2 even a small amount of aha could completely shield ssdna whereas the extent of shielding by srha wom rom depended on the relative content of ssdna and nom and whether bridges formed the extent of shielding of ssdna by nom provides a potential answer to the reported conflicting effects of natural water matrices on the performance of dna based sensors taken together our findings provide insights into the transformations of engineered ssdna under environmentally relevant conditions as well as implications for their performance optimization in practical aquatic applications e g from dna design to pretreatment strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dna natural organic matter adsorption aromaticity divalent cation bridging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction engineered dna strands with desired sequences and a wide range of useful modifications such as fluorescent tags and linkage molecules can now be synthesized purchased at low and decreasing costs the dna consists of nucleotides in a specific order and each nucleotide contains a deoxyribose sugar a phosphate group and one of the four nitrogenous bases namely adenine a thymine t cytosine c and guanine g they are unique from other synthetic polymers due to their intrinsic functions or embedded information for example a short chain single stranded dna ssdna aptamer binds targets with high sensitivity and selectivity being very promising for rapid point of use multiplex environmental sensing of organic contaminants akki et al 2015 fan et al 2014 ions qing et al 2017 and pathogens yu et al 2018 etc aptasensors have the potential to rival some state of the art chemical biological analytical methods also dna aptamer has been demonstrated as a highly selective adsorbent to remove arsenic kim et al 2009 and illicit pharmaceuticals hu et al 2011 engineered dna with programmed information i e the sequence of nucleotides can also be used as a tracer to track the source and migration pathways of pollutants in hydrological environment investigations liao et al 2018 the number of dna tracer is theoretically unlimited i e the combination of four nucleobases and the unique sequence of each dna tracer makes it easily distinguishable from environmental background and allows for multipoint tracing while the potential of engineered dna in aquatic applications has been well recognized as described above little is known about the interactions of engineered dna with natural organic matter nom in typical aquatic environments natural organic matter including humic substances proteins polysaccharides etc is ubiquitous in the environment philippe and schaumann 2014 and their interactions with engineered dna interfere the performance of dna based applications for aptasensors a positive correlation between nom concentration 0 3 6 mg c l and the extent of performance degradation has been observed vogiazi et al 2021 however higher nom concentrations from 4 to 16 mg c l were also reported to exert no significant influence on the performance akki et al 2015 park et al 2022 among various types of aptasensor colorimetric aptasensors typically involve the use of dna coated gold nanoparticles au nps the au nps are stabilized by the dna coating in the presence of high concentration salts and the introduction of the target triggers preferential binding of dna aptamer and causes the aggregation of au nps such systems are dependent on salt induced aggregation and susceptible to interference from matrices e g nom or other constituents akki and werth 2018 for example low recovery of target was observed when the target was doped in milk samples yan et al 2017 other than aptasensors nom can also impact the functionality of dna tracers adsorption of dna tracers to nom can lead to low recovery and unprecise detection liao et al 2018 pang et al 2020 these reports highlight the need to elucidate the interaction s between engineered dna and nom and also the associated change of nanoparticle aggregation behaviors which will benefit the development of dna based applications in more realistic scenarios previous studies investigating the interactions between dna and nom have been mostly conducted with natural dsdna with a long chain thousands of base pairs lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 qin et al 2018 for example divalent cations formed bridges between the phosphate groups of dna and the carboxyl groups of nom while monovalent cations only screened the negative charges nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 however variations in dna properties e g double stranded or single stranded length and sequence may increase the complexity of their interactions with nom smaller dna fragments 2 69 kbp were reported to have preferential adsorption to soil compared to larger fragments 11 19 and 23 kbp due to their faster diffusion rates and or the size exclusion of available binding sites ogram et al 1994 the phosphate groups of dsdna were deemed as the major interaction sites with nom lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 while the exposed nucleobases of ssdna also participated in the interaction with graphene oxide he et al 2010 liu et al 2020 the preferential interaction of cations with guanine bases in the ssdna affected the ion distribution along the dna strands resulting in varied dna layer thickness and drastically different colloidal stability of the coated particles peng et al 2022 little attention has been paid to engineered short chain ssdna e g 100 nucleobases the typical length of a dna aptamer zhou et al 2010 which behaves distinctively from natural dsdna in aquatic systems as such there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the interactions of short chain ssdna with nom which expectedly have profound implications for the rational design of engineered dna for aquatic applications such as dna based sensor adsorbent and dna tracer among other emerging applications in this study we investigated the interaction s between ssdna and nom by examining the impact of nom on the colloidal stability

fluorescence and tem following our earlier work peng et al 2022 ssdna coated gold nanoparticles dna au nps with four different ssdna coatings systematically varied in length and sequence were studied two humic acids suwannee river humic acid srha an aquatic humic substance and aldrich humic acid aha a terrestrial humic substance hur and schlautman 2003 along with two humic like nom from local water matrices in hong kong river water and wastewater effluent were studied as the representative nom our study revealed the dependence of ssdna nom interaction on the aromaticity of nom and the cation bridging effect especially ca2 a strong interaction could result in a complete shielding of the ssdna by nom potentially sabotaging the functionality of ssdna e g the specific binding of aptamer to target and the hybridization of dna barcode our findings provide new insights into the functioning of engineered ssdna in complex aquatic matrices and directions to optimize the general

evaluate the effect of dna sequence peng et al 2022 suwannee river humic acid srha was purchased from international humic substances society ihss standard iii and aldrich humic acid aha was purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 synthesis of dna au nps dna au nps were synthesized using the salt aging method liu and liu 2017 mirkin et al 1996 and the detailed procedure has been provided previously peng et al 2022 briefly the ssdna and au np suspension were incubated with stepwise addition of nacl solution 2 m to increase the salt concentration to 0 1 m excess reagents were removed by centrifugation three times the dna au nps were redispersed in deionized water and stored at 4 c until use 2 3 preparation of nom solutions srha and aha stock solutions were prepared by dissolving humic substances in milliq water under ph 10 5 and subsequently filtering the mixture using a 0 45 μm membrane filter the chemical characteristics of srha and aha were assessed by uv vis spectroscopy biochrom libra s35

compositions of srha and aha retrieved from previous works are summarized in table s1 2 4 aggregation kinetics of dna au nps in the presence of nom and electrolytes aggregation kinetics of dna au nps

organic matter in river water and wastewater denoted as rom and wom respectively were characterized by fluorescence and raman spectroscopies initial aggregation kinetics 30 min of dna au nps in river

was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of dna au nps and nom dna strands were thiol modified at their 3 end and attached to the particle surface via au s covalent bonds forming a densely packed dna layer mirkin et al 1996 fig 1 four dna strands with systematically varied sequences and lengths were used to synthesize dna au nps denoted as dna15 au dna25 au dna25c au and dna40 au respectively such design aimed at singling out the effect of dna length i e dna15 dna25 and dna40 and the effect of dna sequence i e dna25 and dna25c on their interactions with nom detailed characterization of these particles has been reported in our earlier work peng et al 2022 the hydrodynamic sizes of the four dna au nps were 35 4 1 5 nm of dna40 au 33 1 0 5 nm of dna25c au 31 2 1 7 nm of dna25 au and 30 8 1 5 nm dna15 au respectively fig 2 a presents the uv vis spectra of srha and aha 2 7 mg c l in water aha had higher absorbance than srha in both the uv and visible light wavelength ranges absorbance at 254 nm is characteristic of aromatic regions korshin et al 2009 whereas absorbance at 280 nm is positively correlated to molecular weight chin et al 1994 the observed higher absorbance of aha at 280 nm was consistent with the reported more high molecular weight portion 100 kda in aha than srha ca 20 for aha vs 5 for srha kim et al 2006 due to different humification environments srha is typically comprised of relatively small and polar moieties while aha has more nonpolar and aromatic contents grasso et al 1990 hong and elimelech 1997 the suva254 of srha and aha were calculated to be 6 2 0 1 and 9 0 0 1 respectively suggesting a higher aromatic content of aha abbt braun et al 2004 and being in agreement with our previously reported values jiang et al 2017 the eems of srha and aha showed a similar excitation maximum at around 330 nm and srha showed an obvious emission peak at around 460 nm while aha had a broad emission peak from 450 to 550 nm fig 2c d the excitation emission wavelengths are representative of humic like peak c fluorophore coble 1996 emission scan at 330 nm excitation confirmed the emission peak of aha at around 520 nm fig 2b a blue shifted emission maximum of srha indicates a decrease in the π electron system such as a lower number of aromatic rings coble 1996 consistent with the lower aromaticity as suggested by the smaller suva254 value of srha also it has been suggested that long emission wavelengths 500 nm could be attributed to the presence of greatly conjugated systems such as linearly condensed aromatic rings and other unsaturated bond systems rodríguez et al 2014 sierra et al 2005 in accordance with the higher aromaticity of aha as suggested by a larger suva254 value 3 2 aggregation kinetics of dna au nps in the presence of nom the aggregation kinetics of dna au nps in the presence of srha or aha were investigated in nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes respectively distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes of dna au nps were observed fig s1 the ccc values were determined as the intersections of the extrapolated lines of these two regimes and compared in fig 3 the ccc values of dna au nps without nom were retrieved from our previous work peng et al 2022 the presence of srha increased the ccc values of dna15 au from 451 mm to 489 mm nacl from 2 2 mm to 3 mm mgcl2 and from 2 2 mm to 2 7 mm cacl2 respectively fig 3 similar enhanced colloidal stability was observed for the other three dna au nps regardless of the dna sequence and length the enhancement of colloidal stability by the presence of nom has been extensively reported jiang et al 2017 loosli et al 2013 nason et al 2012 and such effect was attributed to the enhanced electro steric repulsion imparted by adsorbed nom chen and elimelech 2007 the epms of srha adsorbed dna au nps were either less negative in nacl electrolyte or similar in mgcl2 or cacl2 electrolyte to the bare dna au nps text s2 and fig s3 indicating that the enhanced colloidal stability mainly arose from stronger steric repulsion the order of stability among the four dna au nps with the presence of srha was the same as that without srha peng et al 2022 i e 1 in nacl electrolyte dna40 au dna25c au dna25 au dna15 au and 2 in mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes dna25c au dna40 au dna25 au dna15 au unlike srha the presence of aha significantly changed the stability of dna au nps and the effect showed a strong dependency on the co existing cations in nacl electrolyte the presence of aha lowered the ccc values of all four dna au nps fig 3a for example the ccc value of dna25c au decreased significantly from 2030 mm to 623 mm nacl although the colloidal stability of dna au nps was reduced by the presence of aha the order of stability did not change compared to that without aha present i e dna40 au dna25c au dna25 au dna15 au in divalent electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 interestingly the presence of aha brought the stability of dna au nps to a similar level i e similar cccs fig 3b c regardless of the original ssdna coatings which was completely different from the effect of srha the ccc values of dna au nps with aha present were ca 6 mm cacl2 and ca 10 mm mgcl2 with the exception of dna15 au in mgcl2 electrolyte 6 8 mm in either electrolyte the similar epms of dna au nps with or without the presence of aha fig s3 indicated that mechanism s other than electrostatic interactions should be accounted for inducing such change in colloidal stability 3 3 mechanisms underlying the distinct effects of nom on particle stability 3 3 1 adsorption of nom onto dna au nps the interaction between dna au nps and nom srha aha was first probed by fluorescence spectroscopy text s3 and fig s4 6 due to fluorescence quenching of au nps liu and liu 2017 the fluorescence intensity of nom was lowered after adsorption figs s4a and e s5a and e and s6 stronger quenching of the aha fluorescence by dna au nps was observed compared to srha fig s6 suggesting a stronger interaction i e adsorption between aha and the ssdna coating for example by calculating the intensity change at emission maximum 460 nm for srha and 520 nm for aha excitation wavelength 330 nm the peak intensity of srha was reduced by 8 while that of aha was reduced by 24 when additional salts nacl mgcl2 cacl2 were introduced the fluorescence intensity of aha was further decreased while the emission peak intensity of srha barely changed text s3 and fig s4 6 both nom and dna au nps were negatively charged therefore the adsorption of nom should be attributed to interactions other than electrostatic attraction such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions π π interactions cation bridging etc philippe and schaumann 2014 to understand the nom dna interaction mechanism s we first examined the ftir spectra of nom adsorbed dna au nps in cacl2 nacl electrolytes respectively the adsorption of nom in cacl2 electrolyte induced a spectral change at ca 1580 cm 1 fig 4 a and c and the extent of which is more pronounced in the spectra of aha adsorbed ones and proportional to the adsorbed amount aha au 1 1 the results suggested that the ssdna coating interacted more strongly with aha than srha consistent with the aforementioned fluorescence study due to the strong overlap of absorption in the ir spectra of the four nucleobases alex and dupuis 1989 tsuboi 1970 correlating the interaction between srha aha and a specific nucleobase was difficult nevertheless an attenuation of the peak at 1466 cm 1 after nom adsorption which symbolizes the in plane vibrations of the nucleobases e g nh and ch in the ring structures tsuboi 1970 molecular structures shown in fig 1 was observed in both electrolytes cacl2 and nacl fig 4a c and e implying that the ssdna nom interactions could have occurred through π π interactions furthermore we observed attenuated peaks at 1730 cm 1 co stretching of nucleobases guanine thymine and cytosine fig 1 1277 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of phosphate and 1073 cm 1 symmetric stretching of phosphate alex and dupuis 1989 tsuboi 1970 which may stem from the binding of cations and or hydrogen bonding park et al 2013 between nom and the ssdna coating these interaction sites i e co of nucleobases and phosphate groups indicated by the ftir results were consistent with our previous work peng et al 2022 in which we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction between ca2 and dna strands to further probe the interactions we used urea and sds to induce possible desorption of nom from dna au nps in nacl electrolyte excluding cation bridging urea breaks hydrogen bonds liu et al 2020 and sds breaks both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions schmid et al 2017 while π π interactions are not disturbed as shown in fig 4g urea induced the desorption of aha from dna au nps and the effect of which was more pronounced at higher urea concentration 6 m ca 10 aha desorbed sds also induced the desorption of aha ca 14 aha desorbed with 10 sds these results suggest that hydrogen bonding and or hydrophobic interactions contributed to the adsorption of aha onto dna au nps however a quantitative distribution of each aha adsorption mechanism cannot be achieved overall less than 15 of aha were desorbed even at 6 m urea or 10 sds condition suggesting that π π interaction was the major mechanism responsible for aha adsorption on the other hand desorption of srha induced by urea or sds was not observed fig 4h indicating that π π interaction was likely the only mechanism responsible for srha adsorption therefore the exposed nucleobases of ssdna played a significant role in its interaction with nom via π π interactions the stronger adsorption of aha than srha onto dna au nps was due to its higher aromaticity indicated by the aromatic carbon content table s1 and suva254 and capability to form hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions with the ssdna coating raman spectra revealed more details of the interaction between nom and the ssdna the adsorption of aha in cacl2 electrolyte completely shielded the characteristic peaks of adenine 734 cm 1 and nucleobases 1250 1500 cm 1 alex and dupuis 1989 otto et al 1986 fig 4b the spectra of aha adsorbed dna au nps became the same as that of pure aha even at a low carbon to gold ratio aha au 1 10 on the other hand the characteristic peaks of adenine and nucleobases after srha adsorption remained in the spectra albeit attenuated fig 4d with more srha adsorbed srha au increased from 1 10 to 1 1 the peak of adenine became weaker and the peaks from srha e g 1190 and 1517 cm 1 became apparent similar pattern was observed for the nom adsorbed dna25c au nps in cacl2 electrolyte as well fig s7 likely due to that the minor differences in dna25 and dna25c did not significantly impact their interactions with nom in nacl electrolyte neither srha nor aha was able to completely shield the original ssdna coating as suggested by the remaining peaks of adenine and nucleobases after adsorption fig 4f the relatively weaker peaks of adenine and nucleobases in the spectrum of aha adsorbed dna25 au compared to the srha adsorbed one was in line with the stronger interaction between aha and the ssdna coating the lack of complete shielding by adsorbed aha in nacl electrolyte suggested that divalent cation bridging between the phosphate groups of dna and the carboxyl groups of nom lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 also played a significant role in the adsorption process of aha in cacl2 electrolyte 3 3 2 intermolecular interactions of nom aggregation of au nps shortens their interparticle distance and causes the suspension color to change from red to purple storhoff et al 2000 such color change was observed for the aggregated dna au nps without nom present or with srha present in all three electrolytes fig 5c inset and s8b c however the colors of aggregated dna au nps with aha present were reddish purple fig 5a inset and showed a dependency on the presence of cations fig s8d e from na mg2 to ca2 the color of the suspensions gradually transitioned from purple to magenta suggesting increased interparticle distance of the aggregated au nps more details regarding the colors of aggregated dna au nps are given in text s4 to elucidate the underlying mechanism s causing the discrepancy in color change we examined the structure of aggregated dna25 au with nom present via tem and eds elemental mapping in the presence of both ca2 and aha we observed light shadowy areas bridging dna au nps fig 5a and s9a c such bridging areas were also observed in the haadf images fig 5b the corresponding eds elemental mapping showed that the elemental distribution of p from dna backbone and s from thiol group in dna fig 1 matched well with that of au suggesting that the dna strands were on au nps the elemental distribution of n and o highly overlapped with the bridging areas fig 5b insets especially the o distribution indicating the areas were indeed aha molecules the intermolecular bridging of aha molecules both adsorbed and unadsorbed likely occurred via calcium complexation chen and elimelech 2007 liu et al 2011 schwyzer et al 2013 on the contrary the intermolecular bridging of srha molecules was hardly observed figs 5c d and s10a c and the aggregate structure was similar to the aggregated dna au nps without nom present fig s11 the interparticle distance observed with aha present was apparently larger than the other two scenarios with srha or without nom in agreement with the magenta color of the aggregate suspension fig 5a inset the aggregated particles with srha present or without nom were closely packed in line with the purple colors of their aggregate suspensions fig 5c inset similar bridging of the aha molecules by mg2 was observed fig s9d f but to a less extent and only occurred at high concentrations e g 20 mm mg2 text s5 and fig s12 13 in agreement with the intermediate reddish purple color of aggregate suspension fig s8e such discrepancy in the effect of mg2 and ca2 stemmed from the weaker electronegativity and larger hydrated radius of mg2 stankus et al 2011 interestingly although the bridging effect was not expected in nacl electrolyte because na only screens the negative charges similar light shadowy areas linking aggregated particles was observed with the presence of aha fig s9g l but not with srha fig s10d f such intermolecular interactions of aha molecules are speculated to occur through π π interaction due to their high aromaticity ghosh et al 2008 nason et al 2012 the bridging of nom molecules by divalent cations has been widely reported chen and elimelech 2007 ghosh et al 2008 huynh and chen 2011 liu et al 2011 nason et al 2012 stankus et al 2011 and the carboxyl groups have been recognized as the binding sites for cations although the carboxyl group density was found to be positively related to the bridging effectiveness lu et al 2012 it does not seem to be the only parameter determining the bridging effect for example the bridging of srha standard ii which has 15 carboxyl carbon table s1 has been reported chen and elimelech 2007 huynh and chen 2011 liu et al 2011 but the bridging of srha standard i with a higher carboxyl content 19 carboxyl carbon table s1 was not observed huangfu et al 2013 other parameters such as the position of carboxyl groups in the polymer chain labille et al 2005 might also need to be taken into consideration in our study the bridging mediated by divalent cations was only observed with aha but not srha which was consistent with the aggregation profile of pure srha aha in the electrolytes fig s2 only in cacl2 electrolyte of a high concentration 50 mm the srha molecules formed clusters that can be steadily detected by the dls instrument fig s2d while the aggregation of aha molecules was observed in both cacl2 and mgcl2 electrolytes fig s2b c the higher carboxyl content of aha than srha standard iii used in this study table s1 may partially contribute to the observed phenomenon more efforts are required to reveal the underlying mechanism of such divalent cation bridging in future 3 3 3 proposed interaction mechanisms the adsorption of nom to ssdna and subsequent impact on the colloidal stability of dna au nps in simple electrolytes showed a dependency on both the properties of nom and cations fig 6 in divalent electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 the adsorbed aha molecules completely shielded the original ssdna coating which was facilitated mainly by both π π interaction and divalent cation bridging the aha coating determined the stability of the coated nanoparticles which explained the similar ccc values of the four aha adsorbed dna au nps in divalent electrolytes fig 3b c on the contrary the adsorption of aha in nacl electrolyte did not completely shield the original ssdna coating as such the original ssdna coating still played a role in the colloidal stability explaining the same order of stability as the bare dna au nps fig 3a the order of stability for the four bare dna au nps was determined by ssdna coating thickness which was influenced by the coating properties dna strand length sequence and loading and cations preferential interaction with guanine base as discussed in our previous work peng et al 2022 the intermolecular attractions from the adsorbed aha molecules led to the reduced colloidal stability lower ccc values the adsorption of srha onto dna au nps was limited largely due to the relatively weak π π interactions between srha and ssdna furthermore the stabilization of dna au nps by adsorbed srha was only observed in high srha concentration 100 mg c l in cacl2 electrolyte but not in mgcl2 electrolyte text s5 and fig s12 suggesting that ca2 bridged the ssdna with srha while mg2 did not and the bridging effect was relatively weaker compared to that with aha as a result the adsorption of srha did not completely shield the original ssdna coating in all three electrolytes the original ssdna coating determined the particle stability explaining the same order of colloidal stability of the four srha adsorbed dna au nps as the bare dna au nps fig 3 the limited intermolecular interaction of srha molecules and the extra steric repulsion provided by the adsorbed srha molecules collectively contributed to the minor increase of ccc values 3 4 interaction of ssdna with nom in real water samples 3 4 1 interaction with the real water organic matter the wastewater effluent and river water characteristics are summarized in table s2 the high ionic strength of the wastewater effluent conductivity 13360 μs cm saline wastewater a unique feature in hong kong due to seawater toilet flushing especially high concentration of divalent cations 10 mm mg2 and 2 9 mm ca2 induced the rapid aggregation of both dna25 au and dna25c au in the 30 min kinetics study fig 7 a b more details in text s6 a slower aggregation of dna25c au was observed due to the guanine rich sequence of dna25c peng et al 2022 on the contrary the stability of dna25 au and dna25c au did not differ in the 21 day study fig 7c and s14a with approximately 20 of the particles remained suspended after 21 days this discrepancy in the 30 min 21 day studies was due to the varied overcoating of wastewater organic matter wom toc 7 0 mg c l onto the dna au nps the fluorescence analysis of wom revealed their humic like nature a maximum fluorescence of peak c fig s15a and slightly lower aromaticity than srha fig s15c coble 1996 rodríguez et al 2014 different dosing of dna au nps in the 30 min 5 mg au l and the 21 day 0 5 mg au l studies resulted in different carbon to gold or carbon to dna mass ratios wom au 1 4 and 14 respectively wom dna 140 and 1400 respectively which impacted the amount of adsorbed wom the raman spectra of wom adsorbed dna au nps confirmed that more wom were adsorbed at higher wom au ratio fig 7e the peak of adenine 734 cm 1 disappeared and wom peaks became apparent e g 942 and 1003 cm 1 when wom au ratio increased from 1 4 to 14 nevertheless the remaining peaks from nucleobases 1250 1500 cm 1 at wom au 14 and the different spectra of wom adsorbed dna au nps and pure wom in contrast to the identical spectra of aha adsorbed dna au nps and pure aha in fig 4b suggested that the complete shielding of ssdna coating by wom was unlikely these observations are consistent with the humic nature of the wom which was more srha like the similar long term stability of dna25 au and dna25c au in wastewater effluent was likely due to the large amount of wom adsorbed that have weakened the role of dna properties in controlling the colloidal stability of dna au nps the low ionic conditions of river water divalent cations 0 1 mm conductivity 43 5 μs cm table s2 favored the suspension of dna au nps aggregation was not observed in the 30 min kinetics study fig 7b and approximately 80 of the particles remained suspended after 21 days figs 7d and s14c similar to their suspension in deionized water fig s16 the river water organic matter rom toc 2 3 mg c l shared a similar humic nature as srha fig s15b c the lack of divalent cations in river water and low aromaticity of rom suggested a weak interaction between the rom and ssdna coating which was confirmed by the raman spectra of rom adsorbed dna au nps where the peak of adenine remained prominent fig 7f 3 4 2 impact of dosed srha aha adding additional aha into wastewater effluent or river water prolonged the suspension of dna au nps and the effect of which was positively related to the dosing concentration of aha figs 7c d and s14a and c such effect could be attributed to the high aromaticity of aha compared to wom and rom and the ssdna coating preferentially adsorbed aha molecules the adsorption of aha in wastewater effluent could occur via both divalent cation bridging and π π interactions while in river water it mainly occurred via π π interactions dosing of additional srha to wastewater effluent posed little impact on the colloidal stability of dna au nps figs 7c and s14b mainly due to the low aromaticity of srha and the already high wom au ratio 14 1 as a result the adsorption of srha onto dna au nps was limited and cannot to provide sufficient stabilization against the high ionic strength particularly rich divalent cations 2 9 mm ca2 and 10 mm mg2 of the wastewater effluent in river water dosing of additional srha at 5 mg c l slightly enhanced the stability of dna au nps e g 90 of dna au nps remained suspended after 21 days figs 7d and s14d which was a result of the substantial increased carbon to au ratio from 4 6 to 14 6 the adsorption of either srha or rom was very limited due to their low aromaticity and the lack of divalent cations in river water overall these results in the real water samples highlighted the preferential interaction of ssdna with nom with high aromaticity consistent with the studies in simple electrolytes for nom with low aromaticity divalent cation bridging especially by ca2 played an essential role in their adsorption onto ssdna 3 5 implications for practical aquatic applications of engineered dna materials as discussed in the introduction interactions between nom and engineered dna have been reported to cause either negative or negligible influence on the performance of dna based applications the observed discrepancy in literatures could possibly be induced by the difference in the carbon to dna ratio instead of nom concentration alone nom properties and the subsequent differential interactions of nom and dna as demonstrated in our earlier results for instance in these studies that reported no significant influence from nom the carbon to dna ratios were around 30 and the divalent cation concentrations were low 1 mm akki et al 2015 park et al 2022 these values are considerably lower than those with which we observed significant change of the colloidal stability of dna au nps srha dna 1000 4 mm ca2 text s5 most noteworthy our study revealed that the highly aromatic nom like aha may have the determining role in the engineered dna functionality in typical aquatic matrices other less aromatic srha like nom are not likely to make the function completely fail in typical natural water chemistries these findings have important implications for designing pretreatment strategies for terrestrial samples that may contain highly aromatic nom future studies can be conducted to establish such quantitative insights furthermore our findings facilitate the general designs of aptamers and hydrological tracers for environmental applications for aptamers nom with high aromaticity could be incorporated into the aptamer selection process to produce aptamers with higher selectivity binding affinity to targets thereby improving the performance of aptasensor in real water samples for dna tracers certain hydrological environments are not suitable for the use of encapsulated dna tracers e g in alluvial gravel aquifer pang et al 2020 however adsorption of naked dna tracers to nom can lead to low recovery and unprecise detection liao et al 2018 pang et al 2020 therefore by understanding the properties of nom present in the field to be investigated and other conditions such as ca2 concentrations our work provides recommendations on whether naked dna tracers could be directly used or certain protection to the tracers will be required 4 conclusions our study bridged the critical knowledge gap regarding the interactions between engineered short chain ssdna and a major natural matrix factor i e nom the interactions between ssdna and nom mainly depended on the properties of nom i e carboxyl group and aromaticity the presence of cations i e valency and concentration and the relative content of ssdna and nom in the system the π π interactions between the aromatic regions of nom and the exposed nucleobases of ssdna aha srha wom rom and the cation bridging effect ca2 mg2 but not via na control whether the adsorbed nom fully shield the ssdna with divalent cations present specifically ca2 even a small amount of nom with high aromaticity e g aha can fully shield ssdna whereas the extent of shielding by nom with low aromaticity e g srha rom and wom depends on the relative content of ssdna and nom in the aquatic system and the occurrence of bridging the extent of shielding by nom has a major impact on the performance of engineered dna applications providing a partial answer to previously reported conflicting impacts of natural matrices on system performance overall our findings provide new insights into the transformations of engineered ssdna under environmentally relevant conditions as well as implications for the rational design of engineered dna based environmental applications such as

15599,engineered short chain single stranded dna ssdna are emerging materials with various environmental applications such as aptasensor selective adsorbent and hydrological tracer however the lack of fundamental understanding on the interactions of such materials with natural organic matter nom hinders the improvement of their application performance in terms of sensitivity selectivity and stability in this study we investigated the interactions of ssdna four strands with systematically varied length and sequence with two humic acids suwannee river humic acid srha and aldrich humic acid aha and two humic like nom present in local aquatic matrices rom in river water and wom in wastewater detailed molecular level interaction mechanisms were obtained by probing the colloidal stability of the ssdna coated gold nanoparticles coupled with product characterization using a suite of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques our study revealed that π π interactions and divalent cation bridging were the major mechanisms for ssdna nom interactions ssdna preferentially interacted with nom with high aromaticity aha srha wom rom with divalent cations present especially ca2 even a small amount of aha could completely shield ssdna whereas the extent of shielding by srha wom rom depended on the relative content of ssdna and nom and whether bridges formed the extent of shielding of ssdna by nom provides a potential answer to the reported conflicting effects of natural water matrices on the performance of dna based sensors taken together our findings provide insights into the transformations of engineered ssdna under environmentally relevant conditions as well as implications for their performance optimization in practical aquatic applications e g from dna design to pretreatment strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dna natural organic matter adsorption aromaticity divalent cation bridging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction engineered dna strands with desired sequences and a wide range of useful modifications such as fluorescent tags and linkage molecules can now be synthesized purchased at low and decreasing costs the dna consists of nucleotides in a specific order and each nucleotide contains a deoxyribose sugar a phosphate group and one of the four nitrogenous bases namely adenine a thymine t cytosine c and guanine g they are unique from other synthetic polymers due to their intrinsic functions or embedded information for example a short chain single stranded dna ssdna aptamer binds targets with high sensitivity and selectivity being very promising for rapid point of use multiplex environmental sensing of organic contaminants akki et al 2015 fan et al 2014 ions qing et al 2017 and pathogens yu et al 2018 etc aptasensors have the potential to rival some state of the art chemical biological analytical methods also dna aptamer has been demonstrated as a highly selective adsorbent to remove arsenic kim et al 2009 and illicit pharmaceuticals hu et al 2011 engineered dna with programmed information i e the sequence of nucleotides can also be used as a tracer to track the source and migration pathways of pollutants in hydrological environment investigations liao et al 2018 the number of dna tracer is theoretically unlimited i e the combination of four nucleobases and the unique sequence of each dna tracer makes it easily distinguishable from environmental background and allows for multipoint tracing while the potential of engineered dna in aquatic applications has been well recognized as described above little is known about the interactions of engineered dna with natural organic matter nom in typical aquatic environments natural organic matter including humic substances proteins polysaccharides etc is ubiquitous in the environment philippe and schaumann 2014 and their interactions with engineered dna interfere the performance of dna based applications for aptasensors a positive correlation between nom concentration 0 3 6 mg c l and the extent of performance degradation has been observed vogiazi et al 2021 however higher nom concentrations from 4 to 16 mg c l were also reported to exert no significant influence on the performance akki et al 2015 park et al 2022 among various types of aptasensor colorimetric aptasensors typically involve the use of dna coated gold nanoparticles au nps the au nps are stabilized by the dna coating in the presence of high concentration salts and the introduction of the target triggers preferential binding of dna aptamer and causes the aggregation of au nps such systems are dependent on salt induced aggregation and susceptible to interference from matrices e g nom or other constituents akki and werth 2018 for example low recovery of target was observed when the target was doped in milk samples yan et al 2017 other than aptasensors nom can also impact the functionality of dna tracers adsorption of dna tracers to nom can lead to low recovery and unprecise detection liao et al 2018 pang et al 2020 these reports highlight the need to elucidate the interaction s between engineered dna and nom and also the associated change of nanoparticle aggregation behaviors which will benefit the development of dna based applications in more realistic scenarios previous studies investigating the interactions between dna and nom have been mostly conducted with natural dsdna with a long chain thousands of base pairs lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 qin et al 2018 for example divalent cations formed bridges between the phosphate groups of dna and the carboxyl groups of nom while monovalent cations only screened the negative charges nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 however variations in dna properties e g double stranded or single stranded length and sequence may increase the complexity of their interactions with nom smaller dna fragments 2 69 kbp were reported to have preferential adsorption to soil compared to larger fragments 11 19 and 23 kbp due to their faster diffusion rates and or the size exclusion of available binding sites ogram et al 1994 the phosphate groups of dsdna were deemed as the major interaction sites with nom lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 nguyen and elimelech 2007 while the exposed nucleobases of ssdna also participated in the interaction with graphene oxide he et al 2010 liu et al 2020 the preferential interaction of cations with guanine bases in the ssdna affected the ion distribution along the dna strands resulting in varied dna layer thickness and drastically different colloidal stability of the coated particles peng et al 2022 little attention has been paid to engineered short chain ssdna e g 100 nucleobases the typical length of a dna aptamer zhou et al 2010 which behaves distinctively from natural dsdna in aquatic systems as such there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding the interactions of short chain ssdna with nom which expectedly have profound implications for the rational design of engineered dna for aquatic applications such as dna based sensor adsorbent and dna tracer among other emerging applications in this study we investigated the interaction s between ssdna and nom by examining the impact of nom on the colloidal stability of ssdna coated nanoparticles molecular level interaction mechanisms were revealed by characterizing the resulting products using a suite of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques ftir raman fluorescence and tem following our earlier work peng et al 2022 ssdna coated gold nanoparticles dna au nps with four different ssdna coatings systematically varied in length and sequence were studied two humic acids suwannee river humic acid srha an aquatic humic substance and aldrich humic acid aha a terrestrial humic substance hur and schlautman 2003 along with two humic like nom from local water matrices in hong kong river water and wastewater effluent were studied as the representative nom our study revealed the dependence of ssdna nom interaction on the aromaticity of nom and the cation bridging effect especially ca2 a strong interaction could result in a complete shielding of the ssdna by nom potentially sabotaging the functionality of ssdna e g the specific binding of aptamer to target and the hybridization of dna barcode our findings provide new insights into the functioning of engineered ssdna in complex aquatic matrices and directions to optimize the general design of dna based system for various aquatic applications e g selection of dna tracer and dna aptamer and proper pretreatment strategy 2 experimental 2 1 materials citrate capped 20 nm spherical au nanoparticles ted pella inc were used for the synthesis of dna au nps four single stranded dna ssdna with carefully designed sequences and 3 end thiol modification were purchased from idt integrated dna technologies inc denoted as dna15 dna25 dna25c and dna40 fig 1 the design of dna15 dna25 and dna40 aimed at investigating the effect of dna length while the design of dna25 and dna25c was to

dna25 au dna25c au and dna40 au respectively such design aimed at singling out the effect of dna length i e dna15 dna25 and dna40 and the effect of dna sequence i e dna25 and dna25c on their interactions with nom detailed characterization of these particles has been reported in our earlier work peng et al 2022 the hydrodynamic sizes of the four dna au nps were 35 4 1 5 nm of dna40 au 33 1 0 5 nm of dna25c au 31 2 1 7 nm of dna25 au and 30 8 1 5 nm dna15 au respectively fig 2 a presents the uv vis spectra of srha and aha 2 7 mg c l in water aha had higher absorbance than srha in both the uv and visible light wavelength ranges absorbance at 254 nm is characteristic of aromatic regions korshin et al 2009 whereas absorbance at 280 nm is positively correlated to molecular weight chin et al 1994 the observed higher absorbance of aha at 280 nm was consistent with the reported more high molecular weight portion 100 kda in aha than srha ca 20 for aha vs 5 for srha kim et al 2006 due to different humification environments srha is typically comprised of relatively small and polar moieties while aha has more nonpolar and aromatic contents grasso et al 1990 hong and elimelech 1997 the suva254 of srha and aha were calculated to be 6 2 0 1 and 9 0 0 1 respectively suggesting a higher aromatic content of aha abbt braun et al 2004 and being in agreement with our previously reported values jiang et al 2017 the eems of srha and aha showed a similar excitation maximum at around 330 nm and srha showed an obvious emission peak at around 460 nm while aha had a broad emission peak from 450 to 550 nm fig 2c d the excitation emission wavelengths are representative of humic like peak c fluorophore coble 1996 emission scan at 330 nm excitation confirmed the emission peak of aha at around 520 nm fig 2b a blue shifted emission maximum of srha indicates a decrease in the π electron system such as a lower number of aromatic rings coble 1996 consistent with the lower aromaticity as suggested by the smaller suva254 value of srha also it has been suggested that long emission wavelengths 500 nm could be attributed to the presence of greatly conjugated systems such as linearly condensed aromatic rings and other unsaturated bond systems rodríguez et al 2014 sierra et al 2005 in accordance with the higher aromaticity of aha as suggested by a larger suva254 value 3 2 aggregation kinetics of dna au nps in the presence of nom the aggregation kinetics of dna au nps in the presence of srha or aha were investigated in nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes respectively distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes of dna au nps were observed fig s1 the ccc values were determined as the intersections of the extrapolated lines of these two regimes and compared in fig 3 the ccc values of dna au nps without nom were retrieved from our previous work peng et al 2022 the presence of srha increased the ccc values of dna15 au from 451 mm to 489 mm nacl from 2 2 mm to 3 mm mgcl2 and from 2 2 mm to 2 7 mm cacl2 respectively fig 3 similar enhanced colloidal stability was observed for the other three dna au nps regardless of the dna sequence and length the enhancement of colloidal stability by the presence of nom has been extensively reported jiang et al 2017 loosli et al 2013 nason et al 2012 and such effect was attributed to the enhanced electro steric repulsion imparted by adsorbed nom chen and elimelech 2007 the epms of srha adsorbed dna au nps were either less negative in nacl electrolyte or similar in mgcl2 or cacl2 electrolyte to the bare dna au nps text s2 and fig s3 indicating that the enhanced colloidal stability mainly arose from stronger steric repulsion the order of stability among the four dna au nps with the presence of srha was the same as that without srha peng et al 2022 i e 1 in nacl electrolyte dna40 au dna25c au dna25 au dna15 au and 2 in mgcl2 and cacl2 electrolytes dna25c au dna40 au dna25 au dna15 au unlike srha the presence of aha significantly changed the stability of dna au nps and the effect showed a strong dependency on the co existing cations in nacl electrolyte the presence of aha lowered the ccc values of all four dna au nps fig 3a for example the ccc value of dna25c au decreased significantly from 2030 mm to 623 mm nacl although the colloidal stability of dna au nps was reduced by the presence of aha the order of stability did not change compared to that without aha present i e dna40 au dna25c au dna25 au dna15 au in divalent electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 interestingly the presence of aha brought the stability of dna au nps to a similar level i e similar cccs fig 3b c regardless of the original ssdna coatings which was completely different from the effect of srha the ccc values of dna au nps with aha present were ca 6 mm cacl2 and ca 10 mm mgcl2 with the exception of dna15 au in mgcl2 electrolyte 6 8 mm in either electrolyte the similar epms of dna au nps with or without the presence of aha fig s3 indicated that mechanism s other than electrostatic interactions should be accounted for inducing such change in colloidal stability 3 3 mechanisms underlying the distinct effects of nom on particle stability 3 3 1 adsorption of nom onto dna au nps the interaction between dna au nps and nom srha aha was first probed by fluorescence spectroscopy text s3 and fig s4 6 due to fluorescence quenching of au nps liu and liu 2017 the fluorescence intensity of nom was lowered after adsorption figs s4a and e s5a and e and s6 stronger quenching of the aha fluorescence by dna au nps was observed compared to srha fig s6 suggesting a stronger interaction i e adsorption between aha and the ssdna coating for example by calculating the intensity change at emission maximum 460 nm for srha and 520 nm for aha excitation wavelength 330 nm the peak intensity of srha was reduced by 8 while that of aha was reduced by 24 when additional salts nacl mgcl2 cacl2 were introduced the fluorescence intensity of aha was further decreased while the emission peak intensity of srha barely changed text s3 and fig s4 6 both nom and dna au nps were negatively charged therefore the adsorption of nom should be attributed to interactions other than electrostatic attraction such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions π π interactions cation bridging etc philippe and schaumann 2014 to understand the nom dna interaction mechanism s we first examined the ftir spectra of nom adsorbed dna au nps in cacl2 nacl electrolytes respectively the adsorption of nom in cacl2 electrolyte induced a spectral change at ca 1580 cm 1 fig 4 a and c and the extent of which is more pronounced in the spectra of aha adsorbed ones and proportional to the adsorbed amount aha au 1 1 the results suggested that the ssdna coating interacted more strongly with aha than srha consistent with the aforementioned fluorescence study due to the strong overlap of absorption in the ir spectra of the four nucleobases alex and dupuis 1989 tsuboi 1970 correlating the interaction between srha aha and a specific nucleobase was difficult nevertheless an attenuation of the peak at 1466 cm 1 after nom adsorption which symbolizes the in plane vibrations of the nucleobases e g nh and ch in the ring structures tsuboi 1970 molecular structures shown in fig 1 was observed in both electrolytes cacl2 and nacl fig 4a c and e implying that the ssdna nom interactions could have occurred through π π interactions furthermore we observed attenuated peaks at 1730 cm 1 co stretching of nucleobases guanine thymine and cytosine fig 1 1277 cm 1 asymmetric stretching of phosphate and 1073 cm 1 symmetric stretching of phosphate alex and dupuis 1989 tsuboi 1970 which may stem from the binding of cations and or hydrogen bonding park et al 2013 between nom and the ssdna coating these interaction sites i e co of nucleobases and phosphate groups indicated by the ftir results were consistent with our previous work peng et al 2022 in which we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction between ca2 and dna strands to further probe the interactions we used urea and sds to induce possible desorption of nom from dna au nps in nacl electrolyte excluding cation bridging urea breaks hydrogen bonds liu et al 2020 and sds breaks both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions schmid et al 2017 while π π interactions are not disturbed as shown in fig 4g urea induced the desorption of aha from dna au nps and the effect of which was more pronounced at higher urea concentration 6 m ca 10 aha desorbed sds also induced the desorption of aha ca 14 aha desorbed with 10 sds these results suggest that hydrogen bonding and or hydrophobic interactions contributed to the adsorption of aha onto dna au nps however a quantitative distribution of each aha adsorption mechanism cannot be achieved overall less than 15 of aha were desorbed even at 6 m urea or 10 sds condition suggesting that π π interaction was the major mechanism responsible for aha adsorption on the other hand desorption of srha induced by urea or sds was not observed fig 4h indicating that π π interaction was likely the only mechanism responsible for srha adsorption therefore the exposed nucleobases of ssdna played a significant role in its interaction with nom via π π interactions the stronger adsorption of aha than srha onto dna au nps was due to its higher aromaticity indicated by the aromatic carbon content table s1 and suva254 and capability to form hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interactions with the ssdna coating raman spectra revealed more details of the interaction between nom and the ssdna the adsorption of aha in cacl2 electrolyte completely shielded the characteristic peaks of adenine 734 cm 1 and nucleobases 1250 1500 cm 1 alex and dupuis 1989 otto et al 1986 fig 4b the spectra of aha adsorbed dna au nps became the same as that of pure aha even at a low carbon to gold ratio aha au 1 10 on the other hand the characteristic peaks of adenine and nucleobases after srha adsorption remained in the spectra albeit attenuated fig 4d with more srha adsorbed srha au increased from 1 10 to 1 1 the peak of adenine became weaker and the peaks from srha e g 1190 and 1517 cm 1 became apparent similar pattern was observed for the nom adsorbed dna25c au nps in cacl2 electrolyte as well fig s7 likely due to that the minor differences in dna25 and dna25c did not significantly impact their interactions with nom in nacl electrolyte neither srha nor aha was able to completely shield the original ssdna coating as suggested by the remaining peaks of adenine and nucleobases after adsorption fig 4f the relatively weaker peaks of adenine and nucleobases in the spectrum of aha adsorbed dna25 au compared to the srha adsorbed one was in line with the stronger interaction between aha and the ssdna coating the lack of complete shielding by adsorbed aha in nacl electrolyte suggested that divalent cation bridging between the phosphate groups of dna and the carboxyl groups of nom lu et al 2012 nguyen and chen 2007 also played a significant role in the adsorption process of aha in cacl2 electrolyte 3 3 2 intermolecular interactions of nom aggregation of au nps shortens their interparticle distance and causes the suspension color to change from red to purple storhoff et al 2000 such color change was observed for the aggregated dna au nps without nom present or with srha present in all three electrolytes fig 5c inset and s8b c however the colors of aggregated dna au nps with aha present were reddish purple fig 5a inset and showed a dependency on the presence of cations fig s8d e from na mg2 to ca2 the color of the suspensions gradually transitioned from purple to magenta suggesting increased interparticle distance of the aggregated au nps more details regarding the colors of aggregated dna au nps are given in text s4 to elucidate the underlying mechanism s causing the discrepancy in color change we examined the structure of aggregated dna25 au with nom present via tem and eds elemental mapping in the presence of both ca2 and aha we observed light shadowy areas bridging dna au nps fig 5a and s9a c such bridging areas were also observed in the haadf images fig 5b the corresponding eds elemental mapping showed that the elemental distribution of p from dna backbone and s from thiol group in dna fig 1 matched well with that of au suggesting that the dna strands were on au nps the elemental distribution of n and o highly overlapped with the bridging areas fig 5b insets especially the o distribution indicating the areas were indeed aha molecules the intermolecular bridging of aha molecules both adsorbed and unadsorbed likely occurred via calcium complexation chen and elimelech 2007 liu et al 2011 schwyzer et al 2013 on the contrary the intermolecular bridging of srha molecules was hardly observed figs 5c d and s10a c and the aggregate structure was similar to the aggregated dna au nps without nom present fig s11 the interparticle distance observed with aha present was apparently larger than the other two scenarios with srha or without nom in agreement with the magenta color of the aggregate suspension fig 5a inset the aggregated particles with srha present or without nom were closely packed in line with the purple colors of their aggregate suspensions fig 5c inset similar bridging of the aha molecules by mg2 was observed fig s9d f but to a less extent and only occurred at high concentrations e g 20 mm mg2 text s5 and fig s12 13 in agreement with the intermediate reddish purple color of aggregate suspension fig s8e such discrepancy in the effect of mg2 and ca2 stemmed from the weaker electronegativity and larger hydrated radius of mg2 stankus et al 2011 interestingly although the bridging effect was not expected in nacl electrolyte because na only screens the negative charges similar light shadowy areas linking aggregated particles was observed with the presence of aha fig s9g l but not with srha fig s10d f such intermolecular interactions of aha molecules are speculated to occur through π π interaction due to their high aromaticity ghosh et al 2008 nason et al 2012 the bridging of nom molecules by divalent cations has been widely reported chen and elimelech 2007 ghosh et al 2008 huynh and chen 2011 liu et al 2011 nason et al 2012 stankus et al 2011 and the carboxyl groups have been recognized as the binding sites for cations although the carboxyl group density was found to be positively related to the bridging effectiveness lu et al 2012 it does not seem to be the only parameter determining the bridging effect for example the bridging of srha standard ii which has 15 carboxyl carbon table s1 has been reported chen and elimelech 2007 huynh and chen 2011 liu et al 2011 but the bridging of srha standard i with a higher carboxyl content 19 carboxyl carbon table s1 was not observed huangfu et al 2013 other parameters such as the position of carboxyl groups in the polymer chain labille et al 2005 might also need to be taken into consideration in our study the bridging mediated by divalent cations was only observed with aha but not srha which was consistent with the aggregation profile of pure srha aha in the electrolytes fig s2 only in cacl2 electrolyte of a high concentration 50 mm the srha molecules formed clusters that can be steadily detected by the dls instrument fig s2d while the aggregation of aha molecules was observed in both cacl2 and mgcl2 electrolytes fig s2b c the higher carboxyl content of aha than srha standard iii used in this study table s1 may partially contribute to the observed phenomenon more efforts are required to reveal the underlying mechanism of such divalent cation bridging in future 3 3 3 proposed interaction mechanisms the adsorption of nom to ssdna and subsequent impact on the colloidal stability of dna au nps in simple electrolytes showed a dependency on both the properties of nom and cations fig 6 in divalent electrolytes mgcl2 and cacl2 the adsorbed aha molecules completely shielded the original ssdna coating which was facilitated mainly by both π π interaction and divalent cation bridging the aha coating determined the stability of the coated nanoparticles which explained the similar ccc values of the four aha adsorbed dna au nps in divalent electrolytes fig 3b c on the contrary the adsorption of aha in nacl electrolyte did not completely shield the original ssdna coating as such the original ssdna coating still played a role in the colloidal stability explaining the same order of stability as the bare dna au nps fig 3a the order of stability for the four bare dna au nps was determined by ssdna coating thickness which was influenced by the coating properties dna strand length sequence and loading and cations preferential interaction with guanine base as discussed in our previous work peng et al 2022 the intermolecular attractions from the adsorbed aha molecules led to the reduced colloidal stability lower ccc values the adsorption of srha onto dna au nps was limited largely due to the relatively weak π π interactions between srha and ssdna furthermore the stabilization of dna au nps by adsorbed srha was only observed in high srha concentration 100 mg c l in cacl2 electrolyte but not in mgcl2 electrolyte text s5 and fig s12 suggesting that ca2 bridged the ssdna with srha while mg2 did not and the bridging effect was relatively weaker compared to that with aha as a result the adsorption of srha did not completely shield the original ssdna coating in all three electrolytes the original ssdna coating determined the particle stability explaining the same order of colloidal stability of the four srha adsorbed dna au nps as the bare dna au nps fig 3 the limited intermolecular interaction of srha molecules and the extra steric repulsion provided by the adsorbed srha molecules collectively contributed to the minor increase of ccc values 3 4 interaction of ssdna with nom in real water samples 3 4 1 interaction with the real water organic matter the wastewater effluent and river water characteristics are summarized in table s2 the high ionic strength of the wastewater effluent conductivity 13360 μs cm saline wastewater a unique feature in hong kong due to seawater toilet flushing especially high concentration of divalent cations 10 mm mg2 and 2 9 mm ca2 induced the rapid aggregation of both dna25 au and dna25c au in the 30 min kinetics study fig 7 a b more details in text s6 a slower aggregation of dna25c au was observed due to the guanine rich sequence of dna25c peng et al 2022 on the contrary the stability of dna25 au and dna25c au did not differ in the 21 day study fig 7c and s14a with approximately 20 of the particles remained suspended after 21 days this discrepancy in the 30 min 21 day studies was due to the varied overcoating of wastewater organic matter wom toc 7 0 mg c l onto the dna au nps the fluorescence analysis of wom revealed their humic like nature a maximum fluorescence of peak c fig s15a and slightly lower aromaticity than srha fig s15c coble 1996 rodríguez et al 2014 different dosing of dna au nps in the 30 min 5 mg au l and the 21 day 0 5 mg au l studies resulted in different carbon to gold or carbon to dna mass ratios wom au 1 4 and 14 respectively wom dna 140 and 1400 respectively which impacted the amount of adsorbed wom the raman spectra of wom adsorbed dna au nps confirmed that more wom were adsorbed at higher wom au ratio fig 7e the peak of adenine 734 cm 1 disappeared and wom peaks became apparent e g 942 and 1003 cm 1 when wom au ratio increased from 1 4 to 14 nevertheless the remaining peaks from nucleobases 1250 1500 cm 1 at wom au 14 and the different spectra of wom adsorbed dna au nps and pure wom in contrast to the identical spectra of aha adsorbed dna au nps and pure aha in fig 4b suggested that the complete shielding of ssdna coating by wom was unlikely these observations are consistent with the humic nature of the wom which was more srha like the similar long term stability of dna25 au and dna25c au in wastewater effluent was likely due to the large amount of wom adsorbed that have weakened the role of dna properties in controlling the colloidal stability of dna au nps the low ionic conditions of river water divalent cations 0 1 mm conductivity 43 5 μs cm table s2 favored the suspension of dna au nps aggregation was not observed in the 30 min kinetics study fig 7b and approximately 80 of the particles remained suspended after 21 days figs 7d and s14c similar to their suspension in deionized water fig s16 the river water organic matter rom toc 2 3 mg c l shared a similar humic nature as srha fig s15b c the lack of divalent cations in river water and low aromaticity of rom suggested a weak interaction between the rom and ssdna coating which was confirmed by the raman spectra of rom adsorbed dna au nps where the peak of adenine remained prominent fig 7f 3 4 2 impact of dosed srha aha adding additional aha into wastewater effluent or river water prolonged the suspension of dna au nps and the effect of which was positively related to the dosing concentration of aha figs 7c d and s14a and c such effect could be attributed to the high aromaticity of aha compared to wom and rom and the ssdna coating preferentially adsorbed aha molecules the adsorption of aha in wastewater effluent could occur via both divalent cation bridging and π π interactions while in river water it mainly occurred via π π interactions dosing of additional srha to wastewater effluent posed little impact on the colloidal stability of dna au nps figs 7c and s14b mainly due to the low aromaticity of srha and the already high wom au ratio 14 1 as a result the adsorption of srha onto dna au nps was limited and cannot to provide sufficient stabilization against the high ionic strength particularly rich divalent cations 2 9 mm ca2 and 10 mm mg2 of the wastewater effluent in river water dosing of additional srha at 5 mg c l slightly enhanced the stability of dna au nps e g 90 of dna au nps remained suspended after 21 days figs 7d and s14d which was a result of the substantial increased carbon to au ratio from 4 6 to 14 6 the adsorption of either srha or rom was very limited due to their low aromaticity and the lack of divalent cations in river water overall these results in the real water samples highlighted the preferential interaction of ssdna with nom with high aromaticity consistent with the studies in simple electrolytes for nom with low aromaticity divalent cation bridging especially by ca2 played an essential role in their adsorption onto ssdna 3 5 implications for practical aquatic applications of engineered dna materials as discussed in the introduction interactions between nom and engineered dna have been reported to cause either negative or negligible influence on the performance of dna based applications the observed discrepancy in literatures could possibly be induced by the difference in the carbon to dna ratio instead of nom concentration alone nom properties and the subsequent differential interactions of nom and dna as demonstrated in our earlier results for instance in these studies that reported no significant influence from nom the carbon to dna ratios were around 30 and the divalent cation concentrations were low 1 mm akki et al 2015 park et al 2022 these values are considerably lower than those with which we observed significant change of the colloidal stability of dna au nps srha dna 1000 4 mm ca2 text s5 most noteworthy our study revealed that the highly aromatic nom like aha may have the determining role in the engineered dna functionality in typical aquatic matrices other less aromatic srha like nom are not likely to make the function completely fail in typical natural water chemistries these findings have important implications for designing pretreatment strategies for terrestrial samples that may contain highly aromatic nom future studies can be conducted to establish such quantitative insights furthermore our findings facilitate the general designs of aptamers and hydrological tracers for environmental applications for aptamers nom with high aromaticity could be incorporated into the aptamer selection process to produce aptamers with higher selectivity binding affinity to targets thereby improving the performance of aptasensor in real water samples for dna tracers certain hydrological environments are not suitable for the use of encapsulated dna tracers e g in alluvial gravel aquifer pang et al 2020 however adsorption of naked dna tracers to nom can lead to low recovery and unprecise detection liao et al 2018 pang et al 2020 therefore by understanding the properties of nom present in the field to be investigated and other conditions such as ca2 concentrations our work provides recommendations on whether naked dna tracers could be directly used or certain protection to the tracers will be required 4 conclusions our study bridged the critical knowledge gap regarding the interactions between engineered short chain ssdna and a major natural matrix factor i e nom the interactions between ssdna and nom mainly depended on the properties of nom i e carboxyl group and aromaticity the presence of cations i e valency and concentration and the relative content of ssdna and nom in the system the π π interactions between the aromatic regions of nom and the exposed nucleobases of ssdna aha srha wom rom and the cation bridging effect ca2 mg2 but not via na control whether the adsorbed nom fully shield the ssdna with divalent cations present specifically ca2 even a small amount of nom with high aromaticity e g aha can fully shield ssdna whereas the extent of shielding by nom with low aromaticity e g srha rom and wom depends on the relative content of ssdna and nom in the aquatic system and the occurrence of bridging the extent of shielding by nom has a major impact on the performance of engineered dna applications providing a partial answer to previously reported conflicting impacts of natural matrices on system performance overall our findings provide new insights into the transformations of engineered ssdna under environmentally relevant conditions as well as implications for the rational design of engineered dna based environmental applications such as selecting anti interference aptamers and designing strategies for the protection of dna tracers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
