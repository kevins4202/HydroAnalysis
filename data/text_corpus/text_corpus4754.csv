23770,coupled ice ocean models require an accurate performance of sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics to realistically simulate sea ice circulation in the polar regions however atmospheric surface variables from reanalysis products that force the models differ in spatial and temporal resolutions and there are also substantial inconsistencies in the distributions and magnitudes of these variables between the products therefore several key parameters in the models need to be adjusted for the models forced by different atmospheric reanalysis products this study compares the sea ice properties simulated by the previously optimized mitgcm ecco2 model forced by jra25 and forced by the recently released era5 the comparisons with high resolution satellite sea ice data reveal that the simulations forced by these two datasets significantly overestimate the arctic sea ice concentration in summer whereas the simulation forced by era5 underestimates the winter antarctic sea ice it is likely that the downward longwave radiation and wind stress regime in era5 is responsible for the underestimated antarctic sea ice cover we then optimize mitgcm ecco2 model forced by era5 by using green functions we consider six key parameters sea ice strength ice atmospheric drag coefficient ice ocean drag coefficient ice and snow albedos and sea ice salinity the optimized simulation significantly improves the sea ice distribution in both regions using a more realistic set of sea ice parameters the most significant improvement is in the antarctic where winter sea ice extent misfit decreases by 48 the optimized simulation reveals that era5 reproduces a closer representation of the arctic sea ice extent and thickness than jra25 in the southern hemisphere era5 simulates the sea ice drift better whereas the jra25 have the closest match to the sea ice extent despite the improvements further work is necessary for the antarctic where the lack of reliable observational data and limitations of the ocean model hinders the optimization keywords ecco2 reanalysis comparison jra25 era5 sea ice optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea ice is an essential element that regulates the climate system on regional scales rapid sea ice motion can create extreme sea ice conditions that threatens the polar navigation wang et al 2015 on large scales it affects ocean temperature by reflecting incoming solar radiation also it modifies momentum input from the atmosphere to the ocean park and stewart 2016 zheng et al 2019 in addition sea ice thermodynamic processes modulate the salinity gradient of the surface mixed layer and deep water formation gill 1973 thomas and dieckmann 2003 haumann et al 2016 ultimately this affects the strength and variability of the thermohaline circulation in polar regions and on a global scale over the last two decades intercomparison projects have been committed to improving numerical simulations of sea ice dynamics in both polar regions notz and community 2020 tsujino et al 2020 a good representation of the sea ice concentration thickness and drift is vital for climate studies wang et al 2019 which require accurate cryospheric performance in a global climate model rampal et al 2009 tietsche et al 2013 fenty et al 2017 diebold and rudebusch 2021 initially the optimization of sea ice models consisted of tuning several parameters to produce a realistic sea ice distribution miller et al 2006 tuned a stand alone sea ice model forced by era 40 using only three parameters namely atmosphere ice drag coefficient ice strength and albedo after optimization they were able to reproduce the sea ice extent and drift but with larger sea ice thickness than the observed they suggested that the forcing data were mainly responsible for the errors in the thickness distribution vancoppenolle et al 2009 included the effect of vertical salinity variations in sea ice to improve the sea ice distribution in a coupled global ocean ice model nemo lim3 they observed that the growth and melt rates in the arctic were mainly controlled by sea ice thermodynamics vancoppenolle 2005 and weak ocean stratification in the antarctic enhanced the impact of vertical ocean fluxes on sea ice properties hunke 2010 considered other tuning parameters such as conductivity ridging and ice ocean drag dynamics by varying the ocean friction velocity while keeping the albedo at its observed value of these parameters the ice ocean drag had the most substantial effect on sea ice thickness uotila et al 2012 conducted a series of sensitivity experiments to optimize sea ice distribution using a global coupled ocean sea ice model auscom forced by the core atmospheric forcing griffies et al 2009 more so they investigated the sensitivity of the sea ice model to 13 parameters and noted that antarctic sea ice properties were less sensitive to these parameters than arctic sea ice docquier et al 2017 studied the optimal value of ice strength for sea ice drift using the nemo lim model large values of ice strength resulted in lower values of sea ice drift in winter and spring but higher values in summer and fall in their study they could not find a specific value of sea ice strength to reproduce observed seasonal sea ice circulation rather they suggested that low and high values would better match the observations during the winter and summer seasons respectively chikhar et al 2019 showed that the use of spatially and temporally varying atmosphere ocean and ice ocean drag coefficients in the ice model could reduce the bias of sea ice drift moreno chamarro et al 2020 studied the effect of ice thickness distribution discretization itd on sea ice concentration using nemo lim in their study they pointed out that a single category of itd produced the worst results the optimized itd categories were dependent on the hemisphere increasing the thickness layers to five categories improved the prediction of arctic sea ice while increasing the thinner ice categories improved the prediction of antarctic sea ice besides sensitivity experiments other statistical methods have been developed to optimize sea ice parameters such as discrete inverse theory menke 2018 inverse theory used observations to adjust the numerical parameters of linear model systems even though ocean and ice models were nonlinear systems several approximations have been developed to address this limitation nguyen et al 2011 used a green functions to linearize the ice and ocean model and then adjusted 16 ocean and sea ice parameters yielding an improvement of 6 17 in sea ice extent 25 61 in sea ice thickness and 14 50 in sea ice velocity following same method ungermann et al 2017 showed that a simple category model with ice strength being linearly dependent on ice thickness is more representative of the ice distribution than a model with itd parameterization more recently green functions were employed to adjust the sea ice model parameters of the ogcms model forced with jra55 in the arctic ocean toyoda et al 2021 the optimized simulation yielded improvements of the sea ice drift of 15 20 the above studies used atmospheric reanalysis data to simulate the effect of the atmosphere on the sea ice reanalysis data combine an atmospheric model and data assimilation algorithms to construct continuous and gridded spatial temporal dataset at the moment we find a variety of reanalysis data depending on data assimilation algorithm resolution and atmospheric model onogi et al 2007 griffies et al 2009 hersbach et al 2020 in this study we consider two reanalysis products jra25 and era5 jra25 is a popular forcing dataset used in many modeling studies from regional to global scales the model used in this study mitgcm ecco2 was previously forced by jra25 and the model results were optimized under jra25 forcing menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 other studies have reported different optimizations for the same configuration using the jra 25 forcing nguyen et al 2011 fenty et al 2017 despite some significant improvements in the sea ice properties their results still reveal overestimations of the arctic sea ice thickness of about 1 1 5 m johnson et al 2012 fenty et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 the era5 is the very recent reanalysis product from ecmwf group it offers an upgrade in both temporal and spatial resolutions relative to jra25 with improved representations of downward longwave radiation winds humidity and air temperature graham et al 2019 tetzner et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 furthermore era5 displays a better representation of the near surface winds and cloud parameterization than other reanalysis products such as jra55 do which was recently adopted by the intercomparison project that involves new generation models ramon et al 2019 tsujino et al 2020 wang et al 2021 jonassen et al 2019 currently no studies are using era5 as atmospheric forcing for coupled ice ocean global simulations the capability of era5 to reproduce the global sea ice distribution has yet to be addressed thus we investigate the effects of era5 on the simulated sea ice properties and optimize the simulated sea ice properties using mitgcm ecco2 this study compares the sea ice distribution simulated by the coupled ocean sea ice model mitgcm ecco2 forced by era5 and jra25 using the previously optimized sea ice parameters under jra25 forcing menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 subsequently the mitgcm ecco2 model forced by era5 is tuned using green functions and inverse theory unlike other optimization methods such as kalman filter massonnet et al 2014 the method of green s functions does not need hundreds of simulations for optimizing the model results we achieved an optimized simulation of arctic and antarctic sea ice circulation as demonstrated by comparing the simulated results with the observed sea ice area and extent sea ice thickness and sea ice drift this paper is structured as follows the observational data the model description the model set up and experimental design are presented in section 2 differences between jra25 and era5 surface forcing variables and optimized experiment are analyzed in section 3 a discussion is given in section 4 the paper ends with concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methodology in this study mitgcm ecco2 was forced with two reanalysis atmospheric forcing datasets era5 and jra25 table 1 for the period 1979 2011 then we compare the model results with the observed sea ice concentration thickness and sea ice velocity table 1 to optimize the ocean sea ice model forced with era5 for the period 2002 2011 2 1 reanalysis products jra25 is a reanalysis product obtained using the jma s global spectra model and the three dimensional variational 3d var data assimilation analysis method onogi et al 2007 jra25 offers many of the atmospheric variables previously employed in climate models studies menemenlis et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 the horizontal resolution has 320 points eastward and 160 points from pole to pole with equidistant latitude spanning of 1 125 the distance between longitude points from the pole towards the equator varies from 1 113 to 1 21 the temporal resolution is 6 h for the period 1979 2012 this study uses specific humidity air temperature at 2 m from the surface precipitation wind speed at 10 m above sea level and both surfaces downward longwave and shortwave radiation among them precipitation longwave and shortwave radiation are fluxes divided over the 6 h forcing period to represent accumulation the jra25 dataset is a discontinuous product and thus its usage might be inappropriate we also looked at the difference between jra25 and jra55do as we will briefly mention later we did not observe significant differences between the jra25 and jra55 do cost functions era5 is another global atmospheric reanalysis dataset obtained from ecmwf and 4d var data assimilation techniques hersbach et al 2020 this dataset is an update of the era interim previously completed in 2019 apart from the already mentioned variables that we used in this study era5 offers vast atmospheric data spanning the period 1950 2020 with a temporal resolution of 1 h the horizontal grid is represented by a regular grid of 1440 points in the east direction and 720 points from pole to pole with a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 degree between grid points 2 2 sea ice observations sea ice extent is computed using sea ice concentrations from the asi version 5 sea ice concentration product assuming that the sea ice concentration in the grid cell is above 15 spreen et al 2008 this product is obtained from the brightness temperatures recorded by two satellite sensors amsr e and amsr2 the first radiometer flew with the aqua satellite recording the brightness temperatures from 2002 2011 subsequently the sensor amsr2 mounted on the shizuku satellite has been in operation from 2012 until now for the arctic and antarctic we use the datasets with a spatial resolution of 6 125 6 125 km 2 overall this is a continuous daily record from 2002 to the present except for 2011 2012 when no satellite was operational the relative error depends on the sea ice concentration with 25 at 0 concentration to 7 at 100 the observed sea ice velocities come from the polar pathfinder daily 25 km ease grid sea ice motion vectors version 4 tschudi et al 2020 the daily sea ice drift vectors are derived from smmr ssm i ssmis amsr e and avhrr satellite observations arctic buoy data and ncep ncar reanalysis winds the record has a spatial resolution of 25 km covering the arctic ocean and antarctic the coarse horizontal resolution of the polar pathfinder does not provide data from the narrow straits of the canadian archipelago thus there is only data from the baffin and hudson bays the temporal coverage ranges from 1979 to 2019 the polar pathfinder has been extensively validated in the arctic ocean johannessen et al 2020 tschudi et al 2020 wang et al 2022 whereas only a few studies have attempted to validate it in the antarctic schwegmann et al 2011 kim et al 2016 farooq et al 2020 the sea ice drift error associated with this gridded data product is about 4 5 cm s the sea ice speed v s i is computed following 1 v s i u s i 2 v s i 2 where u s i and v s i are the sea ice horizontal velocity vectors in the x and y directions respectively sea ice thickness data are modeled by pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system piomas and global ice ocean modeling and assimilation system giomas the piomas and giomas use the same ice ocean model to numerically compute the sea ice properties zhang and rothrock 2003 the main difference between these two systems is the domain and assimilation piomas is a regional model of the arctic ocean that employs the sea surface temperature and the sea ice concentration from satellites to decrease the bias between the numerical solution and the observations giomas is a global model that only assimilates the sea ice concentration from satellites unlike the latter piomas has been validated in numerous studies and shows a good representation of the sea ice thickness in the arctic basin wang et al 2016 labe et al 2018 karvonen et al 2022 the validation of giomas is challenging in the southern hemisphere due to the lack of observations shi et al 2021 liao et al 2022 despite this it is still a relevant product that provides a continuous temporal and gridded spatial distribution the temporal resolution is monthly and the record covers from 1979 to the present it has a spatial resolution of 22 km the error is about 0 5 m 2 3 model description and experiment design 2 3 1 the models ocean model mitgcm ecco2 menemenlis et al 2008 is a high resolution nonlinear three dimensions global ocean and sea ice model based on the dynamic framework of mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the ocean module is developed using the boussinesq assumption and the anelastic approximation in an arakawa c grid the vertical mixing was parameterized using the k profile scheme of large et al 1994 mitgcm ecco2 uses a curvilinear cube sphere structured grid to prevent singularities at the poles the horizontal grid is about 18 km in size and has 50 layers in the vertical direction with layer thicknesses ranging from 10 m near the surface to 400 m near the bottom the global bathymetry is the s2004 which merges the smith and sandwell grid with the gebco one arc minute over shallow and polar areas marks and smith 2006 the green s function method menemenlis et al 2008 is employed to optimize the initial conditions atmospheric forcing fields and some parameterization schemes to reduce the discrepancies with observed data sea ice model the sea ice module is developed based on the viscous plastic dynamics rheology and thermodynamic sea ice model of zhang and hibler 1997 adapted to the arakawa c grid losch et al 2010 the sea ice momentum equation is computed following 2 m d u d t m f k u τ i c e a t m τ i c e o c e a n m ϕ 0 f where m is the mass of the ice and snow u the ice horizontal velocities f is the coriolis parameter ϕ 0 is the gradient of the sea surface height f is the divergence of the internal ice stress tensor and τ i c e a t m i c e o c e a n are the atmosphere and ocean stresses among them the τ i c e a t m i c e o c e a n and the internal ice stress tensor control the sea ice dynamics steele et al 1997 massonnet et al 2014 the ocean and ice stress are computed using quadratic functions 3a τ i c e a t m ρ a t m c i c e a t m u atm u r a t m u atm u 3b τ i c e o c e a n ρ o c e a n c i c e o c e a n u ocean u r o c e a n u ocean u where u atm ocean is the wind speed and ocean c i c e a t m i c e o c e a n is the ice atmospheric drag coefficient and ice ocean drag coefficient ρ a t m o c e a n is the air and water density and r a t m o c e a n are rotation matrices acting on the wind and ocean components the internal ice tensor is related to the ice strain and sea ice strength by the viscous plastic constitutive law hibler 1979 where the sea ice strength coefficient changes the maximum ice pressure 4 p m a x p c h exp c 1 c where p is the sea ice strength c the sea ice concentration c is a non units sea ice strength constant equal to 20 and h the sea ice thickness see losch et al 2010 for full equation detail the ice model uses a zero layer scheme to represent the heat flux transference from the surface to the bottom of the ice the zero layer scheme algorithm assumes that the heat capacity of the ice is zero all the internal heat sources are reduced to constant conductive heat ensuring a linear temperature profile across the different ice thickness categories or layers as a result the ice heats and cools instantaneously producing errors in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal sea ice however this limitation can be readily solved by slightly adjusting the sea ice parameters losch et al 2010 ungermann and losch 2018 the reader is referred to chapter 8 6 2 of the mitgcm manual for full detail of the thermodynamics package atmospheric forcing the atmospheric forcing fields are linearly interpolated in the model using the external forcing package of mitgcm the 10 m wind speed vector components are similarly converted into the wind stress on the ocean following 2 the bulk formulae solves the heat and freshwater fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean ice large and yeager 2004 that require the atmospheric temperature specific humidity precipitation runoff wind speed longwave and downward shortwave radiation the incidence of shortwave radiation varies depending on the albedo coefficient the ocean albedo coefficient is by default set 0 15 whereas total sea ice albedo depends on the amount of snow in the domain if there is no snow then the total albedo coefficient is set by the ice albedo besides if the snow is thicker than 0 15 m the effective albedo is set by the snow albedo at the interval between zero and the cutoff i e 0 15 m mitgcm computes the effective albedo following 5 α e m i n α i h s 1 0 15 c i α s α i α s where α e is the effective albedo α i ice albedo α s snow albedo h s snow thickness and c i is the ice concentration 2 3 2 model spin up the mitgcm ecco2 is forced by these two atmospheric reanalysis data from era5 aka control run and from jra25 for the period 1979 2011 we also compare era5 to jra55 do but we do not discuss it because we do not find significant differences with the jra25 comparison the largest differences were observed in the sea ice drift in east antarctica because of the higher resolution in jra55 do than its predecessor however we cannot draw a conclusion because the lack of reliable observation data hinders the study of sea ice motion in east antarctica see discussion in supporting material river runoff is included as salt fluxes using the climatological river runoff data obtained from the global runoff data centre we set the same sea ice parameters that were optimized for the original configuration of ecco2 using jra25 menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 the domain of integration is global but the comparison study is constrained to the arctic and antarctic see fig 1a and b note we divide each polar cap in five well known subdomains following the literature nguyen et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the simulated sea ice properties are then compared with the observations during 2002 2011 to assess the performances of the experiments see fig 1c 2 3 3 model optimization discrete inverse theory and green functions the sea ice model is tuned using discrete inverse theory and the green functions nguyen et al 2011 ungermann et al 2017 the inverse theory is a powerful tool to adjust the numerical model parameters using observations specifically inverse theory can estimate model parameters from linear systems by computing and minimizing the misfits between observations and model data this method uses weighted least squares to find the optimal parameters that produce the minimal misfit the misfit is defined as cost function following 6 j n 1 n w y y n o b s y n m o d e l 2 where y m o d e l is the model output to be compared and y o b s is the observations of size n w y are the weights associated to the observations equal to the covariance matrix r 1 since they are unknown that matrix is a symmetric band with the standard error in the diagonal and zeros in the rest of the matrix even though mitgcm ecco2 is a fully nonlinear model we can linearize the model around the control scenario by forcing the model with small perturbations in the numerical parameters also called green functions approach the equation that relates the linearized model and the observations can be written as 7 δy g δη ϵ where δη η η ref is the amplitude of the perturbed parameters to adjust δy y obs y ref is the difference between the observations and reference experiment and ϵ is the error of the model misfit with the covariance matrix r 1 g is a jacobian matrix with the sensitivity experiments or green functions for each specific parameter the dimensions of g are nxm where m is the number of numerical parameters therefore g dimensions can be vast but menemenlis et al 2008 proved that only a few parameters are needed to decrease the misfit of the numerical model significantly specifically g is parameterized like 8 g n m y 1 e x p 1 y 1 r e f η 1 η r e f y 1 e x p 2 y 1 r e f η 2 η r e f y 1 e x p m y 1 r e f η m η r e f y 2 e x p 1 y 2 r e f η

the model variable used to tune the model we employ the sea ice concentration the sea ice drift components and the sea ice thickness η are the parameters to be tuned in this study we consider sea ice strength sea ice atmospheric and sea ice ocean drag coefficients which have the leading role in the sea ice momentum equation steele et al 1997 massonnet et al 2014 the snow and sea ice albedos which control heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ice uotila et al 2012 sumata et al 2019 and the sea ice salinity which is usually not considered in the optimization but some studies point out its importance in the heat transference between the ice and ocean våge et al 2009 the sensitivity experiments or expm are run the last five years of the control simulation see fig 1c and table 3 for the reasons that are explained later we perform two successive optimization experiments the first sensitivity experiments use the numerical parameters from exp 1 9 and the second from exp 10 17 see table 3 the misfit is measured as the length j or cost function between the observations and the model control parameters perturbations by 9 j δη t w η δη δy g δη t w y δy g δη where t represents transpose vectors and matrices w y and w η are the weights of the observations and the model parameters equal to the covariance matrix r 1 and q 1 respectively upon minimizing 9 yields 10 δη g t w y g δη w η 1 g t w y δy where the optimized parameters are then obtained from η o p t η r e f δη weights and covariance matrix the observation covariance matrix or r is computed using standard errors and scaled over the data points nguyen et al 2011 ungermann et al 2017 the standard error follows the form σ n where sigma is the weighted monthly standard deviation and n is the number of time steps in each grid cell for the interested period the weighted monthly standard deviation for the sea ice concentration is calculated by mapping the daily sensor uncertainty reported by the manual see 2 2 sea ice observations similarly the standard error for the sea ice drift is computed using the daily polar pathfinder uncertainty in the dataset note that some areas with a low presence of sea ice produce tiny standard errors and thus unrealistic large misfits to address this limitation we only consider the points with more than 80 of ice presence in the record this filter ensures an adequate standard error but it removes most of the information in summer therefore we only considered the winter fields to optimize the sea ice model lastly piomas and giomas do not provide the spatial uncertainty of the product thus we set a constant sigma of 0 5 m the covariance matrix of the numerical parameters q is set differently from previous studies menemenlis et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 in the literature q is set to zero because this problem is overdetermined i e the number observation points are much larger than the numerical parameters to solve upon setting q to zero we can observe unrealistic values for the predicted optimized albedo coefficient i e larger than one and also the proposed snow albedo coefficients are lower than the ice albedos we add restrictions to both hemispheres during the first optimization process to ensure that the albedos are acceptable see q 1 in table 3 note that this setting is not unique and slight variations of q 1 produce different results therefore we decide to conduct a second optimization experiment during this second process the q 2 in the antarctic is set to zero because the estimated parameters are physically possible see opt2 table 2 the arctic s q 2 is non zero because we observe a large estimated value of ice ocean drag coefficient of 0 008 unlike q 1 in the first optimization we set an equal distribution of the restrictions where the drag coefficients vary up to 0 001 respectively the remaining parameters are also restricted but it does not significantly alter the optimized numerical parameters see q 2 in table 3 3 results 3 1 comparisons between experiments forced by jra25 and era5 3 1 1 sea ice extent the sea ice extent cost functions computed from eq 6 for the period 2002 2011 in the arctic domain are shown in fig 2a the control experiment the run forced by era5 control exp in table 2 displays significant disagreements with the observations in summer when the arctic basin ab and barents kara seas bks account for more than half of the misfit in winter the arctic basin is fully covered by sea ice restricting the misfit to the greenland iceland and norwegian seas gins and the bks even though cost functions quantify the misfit between observations and the model simulation they do not provide information the type of bias fig 2b is a composite field plot of the sea ice extent mean with more than 15 sea ice concentration for march and september the sea ice extent of the control experiment is overestimated in summer see the black line and gray shaded area in particular the shelf seas located in the bks and ab regions have the largest root mean square errors see table 4 followed by the canadian archipelago caa and gins in winter the ice edge misfit moves southward due to the sea ice growth see white shaded area and black dashed line during this season the gins and the central barents sea have the most significant root mean square errors followed by the caa and the bering sea the results from the experiment forced by jra25 jra25 exp in table 2 are denoted with a magenta color at first glance jra25 exp displays a similar qualitative bias as the control in summer and winter in particular the jra25 exp performs better during winter with lower mean absolute errors in every zone but worse during the summer season in the baffin bay where there is a more considerable overestimation of sea ice extent than the control run the sea ice extent cost function in the antarctic domain is shown in fig 2c note that we observe larger misfits in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere the most significant misfit is located in winter september when the amundsen and bellingshausen seas abs have the largest bias followed by the western pacific ocean wpo weddell sea ws indian ocean io and lastly the ross sea rs with the lowest misfit the misfit distribution changes significantly in summer when the rs has the most considerable bias leaving the remaining seas in a lower misfit unlike the arctic ocean the antarctic domain displays different types of bias depending on the area the model generates lower sea ice concentration in abs and ws whereas it generates more sea ice in the io and wpo in the growing season see fig 2d there is a good agreement between the observations and the control during the melting season except for the underestimated sea ice extent in the ross sea although root mean square errors rmses associated with these areas agree with the misfit distribution their magnitude is much lower than we could expect from high values of cost functions as it happened in the arctic domain cost functions are computed using spatial standard errors that vary during the season thus rmses and cost functions are not expected to agree in magnitude the experiment forced using jra25 presents a better representation of sea ice misfit in the antarctic during both seasons there are a few exceptions in summer when the ws sea ice is slightly overestimated the disagreement between the two simulations control and jra25 exp is probably due to the effects of the existing disagreement between the two reanalysis datasets in forcing variables see figs 3 and 4 in particular the excess of winter sea ice extent in the bering strait could be explained by the deficiency of shortwave radiation which is not well counterbalanced by longwave radiation 3a and b the discrepancy between the sea ice extents in the gins could be a consequence of the different solar radiation and wind stress regimes over the east of greenland fig 3d in the southern hemisphere we can observe large differences between the radiative forcing products with longwave radiation anomalies larger than 35 w m2 during winter fig 4a besides we also observe significantly different antarctic wind regimes fig 4d that could explain the disagreement between the cost functions of the reanalysis data in abs rs and wpo 3 1 2 sea ice drift the cost functions for the sea ice drift during 2002 2012 for both domains are shown in fig 5 note that the low sea ice drift misfit in the arctic and antarctic during summer is a consequence of the observations filtering see 2 3 2 model optimization therefore we will only look into the winter sea ice properties figs 5a and 5b display the cost functions and probability density distribution functions pdf corresponding to the arctic ocean the most noticeable differences in the arctic are located in the gins and the caa the modeled gins mean sea ice drift is significantly faster than the observations see table 5 and its pdf shows a bimodal distribution whereas the observations have a quasi normal distribution with a mean about 10 cm s in addition its weak spearman correlation confirms that the model cannot reproduce the sea ice dynamics well in the east greenland current due to the coarse horizontal resolution dupont et al 2015 docquier et al 2017 the caa might be a bit challenging to understand the low difference between the sea ice mean drift and the strong correlation contrast with the cost functions and their different pdf distribution as mentioned in the previously pathfinder only offers data for the baffin and the hudson bay see section 2 2 therefore we can see that the sea ice drift distribution agrees well with observations but the southern part of the baffin bay is characterized by the prominent currents that are difficult to reproduce numerically for the same reasons as the greenland current bering strait displays large observe modeled mean sea ice drift differences despite of low cost functions and high spearman correlation it could a consequence of large standard error from the observations the ab and bk show a lower misfit which is supported by the mean variability pdf distribution and high correlations the sea ice drift misfit in the southern hemisphere varies mainly depending on the area and the reanalysis product both reanalysis products produce large misfits in the weddell sea and the indian ocean the modeled sea ice is faster than the observations showing that a small portion of the pdf distribution agrees with the observations fig 5d despite the speed magnitude disagreement there is a strong correlation in the abs and weddell sea table 5 implying a good resemblance of the sea ice drift pattern in these region on the other hand the modeled sea ice drift does not correlate at all in the indian ocean the polar pathfinder might be too coarse to catch the sea ice drift in this region since observational studies found much larger sea ice speeds heil and allison 1999 the misfit in the ross sea and western pacific ocean depends on the reanalysis data the disagreement between the reanalysis datasets is expected since they significantly differ in wind stress regime see fig 4d the control experiment has a lower misfit than jra25 exp but the pdf mean speed and non significant correlation might indicate that the observational uncertainty in the wpo is too large producing a lower misfit the ross sea ice drift is better solved by jra25 with mean values closer to the observations a slightly higher correlation and similar pdf distributions 3 1 3 sea ice thickness sea ice thicknesses in the arctic and antarctic domains are shown in fig 6 the control experiment agrees well with the seasonal arctic sea ice thickness we can only observe a few differences in the ab and caa where the model slightly overestimates the sea ice thickness by no more than 1 m see gray histograms fig 6b the jra25 exp also has a good agreement for most of the regions but has a large misfit in the sea ice thickness in the ab and caa during both seasons with differences being larger than 2 m over the central arctic see pink histograms fig 6b and larger than 6 meters in the caa the low misfit in gins bk and bs could be a consequence of the standard error of the piomas which was set to 0 5 both experiments reproduce the antarctic summer sea ice distribution see figs 6c and d with some biases of about 1 0 5 m in the northern weddell sea not shown the control has a large misfit in antarctic winter ice thickness whereas the jra25 exp had better distribution in winter in general we can observe that those misfits are associated with missing thinner ice see histograms 5d this behavior is expected since the radiative and wind stress forcing of era5 is much larger than jra25 thus the marginal ice zone is more susceptible to melting processes from a warm atmosphere and ocean note that this difference is larger in the rs and abs where the wind stress is more persistently drifting away the sea ice than elsewhere 3 2 optimized experiment as we introduced in the methodology inverse theory employs the winter sea ice properties to minimize the misfit length the sea ice cost fraction of control and optimized experiment is shown in fig 7 note the significant improvement of the sea ice properties in both hemispheres during the first optimization opt1 in general we can observe that the second optimization opt2 affects more the sea ice proprieties in boreal summer mainly due to the decrease and increase of the wet albedo and ice ocean drag coefficients respectively more specifically the arctic shows a decrease in the sea ice extent bias of 34 and 12 in summer and winter respectively there is no apparent improvement in the arctic sea ice velocity components in summer whereas there is a slight worsening of 2 in winter the sea ice thickness bias decreases by 2 in september and increases by about 1 in march in the antarctic the cost functions do not significantly vary from opt1 and opt2 note there is only a small decrease of the austral summer sea ice extent bias produced by the decrease of the wet snow albedo overall the sea ice extent significantly improves by about 35 and 37 in winter and summer respectively the antarctic sea ice drift misfit displays a slight improvement of 5 and 0 5 in winter and summer respectively lastly the sea ice thickness misfit changes slightly decreasing by 1 in winter but increasing by 0 5 in summer the above paragraph summarized the main changes in the optimization it is also instructive to evaluate the cost function associated with each subcategory since their sea ice cost fraction differs significantly in the sea ice properties as presented in the reanalysis product comparison we now summarize the main changes between the different areas in the arctic and antarctic 3 2 1 sea ice extent given that the observed sea ice concentration is the most reliable product among the products of sea ice properties in the two polar regions we regard sea ice cover as the most important metric for validating the sea ice simulations in our experiment the cost function and field of the sea ice extent for the second optimized experiment opt2 and the control experiment are shown in figs 8a and 8b for the period 2002 2011 the most significant change is found during summer when the ab bks and gins sea ice extent misfits decrease by 20 12 and 3 respectively there is also a moderate reduction of winter sea ice extent in the gins the bks and the bs where the misfits decreased by 12 3 and 2 respectively note that the reduction of the cost function is not fully appreciated in the rmsds of these areas see table 4 in fact we can observe that rmsds showed an improvement in the caa basin in summer and a slight worsening in winter not seen in the cost functions as rmsds do not consider the standard error of the observational data rmsds might wrongly estimate the misfit areas with large bias uncertainty antarctic sea ice extent is by the difference the largest improvement in optimization fig 8c shows that the misfit decreased by more than 35 in both seasons the most significant improvement is found in the ross sea where there is an expansion of the summer sea ice extent see fig 8d decreasing the misfit length by about 48 there is also a significant improvement in the abs sea ice extent during winter summer where the discrepancy between the model and observations decreases by about 33 6 besides the misfits in the weddell and the indian ocean deteriorate the summer sea ice extent by 15 and 5 respectively 3 2 2 sea ice drift the optimized simulation sea ice drift cost functions are shown in fig 9 we only include the winter sea ice drift because the observed summer sea ice drift is unreliable as mentioned earlier using the parameters in table 2 does not improve the winter arctic sea ice drift there is a worsening of about 25 of the sea ice drift with 21 of it being due to enhancing mean sea ice speeds in the gins and the ab see table 5 and fig 9a the ramp up of the sea ice drift in these regions is a direct effect of increasing the sea ice ocean drag and decreasing the sea ice strength miller et al 2006 dupont et al 2015 in the southern hemisphere there is a significant decrease of the bias by about 52 in winter sea ice drift in particular the rs has the largest change where the misfit is decreased by 26 we can readily see that the optimized simulation has better agreement with this region s sea ice velocity proprieties table 5 also same improvement can be seen in the pdf which is shown in fig 9b see blue shade the weddell sea also has a significant improvement of about 10 the velocity is still slightly faster than the observations but a bimodal structure now characterizes the pdf similar to the observations the abs sea ice drift shows a small decrease of the misfit by about 3 improving the sea ice drift profile see table 5 and fig 9b the remaining areas also register improvements in the misfit see fig 9 but the disagreement with the mean sea ice drift variability and weak spearman correlations might indicate that the observations in those areas are not suitable for optimizing the global model 3 2 3 sea ice thickness the optimized sea ice thickness is shown in fig 10 there is a noticeable worsening in the caa of 23 and 7 in winter and summer respectively producing sea ice thicker than 6 meters see histogram fig 10b the ab has a significant decrease in the misfit by 41 and 7 in summer and winter respectively in terms of sea ice thickness see the blue histogram in fig 10b the opt2 produces a thinner sea ice than the control experiment during summer and winter the gins sea ice thickness improves about 6 in winter and 2 in summer the bk and bs do not show a noticeable change the antarctic sea ice thickness significantly improves in winter with the bias being reduced by almost 50 see fig 10c more specifically the ross sea abs and ws misfit decrease by 31 10 and 7 respectively increasing the mean winter sea ice thickness distribution see histograms in fig 10b there is a worsening in summer with the misfits in the weddell sea and the indian ocean registering significantly increased biases of 40 and 43 respectively the misfits in the abs and the wpo also increase by about 23 and 5 respectively nevertheless the cost functions associated with the summer sea ice thickness are tiny see fig 6 and we can observe that by comparing the probability distributions from the control and the optimized experiment in fig 10e 4 discussion in this study mitgcm ecco2 is forced by two atmospheric reanalyses products era5 and jra25 we use observational sea ice property data from satellites buoys ncep ncar piomas and giomas reanalysis data to validate the model results and then we optimize the sea ice simulation forced by the era5 dataset using green functions and inverse theory a comparison between the control simulation forced by era5 and the earlier optimized simulation forced by jra25 shows significant differences in the arctic and antarctic the excess of arctic sea ice extent is probably a consequence of the high albedo values from the original configuration see table 2 and the uncertainty of radiation forcing from reanalysis datasets see fig 3a the era5 downward longwave radiation and wind stress mainly contribute to the underestimated sea ice concentration in the antarctic however intercomparison studies show that era5 has a better representation of the longwave radiation than other reanalysis products such as jra55 in the antarctic jonassen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore the low winter sea ice extent could be an effect of other factors such as a not well represented ocean mixed layer petty et al 2014 the simulations forced by jra25 and by era5 display a strong correlation for sea ice drift in most of the areas in winter with exceptions the greenland iceland and norway seas due to limitations of the model resolution to reproduce the east greenland coast current uotila et al 2012 the indian and western pacific ocean probably due to limitations of the observational product and therefore large observational uncertainties the overestimated mean sea ice drift in the antarctic might be a bias of the observations since the polar pathfinder tends to underestimate the sea ice drift schwegmann et al 2011 kim et al 2016 the large overestimations of arctic sea ice thickness in the jra25 experiment probably result from the low downward longwave radiation the optimized parameters obtained after minimizing the cost functions improve the sea ice properties in both domains note that the new albedo coefficients are more acceptable and had a closer agreement with the observations reported in the arctic hunke 2010 uotila et al 2012 the antarctic snow albedo is still slightly higher than losch et al 2010 estimations the disagreement between the different numerical parameters in both domains is expected firstly the arctic and antarctic are the regions where the mutual importance of sea ice related physical mechanisms significantly vary and thus the sensitivity of the numerical parameters vancoppenolle et al 2009 uotila et al 2012 maksym 2019 secondly the asymmetric radiation biasis produced by the atmospheric model cloud parameterization atmospheric models fail to reproduce the observed net radiation distribution from the top of the atmosphere to the surface thus this uncertainty is more significant in the south hemisphere where the cloud fraction is higher walsh et al 2009 jonassen et al 2019 lim et al 2021 thirdly the correction of the amplitude and phase limitations of the ice model s thermodynamic zero layer scheme is also dependent on atmospheric conditions and sea ice driving mechanisms losch et al 2010 ungermann and losch 2018 under these circumstances it is more than justified to use different sea ice parameters to optimized the sea ice model in both polar regions the optimized arctic configuration shows an expected decrease of sea ice extent mainly produced by the decrease increase of the sea ice albedo drag coefficients hunke 2010 unlike the jra25 the era5 solar radiation has a lower magnitude see fig 3a therefore the albedo coefficients in particular the wet albedo coefficients need to be lowered to increase the atmospheric heat flux to the sea ice to enhance the sea ice melting during the melting season a noticeable effect of increasing the atmospheric ice drag coefficient and lowering the sea ice strength is an increment of the sea ice momentum resulting in increased mean sea ice velocity and worsening in the gins and caa where the model resolution does not solve well the circulation dupont et al 2015 docquier et al 2017 the increased sea ice drift improves the ice thickness in the arctic basin excluding the caa region an increase in the ice momentum and decrease in strength produces an piling up of sea ice on the canadian coast steele et al 1997 docquier et al 2017 the configuration in the arctic can be further optimized by varying the ice ocean drag coefficient parameter however we decide not to do so since the ice ocean drag coefficient would be unrealistic according to the other numerical studies holland et al 2010 huot et al 2021 in the southern hemisphere the cost function of the winter ice extent sea ice drift and ice thickness are mainly improved by decreasing the atmospheric ice drag coefficient to 0 0008 the combination of low modeled sea ice extent and fast modeled sea ice drift by the control experiment is the leading cause for this optimization there needs to be more studies to validate the product of polar pathfinder in the antarctic and a few reported underestimations of the sea ice velocity heil and allison 1999 schwegmann et al 2011 therefore more observation and more higher resolution observations are needed to produce a more reliable sea ice optimization in the antarctic we attempted to address the reliability of the era5 dataset in simulating the sea ice distributions in the polar regions after the optimization the era5 experiment produced a better representation of the arctic summer sea ice extent than the jra25 experiment while the winter sea ice extent was similar to that of the jra25 experiment the most significant difference between the model results forced by the reanalysis products is that the era5 experiment much more accurately reproduces arctic sea ice thickness than the jra25 experiment even before the optimization therefore era5 could be a good alternative to previously used reanalysis datasets when studying the arctic sea ice dynamics in the southern ocean the optimized simulation improves the summer ice distribution and winter sea ice drift with smaller biases than those by using jra25 the optimized austral winter sea ice extent bias is still larger than in the jra25 experiment but we believe that the radiative forcing is more accurately produced by era5 jonassen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore there are other factors such as a not well solved mixed layer this could be addressed by considering thermodynamic parameters between the ice and ocean uotila et al 2012 in this study we do not tune them because of the lack of observations despite these improvements we should be cautious about the optimized sea ice drift since the low correlation between the simulated and observed in some areas in east antarctica adds uncertainty to the results 5 concluding remarks the era5 product is a new atmospheric reanalysis dataset with higher spatial and temporal resolutions than earlier reanalysis products such as jra25 this study shows the strengths and limitations of era5 as atmospheric forcing in the sea ice simulations using the global coupled ice ocean model mitgcm ecco2 by adjusting a few sea ice parameters we observe significant improvements in both hemispheres finally we note that this study did not consider the ice ocean thermodynamical parameters because of the lack of observational data for snow depth ocean mixed layer and stratification also we employed a constant ocean albedo a varying ocean albedo might be more appropriate for the incoming radiation on global scale and consequently the heat transports into higher latitudes this is certainly a limitation of the current study in the future the development of new sensors and reanalysis data for the snow and the ocean properties will greatly improve the sea ice

23770,coupled ice ocean models require an accurate performance of sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics to realistically simulate sea ice circulation in the polar regions however atmospheric surface variables from reanalysis products that force the models differ in spatial and temporal resolutions and there are also substantial inconsistencies in the distributions and magnitudes of these variables between the products therefore several key parameters in the models need to be adjusted for the models forced by different atmospheric reanalysis products this study compares the sea ice properties simulated by the previously optimized mitgcm ecco2 model forced by jra25 and forced by the recently released era5 the comparisons with high resolution satellite sea ice data reveal that the simulations forced by these two datasets significantly overestimate the arctic sea ice concentration in summer whereas the simulation forced by era5 underestimates the winter antarctic sea ice it is likely that the downward longwave radiation and wind stress regime in era5 is responsible for the underestimated antarctic sea ice cover we then optimize mitgcm ecco2 model forced by era5 by using green functions we consider six key parameters sea ice strength ice atmospheric drag coefficient ice ocean drag coefficient ice and snow albedos and sea ice salinity the optimized simulation significantly improves the sea ice distribution in both regions using a more realistic set of sea ice parameters the most significant improvement is in the antarctic where winter sea ice extent misfit decreases by 48 the optimized simulation reveals that era5 reproduces a closer representation of the arctic sea ice extent and thickness than jra25 in the southern hemisphere era5 simulates the sea ice drift better whereas the jra25 have the closest match to the sea ice extent despite the improvements further work is necessary for the antarctic where the lack of reliable observational data and limitations of the ocean model hinders the optimization keywords ecco2 reanalysis comparison jra25 era5 sea ice optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea ice is an essential element that regulates the climate system on regional scales rapid sea ice motion can create extreme sea ice conditions that threatens the polar navigation wang et al 2015 on large scales it affects ocean temperature by reflecting incoming solar radiation also it modifies momentum input from the atmosphere to the ocean park and stewart 2016 zheng et al 2019 in addition sea ice thermodynamic processes modulate the salinity gradient of the surface mixed layer and deep water formation gill 1973 thomas and dieckmann 2003 haumann et al 2016 ultimately this affects the strength and variability of the thermohaline circulation in polar regions and on a global scale over the last two decades intercomparison projects have been committed to improving numerical simulations of sea ice dynamics in both polar regions notz and community 2020 tsujino et al 2020 a good representation of the sea ice concentration thickness and drift is vital for climate studies wang et al 2019 which require accurate cryospheric performance in a global climate model rampal et al 2009 tietsche et al 2013 fenty et al 2017 diebold and rudebusch 2021 initially the optimization of sea ice models consisted of tuning several parameters to produce a realistic sea ice distribution miller et al 2006 tuned a stand alone sea ice model forced by era 40 using only three parameters namely atmosphere ice drag coefficient ice strength and albedo after optimization they were able to reproduce the sea ice extent and drift but with larger sea ice thickness than the observed they suggested that the forcing data were mainly responsible for the errors in the thickness distribution vancoppenolle et al 2009 included the effect of vertical salinity variations in sea ice to improve the sea ice distribution in a coupled global ocean ice model nemo lim3 they observed that the growth and melt rates in the arctic were mainly controlled by sea ice thermodynamics vancoppenolle 2005 and weak ocean stratification in the antarctic enhanced the impact of vertical ocean fluxes on sea ice properties hunke 2010 considered other tuning parameters such as conductivity ridging and ice ocean drag dynamics by varying the ocean friction velocity while keeping the albedo at its observed value of these parameters the ice ocean drag had the most substantial effect on sea ice thickness uotila et al 2012 conducted a series of sensitivity experiments to optimize sea ice distribution using a global coupled ocean sea ice model auscom forced by the core atmospheric forcing griffies et al 2009 more so they investigated the sensitivity of the sea ice model to 13 parameters and noted that antarctic sea ice properties were less sensitive to these parameters than arctic sea ice docquier et al 2017 studied the optimal value of ice strength for sea ice drift using the nemo lim model large values of ice strength resulted in lower values of sea ice drift in winter and spring but higher values in summer and fall in their study they could not find a specific value of sea ice strength to reproduce observed seasonal sea ice circulation rather they suggested that low and high values would better match the observations during the winter and summer seasons respectively chikhar et al 2019 showed that the use of spatially and temporally varying atmosphere ocean and ice ocean drag coefficients in the ice model could reduce the bias of sea ice drift moreno chamarro et al 2020 studied the effect of ice thickness distribution discretization itd on sea ice concentration using nemo lim in their study they pointed out that a single category of itd produced the worst results the optimized itd categories were dependent on the hemisphere increasing the thickness layers to five categories improved the prediction of arctic sea ice while increasing the thinner ice categories improved the prediction of antarctic sea ice besides sensitivity experiments other statistical methods have been developed to optimize sea ice parameters such as discrete inverse theory menke 2018 inverse theory used observations to adjust the numerical parameters of linear model systems even though ocean and ice models were nonlinear systems several approximations have been developed to address this limitation nguyen et al 2011 used a green functions to linearize the ice and ocean model and then adjusted 16 ocean and sea ice parameters yielding an improvement of 6 17 in sea ice extent 25 61 in sea ice thickness and 14 50 in sea ice velocity following same method ungermann et al 2017 showed that a simple category model with ice strength being linearly dependent on ice thickness is more representative of the ice distribution than a model with itd parameterization more recently green functions were employed to adjust the sea ice model parameters of the ogcms model forced with jra55 in the arctic ocean toyoda et al 2021 the optimized simulation yielded improvements of the sea ice drift of 15 20 the above studies used atmospheric reanalysis data to simulate the effect of the atmosphere on the sea ice reanalysis data combine an atmospheric model and data assimilation algorithms to construct continuous and gridded spatial temporal dataset at the moment we find a variety of reanalysis data depending on data assimilation algorithm resolution and atmospheric model onogi et al 2007 griffies et al 2009 hersbach et al 2020 in this study we consider two reanalysis products jra25 and era5 jra25 is a popular forcing dataset used in many modeling studies from regional to global scales the model used in this study mitgcm ecco2 was previously forced by jra25 and the model results were optimized under jra25 forcing menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 other studies have reported different optimizations for the same configuration using the jra 25 forcing nguyen et al 2011 fenty et al 2017 despite some significant improvements in the sea ice properties their results still reveal overestimations of the arctic sea ice thickness of about 1 1 5 m johnson et al 2012 fenty et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 the era5 is the very recent reanalysis product from ecmwf group it offers an upgrade in both temporal and spatial resolutions relative to jra25 with improved representations of downward longwave radiation winds humidity and air temperature graham et al 2019 tetzner et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 furthermore era5 displays a better representation of the near surface winds and cloud parameterization than other reanalysis products such as jra55 do which was recently adopted by the intercomparison project that involves new generation models ramon et al 2019 tsujino et al 2020 wang et al 2021 jonassen et al 2019 currently no studies are using era5 as atmospheric forcing for coupled ice ocean global simulations the capability of era5 to reproduce the global sea ice distribution has yet to be addressed thus we investigate the effects of era5 on the simulated sea ice properties and optimize the simulated sea ice properties using mitgcm ecco2 this study compares the sea ice distribution simulated by the coupled ocean sea ice model mitgcm ecco2 forced by era5 and jra25 using the previously optimized sea ice parameters under jra25 forcing menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 subsequently the mitgcm ecco2 model forced by era5 is tuned using green functions and inverse theory unlike other optimization methods such as kalman filter massonnet et al 2014 the method of green s functions does not need hundreds of simulations for optimizing the model results we achieved an optimized simulation of arctic and antarctic sea ice circulation as demonstrated by comparing the simulated results with the observed sea ice area and extent sea ice thickness and sea ice drift this paper is structured as follows the observational data the model description the model set up and experimental design are presented in section 2 differences between jra25 and era5 surface forcing variables and optimized experiment are analyzed in section 3 a discussion is given in section 4 the paper ends with concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methodology in this study mitgcm ecco2 was forced with two reanalysis atmospheric forcing datasets era5 and jra25 table 1 for the period 1979 2011 then we compare the model results with the observed sea ice concentration thickness and sea ice velocity table 1 to optimize the ocean sea ice model forced with era5 for the period 2002 2011 2 1 reanalysis products jra25 is a reanalysis product obtained using the jma s global spectra model and the three dimensional variational 3d var data assimilation analysis method onogi et al 2007 jra25 offers many of the atmospheric variables previously employed in climate models studies menemenlis et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 the horizontal resolution has 320 points eastward and 160 points from pole to pole with equidistant latitude spanning of 1 125 the distance between longitude points from the pole towards the equator varies from 1 113 to 1 21 the temporal resolution is 6 h for the period 1979 2012 this study uses specific humidity air temperature at 2 m from the surface precipitation wind speed at 10 m above sea level and both surfaces downward longwave and shortwave radiation among them precipitation longwave and shortwave radiation are fluxes divided over the 6 h forcing period to represent accumulation the jra25 dataset is a discontinuous product and thus its usage might be inappropriate we also looked at the difference between jra25 and jra55do as we will briefly mention later we did not observe significant differences between the jra25 and jra55 do cost functions era5 is another global atmospheric reanalysis dataset obtained from ecmwf and 4d var data assimilation techniques hersbach et al 2020 this dataset is an update of the era interim previously completed in 2019 apart from the already mentioned variables that we used in this study era5 offers vast atmospheric data spanning the period 1950 2020 with a temporal resolution of 1 h the horizontal grid is represented by a regular grid of 1440 points in the east direction and 720 points from pole to pole with a resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 degree between grid points 2 2 sea ice observations sea ice extent is computed using sea ice concentrations from the asi version 5 sea ice concentration product assuming that the sea ice concentration in the grid cell is above 15 spreen et al 2008 this product is obtained from the brightness temperatures recorded by two satellite sensors amsr e and amsr2 the first radiometer flew with the aqua satellite recording the brightness temperatures from 2002 2011 subsequently the sensor amsr2 mounted on the shizuku satellite has been in operation from 2012 until now for the arctic and antarctic we use the datasets with a spatial resolution of 6 125 6 125 km 2 overall this is a continuous daily record from 2002 to the present except for 2011 2012 when no satellite was operational the relative error depends on the sea ice concentration with 25 at 0 concentration to 7 at 100 the observed sea ice velocities come from the polar pathfinder daily 25 km ease grid sea ice motion vectors version 4 tschudi et al 2020 the daily sea ice drift vectors are derived from smmr ssm i ssmis amsr e and avhrr satellite observations arctic buoy data and ncep ncar reanalysis winds the record has a spatial resolution of 25 km covering the arctic ocean and antarctic the coarse horizontal resolution of the polar pathfinder does not provide data from the narrow straits of the canadian archipelago thus there is only data from the baffin and hudson bays the temporal coverage ranges from 1979 to 2019 the polar pathfinder has been extensively validated in the arctic ocean johannessen et al 2020 tschudi et al 2020 wang et al 2022 whereas only a few studies have attempted to validate it in the antarctic schwegmann et al 2011 kim et al 2016 farooq et al 2020 the sea ice drift error associated with this gridded data product is about 4 5 cm s the sea ice speed v s i is computed following 1 v s i u s i 2 v s i 2 where u s i and v s i are the sea ice horizontal velocity vectors in the x and y directions respectively sea ice thickness data are modeled by pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system piomas and global ice ocean modeling and assimilation system giomas the piomas and giomas use the same ice ocean model to numerically compute the sea ice properties zhang and rothrock 2003 the main difference between these two systems is the domain and assimilation piomas is a regional model of the arctic ocean that employs the sea surface temperature and the sea ice concentration from satellites to decrease the bias between the numerical solution and the observations giomas is a global model that only assimilates the sea ice concentration from satellites unlike the latter piomas has been validated in numerous studies and shows a good representation of the sea ice thickness in the arctic basin wang et al 2016 labe et al 2018 karvonen et al 2022 the validation of giomas is challenging in the southern hemisphere due to the lack of observations shi et al 2021 liao et al 2022 despite this it is still a relevant product that provides a continuous temporal and gridded spatial distribution the temporal resolution is monthly and the record covers from 1979 to the present it has a spatial resolution of 22 km the error is about 0 5 m 2 3 model description and experiment design 2 3 1 the models ocean model mitgcm ecco2 menemenlis et al 2008 is a high resolution nonlinear three dimensions global ocean and sea ice model based on the dynamic framework of mitgcm marshall et al 1997 the ocean module is developed using the boussinesq assumption and the anelastic approximation in an arakawa c grid the vertical mixing was parameterized using the k profile scheme of large et al 1994 mitgcm ecco2 uses a curvilinear cube sphere structured grid to prevent singularities at the poles the horizontal grid is about 18 km in size and has 50 layers in the vertical direction with layer thicknesses ranging from 10 m near the surface to 400 m near the bottom the global bathymetry is the s2004 which merges the smith and sandwell grid with the gebco one arc minute over shallow and polar areas marks and smith 2006 the green s function method menemenlis et al 2008 is employed to optimize the initial conditions atmospheric forcing fields and some parameterization schemes to reduce the discrepancies with observed data sea ice model the sea ice module is developed based on the viscous plastic dynamics rheology and thermodynamic sea ice model of zhang and hibler 1997 adapted to the arakawa c grid losch et al 2010 the sea ice momentum equation is computed following 2 m d u d t m f k u τ i c e a t m τ i c e o c e a n m ϕ 0 f where m is the mass of the ice and snow u the ice horizontal velocities f is the coriolis parameter ϕ 0 is the gradient of the sea surface height f is the divergence of the internal ice stress tensor and τ i c e a t m i c e o c e a n are the atmosphere and ocean stresses among them the τ i c e a t m i c e o c e a n and the internal ice stress tensor control the sea ice dynamics steele et al 1997 massonnet et al 2014 the ocean and ice stress are computed using quadratic functions 3a τ i c e a t m ρ a t m c i c e a t m u atm u r a t m u atm u 3b τ i c e o c e a n ρ o c e a n c i c e o c e a n u ocean u r o c e a n u ocean u where u atm ocean is the wind speed and ocean c i c e a t m i c e o c e a n is the ice atmospheric drag coefficient and ice ocean drag coefficient ρ a t m o c e a n is the air and water density and r a t m o c e a n are rotation matrices acting on the wind and ocean components the internal ice tensor is related to the ice strain and sea ice strength by the viscous plastic constitutive law hibler 1979 where the sea ice strength coefficient changes the maximum ice pressure 4 p m a x p c h exp c 1 c where p is the sea ice strength c the sea ice concentration c is a non units sea ice strength constant equal to 20 and h the sea ice thickness see losch et al 2010 for full equation detail the ice model uses a zero layer scheme to represent the heat flux transference from the surface to the bottom of the ice the zero layer scheme algorithm assumes that the heat capacity of the ice is zero all the internal heat sources are reduced to constant conductive heat ensuring a linear temperature profile across the different ice thickness categories or layers as a result the ice heats and cools instantaneously producing errors in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal sea ice however this limitation can be readily solved by slightly adjusting the sea ice parameters losch et al 2010 ungermann and losch 2018 the reader is referred to chapter 8 6 2 of the mitgcm manual for full detail of the thermodynamics package atmospheric forcing the atmospheric forcing fields are linearly interpolated in the model using the external forcing package of mitgcm the 10 m wind speed vector components are similarly converted into the wind stress on the ocean following 2 the bulk formulae solves the heat and freshwater fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean ice large and yeager 2004 that require the atmospheric temperature specific humidity precipitation runoff wind speed longwave and downward shortwave radiation the incidence of shortwave radiation varies depending on the albedo coefficient the ocean albedo coefficient is by default set 0 15 whereas total sea ice albedo depends on the amount of snow in the domain if there is no snow then the total albedo coefficient is set by the ice albedo besides if the snow is thicker than 0 15 m the effective albedo is set by the snow albedo at the interval between zero and the cutoff i e 0 15 m mitgcm computes the effective albedo following 5 α e m i n α i h s 1 0 15 c i α s α i α s where α e is the effective albedo α i ice albedo α s snow albedo h s snow thickness and c i is the ice concentration 2 3 2 model spin up the mitgcm ecco2 is forced by these two atmospheric reanalysis data from era5 aka control run and from jra25 for the period 1979 2011 we also compare era5 to jra55 do but we do not discuss it because we do not find significant differences with the jra25 comparison the largest differences were observed in the sea ice drift in east antarctica because of the higher resolution in jra55 do than its predecessor however we cannot draw a conclusion because the lack of reliable observation data hinders the study of sea ice motion in east antarctica see discussion in supporting material river runoff is included as salt fluxes using the climatological river runoff data obtained from the global runoff data centre we set the same sea ice parameters that were optimized for the original configuration of ecco2 using jra25 menemenlis et al 2008 chen 2013 the domain of integration is global but the comparison study is constrained to the arctic and antarctic see fig 1a and b note we divide each polar cap in five well known subdomains following the literature nguyen et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the simulated sea ice properties are then compared with the observations during 2002 2011 to assess the performances of the experiments see fig 1c 2 3 3 model optimization discrete inverse theory and green functions the sea ice model is tuned using discrete inverse theory and the green functions nguyen et al 2011 ungermann et al 2017 the inverse theory is a powerful tool to adjust the numerical model parameters using observations specifically inverse theory can estimate model parameters from linear systems by computing and minimizing the misfits between observations and model data this method uses weighted least squares to find the optimal parameters that produce the minimal misfit the misfit is defined as cost function following 6 j n 1 n w y y n o b s y n m o d e l 2 where y m o d e l is the model output to be compared and y o b s is the observations of size n w y are the weights associated to the observations equal to the covariance matrix r 1 since they are unknown that matrix is a symmetric band with the standard error in the diagonal and zeros in the rest of the matrix even though mitgcm ecco2 is a fully nonlinear model we can linearize the model around the control scenario by forcing the model with small perturbations in the numerical parameters also called green functions approach the equation that relates the linearized model and the observations can be written as 7 δy g δη ϵ where δη η η ref is the amplitude of the perturbed parameters to adjust δy y obs y ref is the difference between the observations and reference experiment and ϵ is the error of the model misfit with the covariance matrix r 1 g is a jacobian matrix with the sensitivity experiments or green functions for each specific parameter the dimensions of g are nxm where m is the number of numerical parameters therefore g dimensions can be vast but menemenlis et al 2008 proved that only a few parameters are needed to decrease the misfit of the numerical model significantly specifically g is parameterized like 8 g n m y 1 e x p 1 y 1 r e f η 1 η r e f y 1 e x p 2 y 1 r e f η 2 η r e f y 1 e x p m y 1 r e f η m η r e f y 2 e x p 1 y 2 r e f η

the model variable used to tune the model we employ the sea ice concentration the sea ice drift components and the sea ice thickness η are the parameters to be tuned in this study we consider sea ice strength sea ice atmospheric and sea ice ocean drag coefficients which have the leading role in the sea ice momentum equation steele et al 1997 massonnet et al 2014 the snow and sea ice albedos which control heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ice uotila et al 2012 sumata et al 2019 and the sea ice salinity which is usually not considered in the optimization but some studies point out its importance in the heat transference between the ice and ocean våge et al 2009 the sensitivity experiments or expm are run the last five years of the control simulation see fig 1c and table 3 for the reasons that are explained later we perform two successive optimization experiments the first sensitivity experiments use the numerical parameters from exp 1 9 and the second from exp 10 17 see table 3 the misfit is measured as the length j or cost function between the observations and the model control parameters perturbations by 9 j δη t w η δη δy g δη t w y δy g δη where t represents transpose vectors and matrices w y and w η are the weights of the observations and the model parameters equal to the covariance matrix r 1 and q 1 respectively upon minimizing 9 yields 10 δη g t w y g δη w η 1 g t w y δy where the optimized parameters are then obtained from η o p t η r e f δη weights and covariance matrix the observation covariance matrix or r is computed using standard errors and scaled over the data points nguyen et al 2011 ungermann et al 2017 the standard error follows the form σ n where sigma is the weighted monthly standard deviation and n is the number of time steps in each grid cell for the interested period the weighted monthly standard deviation for the sea ice concentration is calculated by mapping the daily sensor uncertainty reported by the manual see 2 2 sea ice observations similarly the standard error for the sea ice drift is computed using the daily polar pathfinder uncertainty in the dataset note that some areas with a low presence of sea ice produce tiny standard errors and thus unrealistic large misfits to address this limitation we only consider the points with more than 80 of ice presence in the record this filter ensures an adequate standard error but it removes most of the information in summer therefore we only considered the winter fields to optimize the sea ice model lastly piomas and giomas do not provide the spatial uncertainty of the product thus we set a constant sigma of 0 5 m the covariance matrix of the numerical parameters q is set differently from previous studies menemenlis et al 2008 nguyen et al 2011 in the literature q is set to zero because this problem is overdetermined i e the number observation points are much larger than the numerical parameters to solve upon setting q to zero we can observe unrealistic values for the predicted optimized albedo coefficient i e larger than one and also the proposed snow albedo coefficients are lower than the ice albedos we add restrictions to both hemispheres during the first optimization process to ensure that the albedos are acceptable see q 1 in table 3 note that this setting is not unique and slight variations of q 1 produce different results therefore we decide to conduct a second optimization experiment during this second process the q 2 in the antarctic is set to zero because the estimated parameters are physically possible see opt2 table 2 the arctic s q 2 is non zero because we observe a large estimated value of ice ocean drag coefficient of 0 008 unlike q 1 in the first optimization we set an equal distribution of the restrictions where the drag coefficients vary up to 0 001 respectively the remaining parameters are also restricted but it does not significantly alter the optimized numerical parameters see q 2 in table 3 3 results 3 1 comparisons between experiments forced by jra25 and era5 3 1 1 sea ice extent the sea ice extent cost functions computed from eq 6 for the period 2002 2011 in the arctic domain are shown in fig 2a the control experiment the run forced by era5 control exp in table 2 displays significant disagreements with the observations in summer when the arctic basin ab and barents kara seas bks account for more than half of the misfit in winter the arctic basin is fully covered by sea ice restricting the misfit to the greenland iceland and norwegian seas gins and the bks even though cost functions quantify the misfit between observations and the model simulation they do not provide information the type of bias fig 2b is a composite field plot of the sea ice extent mean with more than 15 sea ice concentration for march and september the sea ice extent of the control experiment is overestimated in summer see the black line and gray shaded area in particular the shelf seas located in the bks and ab regions have the largest root mean square errors see table 4 followed by the canadian archipelago caa and gins in winter the ice edge misfit moves southward due to the sea ice growth see white shaded area and black dashed line during this season the gins and the central barents sea have the most significant root mean square errors followed by the caa and the bering sea the results from the experiment forced by jra25 jra25 exp in table 2 are denoted with a magenta color at first glance jra25 exp displays a similar qualitative bias as the control in summer and winter in particular the jra25 exp performs better during winter with lower mean absolute errors in every zone but worse during the summer season in the baffin bay where there is a more considerable overestimation of sea ice extent than the control run the sea ice extent cost function in the antarctic domain is shown in fig 2c note that we observe larger misfits in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere the most significant misfit is located in winter september when the amundsen and bellingshausen seas abs have the largest bias followed by the western pacific ocean wpo weddell sea ws indian ocean io and lastly the ross sea rs with the lowest misfit the misfit distribution changes significantly in summer when the rs has the most considerable bias leaving the remaining seas in a lower misfit unlike the arctic ocean the antarctic domain displays different types of bias depending on the area the model generates lower sea ice concentration in abs and ws whereas it generates more sea ice in the io and wpo in the growing season see fig 2d there is a good agreement between the observations and the control during the melting season except for the underestimated sea ice extent in the ross sea although root mean square errors rmses associated with these areas agree with the misfit distribution their magnitude is much lower than we could expect from high values of cost functions as it happened in the arctic domain cost functions are computed using spatial standard errors that vary during the season thus rmses and cost functions are not expected to agree in magnitude the experiment forced using jra25 presents a better representation of sea ice misfit in the antarctic during both seasons there are a few exceptions in summer when the ws sea ice is slightly overestimated the disagreement between the two simulations control and jra25 exp is probably due to the effects of the existing disagreement between the two reanalysis datasets in forcing variables see figs 3 and 4 in particular the excess of winter sea ice extent in the bering strait could be explained by the deficiency of shortwave radiation which is not well counterbalanced by longwave radiation 3a and b the discrepancy between the sea ice extents in the gins could be a consequence of the different solar radiation and wind stress regimes over the east of greenland fig 3d in the southern hemisphere we can observe large differences between the radiative forcing products with longwave radiation anomalies larger than 35 w m2 during winter fig 4a besides we also observe significantly different antarctic wind regimes fig 4d that could explain the disagreement between the cost functions of the reanalysis data in abs rs and wpo 3 1 2 sea ice drift the cost functions for the sea ice drift during 2002 2012 for both domains are shown in fig 5 note that the low sea ice drift misfit in the arctic and antarctic during summer is a consequence of the observations filtering see 2 3 2 model optimization therefore we will only look into the winter sea ice properties figs 5a and 5b display the cost functions and probability density distribution functions pdf corresponding to the arctic ocean the most noticeable differences in the arctic are located in the gins and the caa the modeled gins mean sea ice drift is significantly faster than the observations see table 5 and its pdf shows a bimodal distribution whereas the observations have a quasi normal distribution with a mean about 10 cm s in addition its weak spearman correlation confirms that the model cannot reproduce the sea ice dynamics well in the east greenland current due to the coarse horizontal resolution dupont et al 2015 docquier et al 2017 the caa might be a bit challenging to understand the low difference between the sea ice mean drift and the strong correlation contrast with the cost functions and their different pdf distribution as mentioned in the previously pathfinder only offers data for the baffin and the hudson bay see section 2 2 therefore we can see that the sea ice drift distribution agrees well with observations but the southern part of the baffin bay is characterized by the prominent currents that are difficult to reproduce numerically for the same reasons as the greenland current bering strait displays large observe modeled mean sea ice drift differences despite of low cost functions and high spearman correlation it could a consequence of large standard error from the observations the ab and bk show a lower misfit which is supported by the mean variability pdf distribution and high correlations the sea ice drift misfit in the southern hemisphere varies mainly depending on the area and the reanalysis product both reanalysis products produce large misfits in the weddell sea and the indian ocean the modeled sea ice is faster than the observations showing that a small portion of the pdf distribution agrees with the observations fig 5d despite the speed magnitude disagreement there is a strong correlation in the abs and weddell sea table 5 implying a good resemblance of the sea ice drift pattern in these region on the other hand the modeled sea ice drift does not correlate at all in the indian ocean the polar pathfinder might be too coarse to catch the sea ice drift in this region since observational studies found much larger sea ice speeds heil and allison 1999 the misfit in the ross sea and western pacific ocean depends on the reanalysis data the disagreement between the reanalysis datasets is expected since they significantly differ in wind stress regime see fig 4d the control experiment has a lower misfit than jra25 exp but the pdf mean speed and non significant correlation might indicate that the observational uncertainty in the wpo is too large producing a lower misfit the ross sea ice drift is better solved by jra25 with mean values closer to the observations a slightly higher correlation and similar pdf distributions 3 1 3 sea ice thickness sea ice thicknesses in the arctic and antarctic domains are shown in fig 6 the control experiment agrees well with the seasonal arctic sea ice thickness we can only observe a few differences in the ab and caa where the model slightly overestimates the sea ice thickness by no more than 1 m see gray histograms fig 6b the jra25 exp also has a good agreement for most of the regions but has a large misfit in the sea ice thickness in the ab and caa during both seasons with differences being larger than 2 m over the central arctic see pink histograms fig 6b and larger than 6 meters in the caa the low misfit in gins bk and bs could be a consequence of the standard error of the piomas which was set to 0 5 both experiments reproduce the antarctic summer sea ice distribution see figs 6c and d with some biases of about 1 0 5 m in the northern weddell sea not shown the control has a large misfit in antarctic winter ice thickness whereas the jra25 exp had better distribution in winter in general we can observe that those misfits are associated with missing thinner ice see histograms 5d this behavior is expected since the radiative and wind stress forcing of era5 is much larger than jra25 thus the marginal ice zone is more susceptible to melting processes from a warm atmosphere and ocean note that this difference is larger in the rs and abs where the wind stress is more persistently drifting away the sea ice than elsewhere 3 2 optimized experiment as we introduced in the methodology inverse theory employs the winter sea ice properties to minimize the misfit length the sea ice cost fraction of control and optimized experiment is shown in fig 7 note the significant improvement of the sea ice properties in both hemispheres during the first optimization opt1 in general we can observe that the second optimization opt2 affects more the sea ice proprieties in boreal summer mainly due to the decrease and increase of the wet albedo and ice ocean drag coefficients respectively more specifically the arctic shows a decrease in the sea ice extent bias of 34 and 12 in summer and winter respectively there is no apparent improvement in the arctic sea ice velocity components in summer whereas there is a slight worsening of 2 in winter the sea ice thickness bias decreases by 2 in september and increases by about 1 in march in the antarctic the cost functions do not significantly vary from opt1 and opt2 note there is only a small decrease of the austral summer sea ice extent bias produced by the decrease of the wet snow albedo overall the sea ice extent significantly improves by about 35 and 37 in winter and summer respectively the antarctic sea ice drift misfit displays a slight improvement of 5 and 0 5 in winter and summer respectively lastly the sea ice thickness misfit changes slightly decreasing by 1 in winter but increasing by 0 5 in summer the above paragraph summarized the main changes in the optimization it is also instructive to evaluate the cost function associated with each subcategory since their sea ice cost fraction differs significantly in the sea ice properties as presented in the reanalysis product comparison we now summarize the main changes between the different areas in the arctic and antarctic 3 2 1 sea ice extent given that the observed sea ice concentration is the most reliable product among the products of sea ice properties in the two polar regions we regard sea ice cover as the most important metric for validating the sea ice simulations in our experiment the cost function and field of the sea ice extent for the second optimized experiment opt2 and the control experiment are shown in figs 8a and 8b for the period 2002 2011 the most significant change is found during summer when the ab bks and gins sea ice extent misfits decrease by 20 12 and 3 respectively there is also a moderate reduction of winter sea ice extent in the gins the bks and the bs where the misfits decreased by 12 3 and 2 respectively note that the reduction of the cost function is not fully appreciated in the rmsds of these areas see table 4 in fact we can observe that rmsds showed an improvement in the caa basin in summer and a slight worsening in winter not seen in the cost functions as rmsds do not consider the standard error of the observational data rmsds might wrongly estimate the misfit areas with large bias uncertainty antarctic sea ice extent is by the difference the largest improvement in optimization fig 8c shows that the misfit decreased by more than 35 in both seasons the most significant improvement is found in the ross sea where there is an expansion of the summer sea ice extent see fig 8d decreasing the misfit length by about 48 there is also a significant improvement in the abs sea ice extent during winter summer where the discrepancy between the model and observations decreases by about 33 6 besides the misfits in the weddell and the indian ocean deteriorate the summer sea ice extent by 15 and 5 respectively 3 2 2 sea ice drift the optimized simulation sea ice drift cost functions are shown in fig 9 we only include the winter sea ice drift because the observed summer sea ice drift is unreliable as mentioned earlier using the parameters in table 2 does not improve the winter arctic sea ice drift there is a worsening of about 25 of the sea ice drift with 21 of it being due to enhancing mean sea ice speeds in the gins and the ab see table 5 and fig 9a the ramp up of the sea ice drift in these regions is a direct effect of increasing the sea ice ocean drag and decreasing the sea ice strength miller et al 2006 dupont et al 2015 in the southern hemisphere there is a significant decrease of the bias by about 52 in winter sea ice drift in particular the rs has the largest change where the misfit is decreased by 26 we can readily see that the optimized simulation has better agreement with this region s sea ice velocity proprieties table 5 also same improvement can be seen in the pdf which is shown in fig 9b see blue shade the weddell sea also has a significant improvement of about 10 the velocity is still slightly faster than the observations but a bimodal structure now characterizes the pdf similar to the observations the abs sea ice drift shows a small decrease of the misfit by about 3 improving the sea ice drift profile see table 5 and fig 9b the remaining areas also register improvements in the misfit see fig 9 but the disagreement with the mean sea ice drift variability and weak spearman correlations might indicate that the observations in those areas are not suitable for optimizing the global model 3 2 3 sea ice thickness the optimized sea ice thickness is shown in fig 10 there is a noticeable worsening in the caa of 23 and 7 in winter and summer respectively producing sea ice thicker than 6 meters see histogram fig 10b the ab has a significant decrease in the misfit by 41 and 7 in summer and winter respectively in terms of sea ice thickness see the blue histogram in fig 10b the opt2 produces a thinner sea ice than the control experiment during summer and winter the gins sea ice thickness improves about 6 in winter and 2 in summer the bk and bs do not show a noticeable change the antarctic sea ice thickness significantly improves in winter with the bias being reduced by almost 50 see fig 10c more specifically the ross sea abs and ws misfit decrease by 31 10 and 7 respectively increasing the mean winter sea ice thickness distribution see histograms in fig 10b there is a worsening in summer with the misfits in the weddell sea and the indian ocean registering significantly increased biases of 40 and 43 respectively the misfits in the abs and the wpo also increase by about 23 and 5 respectively nevertheless the cost functions associated with the summer sea ice thickness are tiny see fig 6 and we can observe that by comparing the probability distributions from the control and the optimized experiment in fig 10e 4 discussion in this study mitgcm ecco2 is forced by two atmospheric reanalyses products era5 and jra25 we use observational sea ice property data from satellites buoys ncep ncar piomas and giomas reanalysis data to validate the model results and then we optimize the sea ice simulation forced by the era5 dataset using green functions and inverse theory a comparison between the control simulation forced by era5 and the earlier optimized simulation forced by jra25 shows significant differences in the arctic and antarctic the excess of arctic sea ice extent is probably a consequence of the high albedo values from the original configuration see table 2 and the uncertainty of radiation forcing from reanalysis datasets see fig 3a the era5 downward longwave radiation and wind stress mainly contribute to the underestimated sea ice concentration in the antarctic however intercomparison studies show that era5 has a better representation of the longwave radiation than other reanalysis products such as jra55 in the antarctic jonassen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore the low winter sea ice extent could be an effect of other factors such as a not well represented ocean mixed layer petty et al 2014 the simulations forced by jra25 and by era5 display a strong correlation for sea ice drift in most of the areas in winter with exceptions the greenland iceland and norway seas due to limitations of the model resolution to reproduce the east greenland coast current uotila et al 2012 the indian and western pacific ocean probably due to limitations of the observational product and therefore large observational uncertainties the overestimated mean sea ice drift in the antarctic might be a bias of the observations since the polar pathfinder tends to underestimate the sea ice drift schwegmann et al 2011 kim et al 2016 the large overestimations of arctic sea ice thickness in the jra25 experiment probably result from the low downward longwave radiation the optimized parameters obtained after minimizing the cost functions improve the sea ice properties in both domains note that the new albedo coefficients are more acceptable and had a closer agreement with the observations reported in the arctic hunke 2010 uotila et al 2012 the antarctic snow albedo is still slightly higher than losch et al 2010 estimations the disagreement between the different numerical parameters in both domains is expected firstly the arctic and antarctic are the regions where the mutual importance of sea ice related physical mechanisms significantly vary and thus the sensitivity of the numerical parameters vancoppenolle et al 2009 uotila et al 2012 maksym 2019 secondly the asymmetric radiation biasis produced by the atmospheric model cloud parameterization atmospheric models fail to reproduce the observed net radiation distribution from the top of the atmosphere to the surface thus this uncertainty is more significant in the south hemisphere where the cloud fraction is higher walsh et al 2009 jonassen et al 2019 lim et al 2021 thirdly the correction of the amplitude and phase limitations of the ice model s thermodynamic zero layer scheme is also dependent on atmospheric conditions and sea ice driving mechanisms losch et al 2010 ungermann and losch 2018 under these circumstances it is more than justified to use different sea ice parameters to optimized the sea ice model in both polar regions the optimized arctic configuration shows an expected decrease of sea ice extent mainly produced by the decrease increase of the sea ice albedo drag coefficients hunke 2010 unlike the jra25 the era5 solar radiation has a lower magnitude see fig 3a therefore the albedo coefficients in particular the wet albedo coefficients need to be lowered to increase the atmospheric heat flux to the sea ice to enhance the sea ice melting during the melting season a noticeable effect of increasing the atmospheric ice drag coefficient and lowering the sea ice strength is an increment of the sea ice momentum resulting in increased mean sea ice velocity and worsening in the gins and caa where the model resolution does not solve well the circulation dupont et al 2015 docquier et al 2017 the increased sea ice drift improves the ice thickness in the arctic basin excluding the caa region an increase in the ice momentum and decrease in strength produces an piling up of sea ice on the canadian coast steele et al 1997 docquier et al 2017 the configuration in the arctic can be further optimized by varying the ice ocean drag coefficient parameter however we decide not to do so since the ice ocean drag coefficient would be unrealistic according to the other numerical studies holland et al 2010 huot et al 2021 in the southern hemisphere the cost function of the winter ice extent sea ice drift and ice thickness are mainly improved by decreasing the atmospheric ice drag coefficient to 0 0008 the combination of low modeled sea ice extent and fast modeled sea ice drift by the control experiment is the leading cause for this optimization there needs to be more studies to validate the product of polar pathfinder in the antarctic and a few reported underestimations of the sea ice velocity heil and allison 1999 schwegmann et al 2011 therefore more observation and more higher resolution observations are needed to produce a more reliable sea ice optimization in the antarctic we attempted to address the reliability of the era5 dataset in simulating the sea ice distributions in the polar regions after the optimization the era5 experiment produced a better representation of the arctic summer sea ice extent than the jra25 experiment while the winter sea ice extent was similar to that of the jra25 experiment the most significant difference between the model results forced by the reanalysis products is that the era5 experiment much more accurately reproduces arctic sea ice thickness than the jra25 experiment even before the optimization therefore era5 could be a good alternative to previously used reanalysis datasets when studying the arctic sea ice dynamics in the southern ocean the optimized simulation improves the summer ice distribution and winter sea ice drift with smaller biases than those by using jra25 the optimized austral winter sea ice extent bias is still larger than in the jra25 experiment but we believe that the radiative forcing is more accurately produced by era5 jonassen et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore there are other factors such as a not well solved mixed layer this could be addressed by considering thermodynamic parameters between the ice and ocean uotila et al 2012 in this study we do not tune them because of the lack of observations despite these improvements we should be cautious about the optimized sea ice drift since the low correlation between the simulated and observed in some areas in east antarctica adds uncertainty to the results 5 concluding remarks the era5 product is a new atmospheric reanalysis dataset with higher spatial and temporal resolutions than earlier reanalysis products such as jra25 this study shows the strengths and limitations of era5 as atmospheric forcing in the sea ice simulations using the global coupled ice ocean model mitgcm ecco2 by adjusting a few sea ice parameters we observe significant improvements in both hemispheres finally we note that this study did not consider the ice ocean thermodynamical parameters because of the lack of observational data for snow depth ocean mixed layer and stratification also we employed a constant ocean albedo a varying ocean albedo might be more appropriate for the incoming radiation on global scale and consequently the heat transports into higher latitudes this is certainly a limitation of the current study in the future the development of new sensors and reanalysis data for the snow and the ocean properties will greatly improve the sea ice

23771,today advanced operational wave models e g wam swan or wavewatch iii provide very accurate solutions nevertheless under extreme weather conditions surface wave predictions can remain challenging indeed for relatively small scale tropical cyclones tcs rapidly evolving in time and space and possibly not always well sampled with observing systems extreme winds may not be properly described and generated wave systems correctly predicted in that context kudryavtsev et al 2021b recently proposed a simplified framework to rapidly assess evolving wave fields under typical tc conditions using self similar functions termed tropical cyclone wave geophysical model function tcw gmf the proposed methodology and initial results demonstrate robustness and efficiency 2d functions assimilating a small number of parameters maximum wind speed cyclone radius and translation velocity provide first guess estimates of surface wave heights wave lengths and directions within the intense tc core region following this strategy an improved tcw gmf version is proposed to also cover the tc far zone providing both wind wave information and outrunning swell conditions this new version more particularly accounts for the wave field sensitivity to the shape of the wind profile the procedure follows three main steps 1 estimation of the characteristics of pure wind waves using self similar matrices 2 determination of the contour limiting the transition between wind waves to swell regime using empirically derived universal functions 3 derivation of analytical functions to describe the swell parameters using initial parameters estimated at this transition contour wind waves and swell systems are further superposed to describe the wave parameters for mixed sea conditions in this study ibtracs are used to initialize the tc s wind profiles coordinates and translation velocities the proposed methodology is then tested using a large altimeter database more than 700 altimeter

atmosphere system marine atmosphere extremes are key integral parts of the climate change questions tropical cyclone tc rapidly evolving characteristics are important particularly to reliably assess air sea interaction processes numerical models still often fail to fully answer why different initial tc structures can result in different steady state maximum intensities for what appear the same environmental conditions tao et al 2020 coupled through the wave dependent momentum flux model analysis then often report significant impacts on the tc development and propagation track shimura et al 2022 complex tc wave fields can indeed result in wave induced stress misaligned with the surface winds to affect the storm dynamics from rapidly evolving wind speed and direction conditions the presence of multiple sometimes opposite wave systems can indeed occur using improved wind inputs advanced models wavewatch iii tolman 2009 wam hasselmann et al 1988 swan booij et al 1999 can now successfully forecast wave fields under extreme wind conditions kalourazi et al 2021 however model resolutions may not always properly cope with small and rapidly evolving intense extreme events with localized large wind speed gradients consequently swell waves radiating from intensive storms are reported to often be poorly predicted by forecast models both in magnitude and arrival time babanin et al 2019 for data driven and or ensemble methods for assimilation purposes more simple and rapid solutions may then be considered to provide general surface wave characteristics within the tc high intensity core but also in far field regions where swell systems originate and outrun given relatively simple and easy to parameterize forms of intense wind vortex generally well documented tc data from different weather services motivate to search for simple solutions for generated wave fields efforts already started from the middle of the last century bretschneider 1959 king and shemdin 1987 see the review in young 2017 today combined with available satellite observations parametric solutions seek to document the tc wind and wave conditions parametric solutions can then provide immediate first guess estimates for the maximum wave height and wave length and even 2d surface wave distributions these simplified methods essentially build on the extended fetch concept young 1988 young and vinoth 2013 kudryavtsev et al 2015 parametric solutions use self similar expressions for wave height length similar to fetch laws for the case of wave development under uniform winds originally suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 and further specified in a number of experimental studies see e g babanin and soloviev 1998 and reviewed in badulin et al 2007 zakharov et al 2019 presented by

yurovskaya et al 2022 results demonstrate very encouraging comparisons with measurements including wave directional properties derived from cfosat swim instrument hauser et al 2021 aouf et al 2021 originally designed to describe the primary wave system the longest wave parameters in the tc inner core area this tcw gmf is limited to radii less than 2 3 r m in this paper the main objective is to propose a new version to extend these 2d self similar solutions not solely constrained to the tc core area but valid at larger distances from the tc eye the proposed self similar solutions are further complemented by analytical solutions for swell systems outrunning the inner area and propagating in different directions away from the moving tc combined self similar and analytical solutions then provide a simple rapid and self consistent description of mixed seas in a tc region the arrangement of the paper is as follows self similar solutions for wind waves generated by a stationary tc and their transformation into swell systems escaping the inner storm area are presented in section 2 extension of these self similar solutions for a moving tc is given in section 3 section 4 summarizes the model and its input and output parameters comparisons between the model predictions and multi satellite altimeter significant wave height swh measurements are given in section 5 section 6

tangent axi symmetric flow e g zhang and uhlhorn 2012 though inflow angle variations can affect the resulting wave fields we do not account them in this study only considering the most typical case for a prescribed wind field stationary in this section or moving with a translation velocity v section 3 numerical calculations of the wave field parameters energy wavelength and wave direction are performed using the 2d parametric wave ray model proposed in kyc21a in total more than 400 runs were performed for different combinations of wind field parameters i e u m ranging form 30 to 70 m s r m from 10 to 100 km v from 0 to 12 m s and b from 0 5 to 2 5 resulting wave ray distributions were interpolated on a uniform grid taking the parameters of the wave train with maximum wavelength inside each grid cell this is done for both wind waves and swell systems pure wind waves are further analyzed to determine self similar relations for 2d tc cases using self similar scaling arguments suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 for a stationary tc and those by kudryavtsev et al 2015 for a moving tc 2 1 wind waves development 2 1 1 significant wave height and wavelength demonstrated in kyc21b their fig 6 space time evolution of wave parameters in a tc occurs from the vicinity of maximum winds towards the periphery it is thus natural to relate the wave fetch with the tc radius considering a stationary tc case it is tempting to check whether the classical scaling arguments suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 solely based on local wind velocity u distance from tc eye r and gravity acceleration g are capable to reproduce 2d numerical simulations more specifically can these solutions apply for a wide range of tc radii wind speed velocities and diverse wind profile parameter b as first guess estimates the peak wave height h and wavelength λ scaled by the local wind speed and gravity u 2 g can be suggested to follow the fetch laws similar to those under uniform wind conditions

fig 1a b note the suggested parameterizations for the wind wave swh and wavelength for a stationary tc differ from those proposed in kyc21b for the longest waves unlike kyc21b parameterizations 2 3 are now valid for wind waves either located in near and far zones of a tc moreover these parameterizations apply for arbitrary wind profile shape parameters b 2 1 2 wind wave directions based on the same simulations the distribution of the wave to wind direction obtained for pure wind waves is shown on fig 1c versus the dimensionless radius r d r g u 2 in contrast to wavelength and wave height parameters the wave direction cannot be universally described for different combinations of r m u m at r d 1 e 4 see the color indicating r m r m g u m 2 furthermore two regimes are clearly distinguished in fig 1c a first regime takes place at r d 1 5 1 0 3 where wind waves develop outward from the tc eye until they turn into swell in this case wind wave direction gradually deviates from the wind one the second regime takes place at r d 1 5 1 0 3 where the wind wave direction gradually tends towards tc periphery to be aligned with the wind these waves represent systems of almost developed wind waves that travel along the wind direction in the far zone of the cyclone these systems are superimposed to longer swell ones arising from wind waves developing within the tc inner region and propagating to the far zone it leads to mixed sea conditions the transition between these two regimes is quite smooth in terms of the dimensionless wave length and height parameters fig 1a b but sharp in terms of the wave directions fig 1c the fit of 2d parametric model simulations of wind waves direction φ relative to the local wind direction φ w is then suggested to be expressed as 5

growing decaying with distance from the tc center occurs at radius r 0 s w it also corresponds to the transition of wind waves to swell a parameterization of r 0 s w will be given below in section 2 2 2 at r r 0 s w the direction of developing wind waves is universally described in terms of r r m with a power exponent n depending on the wind shape parameter b fig 1d at larger radii φ φ w are scattered if plotted versus r r m for different tc parameters not shown but converge in terms of r d fig 1c solely depending on the local wind speed and distance from the tc center eqs 4 and 5 provide wind wave characteristics at any distance from a tc center and considered wind profiles note the wind shape parameter b is not needed to describe wave height and wavelength i e the local relations eqs 2 3 work for a variety of b hence these relations can be extended to an arbitrary holland like wind profile without the need of an exact fit 1 however for the wave direction r m u m and b must be specified and are required to determine r 0 s w and to use eq 5 at r r 0 s w fixing the wind shape parameter at b 1 5 leads to an error in the wave direction less than 20 if r 0 s w is determined correctly fig 1d which can still be tolerated if exact information about b is missing 2 2 swell systems trajectories of wind wave trains developing within the tc inner region display unwinding spirals towards the outer region at some distance r 0 s w from the tc eye the local inverse wave age α reaches a critical value about 0 85 and the wave train start to travel like a swell system 2 2 1 swell

emphasize that taking into account the cross ray gradient of the wave train directions is of decisive importance indeed this term ensures the attenuation of the energy l 1 with distance relations 6 and 8 give swh parameters to asymptotically decay more rapidly than weak turbulent solutions zaslavskii 2000 badulin and zakharov 2017 these authors considered hasselmann 1962 kinetic equation for weakly nonlinear deep water waves in the absence of dissipation and external forcing leading to a swell decay with fetch x h x 1 6 λ x 1 6 our model predicts stronger energy attenuation due to wave

and zakharov 2017 solutions yet these asymptotic estimates predict very weak decay and are absorbed in 6 8 by stronger attenuation mechanisms included in the present model already discussed e g in young 2006 2017 non linear wave wave interactions can influence the wave directional spectrum formation in presence of swell stabilizing the spectral shape to make it similar to fetch limited cases young 2006 revealed that swell overlapping the local wind sea in hurricanes often results in a directionally skewed spectrum providing smooth transition between the dominant low frequency swell and the high frequency wind sea components omnidirectional spectrum exhibits the features inherent to uni directional wind case based on these observations it was suggested that the balance between the wind forcing the nonlinear wave interactions and dissipation is not necessary to maintain such spectral shape the action of nonlinear interactions is itself capable of bringing a complex mixture of locally generated wind waves and remotely generated swells to a spectrum that has a shape typical for uni directional wind seas in our approach swell 6 is considered separately from the underlying wind waves and thus we do not account for the effects of their interactions on the other hand a smooth transition in spectral directional spreading functions from swell to wind seas was also found in kyc21b see their fig 13 where the spectral shape was formed through superposition of parameters of independent wave trains crossing a given area 2 2 2 wind waves to swell transition point the swell initial parameters in eqs 6 7 wave height h i length λ i and direction φ i should match the corresponding parameters of wind waves 4 5 at radial distance r 0 s w where the inverse wave age of wind

relation suggested by kyc21b their eq 10 r r m 5 r m 0 2 where only tc cases with b 1 5 were considered the threshold u c p 0 85 to define r 0 s w is quite arbitrary a more realistic transition between wind waves and swell using 2d parametric model simulations is not sharp it is due to the smooth attenuation of wind energy input close to regions where u c p 0 85 around which before and after wind waves still gain some wind energy accurate determination of r 0 s w may impact the swell parameters eqs 6 which are ultimately linked to wind waves parameters h i and λ i defined through egs 4 at radius r 0 s w comparisons between analytical approximations with direct numerical calculations then reveal that the factor 0 85 to define r 0 s w eq 9 may be sufficient to bring analytical solutions in line with full model simulations for wave development under stationary tc conditions 2 3 tcw gmf performance for stationary tcs following the suggested approximations resulting wave characteristics

while derived for r r m relations 4 5 also apply for smaller radii fig 3 fitted and numerically simulated wave characteristics are also found in consistent agreement for other values of b 3 wave self similarities for moving tc tc motions may strongly influence the wave developments in different sectors relative to the tc heading leading to asymmetrical wave fields even for a perfectly axi symmetric wind field in the right sector left in southern hemisphere wind direction and developing waves almost align with tc heading waves can longer be exposed to strong winds this is a so called wave trapping phenomenon dysthe and harbitz 1987 young 1988 bowyer and macafee 2005 causing strong wave intensification in the right front sector compared to a stationary tc condition in the left sector wind direction and developing waves are opposite to tc heading the residence time of waves in the storm area is reduced i e waves are underdeveloped compared to a stationary tc condition for moving tcs wave amplification in the right sector and attenuation in the left one can then result in strong wave field azimuthal asymmetries 3 1 wind wave development for a moving tc following kyc21b

generalizing 2d parametric model simulations for different tc parameters u m r m and v the self similar solutions 11 targeted the description of the primary the longest wave system parameters since the primary wave system can include both wind waves and swell the solutions 11 essentially based on the fetch law concept were mostly limited to the tc inner core r 2 3 r m in this area a swell system only reached its initial stage u c p 1 in the present development wind waves and swell are separately considered this can then include mixed sea conditions swell is already described analytically eqs 6 solutions for the pure wind waves are searched in self similar form 11 with reference parameters h 0 λ 0 and φ 0 corresponding to a stationary tc defined by 4 5 the new universal functions matrices 11 generalize the tc propagation effects using more than 300 simulations corresponding to different wind field parameters u m r m b and translation velocities v varying from 3 m s to 12 m s fig 4 discussed above only waves with inverse wave age u c p 0 85 are considered functions φ h φ λ and φ φ on fig 4 thus differ from those suggested in kyc21b their fig 18 obtained for the longest waves i e

apparently because the equivalent fetches for wave height and wave length x h and x λ in 12 generally differ for the same tc point see e g kyc21b their eq 18 note functions φ h φ λ φ φ and swell

right tc sector developing waves deviate from wind direction outwards from a tc center but become again aligned with the wind while sliding down in a tc reference system thus a transition to the swell regime occurs at larger radial distances compared to a stationary tc on the contrary in the left sector sliding waves have the direction perpendicular or almost opposite to the wind one and r s w shortens relative to r 0 s w comparable to functions in eqs 11 a self similar function c s w to define the contour r s w normalized by r 0 s w eq 9 is introduced 13 r s w r 0 s w c s w r m l c r m θ where l c r m is the critical fetch defined through maximum wind speed l c r m g u m 2 c c r u m 2 v 1 q the universal function c s w r m l c r m θ is obtained by averaging and smoothing the azimuthal radius distributions corresponding to u c p 0 85 versus the dimensionless parameter r m l c r m a set of simulations is used with different r m u m b and v the result is shown fig 5 a transect of the matrix c s w along r m l c r m const gives the radius of swell generation r s w θ for a tc with r m l c r m 1 only slow tcs for a fast tc r m l c r m 1 the swell contour is not closed sliding down to the backward tc sector in this region we can neglect swell waves small compared to slow tc conditions examples of simulated inverse wave age color and wave direction arrows fields are presented in fig

from the self similar matrix c s w eq 13 using c s w predictions quantitatively agree with direct simulations however see the wind waves directions in fig 6a c contouring wind waves transferring to swell systems cannot always be achieved to cover the whole considered area more particularly the top left sector of the tc from the numerical simulations swell systems in the top left sector traveling at 45 deg to the left from tc heading originate from wind waves initially developing in the right top region swell can then slide down in the tc reference system being underneath the longer wind waves developing inside the contour further gaining energy and accelerating in the region of maximum winds these waves finally leave the inner area through the contour in the top left direction propagating as swell this is not captured in our approach using the criterion u c p 0 85 for the longest waves in each grid cell however in some simulations e g on fig 6b such waves still continue their development as wind waves in the left half space relative to tc heading in this case the two contours u c p 0 85 are distinguished the outer one providing swell propagating in the top left direction to take into account these waves for all cases we artificially extend the contour obtained through eq 13 by adding a condition r s w max r s w 1 5 r m we hypothesize that at r 1 5 r m initial swell parameters derived from the universal matrices are close to observed ones in the top left sector indeed in this region φ h φ λ φ φ are determined from cases comparable to fig 6b where comparable swell

wind profile by the holland model 1 tc eye locations are used to estimate tc translation velocity resulting 2d wind fields are axi symmetrical with 20 inflow angle i e wind information from all 4 quadrants are equally weighted to approximate the wind profile the original main tc parameters u m and r m from the best track data are averaged over the previous 12 h thus the approximation procedure reduces to estimate the parameter b restricted to range from 0 5 to 2 5 in some cases the wind profile cannot exactly be fitted with function 1 i e the same parameters u m r m b cannot adjust to match both the inner and outer tc zones to solve this problem these regions are treated separately for the inner part wind data r30 r34 r50 r64 were weighted with inverse distance from tc center 1 r and at the periphery they were weighted with r the maximum wind was always kept at distance r m from tc eye but unfixed and limited by 0 9 1 u m in the near zone and 0 5 1 u m in the far zone the envelope of these two fits i e the maximum wind speed at each radius then is treated to be the desirable wind profile only tcs with maximum winds higher than 30 m s are further considered in total 95 tc cases

kyc21a wave ray simulations fig 9i j where rays are superimposed so that the longest waves lie atop the shorter ones maximum swh and wavelength predictions also agree with young 2017 or young and

qualitatively and quantitatively within 20 accuracy consistent with altimeter derived swh red an other case tc larry formed in north atlantic in september 2021 is presented fig 10 this tc attained wind speeds up to 55 m s at the moment of cryosat 2 acquisitions tc larry was moving with velocity 4 m s being a typical example of slow tc r m l c r m 80 the wind profile could not be accurately fitted with single function 1 with a marked sharp wind decay followed by a saturation at 20 m s at radii 150 300 km fig 10a thus two profiles with u m 55 m s r m 74 km b 2 5 and u m 36 m s r m 74 km b

compare black solid and dashed lines in fig 10h the measured swh can solely be attributed to swell here the local wind sea is fully developed as confirmed using the pierson moskovitz pierson and

fig 10h the overall consistency with the along track modeled wind waves confirms the tcw gmf good performance further note an interesting feature of swell wave field predicted by tcw gmf fig 10d energy intensification in the north east direction due to ray focusing effect a similar peculiarity is seemingly revealed in the altimeter measurements see along track swh profile red in fig 10h at y 350 400 km though local peak in swh measurements is not well expressed we may still speculate that it originates from swell ray focusing at large distance this effect can also be masked due to

correlation coefficient is 0 84 and root mean square error is 1 1 m with no significant bias 5 3 model limitations to recall the tcw gmf is developed to provide simple first guess estimates of wave fields generated by an arbitrary tc in deep water neglecting surface current effects tcw gmf predictions are not intended to compete with advanced wind wave generation models or even with full 2d parametric model kyc21a thus to derive and test the self similar functions quite rough assumptions can be accepted especially regarding the axi symmetric wind field and constant averaged values of wind profile parameters tc heading velocity and direction for the whole period of waves development nonetheless fig 12 demonstrates an overall convincing agreement of tcw gmf predictions with observed swh values it proves the method robustness and can then be used for rapid ensemble estimations and or comparisons with satellite observations being fast and easy to use tcw gmf provides a steady solution for waves developing under the same conditions for at least 12 h and thus it cannot correctly reproduce the wave fields in complicated situations when tc trajectory is far from a strait line during this time or if the wind field changes rapidly and also in the very beginning of tc evolution the solutions are not applicable if the wind profile differs significantly from holland like function the result can also be imprecise if the wind inflow angle differs much from 20 as assumed in this study or if the wind angular distribution is strongly asymmetrical in this case the wave field is mostly determined by the wind shape in left quadrant besides this tcw gmf can underestimate the waves in a tc eye r r m as swell originated in the right up quadrant is considered only at radii starting from 1 5 r m in all these situations either full kyc21a model example of its implementation in arbitrary space and time varying wind conditions is given in kudryavtsev et al 2022 or advanced spectral models like wam and wavewatch iii can be preferable 6 summary simple self similar solutions termed tropical cyclone wave geophysical model function tcw gmf to describe wave fields

23771,today advanced operational wave models e g wam swan or wavewatch iii provide very accurate solutions nevertheless under extreme weather conditions surface wave predictions can remain challenging indeed for relatively small scale tropical cyclones tcs rapidly evolving in time and space and possibly not always well sampled with observing systems extreme winds may not be properly described and generated wave systems correctly predicted in that context kudryavtsev et al 2021b recently proposed a simplified framework to rapidly assess evolving wave fields under typical tc conditions using self similar functions termed tropical cyclone wave geophysical model function tcw gmf the proposed methodology and initial results demonstrate robustness and efficiency 2d functions assimilating a small number of parameters maximum wind speed cyclone radius and translation velocity provide first guess estimates of surface wave heights wave lengths and directions within the intense tc core region following this strategy an improved tcw gmf version is proposed to also cover the tc far zone providing both wind wave information and outrunning swell conditions this new version more particularly accounts for the wave field sensitivity to the shape of the wind profile the procedure follows three main steps 1 estimation of the characteristics of pure wind waves using self similar matrices 2 determination of the contour limiting the transition between wind waves to swell regime using empirically derived universal functions 3 derivation of analytical functions to describe the swell parameters using initial parameters estimated at this transition contour wind waves and swell systems are further superposed to describe the wave parameters for mixed sea conditions in this study ibtracs are used to initialize the tc s wind profiles coordinates and translation velocities the proposed methodology is then tested using a large altimeter database more than 700 altimeter measurements crossing different tcs during 2020 2022 years are used demonstrating overall convincing agreements between first guess estimates and satellite data graphical abstract keywords tropical

tropical storms form about half of them become strong hurricanes with possible devastating impacts extreme wind events occupy an increasing place in the mass media with direct social and economic implications human loss material destructions etc also expected to become more destructive in the future as a consequence of global warming moreover acknowledging their impacts on the coupled ocean atmosphere system marine atmosphere extremes are key integral parts of the climate change questions tropical cyclone tc rapidly evolving characteristics are important particularly to reliably assess air sea interaction processes numerical models still often fail to fully answer why different initial tc structures can result in different steady state maximum intensities for what appear the same environmental conditions tao et al 2020 coupled through the wave dependent momentum flux model analysis then often report significant impacts on the tc development and propagation track shimura et al 2022 complex tc wave fields can indeed result in wave induced stress misaligned with the surface winds to affect the storm dynamics from rapidly evolving wind speed and direction conditions the presence of multiple sometimes opposite wave systems can indeed occur using improved wind inputs advanced models wavewatch iii tolman 2009 wam hasselmann et al 1988 swan booij et al 1999 can now successfully forecast wave fields under extreme wind conditions kalourazi et al 2021 however model resolutions may not always properly cope with small and rapidly evolving intense extreme events with localized large wind speed gradients consequently swell waves radiating from intensive storms are reported to often be poorly predicted by forecast models both in magnitude and arrival time babanin et al 2019 for data driven and or ensemble methods for assimilation purposes more simple and rapid solutions may then be considered to provide general surface wave characteristics within the tc high intensity core but also in far field regions where swell systems originate and outrun given relatively simple and easy to parameterize forms of intense wind vortex generally well documented tc data from different weather services motivate to search for simple solutions for generated wave fields efforts already started from the middle of the last century bretschneider 1959 king and shemdin 1987 see the review in young 2017 today combined with available satellite observations parametric solutions seek to document the tc wind and wave conditions parametric solutions can then provide immediate first guess estimates for the maximum wave height and wave length and even 2d surface wave distributions these simplified methods essentially build on the extended fetch concept young 1988 young and vinoth 2013 kudryavtsev et al 2015 parametric solutions use self similar expressions for wave height length similar to fetch laws for the case of wave development under uniform winds originally suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 and further specified in a number of experimental studies see e g babanin and soloviev 1998 and reviewed in badulin et al 2007 zakharov et al 2019 presented by kudryavtsev et al 2021b hereinafter kyc21b one of such solutions synthesizes results of wave simulations derived from a consistent 2d parametric wave ray model kudryavtsev et al 2021a hereinafter kyc21a solutions termed tropical cyclone wave geophysical model function tcw gmf provide first guess estimated fields of wave height wave length and wave direction inside a given tc prescribed by its maximum wind speed u m radius r m and translation velocity v the 2d parametric model and self similar solutions were tested using multi mission satellite observations for the hurricane goni 2020 yurovskaya et al 2022 results demonstrate very encouraging comparisons with measurements including wave directional properties derived from cfosat swim instrument hauser et al 2021 aouf et al 2021 originally designed to describe the primary wave system the longest wave parameters in the tc inner core area this tcw gmf is limited to radii less than 2 3 r m in this paper the main objective is to propose a new version to extend these 2d self similar solutions not solely constrained to the tc core area but valid at larger distances from the tc eye the proposed self similar solutions are further complemented by analytical solutions for swell systems outrunning the inner area and propagating in different directions away from the moving tc combined self similar and analytical solutions then provide a simple rapid and self consistent description of mixed seas in a tc region the arrangement of the paper is as follows self similar solutions for wind waves generated by a stationary tc and their transformation into swell systems escaping the inner storm area are presented in section 2 extension of these self similar solutions for a moving tc is given in section 3 section 4 summarizes the model and its input and output parameters comparisons between the model predictions and multi satellite altimeter significant wave height swh measurements are given in section 5 section 6 summarizes results of the paper 2 wave self similarities for stationary tcs throughout this study a tc wind field is prescribed in the axi symmetric form suggested by holland 1980 1 u r u m 2 u m r m f r m r b exp r m r b 1 r f 2 2 r f 2 where f is the coriolis parameter r is distance from the tc center u m is maximum wind speed r m is the radius of maximum winds b is the wind profile shape parameter varying in the present study within the range 0 5 2 5 a constant surface wind inflow angle is assigned the wind vector is thus everywhere directed 20 inflow angle towards the tc eye from the tangent axi symmetric flow e g zhang and uhlhorn 2012 though inflow angle variations can affect the resulting wave fields we do not account them in this study only considering the most typical case for a prescribed wind field stationary in this section or moving with a translation velocity v section 3 numerical calculations of the wave field parameters energy wavelength and wave direction are performed using the 2d parametric wave ray model proposed in kyc21a in total more than 400 runs were performed for different combinations of wind field parameters i e u m ranging form 30 to 70 m s r m from 10 to 100 km v from 0 to 12 m s and b from 0 5 to 2 5 resulting wave ray distributions were interpolated on a uniform grid taking the parameters of the wave train with maximum wavelength inside each grid cell this is done for both wind waves and swell systems pure wind waves are further analyzed to determine self similar relations for 2d tc cases using self similar scaling arguments suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 for a stationary tc and those by kudryavtsev et al 2015 for a moving tc 2 1 wind waves development 2 1 1 significant wave height and wavelength demonstrated in kyc21b their fig 6 space time evolution of wave parameters in a tc occurs from the vicinity of maximum winds towards the periphery it is thus natural to relate the wave fetch with the tc radius considering a stationary tc case it is tempting to check whether the classical scaling arguments suggested by kitaigorodski 1962 solely based on local wind velocity u distance from tc eye r and gravity acceleration g are capable to reproduce 2d numerical simulations more specifically can these solutions apply for a wide range of tc radii wind speed velocities and diverse wind profile parameter b as first guess estimates the peak wave height h and wavelength λ scaled by the local wind speed and gravity u 2 g can be suggested to follow the fetch laws similar to those under uniform wind conditions

simulations of significant wave height swh and wavelength scaled by g u 2 are found to be well described with universal functions of the dimensionless distance from tc eye r g u 2 close to 2 3 though these self similar fetch laws 2 3 were originally derived for uniform wind conditions they are surprisingly valid for spatially non uniform tc wind field fig 1a b fits of simulated data using 2 3

d λ 0 λ f d tanh λ λ f d where h 0 and λ 0 are the estimates of peak wave height and wavelength of wind waves either fully developed or not fits corresponding to 4 are shown with black solid lines on fig 1a b note the suggested parameterizations for the wind wave swh and wavelength for a stationary tc differ from those proposed in kyc21b for the longest waves unlike kyc21b parameterizations 2 3 are now valid for wind waves either located in near and far zones of a tc moreover these parameterizations apply for arbitrary wind profile shape parameters b 2 1 2 wind wave directions based on the same simulations the distribution of the wave to wind direction obtained for pure wind waves is shown on fig 1c versus the dimensionless radius r d r g u 2 in contrast to wavelength and wave height parameters the wave direction cannot be universally described for different combinations of r m u m at r d 1 e 4 see the color indicating r m r m g u m 2 furthermore two regimes are clearly distinguished in fig 1c a first regime takes place at r d 1 5 1 0 3 where wind waves develop outward from the tc eye until they turn into swell in this case wind wave direction gradually deviates from the wind one the second regime takes place at r d 1 5 1 0 3 where the wind wave direction gradually tends towards tc periphery to be aligned with the wind these waves represent systems of almost developed wind waves that travel along the wind direction in the far zone of the cyclone these systems are superimposed to longer swell ones arising from wind waves developing within the tc inner region and propagating to the far zone it leads to mixed sea conditions the transition between these two regimes is quite smooth in terms of the dimensionless wave length and height parameters fig 1a b but sharp in terms of the wave directions fig 1c the fit of 2d parametric model simulations of wind waves direction φ relative to the local wind direction φ w is then suggested to be expressed as 5 φ φ w a r r m n r r 0 s w φ φ w φ 0 b log r d r 0 h e v r r 0 s w with a 40 n 0 3 b φ 0 80 r 0 100 b 8 h e v 0 5 1 tanh 0 4 log r d 8 1 0 4 according to 5 a transition between regimes of wind waves growing decaying with distance from the tc center occurs at radius r 0 s w it also corresponds to the transition of wind waves to swell a parameterization of r 0 s w will be given below in section 2 2 2 at r r 0 s w the direction of developing wind waves is universally described in terms of r r m with a power exponent n depending on the wind shape parameter b fig 1d at larger radii φ φ w are scattered if plotted versus r r m for different tc parameters not shown but converge in terms of r d fig 1c solely depending on the local wind speed and distance from the tc center eqs 4 and 5 provide wind wave characteristics at any distance from a tc center and considered wind profiles note the wind shape parameter b is not needed to describe wave height and wavelength i e the local relations eqs 2 3 work for a variety of b hence these relations can be extended to an arbitrary holland like wind profile without the need of an exact fit 1 however for the wave direction r m u m and b must be specified and are required to determine r 0 s w and to use eq 5 at r r 0 s w fixing the wind shape parameter at b 1 5 leads to an error in the wave direction less than 20 if r 0 s w is determined correctly fig 1d which can still be tolerated if exact information about b is missing 2 2 swell systems trajectories of wind wave trains developing within the tc inner region display unwinding spirals towards the outer region at some distance r 0 s w from the tc eye the local inverse wave age α reaches a critical value about 0 85 and the wave train start to travel like a swell system 2 2 1 swell

emphasize that taking into account the cross ray gradient of the wave train directions is of decisive importance indeed this term ensures the attenuation of the energy l 1 with distance relations 6 and 8 give swh parameters to asymptotically decay more rapidly than weak turbulent solutions zaslavskii 2000 badulin and zakharov 2017 these authors considered hasselmann 1962 kinetic equation for weakly nonlinear deep water waves in the absence of dissipation and external forcing leading to a swell decay with fetch x h x 1 6 λ x 1 6 our model predicts stronger energy attenuation due to wave

and zakharov 2017 solutions yet these asymptotic estimates predict very weak decay and are absorbed in 6 8 by stronger attenuation mechanisms included in the present model already discussed e g in young 2006 2017 non linear wave wave interactions can influence the wave directional spectrum formation in presence of swell stabilizing the spectral shape to make it similar to fetch limited cases young 2006 revealed that swell overlapping the local wind sea in hurricanes often results in a directionally skewed spectrum providing smooth transition between the dominant low frequency swell and the high frequency wind sea components omnidirectional spectrum exhibits the features inherent to uni directional wind case based on these observations it was suggested that the balance between the wind forcing the nonlinear wave interactions and dissipation is not necessary to maintain such spectral shape the action of nonlinear interactions is itself capable of bringing a complex mixture of locally generated wind waves and remotely generated swells to a spectrum that has a shape typical for uni directional wind seas in our approach swell 6 is considered separately from the underlying wind waves and thus we do not account for the effects of their interactions on the other hand a smooth transition in spectral directional spreading functions from swell to wind seas was also found in kyc21b see their fig 13 where the spectral shape was formed through superposition of parameters of independent wave trains crossing a given area 2 2 2 wind waves to swell transition point the swell initial parameters in eqs 6 7 wave height h i length λ i and direction φ i should match the corresponding parameters of wind waves 4 5 at radial distance r 0 s w where the inverse wave age of wind

relation suggested by kyc21b their eq 10 r r m 5 r m 0 2 where only tc cases with b 1 5 were considered the threshold u c p 0 85 to define r 0 s w is quite arbitrary a more realistic transition between wind waves and swell using 2d parametric model simulations is not sharp it is due to the smooth attenuation of wind energy input close to regions where u c p 0 85 around which before and after wind waves still gain some wind energy accurate determination of r 0 s w may impact the swell parameters eqs 6 which are ultimately linked to wind waves parameters h i and λ i defined through egs 4 at radius r 0 s w comparisons between analytical approximations with direct numerical calculations then reveal that the factor 0 85 to define r 0 s w eq 9 may be sufficient to bring analytical solutions in line with full model simulations for wave development under stationary tc conditions 2 3 tcw gmf performance for stationary tcs following the suggested approximations resulting wave characteristics

while derived for r r m relations 4 5 also apply for smaller radii fig 3 fitted and numerically simulated wave characteristics are also found in consistent agreement for other values of b 3 wave self similarities for moving tc tc motions may strongly influence the wave developments in different sectors relative to the tc heading leading to asymmetrical wave fields even for a perfectly axi symmetric wind field in the right sector left in southern hemisphere wind direction and developing waves almost align with tc heading waves can longer be exposed to strong winds this is a so called wave trapping phenomenon dysthe and harbitz 1987 young 1988 bowyer and macafee 2005 causing strong wave intensification in the right front sector compared to a stationary tc condition in the left sector wind direction and developing waves are opposite to tc heading the residence time of waves in the storm area is reduced i e waves are underdeveloped compared to a stationary tc condition for moving tcs wave amplification in the right sector and attenuation in the left one can then result in strong wave field azimuthal asymmetries 3 1 wind wave development for a moving tc following kyc21b

right tc sector developing waves deviate from wind direction outwards from a tc center but become again aligned with the wind while sliding down in a tc reference system thus a transition to the swell regime occurs at larger radial distances compared to a stationary tc on the contrary in the left sector sliding waves have the direction perpendicular or almost opposite to the wind one and r s w shortens relative to r 0 s w comparable to functions in eqs 11 a self similar function c s w to define the contour r s w normalized by r 0 s w eq 9 is introduced 13 r s w r 0 s w c s w r m l c r m θ

from the self similar matrix c s w eq 13 using c s w predictions quantitatively agree with direct simulations however see the wind waves directions in fig 6a c contouring wind waves transferring to swell systems cannot always be achieved to cover the whole considered area more particularly the top left sector of the tc from the numerical simulations swell systems in the top left sector traveling at 45 deg to the left from tc heading originate from wind waves initially developing in the right top region swell can then slide down in the tc reference system being underneath the longer wind waves developing inside the contour further gaining energy and accelerating in the region of maximum winds these waves finally leave the inner area through the contour in the top left direction propagating as swell this is not captured in our approach using the criterion u c p 0 85 for the longest waves in each grid cell however in some simulations e g on fig 6b such waves still continue their development as wind waves in the left half space relative to tc heading in this case the two contours u c p 0 85 are distinguished the outer one providing swell propagating in the top left direction to take into account these waves for all cases we artificially extend the contour obtained through eq 13 by adding a condition r s w max r s w 1 5 r m we hypothesize that at r 1 5 r m initial swell

quadrants are equally weighted to approximate the wind profile the original main tc parameters u m and r m from the best track data are averaged over the previous 12 h thus the approximation procedure reduces to estimate the parameter b restricted to range from 0 5 to 2 5 in some cases the wind profile cannot exactly be fitted with function 1 i e the same parameters u m r m b cannot adjust to match both the inner and outer tc zones to solve this problem these regions are treated separately for the inner part wind data r30 r34 r50 r64 were weighted with inverse distance from tc center 1 r and at

account swell waves starting from contour 13 fig 9d g brings excellent agreement with altimeter measured swh fig 9e tcw gmf derived swh and wavelength fields are close to that obtained from direct kyc21a wave ray simulations fig 9i j where rays are superimposed so that the longest waves lie atop the shorter ones maximum swh and wavelength predictions also agree with young 2017 or young and vinoth 2013 extended fetch model with input parameters r m 32 km u m 46 m s and v 1 m s giving 7 4 and 152 m respectively along track wave height profiles are shown in more detail in fig 9h illustrated swh of wind waves black solid line and swell dashed have close magnitudes ranging from 3 m at the periphery to 5 m closer to the tc center their superposition blue symbols gives values qualitatively and quantitatively within 20 accuracy consistent with altimeter derived swh red an other case tc larry formed in north atlantic in september 2021 is presented fig 10 this tc attained wind speeds up to 55 m s at the moment of cryosat 2 acquisitions tc larry was moving with velocity 4 m s being a typical example of slow tc r m l c r m 80 the wind profile could not be accurately fitted with single function 1 with a marked sharp wind decay followed by a saturation at 20 m s at radii 150 300 km fig 10a thus two profiles with u m 55 m s r m 74 km b 2 5 and u m 36 m s r m 74 km b 1 4 were merged to fit the wind observations the envelope of these profiles was then used to input the tcw gmf larry s tcw gmf reconstructed wind waves fields reveal expected strong azimuthal

shown fig 10e and swh transects along the altimeter track are given fig 10h for this tc case the energy of wind waves several radii ahead the tc center is dominated by its swell counterpart i e compare black solid and dashed lines in fig 10h the measured swh can solely be attributed to swell here the local wind sea is fully developed as confirmed using the pierson moskovitz pierson and moskowitz 1964 expression for the height h p m of fully developed waves under the action of constant wind u 14 h p m 0 21 u 2 g with local wind speed taken from the altimeter product gray circles in fig 10h the overall consistency with the along track modeled wind waves confirms the tcw gmf good performance further note an interesting feature of swell wave field predicted by tcw gmf fig 10d energy intensification in the north east direction due to ray focusing effect a similar peculiarity is seemingly revealed in the altimeter measurements see along track swh profile red in fig 10h at y 350 400 km though local peak in swh measurements is not well expressed we may still speculate that it originates from swell ray focusing at large distance this effect can also be masked due to deviation of swell trajectories e g swell refraction in the presence of intense ocean currents hurricane niran rapidly traveling in south pacific at its terminal stage on 7th march 2021 fig 11 is a

southern hemisphere relative to tc heading sea state usually does not reach very large swh and wavelength values 6 m and 150 m respectively in the case of niran direct model simulations fig 11f g generally predict the same swh and wave length magnitudes but slightly differ at the tc periphery in the back sector providing more detailed and complicated wave ray distributions wave height distributions for a similar tc suggested by young 1988 fig 11h plotted for northern hemisphere and tc moving upward and young 2017 estimates of maximum wave height and wavelength 6 6 m and 154 m respectively also correspond well to tcw gmf and kyc21a results altimeter track passed 200 km ahead the tc where both modeled and measured swh give consistent values around 2 3 m fig 11e finally a scatter plot comparing modeled and observed swh along all 703 selected altimeter tracks is presented fig 12 color indicates the number of data points in a given 25 25 cm wave height range obtained correlation coefficient is 0 84 and root mean square error is 1 1 m with no significant bias 5 3 model limitations to recall the tcw gmf is developed to provide simple first guess estimates of wave fields generated by an arbitrary tc in deep water neglecting surface current effects tcw gmf predictions are not intended to compete with advanced wind wave generation models or even with full 2d parametric model kyc21a thus to derive and test the self similar functions quite rough assumptions can be accepted especially regarding the axi symmetric wind field and constant averaged values of wind profile parameters tc heading velocity and direction for the whole period of waves development nonetheless fig 12 demonstrates an overall convincing agreement of tcw gmf predictions with observed swh values it proves the method robustness and can then be used for rapid ensemble estimations and or comparisons with satellite observations being fast and easy to use tcw gmf provides a steady solution for waves developing under the same conditions for at least 12 h and thus it cannot correctly reproduce the wave fields in complicated situations when tc trajectory is far from a strait line during this time or if the wind field changes rapidly and also in the very beginning of tc evolution the solutions are not applicable if the wind profile differs significantly from holland like function the result can also be imprecise if the wind inflow angle differs much from 20 as assumed in this study or if the wind angular distribution is strongly asymmetrical in this case the wave field is mostly determined by the wind shape in left quadrant besides this tcw gmf can underestimate the waves in a tc eye r r m as swell originated in the right up quadrant is considered only at radii starting from 1 5 r m in all these situations either full kyc21a model example of its implementation in arbitrary space and time varying wind conditions is given in kudryavtsev et al 2022 or advanced spectral models like wam and wavewatch iii can be preferable 6 summary simple self similar solutions termed tropical cyclone wave geophysical model function tcw gmf to describe wave fields generated by a tc have been derived first wave parameters for stationary tc conditions are calculated solutions are found similar to classical fetch laws for the wind wave development with the radial distance from tc center replacing the fetch definition radial profiles of the wind wave heights wavelengths and direction obtained for stationary tc conditions are considered as the reference ones

description of swell emitted away from the tc intense area emanating along a contour marking the wind waves to swell transition this contour is defined from the universal function matrix providing boundaries where the local inverse wave age of wind waves reaches the threshold value u c p 0 85 these proposed self similar solutions were validated using more than 700 altimeter measurements with

23772,biophysical models often require shelf scale domains to map larval dispersal over several weeks presenting a computational challenge this can be overcome by decreasing model spatial resolution however nearshore processes which potentially play a significant role in larval dispersal will inevitably be unresolved here we evaluate how simulated larval dispersal in the nearshore is sensitive to model spatial resolution we use an unstructured finite element hydrodynamic model of a topographically complex coastline in north wales uk which includes headlands bays and channels at four different spatial scales 50 100 250 500 m to compare the influence of spatial resolution on transport and dispersal patterns of particles released within the nearshore region within 1 km of the shore in the higher resolution 50 and 100 m simulations particles generally travelled offshore more quickly and further 18 than in the coarser 250 and 500 m simulations this had important implications for potential connectivity along the coast for the lower resolution simulations retention of particles near source sites was increased by 50 and whilst the magnitude of connectivity among discrete regions along the coast was also increased by 27 the number of connected regions was reduced by 9 compared with the higher resolution simulations our results based on a case study in a highly energetic and topographically complex region suggest that model spatial resolution of 100 m should be used for dispersal studies in the nearshore zone these findings add to growing evidence of the importance of using appropriately scaled models when simulating the transport of material within and out of the coastal zone with many applications such as marine ecology marine biosecurity marine spatial planning and marine pollution keywords coastal currents dispersion lagrangian analysis ocean model connectivity north wales data availability i have shared a link to my code in the manuscript 1 introduction the life cycle of the majority of marine organisms begins with pelagic stages e g larvae eggs spores which are non or weak swimming and hence whose fate is determined by physical transport processes lester and ruttenberg 2005 shanks 2009 simons et al 2013 for many benthic organisms these early life stages are their only chance for population and genetic connectivity understanding dispersal within the marine environment is an inherently difficult problem as both intrinsic e g swimming behaviour pelagic larval duration mortality and extrinsic e g ocean currents factors influence dispersal trajectories pineda et al 2007 because larvae are small obtaining in situ observations of their dispersal patterns is challenging and generally impractical but see davis and butler 1989 in lieu of observational data biophysical models also referred to as particle tracking models use simulations from hydrodynamic models of the evolution of ocean currents and mixing rates to estimate the potential lagrangian transport of particles in this case larvae these models can predict the potential dispersal of millions of virtual larvae under a range of environmental conditions and biological traits a valuable application of particle tracking models is to simulate larval transport from source to sink i e from the natal population to a suitable settlement location hence predicting the pattern and magnitude of population connectivity there are a number of uncertainties associated with larval dispersal modelling some of these uncertainties are biological in nature e g unknowns and variabilities in their pelagic larval duration and behaviour within the water column or during settlement while others are related to the uncertainties in the representation of the physical environment e g model resolution and model parameterisation although several studies have considered the sensitivity of propagule dispersal to a range of physical biological processes and model parameterisations hufnagl et al 2017 robins et al 2013 simons et al 2013 treml et al 2015 there remains no one size fits all approach to estimating larval transport and dispersal as a baseline regardless of the complexity of either known or estimated larval life history traits biophysical models should be driven by physical parameters that have been simulated at appropriate spatio temporal resolutions for the question in hand many benthic invertebrate taxa as well as both pelagic and demersal fish spawn in coastal regions which exhibit a complex flow regime influenced by tides rivers wind and waves these energetic and dynamic physical coastal processes have implications for the transport and dispersal of larvae as currents interact with undulating topographic features and channels vasile et al 2018 to produce local residual flows such as tidally asymmetric currents longshore currents nickols et al 2012 rip currents fujimura et al 2014 largier 2003 morgan et al 2018 talbot and bate 1987 upwelling dauhajre et al 2019 suanda et al 2018 recirculating eddies and estuarine circulation kim et al 2010 pastor et al 2018 and axial convergent fronts robins et al 2012 the role of active swimming in determining patterns of dispersal is variable but generally low and certainly for the period directly after spawning larvae tend to behave passively drake et al 2018 hence for nearshore taxa coastal currents are critical in determining transport and the likelihood of dispersal offshore however coastal currents and turbulent mixing can vary greatly over small spatial and temporal scales especially near undulating coastlines and islands and consequently their role in dispersing larvae is poorly understood at present dauhajre et al 2019 drake et al 2018 morgan et al 2018 nickols et al 2012 particle tracking models have been developed over a variety of spatio temporal scales e g dauhajre et al 2019 demmer et al 2022 lynge et al 2010 ricker and stanev 2020 vasile et al 2018 whilst model spatial resolution has generally increased over the past few decades there has been a lack of consistency in approach swearer et al 2019 with a trade off between increasing resolution and model extent owing to computational limitations larval dispersal over several weeks has the potential to connect distant populations hundreds of kilometres apart hence modelling approaches have typically adopted coarse resolution 1 5 km 3d models to cover these large distances within computational constraints e g bode et al 2019 drake et al 2018 king et al 2021 torrado et al 2021 being focussed on offshore circulation these coarse models often do not resolve coastal dynamics however computational capacity is now at the stage where mesoscale of the order 100 km models can resolve coastal currents at appropriate resolution e g 50 m this capacity is necessary for dispersal studies of coastal species that need to simulate larval transport in coastal environments as well as long distance offshore dispersal pathways therefore there is a need to better understand the influence of model spatial resolution on simulated larval dispersal patterns so that a standardised approach can be designed for future studies we hypothesise that nearshore residual currents tend to restrict the offshore dispersal of larvae spawned within the coastal zone therefore biophysical models that do not accurately resolve nearshore residual currents may over estimate offshore dispersal and population connectivity we compare the relative transport and dispersal of particles released from a topographically complex and tidally energetic coastline using five hydrodynamic models of different spatial resolutions we aim to explore this uncertainty within the context of other uncertainties in dispersal due to oceanographic conditions and pelagic larval duration 2 methods we applied a hydrodynamic model to five different mesh configurations to investigate how spatial resolution influenced our estimations of particle dispersal within the coastal zone see section 2 1 these model domains covered a section of topographically complex coastline of north wales uk located within the irish sea the model domain was selected as it encompasses a variety of hydrodynamic conditions over a short domain e g energetic flows around headlands quiescent water within bays tidally asymmetric flow through channels and recirculating flows around islands the stretch of coast also varies in aspect relative to the predominant tidal flow further the north wales coastline is well developed with numerous anthropogenic activities within the coastal region e g harbours marinas a major seaport holyhead fishing activities tourism sea defences as well as offshore renewable energy infrastructure the hydrodynamics of the irish sea are driven mainly by tidal currents robinson 1979 and the coastal waters remain well mixed throughout the year the tidal range reaches 8 6 m at llandudno tide gauge b fig 1a and tidal currents can exceed 3 m s 1 off headlands of northwest anglesey where mean water depth is up to 40 m within 1 km of the shore along much of the coastline in the region the mean water depth remains 10 m up to 1 km offshore with large intertidal zones in many of the bays we developed a particle tracking model coded in matlab version r2020a and run on a supercomputer supercomputing wales that used the simulated coastal currents to advect particles within the coastal region see section 2 2 we considered the implications of using relatively low hundreds of metres and high tens of metres resolution hydrodynamic models of coastal regions on the transport and resulting dispersal patterns of hypothetical particles these particles were representative of passive larvae and here we consider their dispersal from nearshore release locations for up to two weeks from spawning this period is relevant to a huge range of coastal benthic invertebrate species living in shallow coastal regions with a pelagic duration of two weeks or more see o connor et al 2007 for a review for those taxa with long pelagic larval duration such as many crustaceans and molluscs this period represents the early stage larvae eggs when active swimming or other behaviours tends to be extremely limited 2 1 hydrodynamic model we applied telemac to our different grid configurations which is an open source hydrodynamic modelling system www opentelemac org specifically telemac 2d version 8p2r0 this model solves the shallow water equations saint venant equations in two dimensions depth averaged using finite element or finite volume methods hervouet 2000 which is a good approximation for the dominant barotropic flows of the region where mean spring tidal ranges are 6 m robinson 1979 horrillo caraballo et al 2021 see section 2 2 model validation the hydrodynamic model was run in finite element mode based on unstructured triangular computational mesh grids facilitating increased model resolution in nearshore regions with coarser resolution offshore this unstructured grid capability maximises the resolution of coastal processes while optimising computational efficiency the model included alternate wetting and drying of model nodes in the inter tidal regions and is therefore a sound choice for shallow coastal domains e g robins et al 2014 davies and robins 2017 we developed five model configurations of the north wales coastal region with different horizontal spatial resolutions in the nearshore zone fig 2 50 m r50 100 m r100 250 m r250 and 500 m r500 in each model configuration all triangular elements between the shoreline and 1 km were constrained to not exceed one of 50 100 250 500 m in edge length as focus was on the difference in model resolution in the coastal region the mesh edge lengths were each set to increase to 750 m by 20 km offshore the rate of edge length growth depending on the nearshore resolution after which mesh edge lengths extended to 3 km at the model boundary a fifth grid was generated of the same spatial resolution as the highest resolution grid r50 the purpose being to confirm that any differences in particle transport simulation was a consequence of hydrodynamic mesh resolution rather than configuration see results section this fifth grid was constrained in the same way as described above 50 m resolution within 1 km from shore increasing to 750 m within 20 km from shore but the mesh generator was re run so that individual triangular elements were configured differently

digital terrain model grid resolution of 1 16 1 16 arc minutes 115 m were interpolated onto each grid over which the high resolution 2 4 m uk hydrographic office multibeam data were mapped where available these datasets were used as they were the highest resolution bathymetric datasets which covered the entire model domain the model was forced by tidal boundary conditions with no other

diffusivity coefficient was set to 0 2 and this sets the value of the coefficient of viscosity dynamic turbulent across the domain for both model stability as well as to the greatest degree possible maintaining a consistent courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the internal model timestep varied between the simulations 1 2 5 and 10 s for r50 r100 r250 and r500 respectively each model was run for a 42 day period 40 days of which were output for analysis including harmonic analysis used in the model validation which excluded two days of model spin up sufficient for tides only simulations of this domain simulated water depth and u and v components of current velocity were output at telemac 2d grid nodes at 15 min instantaneous intervals 2 2 hydrodynamic model validation simulated

fast current environments compared here are the decomposed t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 amplitude and phase of the combined uv components of the m 2 and s 2 current speeds calculated from the

was developed in matlab version 2020a using the model outputs from the telemac 2d simulations available from https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7371420 hypothetical particles were used to represent planktonic larvae and were advected at 15 min intervals by the simulated tidal currents magnitude and direction from telemac 2d for consistency this 15 min hydrodynamic model output interval and particle tracking model timestep were the same between models of different resolutions to ensure the runs were purely deterministic thus enabling direct quantitative comparison no additional sub grid scale diffusion or random walk term was included in the particle tracking model generally speaking for the relatively high resolution computational grids used here additional stochastic models used to represent sub grid scale diffusion processes are much less important than for coarser e g kilometre scale models which do not resolve small scale mixing processes marinone et al 2007 robins et al 2013

m offshore at a spacing of 1 km between 306 release points along the north wales coast fig 1b the mean water depth in the model bathymetries at these sites 500 m offshore varied between 3 m e g south coast of the llŷn peninsula and 47 m e g north coast of anglesey one particle was released from each location every 6 h over 14 days 56 particles per site in total to encompass particle releases throughout the spring neap tidal cycle fig 2c each particle was set to propagate for 14 days of pelagic transport the particles simulated were entirely passive i e density and behavioural complexity were omitted as the focus here is on how physical hydrodynamic processes affect dispersal as such these analyses did not include differential distribution in the water column through larval swimming or particles sinking rising particles were sometimes advected onto land referred to later as interactions with the coastline where land was defined as a minimum water depth of 0 1 m when this occurred particles were returned to their position during the previous timestep this approach similarly employed in previous studies e g coscia et al 2020 was necessary to avoid particles getting stranded on land which also includes particles being beached due to model wetting and drying in particular soon after release from the coastal release points this method was a compromise between computational capacity and realistic simulation to quantify the difference in lagrangian transport between individual particle trajectories on the different grid configurations we calculated the root mean square error rmse for each particle trajectory from r100 r250 and r500 relative to the corresponding particle trajectory from the r50 simulations using 4 r m s e i 1 n r 5 0 i r x i 2 n where rx is either r100 r250 or r500 i 1 n where n is the number of logged trajectory points i e 14 days 24 h 15 min timestep 1344 2 4 lagrangian alongshore connectivity to understand the pattern of and difference in alongshore connectivity from simulations with different mesh resolution we divided the 306 release sites into 30 nearshore zones extending from the shore to 5 km offshore fig 1b as much as was possible each zone encompassed nine release sites but this was not always possible due to the undulating coastline thus the strength of connectivity between any two zones was weighted by the number of release sites within the source zone the connectivity between the 30 zones was estimated by recording all particle locations at each timestep throughout the designated 14 day period as for earlier results this method incorporates spring neap tidal variations and releases over waxing and waning stages of the tidal cycle i e includes all 56 particle releases two zones were considered connected i e source to sink connection when a particle released from within a source zone entered a different zone sink and self recruitment was recorded when a particle released from within a source zone was recorded within that same zone at any time during the 14 days from release i e along any particle s entire trajectory although somewhat arbitrary this approach was consistent for each grid resolution and was considered appropriate since the focus was on comparative general patterns of nearshore connectivity between the runs of different resolutions to generate the connectivity matrices the total number of counts within each zone was divided by the number of timesteps within the 14 days since the focus is on the comparison of the relative strength and extent of connectivity for the various hydrodynamic model resolutions for visualisation of the connectivity matrices this value was normalised by the maximum within the matrix being plotted 3 results 3 1 dispersal and offshore transport at the mesoscale the predicted distribution of particles after 14 days was broadly similar between all model resolutions fig 4 particles that were released from exposed and energetic headlands e g the north coast of anglesey and the llŷn peninsula where tidal flows are strong e g 2 3 m s 1 were advected further offshore and were dispersed more widely after 14 days than those released in quiescent bays where tidal currents are generally weaker fig 3 this led to fewer particles accumulating around exposed headlands e g around the north of anglesey when compared with bays e g caernarfon bay fig 4 however a more detailed comparison revealed clear differences in the simulated transport among model resolutions for example in r50 particles released from the northeast coast of anglesey congregated more densely 10 km directly offshore red circle in fig 4 in comparison to the same particles being transported a similar distance in r500 but further to the northeast blue circle in fig 4 also illustrated in fig 6ii particles tended to be advected further offshore in r50 than in the coarser resolution models most notably on the south coast of the llŷn peninsula northwest of anglesey e g average offshore dispersal distances of 27 km r50 and 16 km r500 and west of the great orme offshore transport is considered here as occurring when a particle is transported outside of the 1 km nearshore zone which is often resolved by only one grid cell or part of a grid cell in studies using structured grid hydrodynamic models coscia et al 2020 drake et al 2018 faillettaz et al 2018 wood et al 2021 the majority of the transport of particles offshore occurred within the first few days after release fig 5 with 30 of released particles transported at least 1 km offshore after one day for all grid configurations i e 70 remained within the nearshore zone the finest resolution grid r50 was the most dispersive with 30 of all released particles remaining in the nearshore 1 km after 14 days the coarsest resolution grid r500 was the most retentive in the nearshore zone with 46 remaining after 14 days for the other grids 34 r100 and 40 r250 remained in the nearshore zone after 14 days proportionally in each of the different grid simulations more particles were advected offshore from headland release sites and quicker than from bay release sites the coarser grids tended to produce more particle interactions with the coast i e more particles were simulated as being advected onto land the percentage of total number of released particles which interacted with the coastline after 14 days were 15 r50 14 r100 16 r250 and 18 r500 around half of these interactions with the coastline occurred within four days after release from the 500 m offshore release points when advected onto land a particle was returned to its position during the previous timestep resulting in disproportionately lower total cumulative distance travelled for these particles which in turn contributed to the relatively lower cumulative distance travelled for the lower resolution grid configurations fig 5b after 14 days from release the mean cumulative distance travelled by particles released from all sites was highest in r50 and lowest in r500 fig 5b where on average particles in r50 had travelled 75 km further than those in r500 this pattern is consistent with r50 being the most dispersive grid configuration for particles released within the nearshore zone 3 2 influence of grid resolution on particle trajectories the rmse was calculated for each release location and presented as the mean rmse per release site over 14 days particle transport fig 6 as outlined in section 2 1 a second configuration of the high resolution 50 m resolution mesh was generated using the same resolution constraints as r50 but with triangular mesh elements configured differently to confirm that the differences in the particle trajectories were due to differences in the model spatial resolution as opposed to an artefact of comparing simulations with different mesh configurations this comparison confirmed that mesh configuration was not driving the observed differences in the simulated dispersal e g the mean rmse between these two high resolution r50 grids after one day was 40 72 less than for all other grid resolutions compared with r50 grid resolution had the greatest influence on particle trajectory within the first day from release with the greatest difference between r50 r500 mean rmse of 2 km and the difference for r50 r250 and r50 r100 being 82 and 50 of that respectively the effect of grid resolution on the difference between particle trajectories the mean rmse tended to decrease with time as the particles were advected further offshore the rmses converged and after one week the mean rmse values for the three resolution comparisons with r50 were within 5 the largest differences in trajectories relative to r50 tended to occur along sections of exposed coastline and energetic headlands fig 6 with the largest differences for particles released from sites 40 70 140 160 175 215 blue ellipses on fig 6a similarly the lowest rmse were consistently for particles released within bays some example particle trajectories are illustrated in fig 6i iv for r50 black lines and r500 blue lines these are only illustrative snapshots in time of one particle release from each site sites i 108 ii 230 iii 250 and iv 78 as the differences between the trajectories varied over the tidal cycle the rmse was consistently greater for particles released during spring tides e g up to 19 higher for particles released over two days during spring tide in comparison to those released over two days during neap tide r50 vs r500 further with regards to changes in rmse with time proportionally the rmse was greatest closest to time of release for all resolution grid configurations in comparison with r50 for example within the first 24 h from release a maximum rmse of 6 8 km site 155 black arrow on fig 6a was calculated for r50 r500 after 14 days the maximum rmse r50 r500 was 25 km release site 78 blue arrow on fig 6a in comparison to a minimum rmse of 2 3 km at site 6 in a bay 3 3 influence of grid resolution on alongshore connectivity the schematic of a connectivity network map based on r50 fig 7a illustrates generally a high level of alongshore connectivity of the region this was expected given the close proximity of the coastal sites 1 km apart strong coastal currents up to 3 m s 1 and the simulated pelagic larval duration of 14 days the broad pattern of alongshore connectivity during 14 days from release was comparable between the four model grids however there were differences in the strength of the connections and some key differences in connectivity extent fig 7b c quantified below overall the total strength of individual connections increased for coarser grid resolutions r500 had 27 stronger connectivity overall than r50 r250 was 4 stronger than r50 and r100 had comparable overall strength of connectivity with r50 notably stronger alongshore connectivity in r500 blue colours in fig 7c occurred in both directions on the southern llŷn peninsula e g source sink zones 3 to 2 and 4 to 5 in the southern mouth of the menai strait source zone 14 to sink zones 12 and 13 and westward along the northeast coast of anglesey source zone 24 to sink zone 23 there was also consistently higher alongshore connectivity southwest along the north coast of the llŷn peninsula e g source zone 12 to sink zone 11 in r500 in comparison to r50 these zones in which r500 had considerably higher strength of connectivity than r50 tended to be in bays or along relatively quiescent sections of coastline e g zones 2 5 10 11 25 28 for all grid resolutions self recruitment rates were highest in these bays characterised by shallow water large intertidal regions and with weak residual flows 0 05 m s 1 the predominant section of coastline in which r50 had highest alongshore connectivity was along the west coast of anglesey zones 14 17 except for at zone 15 where the self recruitment within r500 was 90 higher due to an increase in particle interaction with the coastline in the low resolution model configuration the maximum strength of connectivity self recruitment occurred in zone 30 with r50 r100 r250 predicting around 30 self recruitment increasing to 34 for r500 despite the strongest overall connectivity in the coarsest resolution r500 the total number of connected zones increased for finer grid resolution i e r50 had 9 more source sink connections than r500 although r50 had a comparative number to both r100 and r250 2 difference there were 37 unique source sink connections in r50 vs r500 i e where a unique source sink connection exists in one connectivity matrix but not the other whereas only 12 unique source sink connections existed in r500 vs r50 the most significant difference in the connectivity networks was for the r500 simulation in comparison to the other grid configurations in the area of the menai strait a tidal channel 500 m wide see location on fig 4 in each of r50 r100 and r250 there was residual southwest transport from release zone 27 to sink zones 11 14 however the r500 simulation was not sufficiently spatially resolved to facilitate transport of particles through the menai strait in r500 the strait was only one grid cell wide and the simulated tidal currents were unrealistically low facilitating no transport of particles 4 discussion many marine species which have pelagic larval stages spawn in the nearshore region where coastal currents are often complex with considerable spatio temporal variation in flow structure this poses a challenge for biophysical modelling here we show that estimates of lagrangian transport and dispersal in the coastal zone are sensitive to horizontal spatial resolution of the unstructured grid ocean model used this work highlights the importance of carefully considering the appropriate scales for coastal dispersal simulations based on our case study of the north wales region uk biophysical models of relatively coarse spatial resolution 250 m and 500 m were found to overestimate nearshore retention by up to 50 within the first two weeks from release compared with finer spatial resolution models 50 m and 100 m the highest resolution 50 m simulation was the most dispersive with particles travelling the greatest cumulative distance 20 more than the coarsest resolution simulation further the coarser resolution simulations overestimated the strength of connectivity between adjacent coastal regions while underestimating the potential dispersal range this work highlights the importance of model setup for dispersal studies within the nearshore zone of topographically complex coastlines 4 1 should biophysical models be downscaled as much as possible hydrodynamic model resolution becomes particularly important when considering biologically closed systems that are connected over small spatial temporal scales and which are dependent on locally spawned larvae in contrast to open systems that are connected over large spatial scales tens to hundreds of kilometres and hence can usually be simulated using lower resolution regional scale hydrodynamic models gawarkiewicz et al 2007 in the nearshore region hydrodynamic processes differ fundamentally from the deep ocean due to the presence and interaction with the seafloor and the coastline coastal and nearshore hydrodynamic processes span a range of spatial scales including shelf scale circulation kilometres hundreds of kilometres guihou et al 2018 holt et al 2009 ricker and stanev 2020 river plumes and coastal flooding several metres hundreds of kilometres horner devine et al 2015 kulp and strauss 2019 o donnell et al 2008 to small scale surf zone currents and wave processes several centimetres to tens of kilometres fujimura et al 2014 gawarkiewicz et al 2007 hally rosendahl et al 2015 these dynamic processes interact and tend to overlap presenting a challenge of scale for hydrodynamic modellers for dispersal studies the use of long term and large domain models with lower resolution e g simulating trajectories over hundreds of kilometres and several weeks months is computationally efficient but may not yield the most accurate predictions nor be appropriate in coastal settings while the spatial resolution of biophysical models has increased in recent years see swearer et al 2019 and references therein this increase is not in proportion to computational capacity leading to the question should biophysical models be downscaled further for dispersal studies of coastal species where it is important to resolve high resolution coastal currents scale matters because of practical constraints to modelling computational capacity time data availability etc decisions must be made regarding the scales of any modelling study for example how many particles should be released how should the release site be parameterised over which temporal and spatial scales should the computations be made since model resolution both spatial and temporal has been shown to affect estimates of direction distance and relative dispersal of particles dauhajre et al 2019 hufnagl et al 2017 kvile et al 2018 lynge et al 2010 putman and he 2013 it is important that we better understand the impact of our chosen spatial scale on estimates of material dispersal including larval dispersal dauhajre et al 2019 demonstrated using a structured grid model that simulated lagrangian transport was sensitive to horizontal model resolution they found that a relatively coarse resolution hydrodynamic model 1 km failed to resolve the sub mesoscale shelf currents predominantly downwelling of the region santa barbara channel california and concluded that a model of horizontal scale 36 100 m in the nearshore was required although the hydrodynamics in the region were considerably different to our shallow and tidally energetic complex coastline and the hydrodynamic model was a structured grid model rather than the unstructured grid approach that we used the overarching results agree with ours i e coarse resolution models underestimate offshore transport of material released in the coastal zone 4 2 consequences of hydrodynamic model resolution for lagrangian transport along a topographically complex coastline the telemac 2d model used here is a two dimensional depth averaged tide only model see hervouet 2007 and so the resolution of the coastal processes are simplified in the vertical plane e g excluding wind and wave driven currents and density driven flows although the depth averaged currents take into account reduced flows associated with the bottom boundary layer whilst the tide only model setup reduces the realism of the simulations it does allow for an initial comparison of the changes in dispersal resulting from decreasing the grid resolution all efforts were made to minimise any potential artefacts of hydrodynamic model set up on simulated currents such as decreasing the model s internal timestep as the model grid resolution became finer to keep a comparable courant number which defines how quickly information propagates through one grid cell crucially the comparison of the two high resolution 50 m simulations confirms that it is grid spatial resolution as opposed to grid configuration which drives the differences in simulated particle trajectories since the rmse between the two simulations with 50 m nearshore grid resolution was much less than when comparing simulations from coarser resolutions grids 40 72 less section 3 2 understanding the processes driving differences in predicted dispersal among models of differing spatial resolution is important in making recommendations on appropriate methodology our simulations predicted barotropic tidal currents and their interactions with complex and shallow coastal topography to produce a range of secondary coastal flows such as recirculating eddies and asymmetric fluxes the velocity fields were resolved in more detail in the finer resolution simulations owing to the interpolated smoothed bathymetry in the coarser models intricacies in the residual flow patterns within the first kilometre offshore and further offshore were increasingly lost as the grid resolution became coarser along the north wales coastline there are numerous recirculating features the simulation resolution of which was dependent on the model grid spatial resolution fig 3 consequently the highest grid resolution simulations were the most dispersive contrary to our original hypothesis interrogation of the residual flow systems within the nearshore region not shown indicated that as a first order approximation eddies of the order of the grid scale were resolved as close inshore as twice the grid scale for example circulations on the scale of 50 m were permitted within the first 100 m offshore r50 increasing to circulations on the scale of 500 m up to 1 5 km offshore r500 in r500 several large 3 km eddies off the headland of anglesey were resolved the centre of each of these was 2 km offshore however there were numerous smaller recirculating eddies 500 m within the first kilometre offshore resolved in r50 which were entirely unresolved by the r500 these features appear to be driving dispersal offshore rather than resulting in particle retention in the nearshore i e contrary to the original hypothesis another potential mechanism which explains the important role of model resolution is the way in which coastal complexity is dealt with here the coastline was increasingly less well resolved in the relatively coarser model resolutions and so intricacies of the complex coastlines were lost where a comparison of the coastline resolution can be seen in fig 3 where the coastline was less well resolved r250 and r500 models there were relatively more up to 26 incidences where particles were advected onto land taken here as water depth 0 1 m than in the finer resolution simulations r50 and r100 this effect will have contributed to the coarser resolution simulations being overly retentive in the nearshore zone although r50 was the most dispersive simulation retaining the fewest particles within the 1 km nearshore zone it was r100 which had the fewest particle interactions with the coast suggesting that it is not only the detail of the coastline which drives the number of particles being advected onto land but also the resolution of topographic features which will drive some of the fine scale coastal currents particle interactions with land are clearly an important part of predicting dispersal in coastal systems it is worth noting that the number of coastal interactions was reduced with a decreased particle tracking model timestep results not shown here but this had limiting implications for model output because of run time and storage capacity this highlights the potential sensitivity of simulated dispersal to model timestep an important consideration for all particle tracking studies finally coarser models by their very nature lead to greater land interactions under simulations where particles are released close to shore the particles were released 500 m offshore in all simulations hence in the coarser resolution simulations they were relatively closer to the coastline in terms of number of grid cells which increased the particle land interactions in the coarser models the dispersal patterns from our four different resolution models were broadly similar in each of the simulations with particles released from the same locations being dispersed in similar directions in each resolution model however small differences in larval transport or dispersal distance can have significant implications for the success of marine species to settle and reproduce e g hold et al 2021 our results suggest that predicted dispersal patterns are particularly sensitive to model resolution in tidally energetic regions we found that the greatest difference in dispersal between the models occurred where particles were released from exposed headlands islands e g north western coast of anglesey which is highly energetic tidal currents 3 m s 1 roche et al 2016 we thus considered whether there was a correlation between the rmse in the simulated particle trajectories and current speeds or water depth at the release sites but found results not shown here no statistically significant correlations on average the mean water depth at the release sites was 5 deeper in r50 than in r500 and 1 and 2 deeper than r100 r250 respectively an artefact of the interpolation of the high resolution bathymetry onto the lower resolution grids that said in general the nearshore current speeds were higher in r50 r100 simulations than in the r250 r500 simulations because of the increased nearshore resolution and higher number of grid cells resolving the current regime more accurately further offshore 5 km there was minimal current speed difference between the simulations since the horizontal resolution offshore was constrained to be the same a few kilometres offshore as such we suggest that using an unstructured grid of 100 m resolution ought to be considered for simulating the transport of material in the nearshore zone 5 conclusions we find that for simulating lagrangian dispersal of material in the coastal zone of a tidally energetic sea a model spatial resolution of 100 m ought to be used this study illustrates that estimates of dispersal in the coastal zone were sensitive to ocean models of differing spatial resolutions 50 500 m implying that careful consideration of appropriate model resolution is important relatively coarse resolution models 100 m overestimated larval retention in the nearshore zone underestimated total dispersal distance and therefore led to different estimates of alongshore connectivity stronger overall connectivity but fewer discrete source sink sites in comparison to high resolution 100 m models this study considered passive particles dispersed over two weeks and so is relevant particularly to early life larval stages however species specific studies ought to incorporate larval behavioural traits into the particle tracking algorithm which represents much opportunity for further research such studies should also consider natural variabilities in circulation patterns e g from wind driven and density driven events despite these limitations our study represents an important contribution to understanding larval dispersal in the coastal zone through simulating potential pathways and connectivity at high spatial resolution this work is particularly relevant to investigations into the spread of organisms that remain close to shore over timescales of days to weeks e g the spread of marine non native species and pathogenetic parasites but is equally relevant to simulations tracking the dispersal of edna or coastal pollutants such as oil and plastics credit authorship contribution

23772,biophysical models often require shelf scale domains to map larval dispersal over several weeks presenting a computational challenge this can be overcome by decreasing model spatial resolution however nearshore processes which potentially play a significant role in larval dispersal will inevitably be unresolved here we evaluate how simulated larval dispersal in the nearshore is sensitive to model spatial resolution we use an unstructured finite element hydrodynamic model of a topographically complex coastline in north wales uk which includes headlands bays and channels at four different spatial scales 50 100 250 500 m to compare the influence of spatial resolution on transport and dispersal patterns of particles released within the nearshore region within 1 km of the shore in the higher resolution 50 and 100 m simulations particles generally travelled offshore more quickly and further 18 than in the coarser 250 and 500 m simulations this had important implications for potential connectivity along the coast for the lower resolution simulations retention of particles near source sites was increased by 50 and whilst the magnitude of connectivity among discrete regions along the coast was also increased by 27 the number of connected regions was reduced by 9 compared with the higher resolution simulations our results based on a case study in a highly energetic and topographically complex region suggest that model spatial resolution of 100 m should be used for dispersal studies in the nearshore zone these findings add to growing evidence of the importance of using appropriately scaled models when simulating the transport of material within and out of the coastal zone with many applications such as marine ecology marine biosecurity marine spatial planning and marine pollution keywords coastal currents dispersion lagrangian analysis ocean model connectivity north wales data availability i have shared a link to my code in the manuscript 1 introduction the life cycle of the majority of marine organisms begins with pelagic stages e g larvae eggs spores which are non or weak swimming and hence whose fate is determined by physical transport processes lester and ruttenberg 2005 shanks 2009 simons et al 2013 for many benthic organisms these early life stages are their only chance for population and genetic connectivity understanding dispersal within the marine environment is an inherently difficult problem as both intrinsic e g swimming behaviour pelagic larval duration mortality and extrinsic e g ocean currents factors influence dispersal trajectories pineda et al 2007 because larvae are small obtaining in situ observations of their dispersal patterns is challenging and generally impractical but see davis and butler 1989 in lieu of observational data biophysical models also referred to as particle tracking models use simulations from hydrodynamic models of the evolution of ocean currents and mixing rates to estimate the potential lagrangian transport of particles in this case larvae these models can predict the potential dispersal of millions of virtual larvae under a range of environmental conditions and biological traits a valuable application of particle tracking models is to simulate larval transport from source to sink i e from the natal population to a suitable settlement location hence predicting the pattern and magnitude of population connectivity there are a number of uncertainties associated with larval dispersal modelling some of these uncertainties are biological in nature e g unknowns and variabilities in their pelagic larval duration and behaviour within the water column or during settlement while others are related to the uncertainties in the representation of the physical environment e g model resolution and model parameterisation although several studies have considered the sensitivity of propagule dispersal to a range of physical biological processes and model parameterisations hufnagl et al 2017 robins et al 2013 simons et al 2013 treml et al 2015 there remains no one size fits all approach to estimating larval transport and dispersal as a baseline regardless of the complexity of either known or estimated larval life history traits biophysical models should be driven by physical parameters that have been simulated at appropriate spatio temporal resolutions for the question in hand many benthic invertebrate taxa as well as both pelagic and demersal fish spawn in coastal regions which exhibit a complex flow regime influenced by tides rivers wind and waves these energetic and dynamic physical coastal processes have implications for the transport and dispersal of larvae as currents interact with undulating topographic features and channels vasile et al 2018 to produce local residual flows such as tidally asymmetric currents longshore currents nickols et al 2012 rip currents fujimura et al 2014 largier 2003 morgan et al 2018 talbot and bate 1987 upwelling dauhajre et al 2019 suanda et al 2018 recirculating eddies and estuarine circulation kim et al 2010 pastor et al 2018 and axial convergent fronts robins et al 2012 the role of active swimming in determining patterns of dispersal is variable but generally low and certainly for the period directly after spawning larvae tend to behave passively drake et al 2018 hence for nearshore taxa coastal currents are critical in determining transport and the likelihood of dispersal offshore however coastal currents and turbulent mixing can vary greatly over small spatial and temporal scales especially near undulating coastlines and islands and consequently their role in dispersing larvae is poorly understood at present dauhajre et al 2019 drake et al 2018 morgan et al 2018 nickols et al 2012 particle tracking models have been developed over a variety of spatio temporal scales e g dauhajre et al 2019 demmer et al 2022 lynge et al 2010 ricker and stanev 2020 vasile et al 2018 whilst model spatial resolution has generally increased over the past few decades there has been a lack of consistency in approach swearer et al 2019 with a trade off between increasing resolution and model extent owing to computational limitations larval dispersal over several weeks has the potential to connect distant populations hundreds of kilometres apart hence modelling approaches have typically adopted coarse resolution 1 5 km 3d models to cover these large distances within computational constraints e g bode et al 2019 drake et al 2018 king et al 2021 torrado et al 2021 being focussed on offshore circulation these coarse models often do not resolve coastal dynamics however computational capacity is now at the stage where mesoscale of the order 100 km models can resolve coastal currents at appropriate resolution e g 50 m this capacity is necessary for dispersal studies of coastal species that need to simulate larval transport in coastal environments as well as long distance offshore dispersal pathways therefore there is a need to better understand the influence of model spatial resolution on simulated larval dispersal patterns so that a standardised approach can be designed for future studies we hypothesise that nearshore residual currents tend to restrict the offshore dispersal of larvae spawned within the coastal zone therefore biophysical models that do not accurately resolve nearshore residual currents may over estimate offshore dispersal and population connectivity we compare the relative transport and dispersal of particles released from a topographically complex and tidally energetic coastline using five hydrodynamic models of different spatial resolutions we aim to explore this uncertainty within the context of other uncertainties in dispersal due to oceanographic conditions and pelagic larval duration 2 methods we applied a hydrodynamic model to five different mesh configurations to investigate how spatial resolution influenced our estimations of particle dispersal within the coastal zone see section 2 1 these model domains covered a section of topographically complex coastline of north wales uk located within the irish sea the model domain was selected as it encompasses a variety of hydrodynamic conditions over a short domain e g energetic flows around headlands quiescent water within bays tidally asymmetric flow through channels and recirculating flows around islands the stretch of coast also varies in aspect relative to the predominant tidal flow further the north wales coastline is well developed with numerous anthropogenic activities within the coastal region e g harbours marinas a major seaport holyhead fishing activities tourism sea defences as well as offshore renewable energy infrastructure the hydrodynamics of the irish sea are driven mainly by tidal currents robinson 1979 and the coastal waters remain well mixed throughout the year the tidal range reaches 8 6 m at llandudno tide gauge b fig 1a and tidal currents can exceed 3 m s 1 off headlands of northwest anglesey where mean water depth is up to 40 m within 1 km of the shore along much of the coastline in the region the mean water depth remains 10 m up to 1 km offshore with large intertidal zones in many of the bays we developed a particle tracking model coded in matlab version r2020a and run on a supercomputer supercomputing wales that used the simulated coastal currents to advect particles within the coastal region see section 2 2 we considered the implications of using relatively low hundreds of metres and high tens of metres resolution hydrodynamic models of coastal regions on the transport and resulting dispersal patterns of hypothetical particles these particles were representative of passive larvae and here we consider their dispersal from nearshore release locations for up to two weeks from spawning this period is relevant to a huge range of coastal benthic invertebrate species living in shallow coastal regions with a pelagic duration of two weeks or more see o connor et al 2007 for a review for those taxa with long pelagic larval duration such as many crustaceans and molluscs this period represents the early stage larvae eggs when active swimming or other behaviours tends to be extremely limited 2 1 hydrodynamic model we applied telemac to our different grid configurations which is an open source hydrodynamic modelling system www opentelemac org specifically telemac 2d version 8p2r0 this model solves the shallow water equations saint venant equations in two dimensions depth averaged using finite element or finite volume methods hervouet 2000 which is a good approximation for the dominant barotropic flows of the region where mean spring tidal ranges are 6 m robinson 1979 horrillo caraballo et al 2021 see section 2 2 model validation the hydrodynamic model was run in finite element mode based on unstructured triangular computational mesh grids facilitating increased model resolution in nearshore regions with coarser resolution offshore this unstructured grid capability maximises the resolution of coastal processes while optimising computational efficiency the model included alternate wetting and drying of model nodes in the inter tidal regions and is therefore a sound choice for shallow coastal domains e g robins et al 2014 davies and robins 2017 we developed five model configurations of the north wales coastal region with different horizontal spatial resolutions in the nearshore zone fig 2 50 m r50 100 m r100 250 m r250 and 500 m r500 in each model configuration all triangular elements between the shoreline and 1 km were constrained to not exceed one of 50 100 250 500 m in edge length as focus was on the difference in model resolution in the coastal region the mesh edge lengths were each set to increase to 750 m by 20 km offshore the rate of edge length growth depending on the nearshore resolution after which mesh edge lengths extended to 3 km at the model boundary a fifth grid was generated of the same spatial resolution as the highest resolution grid r50 the purpose being to confirm that any differences in particle transport simulation was a consequence of hydrodynamic mesh resolution rather than configuration see results section this fifth grid was constrained in the same way as described above 50 m resolution within 1 km from shore increasing to 750 m within 20 km from shore but the mesh generator was re run so that individual triangular elements were configured differently

digital terrain model grid resolution of 1 16 1 16 arc minutes 115 m were interpolated onto each grid over which the high resolution 2 4 m uk hydrographic office multibeam data were mapped where available these datasets were used as they were the highest resolution bathymetric datasets which covered the entire model domain the model was forced by tidal boundary conditions with no other

by m 2 and s 2 principle semi diurnal lunar and solar respectively constituents with k 1 diurnal luni solar o 1 diurnal lunar and n 2 lunar ecliptic semi diurnal being relatively important in some

diffusivity coefficient was set to 0 2 and this sets the value of the coefficient of viscosity dynamic turbulent across the domain for both model stability as well as to the greatest degree possible maintaining a consistent courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the internal model timestep varied between the simulations 1 2 5 and 10 s for r50 r100 r250 and r500 respectively each model was run for a 42 day period 40 days of which were output for analysis including harmonic analysis used in the model validation which excluded two days of model spin up sufficient for tides only simulations of this domain simulated water depth and u and v components of current velocity were output at telemac 2d grid nodes at 15 min instantaneous intervals 2 2 hydrodynamic model validation simulated barotropic circulation was validated by comparing the two dominant constituents of the region m 2 and s 2 with observational data table 1 simulated tidal elevation amplitudes were compared with observed tidal elevation amplitudes at two coastal tide gauges within the region holyhead and llandudno and simulated tidal currents fig 3 were compared with observed tidal currents from depth averaged current data collected by moored adcps 30 days of data were available at seven points within the domain fig 1a the bottom mounted adcps were deployed in the nearshore zone in both slow and fast current environments compared here are the decomposed t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 amplitude and phase of the combined uv components of the m 2 and s 2 current speeds calculated from the timeseries of both simulated and observed depth averaged currents the comparison improved with finer model spatial resolution each grid configuration also validated well with regards elevation

in amplitude and 14 si 4 in phase for s 2 where the scatter index is the rmse normalised by the mean of the data 2 3 lagrangian particle tracking model an offline lagrangian particle tracking model was developed in matlab version 2020a using the model outputs from the telemac 2d simulations available from https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7371420 hypothetical particles were used to represent planktonic larvae and were advected at 15 min intervals by the simulated tidal currents magnitude and direction from telemac 2d for consistency this 15 min hydrodynamic model output interval and particle tracking model timestep were the same between models of different resolutions to ensure the runs were purely deterministic thus enabling direct quantitative comparison no additional sub grid scale diffusion or random walk term was included in the particle tracking model generally speaking for the relatively high resolution computational grids used here additional stochastic models used to represent sub grid scale diffusion processes are much less important than for coarser e g kilometre scale models which do not resolve small scale mixing processes marinone et al 2007 robins et al 2013 visser 1997 in telemac 2d which is based on vertex centred finite element formulation variables are defined at mesh nodes at each time step the velocities from the three nodes nearest to the particle

m offshore at a spacing of 1 km between 306 release points along the north wales coast fig 1b the mean water depth in the model bathymetries at these sites 500 m offshore varied between 3 m e g south coast of the llŷn peninsula and 47 m e g north coast of anglesey one particle was released from each location every 6 h over 14 days 56 particles per site in total to encompass particle releases throughout the spring neap tidal cycle fig 2c each particle was set to propagate for 14 days of pelagic transport the particles simulated were entirely passive i e density and behavioural complexity were omitted as the focus here is on how physical hydrodynamic processes affect dispersal as such these analyses did not include differential distribution in the water column through larval swimming or particles sinking rising particles were sometimes advected onto land referred to later as interactions with the coastline where land was defined as a minimum water depth of 0 1 m when this occurred particles were returned to their position during the previous timestep this approach similarly employed in previous studies e g coscia et al 2020 was necessary to avoid particles getting stranded on land which also includes particles being beached due to model wetting and drying in particular soon after release from the coastal release points this method was a compromise between computational capacity and realistic simulation to quantify the difference in lagrangian transport between individual particle trajectories on the different grid configurations we calculated the root mean square error rmse for each particle trajectory from r100 r250 and r500 relative to the corresponding particle trajectory from the r50 simulations using 4 r m s e i 1 n r 5 0 i r x i 2 n where rx is either r100 r250 or r500 i 1 n where n is the number of logged trajectory points i e 14 days 24 h 15 min timestep 1344 2 4 lagrangian alongshore connectivity to understand the pattern of and difference in alongshore connectivity from simulations with different mesh resolution we divided the 306 release sites into 30 nearshore zones extending from the shore to 5 km offshore fig 1b as much as was possible each zone encompassed nine release sites but this was not always possible due to the undulating coastline thus the strength of connectivity between any two zones was weighted by the number of release sites within the source zone the connectivity between the 30 zones was estimated by recording all particle locations at each timestep throughout the designated 14 day period as for earlier results this method incorporates spring neap tidal variations and releases over waxing and waning stages of the tidal cycle i e includes all 56 particle releases two zones were considered connected i e source to sink connection when a particle released from within a source zone entered a different zone sink and self recruitment was recorded when a particle released from within a source zone was recorded within that same zone at any time during the 14 days from release i e along any particle s entire trajectory although somewhat arbitrary this approach was consistent for each grid resolution and was considered appropriate since the focus was on comparative general patterns of nearshore connectivity between the runs of different resolutions to generate the connectivity matrices the total number of counts within each zone was divided by the number of timesteps within the 14 days since the focus is on the comparison of the relative strength and extent of connectivity for the various hydrodynamic model resolutions for visualisation of the connectivity matrices this value was normalised by the maximum within the matrix being plotted 3 results 3 1 dispersal and offshore transport at the mesoscale the predicted distribution of particles after 14 days was broadly similar between all model resolutions fig 4 particles that were released from exposed and energetic headlands e g the north coast of anglesey and the llŷn peninsula where tidal flows are strong e g 2 3 m s 1 were advected further offshore and were dispersed more widely after 14 days than those released in quiescent bays where tidal currents are generally weaker fig 3 this led to fewer particles accumulating around exposed headlands e g around the north of anglesey when compared with bays e g caernarfon bay fig 4 however a more detailed comparison revealed clear differences in the simulated transport among model resolutions for example in r50 particles released from the northeast coast of anglesey congregated more densely 10 km directly offshore red circle in fig 4 in comparison to the same particles being transported a similar distance in r500 but further to the northeast blue circle in fig 4 also illustrated in fig 6ii particles tended to be advected further offshore in r50 than in the coarser resolution models most notably on the south coast of the llŷn peninsula northwest of anglesey e g average offshore dispersal distances of 27 km r50 and 16 km r500 and west of the great orme offshore transport is considered here as occurring when a particle is transported outside of the 1 km nearshore zone which is often resolved by only one grid cell or part of a grid cell in studies using structured grid hydrodynamic models coscia et al 2020 drake et al 2018 faillettaz et al 2018 wood et al 2021 the majority of the transport of particles offshore occurred within the first few days after release fig 5 with 30 of released particles transported at least 1 km offshore after one day for all grid configurations i e 70 remained within the nearshore zone the finest resolution grid r50 was the most dispersive with 30 of all released particles remaining in the nearshore 1 km after 14 days the coarsest resolution grid r500 was the most retentive in the nearshore zone with 46 remaining after 14 days for the other grids 34 r100 and 40 r250 remained in the nearshore zone after 14 days proportionally in each of the different grid simulations more particles were advected offshore from headland release sites and quicker than from bay release sites the coarser grids tended to produce more particle interactions with the coast i e more particles were simulated as being advected onto land the percentage of total number of released particles which interacted with the coastline after 14 days were 15 r50 14 r100 16 r250 and 18 r500 around half of these interactions with the coastline occurred within four days after release from the 500 m offshore release points when advected onto land a particle was returned to its position during the previous timestep resulting in disproportionately lower total cumulative distance travelled for these particles which in turn contributed to the relatively lower cumulative distance travelled for the lower resolution grid configurations fig 5b after 14 days from release the mean cumulative distance travelled by particles released from all sites was highest in r50 and lowest in r500 fig 5b where on average particles in r50 had travelled 75 km further than those in r500 this pattern is consistent with r50 being the most dispersive grid configuration for particles released within the nearshore zone 3 2 influence of grid resolution on particle trajectories the rmse was calculated for each release location and presented as the mean rmse per release site over 14 days particle transport fig 6 as outlined in section 2 1 a second configuration of the high resolution 50 m resolution mesh was generated using the same resolution constraints as r50 but with triangular mesh elements configured differently to confirm that the differences in the particle trajectories were due to differences in the model spatial resolution as opposed to an artefact of comparing simulations with different mesh configurations this comparison confirmed that mesh configuration was not driving the observed differences in the simulated dispersal e g the mean rmse between these two high resolution r50 grids after one day was 40 72 less than for all other grid resolutions compared with r50 grid resolution had the greatest influence on particle trajectory within the first day from release with the greatest difference between r50 r500 mean rmse of 2 km and the difference for r50 r250 and r50 r100 being 82 and 50 of that respectively the effect of grid resolution on the difference between particle trajectories the mean rmse tended to decrease with time as the particles were advected further offshore the rmses converged and after one week the mean rmse values for the three resolution comparisons with r50 were within 5 the largest differences in trajectories relative to r50 tended to occur along sections of exposed coastline and energetic headlands fig 6 with the largest differences for particles released from sites 40 70 140 160 175 215 blue ellipses on fig 6a similarly the lowest rmse were consistently for particles released within bays some example particle trajectories are illustrated in fig 6i iv for r50 black lines and r500 blue lines these are only illustrative snapshots in time of one particle release from each site sites i 108 ii 230 iii 250 and iv 78 as the differences between the trajectories varied over the tidal cycle the rmse was consistently greater for particles released during spring tides e g up to 19 higher for particles released over two days during spring tide in comparison to those released over two days during neap tide r50 vs r500 further with regards to changes in rmse with time proportionally the rmse was greatest closest to time of release for all resolution grid configurations in comparison with r50 for example within the first 24 h from release a maximum rmse of 6 8 km site 155 black arrow on fig 6a was calculated for r50 r500 after 14 days the maximum rmse r50 r500 was 25 km release site 78 blue arrow on fig 6a in comparison to a minimum rmse of 2 3 km at site 6 in a bay 3 3 influence of grid resolution on alongshore connectivity the schematic of a connectivity network map based on r50 fig 7a illustrates generally a high level of alongshore connectivity of the region this was expected given the close proximity of the coastal sites 1 km apart strong coastal currents up to 3 m s 1 and the simulated pelagic larval duration of 14 days the broad pattern of alongshore connectivity during 14 days from release was comparable between the four model grids however there were differences in the strength of the connections and some key differences in connectivity extent fig 7b c quantified below overall the total strength of individual connections increased for coarser grid resolutions r500 had 27 stronger connectivity overall than r50 r250 was 4 stronger than r50 and r100 had comparable overall strength of connectivity with r50 notably stronger alongshore connectivity in r500 blue colours in fig 7c occurred in both directions on the southern llŷn peninsula e g source sink zones 3 to 2 and 4 to 5 in the southern mouth of the menai strait source zone 14 to sink zones 12 and 13 and westward along the northeast coast of anglesey source zone 24 to sink zone 23 there was also consistently higher alongshore connectivity southwest along the north coast of the llŷn peninsula e g source zone 12 to sink zone 11 in r500 in comparison to r50 these zones in which r500 had considerably higher strength of connectivity than r50 tended to be in bays or along relatively quiescent sections of coastline e g zones 2 5 10 11 25 28 for all grid resolutions self recruitment rates were highest in these bays characterised by shallow water large intertidal regions and with weak residual flows 0 05 m s 1 the predominant section of coastline in which r50 had highest alongshore connectivity was along the west coast of anglesey zones 14 17 except for at zone 15 where the self recruitment within r500 was 90 higher due to an increase in particle interaction with the coastline in the low resolution model configuration the maximum strength of connectivity self recruitment occurred in zone 30 with r50 r100 r250 predicting around 30 self recruitment increasing to 34 for r500 despite the strongest overall connectivity in the coarsest resolution r500 the total number of connected zones increased for finer grid resolution i e r50 had 9 more source sink connections than r500 although r50 had a comparative number to both r100 and r250 2 difference there were 37 unique source sink connections in r50 vs r500 i e where a unique source sink connection exists in one connectivity matrix but not the other whereas only 12 unique source sink connections existed in r500 vs r50 the most significant difference in the connectivity networks was for the r500 simulation in comparison to the other grid configurations in the area of the menai strait a tidal channel 500 m wide see location on fig 4 in each of r50 r100 and r250 there was residual southwest transport from release zone 27 to sink zones 11 14 however the r500 simulation was not sufficiently spatially resolved to facilitate transport of particles through the menai strait in r500 the strait was only one grid cell wide and the simulated tidal currents were unrealistically low facilitating no transport of particles 4 discussion many marine species which have pelagic larval stages spawn in the nearshore region where coastal currents are often complex with considerable spatio temporal variation in flow structure this poses a challenge for biophysical modelling here we show that estimates of lagrangian transport and dispersal in the coastal zone are sensitive to horizontal spatial resolution of the unstructured grid ocean model used this work highlights the importance of carefully considering the appropriate scales for coastal dispersal simulations based on our case study of the north wales region uk biophysical models of relatively coarse spatial resolution 250 m and 500 m were found to overestimate nearshore retention by up to 50 within the first two weeks from release compared with finer spatial resolution models 50 m and 100 m the highest resolution 50 m simulation was the most dispersive with particles travelling the greatest cumulative distance 20 more than the coarsest resolution simulation further the coarser resolution simulations overestimated the strength of connectivity between adjacent coastal regions while underestimating the potential dispersal range this work highlights the importance of model setup for dispersal studies within the nearshore zone of topographically complex coastlines 4 1 should biophysical models be downscaled as much as possible hydrodynamic model resolution becomes particularly important when considering biologically closed systems that are connected over small spatial temporal scales and which are dependent on locally spawned larvae in contrast to open systems that are connected over large spatial scales tens to hundreds of kilometres and hence can usually be simulated using lower resolution regional scale hydrodynamic models gawarkiewicz et al 2007 in the nearshore region hydrodynamic processes differ fundamentally from the deep ocean due to the presence and interaction with the seafloor and the coastline coastal and nearshore hydrodynamic processes span a range of spatial scales including shelf scale circulation kilometres hundreds of kilometres guihou et al 2018 holt et al 2009 ricker and stanev 2020 river plumes and coastal flooding several metres hundreds of kilometres horner devine et al 2015 kulp and strauss 2019 o donnell et al 2008 to small scale surf zone currents and wave processes several centimetres to tens of kilometres fujimura et al 2014 gawarkiewicz et al 2007 hally rosendahl et al 2015 these dynamic processes interact and tend to overlap presenting a challenge of scale for hydrodynamic modellers for dispersal studies the use of long term and large domain models with lower resolution e g simulating trajectories over hundreds of kilometres and several weeks months is computationally efficient but may not yield the most accurate predictions nor be appropriate in coastal settings while the spatial resolution of biophysical models has increased in recent years see swearer et al 2019 and references therein this increase is not in proportion to computational capacity leading to the question should biophysical models be downscaled further for dispersal studies of coastal species where it is important to resolve high resolution coastal currents scale matters because of practical constraints to modelling computational capacity time data availability etc decisions must be made regarding the scales of any modelling study for example how many particles should be released how should the release site be parameterised over which temporal and spatial scales should the computations be made since model resolution both spatial and temporal has been shown to affect estimates of direction distance and relative dispersal of particles dauhajre et al 2019 hufnagl et al 2017 kvile et al 2018 lynge et al 2010 putman and he 2013 it is important that we better understand the impact of our chosen spatial scale on estimates of material dispersal including larval dispersal dauhajre et al 2019 demonstrated using a structured grid model that simulated lagrangian transport was sensitive to horizontal model resolution they found that a relatively coarse resolution hydrodynamic model 1 km failed to resolve the sub mesoscale shelf currents predominantly downwelling of the region santa barbara channel california and concluded that a model of horizontal scale 36 100 m in the nearshore was required although the hydrodynamics in the region were considerably different to our shallow and tidally energetic complex coastline and the hydrodynamic model was a structured grid model rather than the unstructured grid approach that we used the overarching results agree with ours i e coarse resolution models underestimate offshore transport of material released in the coastal zone 4 2 consequences of hydrodynamic model resolution for lagrangian transport along a topographically complex coastline the telemac 2d model used here is a two dimensional depth averaged tide only model see hervouet 2007 and so the resolution of the coastal processes are simplified in the vertical plane e g excluding wind and wave driven currents and density driven flows although the depth averaged currents take into account reduced flows associated with the bottom boundary layer whilst the tide only model setup reduces the realism of the simulations it does allow for an initial comparison of the changes in dispersal resulting from decreasing the grid resolution all efforts were made to minimise any potential artefacts of hydrodynamic model set up on simulated currents such as decreasing the model s internal timestep as the model grid resolution became finer to keep a comparable courant number which defines how quickly information propagates through one grid cell crucially the comparison of the two high resolution 50 m simulations confirms that it is grid spatial resolution as opposed to grid configuration which drives the differences in simulated particle trajectories since the rmse between the two simulations with 50 m nearshore grid resolution was much less than when comparing simulations from coarser resolutions grids 40 72 less section 3 2 understanding the processes driving differences in predicted dispersal among models of differing spatial resolution is important in making recommendations on appropriate methodology our simulations predicted barotropic tidal currents and their interactions with complex and shallow coastal topography to produce a range of secondary coastal flows such as recirculating eddies and asymmetric fluxes the velocity fields were resolved in more detail in the finer resolution simulations owing to the interpolated smoothed bathymetry in the coarser models intricacies in the residual flow patterns within the first kilometre offshore and further offshore were increasingly lost as the grid resolution became coarser along the north wales coastline there are numerous recirculating features the simulation resolution of which was dependent on the model grid spatial resolution fig 3 consequently the highest grid resolution simulations were the most dispersive contrary to our original hypothesis interrogation of the residual flow systems within the nearshore region not shown indicated that as a first order approximation eddies of the order of the grid scale were resolved as close inshore as twice the grid scale for example circulations on the scale of 50 m were permitted within the first 100 m offshore r50 increasing to circulations on the scale of 500 m up to 1 5 km offshore r500 in r500 several large 3 km eddies off the headland of anglesey were resolved the centre of each of these was 2 km offshore however there were numerous smaller recirculating eddies 500 m within the first kilometre offshore resolved in r50 which were entirely unresolved by the r500 these features appear to be driving dispersal offshore rather than resulting in particle retention in the nearshore i e contrary to the original hypothesis another potential mechanism which explains the important role of model resolution is the way in which coastal complexity is dealt with here the coastline was increasingly less well resolved in the relatively coarser model resolutions and so intricacies of the complex coastlines were lost where a comparison of the coastline resolution can be seen in fig 3 where the coastline was less well resolved r250 and r500 models there were relatively more up to 26 incidences where particles were advected onto land taken here as water depth 0 1 m than in the finer resolution simulations r50 and r100 this effect will have contributed to the coarser resolution simulations being overly retentive in the nearshore zone although r50 was the most dispersive simulation retaining the fewest particles within the 1 km nearshore zone it was r100 which had the fewest particle interactions with the coast suggesting that it is not only the detail of the coastline which drives the number of particles being advected onto land but also the resolution of topographic features which will drive some of the fine scale coastal currents particle interactions with land are clearly an important part of predicting dispersal in coastal systems it is worth noting that the number of coastal interactions was reduced with a decreased particle tracking model timestep results not shown here but this had limiting implications for model output because of run time and storage capacity this highlights the potential sensitivity of simulated dispersal to model timestep an important consideration for all particle tracking studies finally coarser models by their very nature lead to greater land interactions under simulations where particles are released close to shore the particles were released 500 m offshore in all simulations hence in the coarser resolution simulations they were relatively closer to the coastline in terms of number of grid cells which increased the particle land interactions in the coarser models the dispersal patterns from our four different resolution models were broadly similar in each of the simulations with particles released from the same locations being dispersed in similar directions in each resolution model however small differences in larval transport or dispersal distance can have significant implications for the success of marine species to settle and reproduce e g hold et al 2021 our results suggest that predicted dispersal patterns are particularly sensitive to model resolution in tidally energetic regions we found that the greatest difference in dispersal between the models occurred where particles were released from exposed headlands islands e g north western coast of anglesey which is highly energetic tidal currents 3 m s 1 roche et al 2016 we thus considered whether there was a correlation between the rmse in the simulated particle trajectories and current speeds or water depth at the release sites but found results not shown here no statistically significant correlations on average the mean water depth at the release sites was 5 deeper in r50 than in r500 and 1 and 2 deeper than r100 r250 respectively an artefact of the interpolation of the high resolution bathymetry onto the lower resolution grids that said in general the nearshore current speeds were higher in r50 r100 simulations than in the r250 r500 simulations because of the increased nearshore resolution and higher number of grid cells resolving the current regime more accurately further offshore 5 km there was minimal current speed difference between the simulations since the horizontal resolution offshore was constrained to be the same a few kilometres offshore as such we suggest that using an unstructured grid of 100 m resolution ought to be considered for simulating the transport of material in the nearshore zone 5 conclusions we find that for simulating lagrangian dispersal of material in the coastal zone of a tidally energetic sea a model spatial resolution of 100 m ought to be used this study illustrates that estimates of dispersal in the coastal zone were sensitive to ocean models of differing spatial resolutions 50 500 m implying that careful consideration of appropriate model resolution is important relatively coarse resolution models 100 m overestimated larval retention in the nearshore zone underestimated total dispersal distance and therefore led to different estimates of alongshore connectivity stronger overall connectivity but fewer discrete source sink sites in comparison to high resolution 100 m models this study considered passive particles dispersed over two weeks and so is relevant particularly to early life larval stages however species specific studies ought to incorporate larval behavioural traits into the particle tracking algorithm which represents much opportunity for further research such studies should also consider natural variabilities in circulation patterns e g from wind driven and density driven events despite these limitations our study represents an important contribution to understanding larval dispersal in the coastal zone through simulating potential pathways and connectivity at high spatial resolution this work is particularly relevant to investigations into the spread of organisms that remain close to shore over timescales of days to weeks e g the spread of marine non native species and pathogenetic parasites but is equally relevant to simulations tracking the dispersal of edna or coastal pollutants such as oil and plastics credit authorship contribution

23773,a downshift of the wind wave peak frequency was observed in a wind wave tunnel when irregular long paddle waves i e generated mechanically with a plane wave maker are added in the sea state the 3rd generation spectral wave model tomawac is used to assess the extent at which this peak frequency downshift can take place at prototype scale in bimodal sea state conditions involving swell and wind wave systems several parameterizations of the modeled physical processes are selected to numerically reproduce the laboratory experiments in the first place then the model performances are further inquired in reproducing coastal observations during a specific event combining a wind wave and a swell system overall a good agreement is obtained between the simulations and the observations both at laboratory and coastal scale in particular a set of parameterizations combining one of the latest developments in spectral wave models for the whitecapping dissipation and the nonlinear 4 wave interactions reveals high performances in reproducing the observations lastly based on the performances of this latter set of parameterizations a generic numerical domain with typical coastal scale dimensions is created to inquire the occurrence of the downshift at prototype scale this last study reveals a wind wave peak period shift from 5 s without swell to more than 6 5 s with a 2 m high swell keywords bimodal sea states wind waves swell wind wave tunnel spectral wave model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea states combining several wave systems such as swell and wind waves are very common both in open oceans and in coastal areas thompson et al 2018 mason et al 2008 although the occurrence of these complex sea states has been addressed several times in the literature it is not quite settled whether the wind waves are generated the same way with or without a background swell the purpose of this paper is to evaluate 3 rd generation hereafter denoted 3g wave models performances for bimodal sea states modeling given recent improvements in wind wave generation parameterizations then such a model is further used to investigate the physics behind the combinations of both wave systems with the purpose to study wind wave growth in the presence of swell a preliminary approach consists in studying the generation of short wind waves in the presence of a longer wave system in the well controlled conditions of a wind wave tank such facilities allow the combination of both wave systems generated using an air blower and a mechanical paddle wave maker respectively mitsuyasu 1966 phillips and banner 1974 donelan 1987 and villefer et al 2021 yet the long paddle waves generated in wind wave tanks are significantly different from ocean swell in terms of wave age ξ c p u 10 with c p the peak phase celerity and u 10 the wind velocity at 10 m above the mean water level mwl respective wave ages are larger than 1 for typical ocean swell and generally lower than 0 5 for paddle waves in wind wave tanks to avoid surface tension effects therefore the different wave systems generated in a wind wave tank should be considered as different components of the wind sea with lower and higher peak frequencies rather than real swell and wind sea hereafter for readability reasons short wind generated waves are denoted wind waves and long mechanically generated waves are denoted paddle waves donelan s 1987 wind wave tank experiments revealed a reduction of the wind sea variance by a factor of about 2 5 in the presence of following monochromatic paddle waves replacing the monochromatic waves by jonswap type paddle waves villefer et al 2021 showed that the wind wave peak frequency is shifted towards lower frequencies due to the background paddle waves however the extension of these results for the study of wind wave growth over real ocean swell is complicated by the high steepness and the low wave age of the laboratory paddle waves compared to open ocean swell at prototype scale a common approach to physically characterize such a bimodal sea state involves in situ observations of its spatial development thus the conditions for these observations must be in a coastal area where a wind is blowing steadily offshore i e fetch limited conditions and opposing a swell directed inshore ardhuin et al 2007 hwang et al 2011 these very specific conditions make the characterization of bimodal sea states rather difficult at natural scale some observations showed a modification of wind wave growth in the presence of swell donelan et al 1997 hwang et al 2011 vincent et al 2019 according to hwang et al 2011 wind wave generation and development are enhanced with an opposing background swell these observations lead to physical interpretations swell is expected to modify the wind velocity profile donelan et al 1997 chen and belcher 2000 to increase the breaking of the wind sea phillips and banner 1974 and to alter the nonlinear 4 wave interactions masson 1993 however based on observations in the north carolina continental shelf during the shoaling waves experiment showex ardhuin et al 2007 showed that a moderate swell has no significant effect on the bulk parameters characterizing the wind sea both the idealized laboratory conditions and the realistic in situ observations are necessary to understand the processes at play when wind waves are generated over a preexisting swell with the purpose to unify the different observations our approach is based on the use of the 3g spectral wave model tomawac part of the telemac mascaret hydro informatic system benoit et al 1996 to upscale villefer et al 2021 laboratory results to the coastal scale the model is used to numerically reproduce first the laboratory experiments and then an event during the showex campaign taking advantage of the physical processes separation involved in wind wave generation the laboratory experiments hindcast aims to assess the extent at which the observed spectral downshift can occur at prototype scale however the accuracy of 3g wave models remains questionable for a simulation including more than one wave system as shown in latest developments in 3g wave models ardhuin et al 2010 gagnaire renou et al 2010 while the integral parameters such as the significant wave height and representative periods can be well predicted for this kind of sea states the frequency and directional distributions of the wave energy remain rather inaccurate however these distributions are of prime importance for applications such as the design of coastal protections or offshore structures recent developments in wave models proved that improving the whitecapping dissipation modeling was necessary to better simulate the combination of swell and wind sea this dissipation process is considered as the least understood part of the physics relevant to wave modeling by cavaleri et al 2007 the first operational dissipation parameterization in 3g wave models was the one developed by komen et al 1984 loosely following hasselmann 1974 s work in which whitecaps act as a pressure pulse countering the rise of the sea surface in the case of swell and wind wave combination the main weakness of this parameterization is the use of an averaged wave steepness to determine the dissipation rate since swell and wind waves have a low and high steepness respectively the presence of swell leads to anomalously high wind waves due to a lack of dissipation and vice versa bidlot et al 2007 partly corrected this issue by re defining the averaged steepness used in the latter parameterization to increase the dissipation at higher frequencies i e wind wave frequencies to further solve this issue dissipation models using a local saturation spectrum rather than an integral wave steepness have been developed based on the work of alves and banner 2003 first van der westhuysen 2007 combined the advantages of a saturation model van der westhuysen et al 2007 and a model based on the average wave steepness of the sea state komen et al 1984 secondly ardhuin et al 2010 developed a new set of source sink terms taking into account the breaking threshold approach with a saturation term the dissipation of short waves by larger breakers and the swell dissipation over long distances another improvement in the bimodal sea state modeling regards the nonlinear 4 wave interactions an exact equation with boltzmann type integral describing these interactions has been proposed by hasselmann 1962 and zakharov 1968 since then a substantial work has been devoted to find a good balance between a computationally efficient and an accurate resolution of these interactions masson 1993 showed that nonlinear 4 wave interactions are involved in bimodal spectra evolution when the ratio of long wave to short wave frequencies is greater than 0 6 the standard discrete interaction approximation dia method that triggered the outbreak of 3g wave models is a computationally efficient method to estimate these interactions however it suffers from many shortcomings regarding the frequency and directional distribution of wave energy compared to exact methods benoit 2005 according to masson s work a more accurate method to solve the nonlinear 4 wave interactions might be required for bimodal spectra simulations based on the gaussian quadrature method gqm lavrenov 2001 gagnaire renou et al 2010 developed an algorithm using numerical integration methods of high accuracy in the following this original method is used to assess wind wave growth in the presence of swell both at laboratory and coastal scales to compare the simulations with observations an appropriate scaling is applied following kitaigorodskii 1961 in the present study wind wave growth is described in two manners both based on a spectral analysis of the sea states on the one hand using the variance density spectrum e f θ x t at a location x and a time t where f and θ are the wave frequency and direction respectively on the other hand using the fetch x peak frequency f p and the total variance of the free surface elevation m 0 η 2 those variables are made dimensionless using u 10 and the acceleration due to gravity g 1a x x g u 10 2 1b f p f p u 10 g 1c m 0 m 0 g 2 u 10 4 in the present paper section 2 presents the laboratory experiments see villefer et al 2021 for a more complete description and the showex event ardhuin et al 2007 against which tomawac s hindcast performances are evaluated section 3 gives an overview of the physics at play in the wave model in order to introduce the different sets of parameterizations later used for the simulations then after a description of the numerical characteristics the results of the simulations at laboratory and at coastal scales are discussed in sections 4 and 5 respectively in light of the preceding discussion a generic numerical domain is created to assess wind wave growth modifications in the presence of a following swell at coastal scale in section 6 section 7 summarizes the present findings and introduces recent 3g wave model developments that could further improve the simulation of bimodal sea state conditions 2 bimodal sea states data sets this section introduces two bimodal sea state data sets used to evaluate the performances of tomawac during the wave generation process at laboratory and coastal scales respectively it is important to note that these data sets are not comparable since they differ in at least two ways a short and a long wind wave systems are combined in the wind wave tank whereas wind waves and oceanic swell coexist at coastal scale both wave systems have the same direction in the wind wave tank whereas they have nearly opposed directions at coastal scale the extension of the laboratory results i e the peak frequency downshift phenomenon at coastal scale is investigated in section 6 2 1 experimental study in a wind wave tank the first dataset consists in a series of experiments carried out in the controlled conditions of the institut de recherche sur les phénomènes hors equilibre irphé pythéas 40 m long wind wave tank in marseilles france the use of such a facility permitted to study wind wave growth in the presence of following long paddle waves the facility and the results are described and discussed in villefer et al 2021 twelve wave gauges distributed along the test section enabled to obtain the fetch limited evolution of the wind waves with and without monochromatic or irregular jonswap type paddle waves for the present study only the spectra depicting wind waves in the presence of irregular paddle waves are considered using the wave gauge situated at the maximal fetch of 30 m fig 1 introduces the 6 cases of interest for this study the frequency wave spectra are considered for three wind speed settings u ref 6 10 and 14 m s with and without paddle waves here u ref is a reference wind speed measured by a sonic anemometer at 1 m above mwl two different values of paddle wave steepness a k of 2 7 and 4 2 with the wave amplitude a 2 m 0 h m 0 2 2 and the wavenumber k k p i e the peak wavenumber are considered for each wind velocity in fig 1 the comparison between spectra with and without paddle waves highlights the downshift of the wind wave frequency peak in the presence of paddle waves this downshift tends to increase with increasing paddle wave steepness by fitting the vertical profile of the horizontal wind velocity with a logarithmic profile method see monin and obukhov 1954 villefer et al 2021 found that the friction velocity at the air sea interface u had a tendency to increase in the presence of a background following paddle waves this tendency can be retained as a first hypothesis to explain the above mentioned downshift as a result of an increase of the momentum transfer from the wind to the waves with paddle waves the following numerical simulations are analyzed given these observed experimental features 2 2 showex in situ observations in north carolina continental shelf the second dataset considered for model s validation is an event that happened during the shoaling waves experiment showex conducted in the north carolina continental shelf east coast of the usa from august to december 1999 six datawell directional waverider ddw buoys ardhuin et al 2003b a were deployed along a cross shelf transect going from 5 to 80 km x1 to x6 to the coastline see fig 2 to obtain the wave spectra and bulk parameters three air sea interaction spar asis buoys graber et al 2000 permitted to obtain the wind properties and additional wave measurements bravo yankee and romeo buoys in fig 2 buoys and stations of the national data buoy center ndbc and the u s army corps of engineers usace provided extra data about the oceanic and atmospheric conditions on 3 rd november 1999 a 10 m s wind u 10 coming from the land westerly wind orange arrow in fig 2 was blowing steadily and uniformly over a time period of 5 h from 12 00 to 17 00 east coast standard time est this led to wind wave generation close to idealized fetch limited conditions with a wind directed at 10 to 30 degrees relative to the normal to the coast i e slightly oblique wind an additional southeasterly swell system blue arrow in fig 2 with a peak period t p 10 s and a significant wave height h s 1 m was nearly opposed to the local wind this event first chosen by ardhuin et al 2007 to validate the spectral wave model wavewatch iii ww3 tolman and chalikov 1996 the wavewatch iii r development group ww3dg 2019 provides rare observations of fetch limited conditions in the presence of a background swell with a large set of wave sensors to assess wind wave growth with fetch the wave spectra calculated from the wave buoys measurements for instance at bravo in fig 2 depicted the evolution of two well defined wave systems the low frequency part with swell energy decreasing from offshore to the coast and the high frequency hf part with wind waves growing with fetch from x1 to x6 looking at bravo directional spectrum in fig 2 one can observe that the wind wave peak is not exactly aligned with the mean wind direction orange dots the main wind wave components are slightly deviated towards the alongshore direction i e θ 160 this observation within the framework of this particular event received two different interpretations in the literature on the one hand it was associated to slanting fetch conditions i e the obliquity of the wind direction relative to the normal to the coast and to wave refraction by ardhuin et al 2007 the turning of the wind wave peak due to slanting fetch conditions is further described in pettersson et al 2010 it is interesting to remark that the wind wave peak mean direction simulated with ww3 in ardhuin et al 2010 including the wave dissipation model they developed showed a 25 bias towards the alongshore direction on the other hand zhang et al 2009 associated the turning of the wind wave peak towards the alongshore direction to a wind stress angle deviated from the wind direction because of surface currents following ardhuin et al 2007 in the case of a slanting fetch the dimensionless fetch in the wind direction is defined extending eq 1a as x x g cos θ w u 10 2 where θ w is the wind direction with respect to the normal to the coast and x is the distance perpendicular to the coast the idealized fetch limited condition the specific directional properties of the observed spectra and the comparison with ww3 results ardhuin et al 2007 2010 provide a valuable database to assess the performances of the present simulations 3 parameterization of the 3 rd generation wave model tomawac is a 3g wave model developed by edf r d using unstructured spatial grid of the oceanic domain for solving the action balance equation benoit et al 1996 to serve that purpose the model simulates the evolution of the action density directional spectrum at each node of a spatial computational grid the balance equation of wave action density is solved for each component f i θ j with discrete frequencies f i and directions θ j each component of the action density spectrum changes in time and space under the effects of wave propagation and software modeled physical processes based on the considerations in ardhuin et al 2007 the current is not taken into account in the present study thereby only the evolution of the surface elevation variance spectrum e t x f θ at a location x and a time t is considered using the following equation 2 d e d t q the left hand size of the equation is the kinematic part and the right hand size gathers the contributions from the physical processes modeled using source and sink terms following ardhuin et al 2007 bottom friction dissipation is considered as negligible here so that q is formulated as in deep water conditions 3 q q in q ds q nl corresponding to the processes of wind energy input q in dissipation through white capping q ds and nonlinear 4 wave interactions q nl in the code each process has several models and formulations that can be adapted to the particularities of the studied case the different source sink terms used in the course of this study are described below from the most to the less known physical mechanisms q nl is the only source term that has been formulated theoretically hasselmann 1962 zakharov 1968 as a boltzmann integral for resonant interactions between quadruplets of surface gravity waves as said above among the methods that have been developed to calculate an approximated solution the above mentioned two methods are used here dia q nl dia and the more accurate as well as computationally heavier gqm q nl gqm the gqm algorithm as implemented in tomawac with the default configuration needs about 50 times the dia cpu time to compute q nl the transfer of momentum from the wind to the sea q in is based on miles feedback mechanism and janssen s quasi linear theory for modeling the ocean atmosphere interaction janssen 1991 2004 and denoted q in j lastly the selected dissipation terms are van der westhuysen 2007 term q ds vdw combining a saturation model van der westhuysen et al 2007 and komen et al 1984 s model and ardhuin et al 2010 term q ds st4 st4 referring to ww3 nomenclature this latter sink term is a combination of different dissipation terms formulated as q ds st4 q sat q bk cu q swell q turb for the following simulations the swell dissipation due to the resistance of the air q swell q out in ardhuin et al 2010 and the dissipation associated to surface turbulence q turb are considered as negligible particularly q swell is not expected to have a significant effect on swell dissipation over the typical distances 150 km maximum in the spatial domain considered here only the saturation term q sat and breaking cumulative term q bk cu i e the dissipation of short waves by long breaking waves are considered the modification of q in j and q nl dia parameterizations described in ardhuin et al 2010 dissipation terms are included when q ds st4 is activated regarding q in j it consists in the inclusion of a sheltering effect accounting for the effect of a background swell on the wind wave generation by adapting the calculation of the friction velocity somewhat like chen and belcher 2000 suggested amongst the parameterizations developed for q ds st4 we chose to use the t471f the wavewatch iii r development group ww3dg 2019 which corresponds to the one used in ww3 at global scale adapted to climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr wind files to reproduce both laboratory and in situ showex observations different sets of parameterizations for the source sink terms are compared vdw q vdw q in j q ds vdw q nl dia associated to blue color in figures of results st4 q st4 q in j q ds st4 q nl dia associated to orange color st4 gqm q st4 gqm q in j q ds vdw q nl gqm associated to red color these parameterizations will be compared with observations associated to gray scale colors 4 hindcast of laboratory experiments 4 1 numerical specifications a first series of simulations of the wind wave tunnel experiments led to some adjustments of the source sink terms parameterizations first the wave growth limiter is deactivated this limiter is generally used to guarantee the numerical stability of the calculation which in our case appears to be unnecessary with a small time step of 0 1 s secondly in q in j the friction velocity at the air sea interface for each wind speed u ref is forced to be constant and equal to the laboratory measured one in the wind only case for simulations with and without paddle waves without this forcing the model tends to overestimate the friction velocity in addition the deep water approximation is adopted since it was shown by villefer et al 2021 that the dissipation due to bottom friction is relatively low lastly since the spectral wave model is not meant for the simulation of strictly unidirectional waves the laboratory paddle waves are modeled with a very narrow directional energy distribution 4 e f θ e f δ cos 20 θ θ 0 with θ θ 0 π 2 θ 0 π 2 and δ is a normalization factor to ensure that the integral of the angular spreading function over π π is equal to 1 it was further verified that the following results with this representation of paddle waves are not sensitive to the directional discretization yet such a definition might change the nonlinear interactions between both wave systems that occurred in the wind wave tank therefore the following results must be analyzed in light of the present directional definition of the paddle wave system 4 2 results hindcasts of laboratory measurements i e without any kinematic similarity are not common in the literature booij et al 2001 and holthuijsen et al 2000 made an attempt to simulate donelan 1987 laboratory observations with the swan model booij et al 1999 they showed significant limitations of 3g wave models to simulate wind wave generation and dissipation processes at laboratory scale indeed wave models are exclusively parameterized for wave hindcasting or forecasting at global regional or coastal scales however as shemer 2019 showed wave generation in wind wave tunnels is to a great extent comparable to in situ wind wave growth thus using the advantages of the well controlled laboratory environment can be a powerful way to validate 3g wave models since the paddle waves and the wind had the same direction in the tank we focus on 1d omnidirectional wave spectra in this case fig 3 depicts the observed spectra at a fetch 30 m by comparisons with the simulated ones columns and rows separate the different values of the steepness a k of irregular paddle waves and the different wind speeds respectively overall the simulations are in good agreement with the observed spectra in the presence of a jonswap type paddle waves on the other hand in wind only conditions the spectral wind wave peak is underestimated in terms of energy and peak frequency booij et al 2001 and holthuijsen et al 2000 raised a similar issue when simulating wind wave growth from laboratory observations with swan the most interesting point to highlight might be that in the simulations the various model variations seem to reproduce a wind wave peak frequency downshift in the presence of background long waves this numerically simulated downshift is however less pronounced than in the experiment it can be noted that the energy levels of the hf tail are overestimated in the simulations with u ref 10 and 14 m s colored lines in fig 3 b c e and f even if the variance density decrease rate at hf is consistent with the observations grey scale for those wind speeds there is an increasing difference between the simulations and the observations from the wind wave peak to higher frequencies it shows a lack of accuracy of the simulations in reproducing the well known overshoot behavior barnett and sutherland 1968 associated to wind wave growth at lower wind speed fig 3 a and d this overshoot is less pronounced and the hf tails seem rather well reproduced by the simulations including the long waves but it is not the case for the wind wave peak colored dotted lines which is underestimated in all panels overall the simulation of an accurate energy level for both the wind wave peak and the hf tail seems to be a barrier when using 3g wave models at such small scale the different models described in section 3 show different levels of performances in reproducing the observed spectra first the vdw set is the only parameterization depicting a slight underestimation of the low frequency wave energy at the highest wind speed this is due to the limitation of komen et al 1984 s parameterization partly included in vdw at higher frequencies vdw generally underestimates the energy of the wind wave peak with and without the long waves such a behavior reveals an over dissipation of the wind sea system in q ds vdw regarding the wind only case vdw simulates a wind wave peak frequency that tends to be shifted toward low frequencies by comparison with the observations at the largest wind speed u ref 14 m s all the models tend to have an excessively energetic wind wave peak in the cases with long waves and an excessively low wind wave peak frequency in wind only conditions as highlighted in villefer et al 2021 the limitation of the techniques to measure the wind velocity profile could lead to the calculation of an excessive value of the friction velocity since the friction velocity forcing is taken from the experimental value the wind wave peak energy and frequency can be expected to be respectively over and under estimated at higher wind speeds st4 parameterization seems to better estimate the wind wave peak energy than vdw both with and without long waves but still depicts a largely downshifted peak frequency for the wind only case with a more accurate resolution for the 4 wave interactions with gqm the simulations in wind only conditions give a better compromise in terms of energy level and peak frequency the differences between st4 with dia and st4 with gqm is well illustrated in the simulations with long waves in fig 3 a and d the red spectra gqm depict a slightly narrower wind wave peak than the orange spectra dia simulating narrower spectra is a well known property when improving the accuracy of the method for solving the 4 wave interactions benoit 2005 finally considering the simulations with and without long waves st4 gqm might be the parameterization showing the best overall performances in reproducing the bimodal spectra observed in marseilles wind wave tank fig 4 is obtained by separating the wind waves from the paddle waves using a decomposition of the sea state into two jonswap spectra fitted using a method presented in villefer et al 2021 it tempers the agreement between the simulated and the observed wind wave peak energy illustrated in fig 3 in fig 4 a the 3g wave model overestimates the wind wave energy at all fetches with an exception at maximal fetch nevertheless the simulated wind wave energy variations with fetch show a slope similar to kahma and calkoen 1992 formula and close to the observations regarding the simulated wind waves peak frequency variations with fetch the model reproduces rather well the observed bimodal sea states in terms of magnitude and slope however the simulated variation of the wind wave peak frequency without paddle waves dotted lines in fig 4 b clearly different from the corresponding observations black squares is similar to the observations with paddle waves black circles this latter issue also observed in fig 3 is linked to the difficult question of triggering wind wave growth in 3g wave models the wind wave growth initialization commonly used following cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 was not adapted for wave simulation at laboratory scale in our case not shown thus we triggered wind wave growth by using the measured wind wave spectrum at a fetch 5 m as an input boundary condition in our simulations a difference is observed between the horizontal location of the hf peak of colored plain line spectra and the corresponding peak of dotted line spectra in fig 3 especially at high wind speed this difference is observed once again in fig 4 b between the dashed and plain color lines hence the downshift of the wind wave peak in the presence of long waves first observed during the laboratory experiments villefer et al 2021 is observed once again in the simulations to a smaller extent to further characterize this phenomenon fig 5 illustrates the differences between its observations in laboratory black dots and their simulations colored dots in laboratory the downshift does not result in a modification of the wind wave energy hence it implies a reduction of the wind wave steepness this was illustrated in a figure similar to fig 5 in villefer et al 2021 by the distance to toba s law toba 1997 wind waves steepness increases when the points overtake toba s law from above according to fig 5 at medium and high wind speed the points are more gathered in the simulations than in the observations particularly the most pronounced differences are in wind only conditions with the points corresponding to observed wind waves located above toba s law contrary to the simulations thus the model fails to reproduce the high steepness of the wind waves in wind only conditions for each wind speed and for all the parameterizations the simulations exhibit a clear tendency to be horizontally distributed the width of the distribution increases when the wind speed decreases in agreement with the observations the horizontal distribution shows that the wave models simulate wind waves with the same energy but a different peak frequency whether they are generated with or in absence of paddle waves although in wind only conditions simulated wind waves are less steep than in laboratory the simulations succeed in reproducing the wind wave frequency downshift happening when long waves are added to the sea state in villefer et al 2021 the increase of the wind wave friction velocity in the presence of long waves was considered as a possible factor to explain the downshift according to the simulations in which the friction velocity is kept constant with and without long waves this factor is proved not to be the only one explaining the downshift overall the simulations are in rather good agreement with the observed frequency spectra in cases including paddle waves therefore the narrow energy directional distribution selected to model the unidirectional paddle waves does not seem to disturb the nonlinear interactions between both wave systems the general underestimation of the wind wave peak in wind only conditions seems to result from an over dissipation in the wind wave frequency range the wind waves observed in the wind wave tank especially in wind only conditions are very steep the saturation limits defined by ardhuin et al 2010 and van der westhuysen 2007 might then be too restrictive for young laboratory wind waves according to their wave age hence the saturation limit might be more relevant with a definition including a function of wave age this could allow having a more pronounced overshoot in the spectra and an accurate numerical estimation of the energy levels for both the wind wave peak and the hf tail this saturation limit is less problematic for wind waves in the presence of longer waves since their steepness is reduced due to the background long waves the mechanisms at play in this steepness reduction will be further investigated in the following 5 hindcast of showex experiment 5 1 numerical specifications the bathymetry for the north carolina continental shelf was taken from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco publicly available bathymetry data sets the different domains are discretized as follows spatial irregular mesh with an average resolution of 500 m temporal constant time step of 30 s frequency 40 frequencies with a logarithmic distribution f n f 1 q n 1 over the range 0 04 0 72 hz directional regular mesh with 36 directions every 10 it was checked that halving the spatial resolution from 500 m to 250 m does not change the simulated spectra the spatial mesh convergence is thus satisfied the wind field is taken from the cfsr time series in open access in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website fig 6 gives an overview of the numerical spatial domain colored with the wind velocity 65 000 nodes it depicts the wind acceleration when the distance to the coast increases the swell frequency spectra from the measurements at the x6 buoy offshore are imposed as boundary condition on the offshore side of the spatial domain the unstable atmospheric boundary layer is not taken into account in the simulations these atmospheric conditions would result in a slight wind wave growth amplification see ardhuin et al 2007 for more details therefore this amplification is ignored in our case since the default numerical settings consider a neutral atmospheric boundary layer when using q st4 it was found that imposing a parametric hf tail was not necessary to obtain a variance density smooth f 4 decrease rate this decrease rate has been largely discussed in the literature toba 1973 and is supported by numerous observations kawai et al 1977 furthermore the deactivation of the parametric tail was required to obtain spatially converged results not shown when using q st4 gqm neither the parametric hf tail nor the wave growth limiter were activated these features are commonly used respectively to insure the physical shape of the spectrum at high frequencies and to guarantee the numerical stability of the calculations due to the physical shortcomings of the model parameterizations having numerically stable simulations without using these tools is a proof of the physical relevance of the st4 gqm parameterization 5 2 results in section 4 the numerical model has proved to be quite adapted with a friction velocity forcing for reproducing the laboratory bimodal sea states the purpose of our work is to assess the extent at which laboratory observations by villefer et al 2021 can be transported at coastal scale hence it is necessary to verify the model s performances for simulating bimodal sea states at coastal scale this validation step is based on the evaluation of tomawac s performances in reproducing the spatial characteristics of wind wave growth over an opposing background swell within the scope of the showex campaign fig 7 depicts the simulated wind wave energy and peak frequency variations with fetch these variations are compared to the showex observations and kahma and calkoen 1992 law for stable stratification obtained from a collection of laboratory and ocean data in the observations one can distinguish two kinds of gray circles referring to two spectral methods for separating wind waves from swell the open circles refer to ardhuin et al 2007 s analysis considering the wind sea energy at frequencies above the first maximum of the directional spread over frequencies the solid circles refer to a spectral separation method based on jonswap type spectra fitted on the observed bimodal spectra from villefer et al 2021 this method is also used to obtain the simulated wind wave energy and peak frequencies hence the model s results are compared to the observations according to the full circles in the following the vertical distance between solid and empty circles at each fetch in fig 7 depicts the degree of arbitrariness existing between methods for separating swell and wind waves in fig 7 a each parameterization reproduces energy variations in agreement with showex observations and the empirical laws for the energy and the peak frequency however the wind wave energy level is systematically overestimated in the simulations especially by vdw at a medium fetch this systematic overestimation can be explained to some extent by the choice of the wind hindcast file a finer setting of the parameterizations design parameters such as alday et al 2021 did by modifying the wind input and dissipation parameters for global scale applications could improve the quality of the estimated energy level for example ardhuin et al 2007 test443 parameterization for st4 black triangles in fig 7 is in close agreement with the observations open circles it should be noted that gqm was activated without changing any dissipation or wind input settings originally calibrated for dia method performing global hindcasts would be necessary to further improve gqm performances by adopting a finer setting for gqm parameters recently beyramzadeh and siadatmousavi 2022 implemented the gqm method in ww3 and performed hindcasts on hurricanes observed in the gulf of mexico their conclusion similar to ours is that a redesign and a recalibration of q in and q ds would be necessary to fully benefit from gqm s improvements regarding fig 7 b st4 gqm red lines clearly outperforms the parameterization using dia method in reproducing the downshift of the wind wave peak frequency with fetch the frequency variation depicted by the red curve is in agreement with showex observations and the empirical law the differences with parameterizations based on dia appear at short fetch with an underestimation of the peak frequency this initial underestimation results in reduced variations that eventually give an accurate peak frequency at longer fetch fig 8 shows the spatial evolution of frequency spectra at buoys bravo x3 and x6 respectively the 2 nd 4th and last locations relative to increasing fetch in fig 7 the features observed in fig 7 are encountered again in fig 8 with the overestimation of the wind wave energy and the accurate estimation of the wind wave peak frequency by st4 gqm the swell peak is rather well reproduced in the simulations vdw parameterization shows a stronger dissipation of the swell with fetch resulting from the dissipation term partly based on komen et al 1984 in fig 8 a and b the st4 gqm simulations red spectra overestimate the hf side of the swell peak degrading the agreement with the observations this overestimation can either result from the 4 wave interactions or from a lack of dissipation of the hf part of the swell in the shoaling process the overestimation eventually disappears at maximal fetch fig 8 c another proof of st4 gqm performances is illustrated by the width of the simulated spectra while vdw and st4 parameterizations depict a rather large wind wave peak in fig 8 a and b st4 gqm gives a narrower peak which is more representative of the observed spectra fig 9 shows a set of observed and simulated directional spectra at bravo location one should keep in mind that the methods to obtain directional spectra from buoy measurements such as gauge arrays asis or single point systems ddw only give an estimation of the directional properties the energy distribution along frequencies and directions can vary between the different methods here the directional spectra from the observations are obtained using the maximum likelihood method mlm a classification of methods to analyze directional wave spectra was performed by benoit et al 1997 in fig 9 the original directional spectra are multiplied by the squared frequency to highlight the energy of the wind waves directional spectra from simulations with and without swell are plotted to assess the extent at which swell impacts the wind wave direction looking at the observations in fig 9 a the equilibrium range clear blue is slightly deviated from the wind direction towards the alongshore direction however the wind wave peak dark blue green color direction is aligned with wind direction using the same showex event this deviation has been addressed by ardhuin et al 2007 and zhang et al 2009 first by observing the wind wave mean directions ardhuin et al 2007 and ardhuin et al 2010 associated this deviation to the slanting fetch properties they observed a similar but amplified wind wave deviation in their models with a significant bias compared to showex observations towards the alongshore direction this amplification was even more marked with a saturation based dissipation term zhang et al 2009 argued that the slanting fetch has the property to deviate the wind wave peak but not the waves in the equilibrium range according to them the waves in the equilibrium range are deviated due to the wind stress angle that can be shifted from the wind direction by the presence of ocean currents in the present simulations no current is taken into account and no shifting of the wave equilibrium range is observed in the corresponding spectra plotted in fig 9 the numerically estimated wave equilibrium range has the same direction as the wind in all parameterizations however according to vdw and st4 parameterizations with and without swell the wind wave peak direction has a bias of about 30 in the alongshore direction this bias is certainly due to the slanting fetch properties somehow amplified by the numerical model vdw is the only parameterization showing a clear wind wave energy amplification in the presence of swell this amplification is another consequence of the use of komen et al 1984 s dissipation term with a background swell the differences between dia method and gqm to take into account the 4 wave interaction in a sea state including wind waves are well illustrated in fig 9 according to fig 9 d and g the wind wave peak simulated with st4 gqm differs from vdw and st4 in terms of directional distribution of the wave energy near the wind wave peak three peaks can be distinguished the main peak i e the more energetic in red follows the alongshore propagation tendency observed in vdw and st4 while the secondary peak i e yellow is aligned with the wind direction lastly the third peak is directed offshore overall with the presence of the secondary peak gqm st4 slightly improves the agreement between the numerical model and the observations regarding the mutual influences between swell and wind wave peaks the wave systems do not seem to have significant effects on each other in fig 10 the frequency spectra mean directions and directional spreadings simulated with st4 qm are compared to the observations at two values of fetch 26 km and 89 km buoys x3 and x6 respectively at buoy x3 the simulated and observed wind wave peak frequencies are identical fig 10 a however the distribution of the wind wave energy is slightly shifted towards hfs in the simulation a similar shift is encountered regarding the mean direction and the directional spread fig 10 b and c hence as observed in fig 9 the simulated mean direction is still slightly overestimated in the alongshore direction in fig 10 c the simulated wind wave directional spreading is overestimated by about 10 at buoy x6 the simulated wind wave peak is in rather good agreement with the observations regarding the main direction and the angular spread fig 10 e and f yet the simulated peak frequency is still shifted towards hfs compared to the simulations in figs 9 10 proves that the model shows better performances in reproducing the directional properties at a larger fetch where the influence of the slanting fetch configuration decreases the simulations at laboratory and coastal scales prove that the chosen parameterizations are sufficiently accurate to reproduce both laboratory and coastal observations among the parameterizations the aforementioned results showed that st4 gqm slightly outperforms simulations with dia at laboratory scale in terms of peak frequency variations with fetch and at coastal scale in terms of the directional distribution of the wave energy st4 gqm is used in the next section on a generic case to study the effect of swell on wind wave growth at coastal scale 6 application to the study of wind wave growth over swell 6 1 numerical specifications a generic mesh was created to study wind wave growth over a background following swell the maximal fetch for this study was set to 60 km the mesh resolution is 500 m the selected generic atmospheric conditions are in such a way that a wind at a velocity u 10 12 m s is blowing over a swell jonswap type with a 10 s peak period propagating in the wind direction simulations were run with six swell energy levels ranging from no swell to a swell with a significant wave height h m 0 2 m the swell energy levels are identified in figs 11 and 12 by swell energy percentages i e 0 to 100 corresponding to 0 to 2 m wave height for instance 40 is equivalent to a swell with h m 0 0 4 2 1 26 m two test cases were selected in both cases the st4 gqm parameterization is used and the simulations are run with the six different swell magnitudes the purpose of the first case is to let the wave model handle the whole wind wave generation process and to observe the final results when the sea state reaches a stationary state for this first case only the swell given the aforementioned percentage is present in the initial condition of the simulations fig 11 shows the corresponding stationary spectra the second test case inspired by masson 1993 study aims at observing the source term balance for specific sea states consisting in the addition of two jonswap spectra as illustrated in fig 12 a one is the swell system with f p 0 1 hz and six different energy levels and the other one represents a wind wave system with f p 0 2 hz 5 s peak period and h m 0 1 m in fig 12 a the wind wave energy levels are slightly affected by swell energy this is due to the addition of the energy in the hf tail of the jonswap swell spectrum considering q in q ds and q nl the source term balance is calculated and given in fig 12 b and c 6 2 results as mentioned above the wind wave modifications in the presence of swell are difficult to observe in the ocean and in coastal areas this is partly due to the complex notion of fetch when dealing with vast areas of water and winds varying both in space and in time here we suggest using a numerical model to overcome the problem fig 11 proves that given the parameterizations and hypotheses on which our simulations are based with the use of tomawac the wind wave generation is largely modified with a background swell given the constant wind speed u 10 the only parameter changing between the different simulations i e different colors in fig 11 is the swell height the downshift of the wind wave peak frequency with increasing swell height is clear with the wind wave peak frequency varying from 0 2 hz to almost 0 15 hz equivalent to a variation from 5 to 6 7 s in terms of peak period this downshift observed in fig 11 is in agreement with the downshift observed during the laboratory experiments fig 1 in order to further analyze the physical processes leading to the downshift the source terms involved in tomawac simulations are investigated in fig 12 this separation of the physical processes is inspired from masson 1993 study in which the nonlinear coupling between swell and wind waves was examined here the influence of the balance between the wind energy input and the whitecapping dissipation is studied in addition to the 4 wave interactions term according to fig 12 b the balance between q in and q ds is positive wave generation prevails over wave dissipation so wave components are only growing hence at the stage considered in fig 12 the wave spectra did not reach an equilibrium state the observation of this duration limited stage is necessary to identify the processes leading to the downshift in fig 12 b the most striking effect of the swell energy on wind wave growth is the large wind wave generation on the hf side of the swell peak a significant amount of energy is added to the wave system in the frequency range between the swell and the wind wave peaks such wave generation on the low frequency part of the wind wave peak facilitates the wind wave frequency downshift this observation is in agreement with villefer et al 2021 hypothesis according the them the energy continuum brought by the swell hf tail would initiate wind wave growth at a lower frequency than in absence of swell fig 12 c recalls masson 1993 study on nonlinear coupling between swell and wind waves as said above according to this latter reference 4 wave interactions are involved in the wind wave evolution when the ratio of swell to wind wave frequency is greater than 0 6 in our case this ratio is 0 5 in fig 12 c q nl shows slight variations accounting for the slight differences in wind wave energy levels see fig 12 a apart from these variations the swell does not seem to have a significant effect on the 4 wave interactions term that could have a notable effect on wind wave growth this latter assertion is in agreement with masson s ratio the present analysis could be completed by studying the magnitude of the downshift as a function of the spectral width of the swell peak it comes from the present analysis that the hf tail of the swell peak artificially increases the fetch available for wind wave growth by initiating wave generation at a lower frequency than without swell however in many cases swell spectral peaks do not carry much energy in the hf range given the latter analysis the observed downshift is therefore expected to be reduced with a sharper and narrower swell peak hence further analysis could be performed by testing different shapes for the swell peak with a narrow gaussian shape for instance this is left for future work overall studying the influence of swell on wind wave generation based on the use of a spectral wave model with a generic domain enables to gain insights on the physical processes at play in the wind wave growth process for complex sea state conditions however this insight may be biased due to the limitations and the large extent of empiricism involved in the physical processes modeled in such numerical models see e g cavaleri et al 2007 although the general shape of the wave spectrum has been reproduced to some extent by the numerical model at laboratory and coastal scales the source and sink terms combination is not validated there is a multitude of combinations between generation and dissipation terms that might lead to the observed spectra yet the gap between the understanding of the physical processes and their mathematical formulations as source and sink terms in 3g wave models is constantly decreasing the present analysis involving wind wave tank experiments and numerical simulations is still rather exploratory and could be continued to assess the effect of several physical parameters on wind wave growth in more diverse configurations parameters such as the wind direction relative to the swell direction the water depth or the atmospheric stability could be investigated among others 7 extension of the results to real ocean waves a downshift of the wind wave peak frequency was observed in marseilles wind wave tunnel when long paddle waves were added into the wave system villefer et al 2021 to which extent these laboratory observations can be upscaled at coastal scale with swell instead of paddle waves this is not an easy question since the long paddle waves generated in wind wave tunnels have a wave age radically smaller than typical ocean swell in the present paper the method chosen to address the question is based on the use of a 3g spectral wave model the initial hypothesis is that if the numerical model can faithfully reproduce the laboratory experiments i e the frequency downshift and the evolution of a bimodal sea states i e combining wind waves and swell at a coastal scale it can be used to upscale the laboratory experiment to the coastal scale and by decomposing the physical processes at play when wind waves grow the model can help to identify the physical processes responsible for the downshift the first stage of our methodology was to evaluate tomawac performances in reproducing bimodal sea states at laboratory and coastal scales amongst the different parameterizations the combination st4 gqm gives on average the best agreement between simulations and observations overall st4 gqm shows a rather faithful reproduction of the observations both in terms of wave energy and peak frequency variations with fetch nevertheless there are two main limitations of the model at laboratory scale the model largely underestimates the wind wave peak energy in wind only conditions i e without paddle waves at coastal scale in the presence of slanting fetch conditions of the selected event showex campaign the model succeeds only partially in simulating the directional distribution of the wind wave energy yet one interesting feature is the numerical simulation of a downshift similar to the experiments at laboratory scale to a lesser extent though the second stage of our methodology consisted in creating a generic coastal domain to upscale the laboratory experiments at coastal scale the first test case fig 11 reveals a marked wind wave peak frequency downshift increasing with swell intensity according to the simulations the wind wave peak period can be shifted by more than 1 s when a background swell is present this wave period shift would have significant effects on the design of breakwaters or offshore structures for instance in a second test case fig 12 we took advantage of the separation of the physical processes i e q in q ds and q nl to identify the source and sink terms responsible for the spectral downshift the wind input term is the best candidate given the wave generation happening on the low frequency part of the wind wave peak in the presence of swell this wind wave generation at frequencies lower than without swell appears to be due to the continuum of energy brought by the swell peak in the hf range the methodology described in the present study is essentially based on the wave model reliability in modeling the physical processes at play when wind waves grow this validity was evaluated to a large extent by performing comparisons between the numerical model results and wave observations such a verification makes our methodology more consistent but the results must be appreciated in light of the validation stage we performed 8 conclusion the performances of a 3g wave model were assessed for the simulation of bimodal sea state conditions at laboratory and coastal scales three sets of parameterizations for the source and sink terms were tested and compared with the observations at both scales the similarity between the different sets lies in the modeling of the dissipation by whitecapping using a saturation based model the latter choice results from the limitations of komen et al 1984 dissipation model in bimodal sea state conditions highlighted in several references e g ardhuin et al 2007 the st4 gqm combination recently and originally developed in tomawac uses a highly accurate method gqm to compute the nonlinear 4 wave interactions benoit 2005 gagnaire renou et al 2010 within this set gqm is combined with the recent and largely adopted st4 parameterization for the whitecapping dissipation sink term ardhuin et al 2010 compared to the other sets based on the dia method st4 gqm simulations are roughly 50 times longer than the other sets due to the cpu time to compute q nl with gqm overall all the sets of parameterizations showed good performances for the reproduction of the frequency spectra by comparison with the observations at both scales the st4 gqm combination albeit computationally demanding showed two interesting facets at laboratory scale it differentiates from the other sets with a very accurate reproduction of the wind wave peak frequency variations with fetch at coastal scale it is the set showing the best agreement in terms of directional properties by comparison with the observations in addition to these two facets simulations with st4 gqm can be run without imposing any diagnostic hf tail and without using any wave growth limiter lastly the st4 gqm set was used to investigate the relevance of a physical phenomenon observed at laboratory scale within a bimodal sea state combining two wind wave systems at coastal scale within a bimodal sea state combining swell and wind waves to improve the results of the present study it would be necessary to remove the friction velocity forcing adopted for the simulations at laboratory scale recent studies aimed to improve the calculation of the friction velocity by further including the effects of nonlinearity with janssen and bidlot 2021 revision of janssen 1991 source term or with the use of a wave boundary layer model as in du et al 2017 to further improve the directional properties of the simulated spectra romero 2019 proposed an anisotropic parameterization of the dissipation by whitecapping showing promising directional properties the use of 3g spectral wave models at laboratory scale could permit to further validate the different parameterizations for the source and sink terms in idealized conditions lastly the simulations on a generic coastal domain could be continued to investigate wind wave growth with a background swell considering several aspects such as the relative angle between swell and wind direction the presence of a variable depth the directional spread of the swell system etc

23773,a downshift of the wind wave peak frequency was observed in a wind wave tunnel when irregular long paddle waves i e generated mechanically with a plane wave maker are added in the sea state the 3rd generation spectral wave model tomawac is used to assess the extent at which this peak frequency downshift can take place at prototype scale in bimodal sea state conditions involving swell and wind wave systems several parameterizations of the modeled physical processes are selected to numerically reproduce the laboratory experiments in the first place then the model performances are further inquired in reproducing coastal observations during a specific event combining a wind wave and a swell system overall a good agreement is obtained between the simulations and the observations both at laboratory and coastal scale in particular a set of parameterizations combining one of the latest developments in spectral wave models for the whitecapping dissipation and the nonlinear 4 wave interactions reveals high performances in reproducing the observations lastly based on the performances of this latter set of parameterizations a generic numerical domain with typical coastal scale dimensions is created to inquire the occurrence of the downshift at prototype scale this last study reveals a wind wave peak period shift from 5 s without swell to more than 6 5 s with a 2 m high swell keywords bimodal sea states wind waves swell wind wave tunnel spectral wave model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sea states combining several wave systems such as swell and wind waves are very common both in open oceans and in coastal areas thompson et al 2018 mason et al 2008 although the occurrence of these complex sea states has been addressed several times in the literature it is not quite settled whether the wind waves are generated the same way with or without a background swell the purpose of this paper is to evaluate 3 rd generation hereafter denoted 3g wave models performances for bimodal sea states modeling given recent improvements in wind wave generation parameterizations then such a model is further used to investigate the physics behind the combinations of both wave systems with the purpose to study wind wave growth in the presence of swell a preliminary approach consists in studying the generation of short wind waves in the presence of a longer wave system in the well controlled conditions of a wind wave tank such facilities allow the combination of both wave systems generated using an air blower and a mechanical paddle wave maker respectively mitsuyasu 1966 phillips and banner 1974 donelan 1987 and villefer et al 2021 yet the long paddle waves generated in wind wave tanks are significantly different from ocean swell in terms of wave age ξ c p u 10 with c p the peak phase celerity and u 10 the wind velocity at 10 m above the mean water level mwl respective wave ages are larger than 1 for typical ocean swell and generally lower than 0 5 for paddle waves in wind wave tanks to avoid surface tension effects therefore the different wave systems generated in a wind wave tank should be considered as different components of the wind sea with lower and higher peak frequencies rather than real swell and wind sea hereafter for readability reasons short wind generated waves are denoted wind waves and long mechanically generated waves are denoted paddle waves donelan s 1987 wind wave tank experiments revealed a reduction of the wind sea variance by a factor of about 2 5 in the presence of following monochromatic paddle waves replacing the monochromatic waves by jonswap type paddle waves villefer et al 2021 showed that the wind wave peak frequency is shifted towards lower frequencies due to the background paddle waves however the extension of these results for the study of wind wave growth over real ocean swell is complicated by the high steepness and the low wave age of the laboratory paddle waves compared to open ocean swell at prototype scale a common approach to physically characterize such a bimodal sea state involves in situ observations of its spatial development thus the conditions for these observations must be in a coastal area where a wind is blowing steadily offshore i e fetch limited conditions and opposing a swell directed inshore ardhuin et al 2007 hwang et al 2011 these very specific conditions make the characterization of bimodal sea states rather difficult at natural scale some observations showed a modification of wind wave growth in the presence of swell donelan et al 1997 hwang et al 2011 vincent et al 2019 according to hwang et al 2011 wind wave generation and development are enhanced with an opposing background swell these observations lead to physical interpretations swell is expected to modify the wind velocity profile donelan et al 1997 chen and belcher 2000 to increase the breaking of the wind sea phillips and banner 1974 and to alter the nonlinear 4 wave interactions masson 1993 however based on observations in the north carolina continental shelf during the shoaling waves experiment showex ardhuin et al 2007 showed that a moderate swell has no significant effect on the bulk parameters characterizing the wind sea both the idealized laboratory conditions and the realistic in situ observations are necessary to understand the processes at play when wind waves are generated over a preexisting swell with the purpose to unify the different observations our approach is based on the use of the 3g spectral wave model tomawac part of the telemac mascaret hydro informatic system benoit et al 1996 to upscale villefer et al 2021 laboratory results to the coastal scale the model is used to numerically reproduce first the laboratory experiments and then an event during the showex campaign taking advantage of the physical processes separation involved in wind wave generation the laboratory experiments hindcast aims to assess the extent at which the observed spectral downshift can occur at prototype scale however the accuracy of 3g wave models remains questionable for a simulation including more than one wave system as shown in latest developments in 3g wave models ardhuin et al 2010 gagnaire renou et al 2010 while the integral parameters such as the significant wave height and representative periods can be well predicted for this kind of sea states the frequency and directional distributions of the wave energy remain rather inaccurate however these distributions are of prime importance for applications such as the design of coastal protections or offshore structures recent developments in wave models proved that improving the whitecapping dissipation modeling was necessary to better simulate the combination of swell and wind sea this dissipation process is considered as the least understood part of the physics relevant to wave modeling by cavaleri et al 2007 the first operational dissipation parameterization in 3g wave models was the one developed by komen et al 1984 loosely following hasselmann 1974 s work in which whitecaps act as a pressure pulse countering the rise of the sea surface in the case of swell and wind wave combination the main weakness of this parameterization is the use of an averaged wave steepness to determine the dissipation rate since swell and wind waves have a low and high steepness respectively the presence of swell leads to anomalously high wind waves due to a lack of dissipation and vice versa bidlot et al 2007 partly corrected this issue by re defining the averaged steepness used in the latter parameterization to increase the dissipation at higher frequencies i e wind wave frequencies to further solve this issue dissipation models using a local saturation spectrum rather than an integral wave steepness have been developed based on the work of alves and banner 2003 first van der westhuysen 2007 combined the advantages of a saturation model van der westhuysen et al 2007 and a model based on the average wave steepness of the sea state komen et al 1984 secondly ardhuin et al 2010 developed a new set of source sink terms taking into account the breaking threshold approach with a saturation term the dissipation of short waves by larger breakers and the swell dissipation over long distances another improvement in the bimodal sea state modeling regards the nonlinear 4 wave interactions an exact equation with boltzmann type integral describing these interactions has been proposed by hasselmann 1962 and zakharov 1968 since then a substantial work has been devoted to find a good balance between a computationally efficient and an accurate resolution of these interactions masson 1993 showed that nonlinear 4 wave interactions are involved in bimodal spectra evolution when the ratio of long wave to short wave frequencies is greater than 0 6 the standard discrete interaction approximation dia method that triggered the outbreak of 3g wave models is a computationally efficient method to estimate these interactions however it suffers from many shortcomings regarding the frequency and directional distribution of wave energy compared to exact methods benoit 2005 according to masson s work a more accurate method to solve the nonlinear 4 wave interactions might be required for bimodal spectra simulations based on the gaussian quadrature method gqm lavrenov 2001 gagnaire renou et al 2010 developed an algorithm using numerical integration methods of high accuracy in the following this original method is used to assess wind wave growth in the presence of swell both at laboratory and coastal scales to compare the simulations with observations an appropriate scaling is applied following kitaigorodskii 1961 in the present study wind wave growth is described in two manners both based on a spectral analysis of the sea states on the one hand using the variance density spectrum e f θ x t at a location x and a time t where f and θ are the wave frequency and direction respectively on the other hand using the fetch x peak frequency f p and the total variance of the free surface elevation m 0 η 2 those variables are made dimensionless using u 10 and the acceleration due to gravity g 1a x x g u 10 2 1b f p f p u 10 g 1c m 0 m 0 g 2 u 10 4 in the present paper section 2 presents the laboratory experiments see villefer et al 2021 for a more complete description and the showex event ardhuin et al 2007 against which tomawac s hindcast performances are evaluated section 3 gives an overview of the physics at play in the wave model in order to introduce the different sets of parameterizations later used for the simulations then after a description of the numerical characteristics the results of the simulations at laboratory and at coastal scales are discussed in sections 4 and 5 respectively in light of the preceding discussion a generic numerical domain is created to assess wind wave growth modifications in the presence of a following swell at coastal scale in section 6 section 7 summarizes the present findings and introduces recent 3g wave model developments that could further improve the simulation of bimodal sea state conditions 2 bimodal sea states data sets this section introduces two bimodal sea state data sets used to evaluate the performances of tomawac during the wave generation process at laboratory and coastal scales respectively it is important to note that these data sets are not comparable since they differ in at least two ways a short and a long wind wave systems are combined in the wind wave tank whereas wind waves and oceanic swell coexist at coastal scale both wave systems have the same direction in the wind wave tank whereas they have nearly opposed directions at coastal scale the extension of the laboratory results i e the peak frequency downshift phenomenon at coastal scale is investigated in section 6 2 1 experimental study in a wind wave tank the first dataset consists in a series of experiments carried out in the controlled conditions of the institut de recherche sur les phénomènes hors equilibre irphé pythéas 40 m long wind wave tank in marseilles france the use of such a facility permitted to study wind wave growth in the presence of following long paddle waves the facility and the results are described and discussed in villefer et al 2021 twelve wave gauges distributed along the test section enabled to obtain the fetch limited evolution of the wind waves with and without monochromatic or irregular jonswap type paddle waves for the present study only the spectra depicting wind waves in the presence of irregular paddle waves are considered using the wave gauge situated at the maximal fetch of 30 m fig 1 introduces the 6 cases of interest for this study the frequency wave spectra are considered for three wind speed settings u ref 6 10 and 14 m s with and without paddle waves here u ref is a reference wind speed measured by a sonic anemometer at 1 m above mwl two different values of paddle wave steepness a k of 2 7 and 4 2 with the wave amplitude a 2 m 0 h m 0 2 2 and the wavenumber k k p i e the peak wavenumber are considered for each wind velocity in fig 1 the comparison between spectra with and without paddle waves highlights the downshift of the wind wave frequency peak in the presence of paddle waves this downshift tends to increase with increasing paddle wave steepness by fitting the vertical profile of the horizontal wind velocity with a logarithmic profile method see monin and obukhov 1954 villefer et al 2021 found that the friction velocity at the air sea interface u had a tendency to increase in the presence of a background following paddle waves this tendency can be retained as a first hypothesis to explain the above mentioned downshift as a result of an increase of the momentum transfer from the wind to the waves with paddle waves the following numerical simulations are analyzed given these observed experimental features 2 2 showex in situ observations in north carolina continental shelf the second dataset considered for model s validation is an event that happened during the shoaling waves experiment showex conducted in the north carolina continental shelf east coast of the usa from august to december 1999 six datawell directional waverider ddw buoys ardhuin et al 2003b a were deployed along a cross shelf transect going from 5 to 80 km x1 to x6 to the coastline see fig 2 to obtain the wave spectra and bulk parameters three air sea interaction spar asis buoys graber et al 2000 permitted to obtain the wind properties and additional wave measurements bravo yankee and romeo buoys in fig 2 buoys and stations of the national data buoy center ndbc and the u s army corps of engineers usace provided extra data about the oceanic and atmospheric conditions on 3 rd november 1999 a 10 m s wind u 10 coming from the land westerly wind orange arrow in fig 2 was blowing steadily and uniformly over a time period of 5 h from 12 00 to 17 00 east coast standard time est this led to wind wave generation close to idealized fetch limited conditions with a wind directed at 10 to 30 degrees relative to the normal to the coast i e slightly oblique wind an additional southeasterly swell system blue arrow in fig 2 with a peak period t p 10 s and a significant wave height h s 1 m was nearly opposed to the local wind this event first chosen by ardhuin et al 2007 to validate the spectral wave model wavewatch iii ww3 tolman and chalikov 1996 the wavewatch iii r development group ww3dg 2019 provides rare observations of fetch limited conditions in the presence of a background swell with a large set of wave sensors to assess wind wave growth with fetch the wave spectra calculated from the wave buoys measurements for instance at bravo in fig 2 depicted the evolution of two well defined wave systems the low frequency part with swell energy decreasing from offshore to the coast and the high frequency hf part with wind waves growing with fetch from x1 to x6 looking at bravo directional spectrum in fig 2 one can observe that the wind wave peak is not exactly aligned with the mean wind direction orange dots the main wind wave components are slightly deviated towards the alongshore direction i e θ 160 this observation within the framework of this particular event received two different interpretations in the literature on the one hand it was associated to slanting fetch conditions i e the obliquity of the wind direction relative to the normal to the coast and to wave refraction by ardhuin et al 2007 the turning of the wind wave peak due to slanting fetch conditions is further described in pettersson et al 2010 it is interesting to remark that the wind wave peak mean direction simulated with ww3 in ardhuin et al 2010 including the wave dissipation model they developed showed a 25 bias towards the alongshore direction on the other hand zhang et al 2009 associated the turning of the wind wave peak towards the alongshore direction to a wind stress angle deviated from the wind direction because of surface currents following ardhuin et al 2007 in the case of a slanting fetch the dimensionless fetch in the wind direction is defined extending eq 1a as x x g cos θ w u 10 2 where θ w is the wind direction with respect to the normal to the coast and x is the distance perpendicular to the coast the idealized fetch limited condition the specific directional properties of the observed spectra and the comparison with ww3 results ardhuin et al 2007 2010 provide a valuable database to assess the performances of the present simulations 3 parameterization of the 3 rd generation wave model tomawac is a 3g wave model developed by edf r d using unstructured spatial grid of the oceanic domain for solving the action balance equation benoit et al 1996 to serve that purpose the model simulates the evolution of the action density directional spectrum at each node of a spatial computational grid the balance equation of wave action density is solved for each component f i θ j with discrete frequencies f i and directions θ j each component of the action density spectrum changes in time and space under the effects of wave propagation and software modeled physical processes based on the considerations in ardhuin et al 2007 the current is not taken into account in the present study thereby only the evolution of the surface elevation variance spectrum e t x f θ at a location x and a time t is considered using the following equation 2 d e d t q the left hand size of the equation is the kinematic part and the right hand size gathers the contributions from the physical processes modeled using source and sink terms following ardhuin et al 2007 bottom friction dissipation is considered as negligible here so that q is formulated as in deep water conditions 3 q q in q ds q nl corresponding to the processes of wind energy input q in dissipation through white capping q ds and nonlinear 4 wave interactions q nl in the code each process has several models and formulations that can be adapted to the particularities of the studied case the different source sink terms used in the course of this study are described below from the most to the less known physical mechanisms q nl is the only source term that has been formulated theoretically hasselmann 1962 zakharov 1968 as a boltzmann integral for resonant interactions between quadruplets of surface gravity waves as said above among the methods that have been developed to calculate an approximated solution the above mentioned two methods are used here dia q nl dia and the more accurate as well as computationally heavier gqm q nl gqm the gqm algorithm as implemented in tomawac with the default configuration needs about 50 times the dia cpu time to compute q nl the transfer of momentum from the wind to the sea q in is based on miles feedback mechanism and janssen s quasi linear theory for modeling the ocean atmosphere interaction janssen 1991 2004 and denoted q in j lastly the selected dissipation terms are van der westhuysen 2007 term q ds vdw combining a saturation model van der westhuysen et al 2007 and komen et al 1984 s model and ardhuin et al 2010 term q ds st4 st4 referring to ww3 nomenclature this latter sink term is a combination of different dissipation terms formulated as q ds st4 q sat q bk cu q swell q turb for the following simulations the swell dissipation due to the resistance of the air q swell q out in ardhuin et al 2010 and the dissipation associated to surface turbulence q turb are considered as negligible particularly q swell is not expected to have a significant effect on swell dissipation over the typical distances 150 km maximum in the spatial domain considered here only the saturation term q sat and breaking cumulative term q bk cu i e the dissipation of short waves by long breaking waves are considered the modification of q in j and q nl dia parameterizations described in ardhuin et al 2010 dissipation terms are included when q ds st4 is activated regarding q in j it consists in the inclusion of a sheltering effect accounting for the effect of a background swell on the wind wave generation by adapting the calculation of the friction velocity somewhat like chen and belcher 2000 suggested amongst the parameterizations developed for q ds st4 we chose to use the t471f the wavewatch iii r development group ww3dg 2019 which corresponds to the one used in ww3 at global scale adapted to climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr wind files to reproduce both laboratory and in situ showex observations different sets of parameterizations for the source sink terms are compared vdw q vdw q in j q ds vdw q nl dia associated to blue color in figures of results st4 q st4 q in j q ds st4 q nl dia associated to orange color st4 gqm q st4 gqm q in j q ds vdw q nl gqm associated to red color these parameterizations will be compared with observations associated to gray scale colors 4 hindcast of laboratory experiments 4 1 numerical specifications a first series of simulations of the wind wave tunnel experiments led to some adjustments of the source sink terms parameterizations first the wave growth limiter is deactivated this limiter is generally used to guarantee the numerical stability of the calculation which in our case appears to be unnecessary with a small time step of 0 1 s secondly in q in j the friction velocity at the air sea interface for each wind speed u ref is forced to be constant and equal to the laboratory measured one in the wind only case for simulations with and without paddle waves without this forcing the model tends to overestimate the friction velocity in addition the deep water approximation is adopted since it was shown by villefer et al 2021 that the dissipation due to bottom friction is relatively low lastly since the spectral wave model is not meant for the simulation of strictly unidirectional waves the laboratory paddle waves are modeled with a very narrow directional energy distribution 4 e f θ e f δ cos 20 θ θ 0 with θ θ 0 π 2 θ 0 π 2 and δ is a normalization factor to ensure that the integral of the angular spreading function over π π is equal to 1 it was further verified that the following results with this representation of paddle waves are not sensitive to the directional discretization yet such a definition might change the nonlinear interactions between both wave systems that occurred in the wind wave tank therefore the following results must be analyzed in light of the present directional definition of the paddle wave system 4 2 results hindcasts of laboratory measurements i e without any kinematic similarity are not common in the literature booij et al 2001 and holthuijsen et al 2000 made an attempt to simulate donelan 1987 laboratory observations with the swan model booij et al 1999 they showed significant limitations of 3g wave models to simulate wind wave generation and dissipation processes at laboratory scale indeed wave models are exclusively parameterized for wave hindcasting or forecasting at global regional or coastal scales however as shemer 2019 showed wave generation in wind wave tunnels is to a great extent comparable to in situ wind wave growth thus using the advantages of the well controlled laboratory environment can be a powerful way to validate 3g wave models since the paddle waves and the wind had the same direction in the tank we focus on 1d omnidirectional wave spectra in this case fig 3 depicts the observed spectra at a fetch 30 m by comparisons with the simulated ones columns and rows separate the different values of the steepness a k of irregular paddle waves and the different wind speeds respectively overall the simulations are in good agreement with the observed spectra in the presence of a jonswap type paddle waves on the other hand in wind only conditions the spectral wind wave peak is underestimated in terms of energy and peak frequency booij et al 2001 and holthuijsen et al 2000 raised a similar issue when simulating wind wave growth from laboratory observations with swan the most interesting point to highlight might be that in the simulations the various model variations seem to reproduce a wind wave peak frequency downshift in the presence of background long waves this numerically simulated downshift is however less pronounced than in the experiment it can be noted that the energy levels of the hf tail are overestimated in the simulations with u ref 10 and 14 m s colored lines in fig 3 b c e and f even if the variance density decrease rate at hf is consistent with the observations grey scale for those wind speeds there is an increasing difference between the simulations and the observations from the wind wave peak to higher frequencies it shows a lack of accuracy of the simulations in reproducing the well known overshoot behavior barnett and sutherland 1968 associated to wind wave growth at lower wind speed fig 3 a and d this overshoot is less pronounced and the hf tails seem rather well reproduced by the simulations including the long waves but it is not the case for the wind wave peak colored dotted lines which is underestimated in all panels overall the simulation of an accurate energy level for both the wind wave peak and the hf tail seems to be a barrier when using 3g wave models at such small scale the different models described in section 3 show different levels of performances in reproducing the observed spectra first the vdw set is the only parameterization depicting a slight underestimation of the low frequency wave energy at the highest wind speed this is due to the limitation of komen et al 1984 s parameterization partly included in vdw at higher frequencies vdw generally underestimates the energy of the wind wave peak with and without the long waves such a behavior reveals an over dissipation of the wind sea system in q ds vdw regarding the wind only case vdw simulates a wind wave peak frequency that tends to be shifted toward low frequencies by comparison with the observations at the largest wind speed u ref 14 m s all the models tend to have an excessively energetic wind wave peak in the cases with long waves and an excessively low wind wave peak frequency in wind only conditions as highlighted in villefer et al 2021 the limitation of the techniques to measure the wind velocity profile could lead to the calculation of an excessive value of the friction velocity since the friction velocity forcing is taken from the experimental value the wind wave peak energy and frequency can be expected to be respectively over and under estimated at higher wind speeds st4 parameterization seems to better estimate the wind wave peak energy than vdw both with and without long waves but still depicts a largely downshifted peak frequency for the wind only case with a more accurate resolution for the 4 wave interactions with gqm the simulations in wind only conditions give a better compromise in terms of energy level and peak frequency the differences between st4 with dia and st4 with gqm is well illustrated in the simulations with long waves in fig 3 a and d the red spectra gqm depict a slightly narrower wind wave peak than the orange spectra dia simulating narrower spectra is a well known property when improving the accuracy of the method for solving the 4 wave interactions benoit 2005 finally considering the simulations with and without long waves st4 gqm might be the parameterization showing the best overall performances in reproducing the bimodal spectra observed in marseilles wind wave tank fig 4 is obtained by separating the wind waves from the paddle waves using a decomposition of the sea state into two jonswap spectra fitted using a method presented in villefer et al 2021 it tempers the agreement between the simulated and the observed wind wave peak energy illustrated in fig 3 in fig 4 a the 3g wave model overestimates the wind wave energy at all fetches with an exception at maximal fetch nevertheless the simulated wind wave energy variations with fetch show a slope similar to kahma and calkoen 1992 formula and close to the observations regarding the simulated wind waves peak frequency variations with fetch the model reproduces rather well the observed bimodal sea states in terms of magnitude and slope however the simulated variation of the wind wave peak frequency without paddle waves dotted lines in fig 4 b clearly different from the corresponding observations black squares is similar to the observations with paddle waves black circles this latter issue also observed in fig 3 is linked to the difficult question of triggering wind wave growth in 3g wave models the wind wave growth initialization commonly used following cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 was not adapted for wave simulation at laboratory scale in our case not shown thus we triggered wind wave growth by using the measured wind wave spectrum at a fetch 5 m as an input boundary condition in our simulations a difference is observed between the horizontal location of the hf peak of colored plain line spectra and the corresponding peak of dotted line spectra in fig 3 especially at high wind speed this difference is observed once again in fig 4 b between the dashed and plain color lines hence the downshift of the wind wave peak in the presence of long waves first observed during the laboratory experiments villefer et al 2021 is observed once again in the simulations to a smaller extent to further characterize this phenomenon fig 5 illustrates the differences between its observations in laboratory black dots and their simulations colored dots in laboratory the downshift does not result in a modification of the wind wave energy hence it implies a reduction of the wind wave steepness this was illustrated in a figure similar to fig 5 in villefer et al 2021 by the distance to toba s law toba 1997 wind waves steepness increases when the points overtake toba s law from above according to fig 5 at medium and high wind speed the points are more gathered in the simulations than in the observations particularly the most pronounced differences are in wind only conditions with the points corresponding to observed wind waves located above toba s law contrary to the simulations thus the model fails to reproduce the high steepness of the wind waves in wind only conditions for each wind speed and for all the parameterizations the simulations exhibit a clear tendency to be horizontally distributed the width of the distribution increases when the wind speed decreases in agreement with the observations the horizontal distribution shows that the wave models simulate wind waves with the same energy but a different peak frequency whether they are generated with or in absence of paddle waves although in wind only conditions simulated wind waves are less steep than in laboratory the simulations succeed in reproducing the wind wave frequency downshift happening when long waves are added to the sea state in villefer et al 2021 the increase of the wind wave friction velocity in the presence of long waves was considered as a possible factor to explain the downshift according to the simulations in which the friction velocity is kept constant with and without long waves this factor is proved not to be the only one explaining the downshift overall the simulations are in rather good agreement with the observed frequency spectra in cases including paddle waves therefore the narrow energy directional distribution selected to model the unidirectional paddle waves does not seem to disturb the nonlinear interactions between both wave systems the general underestimation of the wind wave peak in wind only conditions seems to result from an over dissipation in the wind wave frequency range the wind waves observed in the wind wave tank especially in wind only conditions are very steep the saturation limits defined by ardhuin et al 2010 and van der westhuysen 2007 might then be too restrictive for young laboratory wind waves according to their wave age hence the saturation limit might be more relevant with a definition including a function of wave age this could allow having a more pronounced overshoot in the spectra and an accurate numerical estimation of the energy levels for both the wind wave peak and the hf tail this saturation limit is less problematic for wind waves in the presence of longer waves since their steepness is reduced due to the background long waves the mechanisms at play in this steepness reduction will be further investigated in the following 5 hindcast of showex experiment 5 1 numerical specifications the bathymetry for the north carolina continental shelf was taken from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco publicly available bathymetry data sets the different domains are discretized as follows spatial irregular mesh with an average resolution of 500 m temporal constant time step of 30 s frequency 40 frequencies with a logarithmic distribution f n f 1 q n 1 over the range 0 04 0 72 hz directional regular mesh with 36 directions every 10 it was checked that halving the spatial resolution from 500 m to 250 m does not change the simulated spectra the spatial mesh convergence is thus satisfied the wind field is taken from the cfsr time series in open access in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa website fig 6 gives an overview of the numerical spatial domain colored with the wind velocity 65 000 nodes it depicts the wind acceleration when the distance to the coast increases the swell frequency spectra from the measurements at the x6 buoy offshore are imposed as boundary condition on the offshore side of the spatial domain the unstable atmospheric boundary layer is not taken into account in the simulations these atmospheric conditions would result in a slight wind wave growth amplification see ardhuin et al 2007 for more details therefore this amplification is ignored in our case since the default numerical settings consider a neutral atmospheric boundary layer when using q st4 it was found that imposing a parametric hf tail was not necessary to obtain a variance density smooth f 4 decrease rate this decrease rate has been largely discussed in the literature toba 1973 and is supported by numerous observations kawai et al 1977 furthermore the deactivation of the parametric tail was required to obtain spatially converged results not shown when using q st4 gqm neither the parametric hf tail nor the wave growth limiter were activated these features are commonly used respectively to insure the physical shape of the spectrum at high frequencies and to guarantee the numerical stability of the calculations due to the physical shortcomings of the model parameterizations having numerically stable simulations without using these tools is a proof of the physical relevance of the st4 gqm parameterization 5 2 results in section 4 the numerical model has proved to be quite adapted with a friction velocity forcing for reproducing the laboratory bimodal sea states the purpose of our work is to assess the extent at which laboratory observations by villefer et al 2021 can be transported at coastal scale hence it is necessary to verify the model s performances for simulating bimodal sea states at coastal scale this validation step is based on the evaluation of tomawac s performances in reproducing the spatial characteristics of wind wave growth over an opposing background swell within the scope of the showex campaign fig 7 depicts the simulated wind wave energy and peak frequency variations with fetch these variations are compared to the showex observations and kahma and calkoen 1992 law for stable stratification obtained from a collection of laboratory and ocean data in the observations one can distinguish two kinds of gray circles referring to two spectral methods for separating wind waves from swell the open circles refer to ardhuin et al 2007 s analysis considering the wind sea energy at frequencies above the first maximum of the directional spread over frequencies the solid circles refer to a spectral separation method based on jonswap type spectra fitted on the observed bimodal spectra from villefer et al 2021 this method is also used to obtain the simulated wind wave energy and peak frequencies hence the model s results are compared to the observations according to the full circles in the following the vertical distance between solid and empty circles at each fetch in fig 7 depicts the degree of arbitrariness existing between methods for separating swell and wind waves in fig 7 a each parameterization reproduces energy variations in agreement with showex observations and the empirical laws for the energy and the peak frequency however the wind wave energy level is systematically overestimated in the simulations especially by vdw at a medium fetch this systematic overestimation can be explained to some extent by the choice of the wind hindcast file a finer setting of the parameterizations design parameters such as alday et al 2021 did by modifying the wind input and dissipation parameters for global scale applications could improve the quality of the estimated energy level for example ardhuin et al 2007 test443 parameterization for st4 black triangles in fig 7 is in close agreement with the observations open circles it should be noted that gqm was activated without changing any dissipation or wind input settings originally calibrated for dia method performing global hindcasts would be necessary to further improve gqm performances by adopting a finer setting for gqm parameters recently beyramzadeh and siadatmousavi 2022 implemented the gqm method in ww3 and performed hindcasts on hurricanes observed in the gulf of mexico their conclusion similar to ours is that a redesign and a recalibration of q in and q ds would be necessary to fully benefit from gqm s improvements regarding fig 7 b st4 gqm red lines clearly outperforms the parameterization using dia method in reproducing the downshift of the wind wave peak frequency with fetch the frequency variation depicted by the red curve is in agreement with showex observations and the empirical law the differences with parameterizations based on dia appear at short fetch with an underestimation of the peak frequency this initial underestimation results in reduced variations that eventually give an accurate peak frequency at longer fetch fig 8 shows the spatial evolution of frequency spectra at buoys bravo x3 and x6 respectively the 2 nd 4th and last locations relative to increasing fetch in fig 7 the features observed in fig 7 are encountered again in fig 8 with the overestimation of the wind wave energy and the accurate estimation of the wind wave peak frequency by st4 gqm the swell peak is rather well reproduced in the simulations vdw parameterization shows a stronger dissipation of the swell with fetch resulting from the dissipation term partly based on komen et al 1984 in fig 8 a and b the st4 gqm simulations red spectra overestimate the hf side of the swell peak degrading the agreement with the observations this overestimation can either result from the 4 wave interactions or from a lack of dissipation of the hf part of the swell in the shoaling process the overestimation eventually disappears at maximal fetch fig 8 c another proof of st4 gqm performances is illustrated by the width of the simulated spectra while vdw and st4 parameterizations depict a rather large wind wave peak in fig 8 a and b st4 gqm gives a narrower peak which is more representative of the observed spectra fig 9 shows a set of observed and simulated directional spectra at bravo location one should keep in mind that the methods to obtain directional spectra from buoy measurements such as gauge arrays asis or single point systems ddw only give an estimation of the directional properties the energy distribution along frequencies and directions can vary between the different methods here the directional spectra from the observations are obtained using the maximum likelihood method mlm a classification of methods to analyze directional wave spectra was performed by benoit et al 1997 in fig 9 the original directional spectra are multiplied by the squared frequency to highlight the energy of the wind waves directional spectra from simulations with and without swell are plotted to assess the extent at which swell impacts the wind wave direction looking at the observations in fig 9 a the equilibrium range clear blue is slightly deviated from the wind direction towards the alongshore direction however the wind wave peak dark blue green color direction is aligned with wind direction using the same showex event this deviation has been addressed by ardhuin et al 2007 and zhang et al 2009 first by observing the wind wave mean directions ardhuin et al 2007 and ardhuin et al 2010 associated this deviation to the slanting fetch properties they observed a similar but amplified wind wave deviation in their models with a significant bias compared to showex observations towards the alongshore direction this amplification was even more marked with a saturation based dissipation term zhang et al 2009 argued that the slanting fetch has the property to deviate the wind wave peak but not the waves in the equilibrium range according to them the waves in the equilibrium range are deviated due to the wind stress angle that can be shifted from the wind direction by the presence of ocean currents in the present simulations no current is taken into account and no shifting of the wave equilibrium range is observed in the corresponding spectra plotted in fig 9 the numerically estimated wave equilibrium range has the same direction as the wind in all parameterizations however according to vdw and st4 parameterizations with and without swell the wind wave peak direction has a bias of about 30 in the alongshore direction this bias is certainly due to the slanting fetch properties somehow amplified by the numerical model vdw is the only parameterization showing a clear wind wave energy amplification in the presence of swell this amplification is another consequence of the use of komen et al 1984 s dissipation term with a background swell the differences between dia method and gqm to take into account the 4 wave interaction in a sea state including wind waves are well illustrated in fig 9 according to fig 9 d and g the wind wave peak simulated with st4 gqm differs from vdw and st4 in terms of directional distribution of the wave energy near the wind wave peak three peaks can be distinguished the main peak i e the more energetic in red follows the alongshore propagation tendency observed in vdw and st4 while the secondary peak i e yellow is aligned with the wind direction lastly the third peak is directed offshore overall with the presence of the secondary peak gqm st4 slightly improves the agreement between the numerical model and the observations regarding the mutual influences between swell and wind wave peaks the wave systems do not seem to have significant effects on each other in fig 10 the frequency spectra mean directions and directional spreadings simulated with st4 qm are compared to the observations at two values of fetch 26 km and 89 km buoys x3 and x6 respectively at buoy x3 the simulated and observed wind wave peak frequencies are identical fig 10 a however the distribution of the wind wave energy is slightly shifted towards hfs in the simulation a similar shift is encountered regarding the mean direction and the directional spread fig 10 b and c hence as observed in fig 9 the simulated mean direction is still slightly overestimated in the alongshore direction in fig 10 c the simulated wind wave directional spreading is overestimated by about 10 at buoy x6 the simulated wind wave peak is in rather good agreement with the observations regarding the main direction and the angular spread fig 10 e and f yet the simulated peak frequency is still shifted towards hfs compared to the simulations in figs 9 10 proves that the model shows better performances in reproducing the directional properties at a larger fetch where the influence of the slanting fetch configuration decreases the simulations at laboratory and coastal scales prove that the chosen parameterizations are sufficiently accurate to reproduce both laboratory and coastal observations among the parameterizations the aforementioned results showed that st4 gqm slightly outperforms simulations with dia at laboratory scale in terms of peak frequency variations with fetch and at coastal scale in terms of the directional distribution of the wave energy st4 gqm is used in the next section on a generic case to study the effect of swell on wind wave growth at coastal scale 6 application to the study of wind wave growth over swell 6 1 numerical specifications a generic mesh was created to study wind wave growth over a background following swell the maximal fetch for this study was set to 60 km the mesh resolution is 500 m the selected generic atmospheric conditions are in such a way that a wind at a velocity u 10 12 m s is blowing over a swell jonswap type with a 10 s peak period propagating in the wind direction simulations were run with six swell energy levels ranging from no swell to a swell with a significant wave height h m 0 2 m the swell energy levels are identified in figs 11 and 12 by swell energy percentages i e 0 to 100 corresponding to 0 to 2 m wave height for instance 40 is equivalent to a swell with h m 0 0 4 2 1 26 m two test cases were selected in both cases the st4 gqm parameterization is used and the simulations are run with the six different swell magnitudes the purpose of the first case is to let the wave model handle the whole wind wave generation process and to observe the final results when the sea state reaches a stationary state for this first case only the swell given the aforementioned percentage is present in the initial condition of the simulations fig 11 shows the corresponding stationary spectra the second test case inspired by masson 1993 study aims at observing the source term balance for specific sea states consisting in the addition of two jonswap spectra as illustrated in fig 12 a one is the swell system with f p 0 1 hz and six different energy levels and the other one represents a wind wave system with f p 0 2 hz 5 s peak period and h m 0 1 m in fig 12 a the wind wave energy levels are slightly affected by swell energy this is due to the addition of the energy in the hf tail of the jonswap swell spectrum considering q in q ds and q nl the source term balance is calculated and given in fig 12 b and c 6 2 results as mentioned above the wind wave modifications in the presence of swell are difficult to observe in the ocean and in coastal areas this is partly due to the complex notion of fetch when dealing with vast areas of water and winds varying both in space and in time here we suggest using a numerical model to overcome the problem fig 11 proves that given the parameterizations and hypotheses on which our simulations are based with the use of tomawac the wind wave generation is largely modified with a background swell given the constant wind speed u 10 the only parameter changing between the different simulations i e different colors in fig 11 is the swell height the downshift of the wind wave peak frequency with increasing swell height is clear with the wind wave peak frequency varying from 0 2 hz to almost 0 15 hz equivalent to a variation from 5 to 6 7 s in terms of peak period this downshift observed in fig 11 is in agreement with the downshift observed during the laboratory experiments fig 1 in order to further analyze the physical processes leading to the downshift the source terms involved in tomawac simulations are investigated in fig 12 this separation of the physical processes is inspired from masson 1993 study in which the nonlinear coupling between swell and wind waves was examined here the influence of the balance between the wind energy input and the whitecapping dissipation is studied in addition to the 4 wave interactions term according to fig 12 b the balance between q in and q ds is positive wave generation prevails over wave dissipation so wave components are only growing hence at the stage considered in fig 12 the wave spectra did not reach an equilibrium state the observation of this duration limited stage is necessary to identify the processes leading to the downshift in fig 12 b the most striking effect of the swell energy on wind wave growth is the large wind wave generation on the hf side of the swell peak a significant amount of energy is added to the wave system in the frequency range between the swell and the wind wave peaks such wave generation on the low frequency part of the wind wave peak facilitates the wind wave frequency downshift this observation is in agreement with villefer et al 2021 hypothesis according the them the energy continuum brought by the swell hf tail would initiate wind wave growth at a lower frequency than in absence of swell fig 12 c recalls masson 1993 study on nonlinear coupling between swell and wind waves as said above according to this latter reference 4 wave interactions are involved in the wind wave evolution when the ratio of swell to wind wave frequency is greater than 0 6 in our case this ratio is 0 5 in fig 12 c q nl shows slight variations accounting for the slight differences in wind wave energy levels see fig 12 a apart from these variations the swell does not seem to have a significant effect on the 4 wave interactions term that could have a notable effect on wind wave growth this latter assertion is in agreement with masson s ratio the present analysis could be completed by studying the magnitude of the downshift as a function of the spectral width of the swell peak it comes from the present analysis that the hf tail of the swell peak artificially increases the fetch available for wind wave growth by initiating wave generation at a lower frequency than without swell however in many cases swell spectral peaks do not carry much energy in the hf range given the latter analysis the observed downshift is therefore expected to be reduced with a sharper and narrower swell peak hence further analysis could be performed by testing different shapes for the swell peak with a narrow gaussian shape for instance this is left for future work overall studying the influence of swell on wind wave generation based on the use of a spectral wave model with a generic domain enables to gain insights on the physical processes at play in the wind wave growth process for complex sea state conditions however this insight may be biased due to the limitations and the large extent of empiricism involved in the physical processes modeled in such numerical models see e g cavaleri et al 2007 although the general shape of the wave spectrum has been reproduced to some extent by the numerical model at laboratory and coastal scales the source and sink terms combination is not validated there is a multitude of combinations between generation and dissipation terms that might lead to the observed spectra yet the gap between the understanding of the physical processes and their mathematical formulations as source and sink terms in 3g wave models is constantly decreasing the present analysis involving wind wave tank experiments and numerical simulations is still rather exploratory and could be continued to assess the effect of several physical parameters on wind wave growth in more diverse configurations parameters such as the wind direction relative to the swell direction the water depth or the atmospheric stability could be investigated among others 7 extension of the results to real ocean waves a downshift of the wind wave peak frequency was observed in marseilles wind wave tunnel when long paddle waves were added into the wave system villefer et al 2021 to which extent these laboratory observations can be upscaled at coastal scale with swell instead of paddle waves this is not an easy question since the long paddle waves generated in wind wave tunnels have a wave age radically smaller than typical ocean swell in the present paper the method chosen to address the question is based on the use of a 3g spectral wave model the initial hypothesis is that if the numerical model can faithfully reproduce the laboratory experiments i e the frequency downshift and the evolution of a bimodal sea states i e combining wind waves and swell at a coastal scale it can be used to upscale the laboratory experiment to the coastal scale and by decomposing the physical processes at play when wind waves grow the model can help to identify the physical processes responsible for the downshift the first stage of our methodology was to evaluate tomawac performances in reproducing bimodal sea states at laboratory and coastal scales amongst the different parameterizations the combination st4 gqm gives on average the best agreement between simulations and observations overall st4 gqm shows a rather faithful reproduction of the observations both in terms of wave energy and peak frequency variations with fetch nevertheless there are two main limitations of the model at laboratory scale the model largely underestimates the wind wave peak energy in wind only conditions i e without paddle waves at coastal scale in the presence of slanting fetch conditions of the selected event showex campaign the model succeeds only partially in simulating the directional distribution of the wind wave energy yet one interesting feature is the numerical simulation of a downshift similar to the experiments at laboratory scale to a lesser extent though the second stage of our methodology consisted in creating a generic coastal domain to upscale the laboratory experiments at coastal scale the first test case fig 11 reveals a marked wind wave peak frequency downshift increasing with swell intensity according to the simulations the wind wave peak period can be shifted by more than 1 s when a background swell is present this wave period shift would have significant effects on the design of breakwaters or offshore structures for instance in a second test case fig 12 we took advantage of the separation of the physical processes i e q in q ds and q nl to identify the source and sink terms responsible for the spectral downshift the wind input term is the best candidate given the wave generation happening on the low frequency part of the wind wave peak in the presence of swell this wind wave generation at frequencies lower than without swell appears to be due to the continuum of energy brought by the swell peak in the hf range the methodology described in the present study is essentially based on the wave model reliability in modeling the physical processes at play when wind waves grow this validity was evaluated to a large extent by performing comparisons between the numerical model results and wave observations such a verification makes our methodology more consistent but the results must be appreciated in light of the validation stage we performed 8 conclusion the performances of a 3g wave model were assessed for the simulation of bimodal sea state conditions at laboratory and coastal scales three sets of parameterizations for the source and sink terms were tested and compared with the observations at both scales the similarity between the different sets lies in the modeling of the dissipation by whitecapping using a saturation based model the latter choice results from the limitations of komen et al 1984 dissipation model in bimodal sea state conditions highlighted in several references e g ardhuin et al 2007 the st4 gqm combination recently and originally developed in tomawac uses a highly accurate method gqm to compute the nonlinear 4 wave interactions benoit 2005 gagnaire renou et al 2010 within this set gqm is combined with the recent and largely adopted st4 parameterization for the whitecapping dissipation sink term ardhuin et al 2010 compared to the other sets based on the dia method st4 gqm simulations are roughly 50 times longer than the other sets due to the cpu time to compute q nl with gqm overall all the sets of parameterizations showed good performances for the reproduction of the frequency spectra by comparison with the observations at both scales the st4 gqm combination albeit computationally demanding showed two interesting facets at laboratory scale it differentiates from the other sets with a very accurate reproduction of the wind wave peak frequency variations with fetch at coastal scale it is the set showing the best agreement in terms of directional properties by comparison with the observations in addition to these two facets simulations with st4 gqm can be run without imposing any diagnostic hf tail and without using any wave growth limiter lastly the st4 gqm set was used to investigate the relevance of a physical phenomenon observed at laboratory scale within a bimodal sea state combining two wind wave systems at coastal scale within a bimodal sea state combining swell and wind waves to improve the results of the present study it would be necessary to remove the friction velocity forcing adopted for the simulations at laboratory scale recent studies aimed to improve the calculation of the friction velocity by further including the effects of nonlinearity with janssen and bidlot 2021 revision of janssen 1991 source term or with the use of a wave boundary layer model as in du et al 2017 to further improve the directional properties of the simulated spectra romero 2019 proposed an anisotropic parameterization of the dissipation by whitecapping showing promising directional properties the use of 3g spectral wave models at laboratory scale could permit to further validate the different parameterizations for the source and sink terms in idealized conditions lastly the simulations on a generic coastal domain could be continued to investigate wind wave growth with a background swell considering several aspects such as the relative angle between swell and wind direction the presence of a variable depth the directional spread of the swell system etc

23774,wave current interaction phenomena are often represented through coupled model frameworks in ocean modelling however benchmarking of these models is scarce revealing a substantial research challenge we seek to address this through a selection of cases for coupled wave current interaction modelling this comprises a series of analytical and experimental test cases spanning three diverse conditions of wave run up one scenario of waves opposing a current flow and a 2 d arrangement of waves propagating over a submerged bar we simulate these through coupling the spectral wave model simulating waves nearshore swan with the coastal hydrodynamics shallow water equation model thetis using the basic model interface bmi structure by comparing calibrated versus default parameter settings we identify and highlight calibration uncertainties that emerge across a range of potential applications calibrated model results exhibit good correlation against experimental and analytical data alongside benchmarked wave current model predictions where available specifically inter model comparisons show equivalent accuracy finally the coupled model we developed as part of this work showcases its ability to account for wave current effects in a manner extensible to other coupled processes through bmi and applicable to more complex geometries keywords wave current interactions coupled model shallow water equation modelling spectral wave modelling validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wave current interaction phenomena are common in coastal areas where both surface gravity waves and ocean currents become influential to coastal hydrodynamics simultaneously wolf and prandle 1999 in such cases their concurring presence affects each other wave transformation processes generate radiation stress and are influenced by the water depth and the presence of underlying currents radiation stress in turn affects currents and wave setup compounded by bottom friction and vertical mixing dietrich et al 2011 accurate representation of such interactions is motivated by a plethora of applications such as capturing evolution of coastal morphology santos et al 2009 design of offshore and coastal infrastructure brown 2010 or quantifying storm surge effects zhang et al 2021 the need to account for wave current interactions was recognised early longuet higgins and stewart 1962 jonsson et al 1970 peregrine 1976 leading to the development of coupled ocean and spectral wave models the first coupled model configurations as well as some later ones employ a structured mesh either rectilinear xie et al 2001 xia et al 2004 marsooli et al 2017 or curvilinear warner et al 2008 kumar et al 2011 such a configuration could potentially incur high computational costs when multiple scales must be resolved in increasing versatility through multi scale modelling unstructured coupled models followed dietrich et al 2011 roland et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 dobbelaere et al 2022 alternative solutions were also presented that maintained independent discretisation allowing greater flexibility among model components dutour sikirić et al 2013 wave current interaction models are notoriously difficult to validate it is challenging to establish validation data for wave current interactions at regional scales as a fully controlled environment at such scales becomes unattainable hence models are often applied to either idealised cases focusing on an indirect validation by examining other processes of interest like sediment transport warner et al 2008 or more realistic setups on the effect of wave current interactions that contain a large margin of uncertainties dietrich et al 2011 xie et al 2001 especially during extreme events such as hurricane conditions dobbelaere et al 2022 a few studies demonstrated efforts to validate the modelling through analytical or experimental test cases where wave current interactions emerge roland et al 2012 marsooli et al 2017 kumar et al 2011 it is instructive to provide an overview of the models themselves presenting features that motivate this research in the process we include details to highlight the diversity of coupled modelling frameworks we begin with the study of roland et al 2012 on the coupling between the unstructured 3 d hydrodynamic model selfe zhang and baptista 2008 and the phase averaged spectral wave model wind wave model ii wwm ii roland 2008 the former applies a semi implicit time marching scheme while the advection is propagated through an eulerian lagrangian method which ensures model numerical stability the coupling of the two models is inherently integrated by including wwm ii in selfe s source code as a routine with both models written in fortran the coupled framework s ability to account for wave current interactions is evaluated through a series of analytical and experimental setups validating its capacity for a plethora of phenomena were wave current interactions are dominant selfe has expanded into the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2016 preserving its coupling with wwm ii in turn we have the study of marsooli et al 2017 who validated their model through the numerical implementation of a series of experimental setups the coupled framework consists of the 3 d stevens institute of technology estuarine and coastal ocean model secom blumberg and mellor 1987 and the mellor donelan oey mdo mellor et al 2008 spectral wave model where the same arakawa c orthogonal curvilinear grid with terrain following vertical coordinates is employed for both components the wave model simpler than 3rd generation wave models in omitting the solution of the spectral equation in the frequency space mellor et al 2008 solves the wave energy balance equation accounting for current induced refraction alongside the deep and shallow water phenomena it employs the spectrum of donelan et al 1985 which makes the wave wave interaction in the frequency space parametrisation computationally effective however to the best of our knowledge mdo relied on serial computation which in combination with its structured setup could hinder the scalability of any coupled model lastly we refer to the coupled model of xie et al 2001 consisting of the structured 3 d ocean circulation model princeton ocean model pom mellor 1998 and the spectral wave model wam komen et al 1996 in xie et al 2001 the coupled model was immediately applied for the simulation of a practical case the south atlantic bight xie et al 2001 subsequently when xia et al 2004 incorporated into the coupled model an extended formulation of radiation stress in the vertical direction some benchmarking using the analytical solution of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 was reported towards demonstrating the validity of their formulation considering the broad associated literature that apply wave current interaction models we observe that only a minority of wave current coupled models report on validation of wave current phenomena in controlled environments as regulating the various parameters at regional scales becomes a challenging task therefore this work documents our efforts towards a validated coupled model to capture wave current interactions our objective is to do so in an efficient manner while being mindful of a parallelisation and scalability requirements b the continuous development of the individual models and c coupled model extensions to other processes e g atmospheric the latter would render a non intrusive coupling configuration important for future development in this study the spectral wave model simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 is coupled with the shallow water equation model thetis kärnä et al 2018 kärnä 2020 this coupled framework presented in section 2 is the first 2 d model for wave current interactions that uses a collection of validation cases section 3 comprised of analytical and experimental setups while comparing its performance with other coupled models section 4 furthermore an effort is made to outline the calibration rationale for the cases considered and the applications of the coupled framework section 5 finally in maintaining versatility of the coupling framework we refactor model elements to use a minimally intrusive interface in python preserving the processing efficiency of fortran and c code for the iterative solving of swan and thetis respectively 2 methodology 2 1 spectral wave model the spectral wave model swan solves the action density equation to calculate wave characteristics and spectra 1 n t 1 x y c x y n 2 σ θ c σ θ n 3 1 σ s where 2 s s in s ds s nl s bf s brk the action density n expresses the ratio of the energy density e over the relative frequency σ on the lhs term 1 of eq 1 denotes the changes of action density n in time t while term 2 expresses its advection in the geographical domain with propagation speed c x y term 3 represents the shifting of frequencies in the frequency σ domain and the refraction in the wave direction θ domain with propagation speed c σ θ the rhs of eq 1 comprises the sum of the source and sink terms eq 2 which include the wind input s in whitecapping dissipation s ds non linear wave wave interactions s nl bottom friction s bf and depth induced wave breaking s brk effects see booij et al 1999 for details bed friction is considered through the eddy viscosity model of madsen et al 1989 where energy dissipation due to bottom friction is expressed as 3 s bf c b σ 2 g 2 sinh 2 k h e σ θ where c b is a bottom friction coefficient σ is the relative radian frequency k is the wavenumber h is the water depth and e is the energy density spectrum madsen et al 1989 takes into account the bottom roughness height and the actual wave conditions for the calculation of the bottom friction coefficient swan team 2019 for the calculation of the energy dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking swan extends the expression of eldeberky and battjes 1996 to include the spectral directions 4 s brk σ θ α b j q b σ β 2 π e σ θ where s brk is the energy dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking α b j is the rate of energy dissipation q b is the fraction of breaking waves σ is the mean frequency β is the ratio of root mean square wave height h r m s over maximum water height h max in turn the latter adheres to h max γ h where γ is the breaker index expressing the ratio of wave height and still water depth at the location waves start breaking holthuijsen 2010 in non stationary swan simulations a first order semi lagrangian scheme called backward space backward time bsbt is employed for propagating in time and space swan team 2019 here the structured rectilinear formulation of swan is employed either serially or in parallel 2 2 shallow water equation model thetis a 2 d 3 d coastal model kärnä et al 2018 employs the firedrake finite element modelling framework which uses abstraction for the description of the weak formulation of pdes and the generation of automated code rathgeber et al 2016 it considers the non conservative formulation of the shallow water equations eqs 5 6 the model accounts for wetting and drying by utilising the formulation of kärnä et al 2011 introducing a modified bathymetry to ensure positive water depth as defined by eq 7 therefore 5 η t h t h d u 0 6 u t u u g η ν u u t τ b τ rs τ wr ρ h d 7 f h d 1 2 h d 2 α w d 2 h d where η is the water elevation h d h η is the total water depth u is the depth averaged velocity vector ν is the eddy viscosity of the fluid and α w d is a wetting and drying parameter the latter through eq 7 modifies the bathymetry h h f h d with an equivalent treatment for the modified total water depth h d the bed shear stress effects τ b make use of the manning formulation with a friction coefficient n m so that 8 τ b ρ g n m 2 u u h d 1 3 while the effect of the radiation stress caused by waves is described by the term τ rs and the effect of the wave roller by τ wr see section 2 4 for more information the shallow water equations in this study are discretised using the discontinuous galerkin finite element method dg fem the semi implicit crank nicolson scheme imposing an implicitness θ 0 5 time marches the solution in all cases the resulting system of equations is sequentially solved iteratively by newton s method as implemented in petsc balay et al 2019 2 3 basic model interface the coupled model is facilitated by the basic model interface bmi hutton et al 2020 a library of functions provided across several programming languages the functions are categorised as i model control functions to call a component of the model to bypass the mainstream time loop ii model information functions that provide general information about the exchange variables iii variable information functions to supply details about a particular input or output field iv time functions to administer information on the model times v variable getter and setter functions to access and modify the exchange items of the models and vi model grid functions to describe the model spatial discretisation 1 1 see https bmi readthedocs io en latest for more details the two models have been refactored to fit into a bmi template which is constructed in fortran for swan and in python for thetis due to the differing programming languages used by each model swan was converted into a package for invocation in python through utilising the refactored swan source code which is then fitted into the fortran 2003 bmi template by wrapping the latter with a c interoperability layer swan can be compiled and linked in a c library this library can be called from cython an extension language that enables a c library to be called from python as such the cythonised code can be converted into a python package fig 1 2 4 coupling procedure the parallel coupling procedure commences by initialising swan followed by thetis allowing for internal on the fly communication the two models run on an iterative basis marching forward following their own time stepping mechanism with δ t swan for swan and δ t thetis for thetis the time t in fig 2 is the time that the two models are required to reach to exchange the necessary information through bmi and is used to coordinate the serial implementation of the model components as such the coupling time step δ t c o u p l i n g i e the time interval between information exchange is a multiple of both time steps initialisation of thetis and swan launches the coupling procedure which iterates the process until the simulation end time t end swan provides the necessary statistical wave parameters for the calculation of the radiation stress and the wave roller contribution these parameters are the significant wave height h s the wave direction θ m the wavelength λ and the percentage of wave breaking q b in turn thetis provides swan with water elevation η and current u information we adopt the calculation of vertically integrated radiation stress proposed by mellor 2015 9 s i j z e n k i k j k 2 δ i j n 1 2 where s i j z is the vertically integrated radiation stress n is the ratio of the group over the phase velocity k is the wavenumber and δ i j is the kronecker delta function 1 when i j or 0 otherwise the gradient of s i j z describes the radiation stress on currents 10 τ rs s i j z the vertically integrated effect of the roller wave interface is calculated similarly reniers and battjes 1997 svendsen 1984 as 11 r i j 2 e r k i k j k 2 where e r ρ g a r sin ϕ is the energy due to roller wave interface according to duncan 1981 where a r 0 9 h 2 svendsen 1984 the roller area and ϕ the roller angle with tan ϕ 0 1 reniers and battjes 1997 generally accepted martins et al 2018 the gradient of r i j yields the effect of wave rollers on currents 12 τ wr r i j the combined effect of waves on currents is the sum of the gradient of radiation stress and the wave roller effects τ rs τ wr 3 case studies a series of analytical and experimental setups of varying complexity table 1 are employed to validate the model s capability to accurately capture wave current interactions and evaluate performance against other models first we consider the idealised setup for the analytical solution developed by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 where wave setup is validated against an analytical solution next we move to the case of boers 1997 that considers a more realistic bathymetry that leads to wave setup depth induced wave breaking and bed friction losses in turn the case of roelvink and reniers 1995 explores the same effects at a scale that is closer to regional coastal applications we then examine the model s ability in the presence of a strong opposing current adopting the lai et al 1989 experiment finally we consider the 2 d experimental setup dingemans 1987 of a submerged bar subjected to wave action in all cases the mesh generation for thetis employs the open source qmesh avdis et al 2018 package returning an unstructured triangular mesh the mesh employed by swan is a structured orthogonal mesh constructed internally by swan for each case a nested setup is utilised composed of two domains domain d 1 i e the outer domain in which only swan is implemented and d 2 the area of interest where the coupled model is applied fig 3 d 1 provides the top n and bottom s wave boundary conditions for the latter domain in these setups to conserve computational resources stationary conditions are applied in domain d 1 while a stationary swan run of d 2 is executed to spin up the wave conditions before a coupled model is implemented sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the effect of model swan thetis parameters on the results to balance accuracy and computational cost for swan these include the geographical mesh spacing where d x d y timestep δ t swan limits of spectral wave direction θ 1 θ 2 alongside the spectral resolution δ θ standard directional deviation of wave spreading σ θ the equivalent roughness length k n implemented in the bed friction losses formulation of swan the rate of dissipation for depth induced wave breaking α b j followed by the maximum wave height over water depth ratio γ in addition the effects of triad wave wave interactions and whitecapping dissipation were tested in thetis the sensitivity explores effects of mesh element length h timestep δ t thetis eddy viscosity ν wetting and drying α w d and the manning coefficient n m the most salient observations of the sensitivity analyses are discussed in section 5 1 while the calibrated configurations resulting in improved predictions are described here for each of the cases the default setup including initial parameters is summarised in table 3 for each case for swan these follow recommended values of booij et al 2004 apart from the standard directional deviation of wave spreading as wave conditions listed in table 2 are narrow banded similarly thetis default parameters employ typical values for regional coastal scale simulations such as n m 0 03 the model mesh size was determined through a mesh convergence analysis that initiated from coarse configurations to reduce computational cost 3 1 longuet higgins and stewart 1964 case on wave set up on a linearly sloped beach longuet higgins and stewart 1964 provided an analytical solution for wave set up in a gradually varying beach for 1 d steady state situations the momentum balance is 13 d η d x 1 ρ g h d s x x d x in the absence of reflection outside the surf zone we can assume wave energy conservation 14 d e c g d x 0 where s x x is the radiation stress and c g the group velocity in the surf zone the wave height is controlled by h γ h solving eq 13 considering the aforementioned assumptions results in two areas i the outer zone and ii the surf zone the boundary between the two is denoted by coordinate x b in the outer zone i e for x x b the water elevation is described by 15 η a 2 k 2 sinh 2 k h while from the wave energy conservation we have 16 a 2 k 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 a 0 2 k 0 where a is the local wave amplitude k is the wavenumber and the subscript 0 indicates deep water parameters within the surf zone i e for x x b as wave amplitude is proportional to local water depth the water elevation is 17 η 1 1 8 3 γ 2 h b h η b with the subscript b denoting quantities at the boundary between the outer and surf zones as the water elevation at the boundary has to be continuous equating eq 15 with eq 17 and including the dispersion relationship eq 18 18 ω g k tanh k h and the energy conservation eq 14 we determine the location of x b the system of equations has been solved for d x 0 125 m fig 3a red line in comparing our model to the analytical solution we apply a monochromatic wave of amplitude a 0 09 m and period t 1 5 s with normal incident direction to the shore on the nested setup of fig 3a following the modelling study of roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 the bathymetry is constant in the y direction while in the x direction it is flat with still water depth h 0 45 m for x 4 5 m for x 4 5 m the depth decreases linearly to h 0 05 m by a slope of 0 1 the numerical domain starts at x 0 5 m dotted line in fig 4 due to swan s limitation in predicting wave characteristics in very shallow water depths swan mesh spacing is d x d y 0 4 m whereas thetis employs an unstructured mesh with an element length h 0 4 m table 3 in terms of boundary conditions table 2 the wave condition is applied at the right boundary of swan for thetis the calculated water elevation from the analytical solution is also imposed there the left thetis boundary represents the shore and a no slip condition is set whilst a free slip boundary condition is utilised on the remaining boundaries the only physical process taken into account in swan is the depth induced wave breaking with maximum wave height over water depth ratio γ 0 83 following roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 and rate of dissipation α b j 1 5 while we neglect any energy losses due to bottom friction and wind driven waves thetis also disregards bed friction losses following sensitivity swan s timestep is δ t swan 20 s whereas δ t thetis 1 s with a coupling timestep δ t coupling equal to the largest of the two table 3 3 2 boers 1997 case on surf zone with a barred beach boers 1997 examined depth induced wave breaking and wave induced set up under laboratory conditions by use of a flume with length 40 m width 0 8 m and height 1 08 m they recorded the evolution of random unidirectional waves over a bar trough profile the flume s bottom was composed of sand with a smooth concrete layer finish three wave conditions described by their significant wave height h s and their peak period t p were applied a h s 0 16 m and t p 2 1 s b h s 0 22 m and t p 2 1 s and c h s 0 10 m and t p 3 4 s table 2 with normal incident wave direction towards the shore the numerical domain representing the experimental setup consists of the nested setup shown in fig 3b encompassing a subdomain of 45 m in length and 5 m in width in the area of interest d 2 the bathymetry is constant in the y direction and ranges from 0 05 m to 0 80 m in the x direction fig 3b the mesh employed by swan is uniformly structured in both directions with d x d y 0 4 m while the mesh in thetis retains an element length of 0 4 m table 3 the wave boundary condition is applied to the left boundary of swan with direction perpendicular to the shore located at the right e boundary of the domain similarly for thetis the measured water elevation is imposed on the left w boundary while a no slip condition is applied at the shore finally the top n and bottom s boundaries are described by a free slip condition mimicking smooth surfaces typical of lab scale experiments table 2 bed friction losses in swan are accounted for by employing the madsen formulation madsen et al 1989 with roughness length scale k n 0 02 m while no bed friction effects are included in thetis in addition depth induced wave breaking is considered with α b j 1 5 and γ 0 63 whereas no wind forcing is included the implicit nature of swan s propagation scheme allows the employment of a timestep δ t swan 10 s and considering the semi implicitness of thetis numerical scheme a smaller timestep δ t thetis 5 s is considered 3 3 roelvink and reniers 1995 case on wave induced undertow current as part of the eu large installations plan framework lip11d roelvink and reniers 1995 examined the phenomenon of a sandbar formation and migration caused by wave induced undertow current in a large scale flume with length 225 m width 5 m and depth 7 m during the experiment three wave conditions were applied resulting in different beach states we select the first one comprised of narrow banded irregular waves of h s 0 95 m and t p 5 s traversing perpendicular to the shore generating a stable beach to numerically reproduce the experiment the nested domain shown in fig 3c is implemented the bathymetry ranges from h 0 20 m to h 4 10 m specifically in the first 20 m the bathymetry is flat with h 4 10 m followed by a constant 1 20 slope until x 52 m after which the still water depth adheres to a power function h x 0 1 177 x 2 3 up to x 169 m and then following a 1 30 slope for the remaining length the uniform structured mesh in swan has a resolution of 5 0 m while thetis mesh resolution is h 0 5 m nearshore and h 2 5 m at deep water regarding the boundary conditions table 2 the forcing boundary conditions are imposed on the left boundary the wave boundary condition in swan and the known water elevation in thetis similar to the previous two cases bottom friction has been accounted in swan by madsen s k n 0 05 m in addition to the implementation of depth induced wave breaking dissipation with a b j 1 0 and γ 0 73 in thetis only wetting and drying has been included with α w d 2 5 m both models utilise the same timestep δ t swan δ t thetis 3 s which is also the coupling timestep table 3 3 4 lai et al 1989 case on a strong opposing current the blocking of waves breaking or non breaking caused by an opposing current was studied in the experiment of lai et al 1989 in a tank with a 18 3 m long 0 91 m wide and 1 22 m deep test section the waves were generated by the wave maker located at the left w side of the tank while a current was imposed through a pump on the opposite end we focus on a monochromatic wave described by h s 0 01 m and t p 0 57 s travelling from left w to right e while the current s speed starts at 0 13 m s 1 evolving to approximately 0 22 m s 1 over the bar the numerical domain for this setup is presented in fig 3d the domain of interest d 2 has 28 m length 10 m width and the water depth ranges from 0 45 m to 0 75 m the structured mesh utilised in swan is uniform with mesh spacing 0 5 m while the thetis mesh element length varies from h 0 4 m on the top of the bar gradually increasing to h 1 0 m at the forcing boundaries these boundaries entail a current entering the domain on the right e which is assigned a magnitude of 0 13 m s 1 that leaves through the left w of the domain this is imposed in thetis alongside the wave conditions in swan table 2 the effect of depth induced wave breaking and bottom friction are absent along with the negligible contribution of whitecapping dissipation similarly in thetis neither wetting and drying nor bed shear stress are included table 3 3 5 dingemans 1987 2 d setup on waves over a submerged bar the experiment of dingemans 1987 consists of a semi cylindrical submerged bar with bathymetry ranging from 0 10 m to 0 40 m in a flume 30 m long and 26 4 m wide alongside the left side of the flume is a wave generator while on the opposite site a wave absorbing beach was constructed with a 1 7 slope the bathymetry follows a 1 20 slope on the left bank of the bar and 1 10 on the right dingemans 1987 implemented a plethora of wave conditions the focus on this study falls on the case with a jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 described by h s 0 10 m and t p 1 25 s during the experiments the water velocities were recorded through 81 current gauges placed on a 3 m 3 m grid in addition to the water elevations captured by the wave gauges fig 3f the numerical domain utilised here fig 3e follows dingemans 1987 bathymetry but has extended the submerged bar a further 20 m to accurately calculate wave boundary conditions for domain d 2 and to minimise boundary errors swan and thetis meshes employ the same 2 m resolution the former in a uniform structured grid and the latter in terms of mesh element length the known wave boundary condition is applied on the left boundary while we emulate the wave absorbing beach on the right side through a no slip condition table 2 bed friction losses have been accounted in swan per madsen s formulation with k n 0 04 m and in thetis following the manning formulation with n m 0 022 depth induced wave breaking has also been considered with a b j 1 and γ 0 73 while no wind input is implemented swan s implicit scheme allows for a relatively big timestep of 60 s while thetis utilises a much shorter timestep δ t thetis 1 s table 3 4 results a synoptic table table 3 containing the default and calibrated values of the parameters examined in sensitivity analyses across cases is included alongside a table depicting the computational details including simulation convergence and cpu time for each test case table 5 the final configuration is compared against the analytical solution or experimental data its performance assessed through a series of statistical parameters table 6 when available a cross comparison between our model s and other models predictions found in literature is presented through infographics and statistical

been employed by roland et al 2012 dashed green line fig 4 and xia et al 2004 blue dashed line fig 4b to validate their models the former on their coupled model framework and the latter on the

line fig 7b slightly underestimates the measured profile continuous black line fig 7b even though a noticeable difference is seen due to the scale of the y axis specifically i the predicted velocity over the bar is 0 213 m s 1 against the measured 0 217 m s 1 and ii the velocities near the bottom of the bar are marginally smaller i e 0 125 m s 1 against the observed 0 13 m s 1 these inconsistencies induce the small m a e of 0 004 m s 1 and a willmott index d 0 99 table 11 4 5 dingemans 1987 2 d setup on waves over a submerged bar roland et al 2012 black dots fig 8 also made use of the experiment by dingemans 1987 to validate their model performance with regards to the significant wave height h s and the current velocities u v in a 2 d setup their overestimation of the smaller h s for h s 0 10 m results in a much lower r 2 r 2 0 59 compared to r 2 0 89 table 12 for our calibrated setup red circles fig 8a similarly we simulate the v velocity with marginally more precision r 2 0 79 since roland et al 2012 tends to slightly under estimate 0 1 m s 1 v 0 1 m s 1 with r 2 0 74 concerning the other component of current velocities i e u fig 8b the models exhibit similar results in relative accordance to the measurements with r 2 0 81 and r m s e 0 04 m s 1 table 12 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis an exploration of a series of parameters was performed through sensitivity analyses for each case study the initial setup containing the default values is arranged alongside the calibrated model table 3 with the parameter range summarised in table 4 for completeness 5 1 1 temporal and mesh convergence the analysis commenced with the mesh resolution of swan d x and thetis h assuming that the time steps δ t swan δ t thetis 1 s are small enough for the cfl condition to be met ordinarily the coarser resolutions investigated table 4 yield insubstantial differences except when refraction is prominent roelvink and reniers 1995 dingemans 1987 the sensitivity of result accuracy to refraction in non stationary simulations is a known swan issue swan team 2019 here exhibited for smaller d x in the dingemans 1987 cases table 4 there the lipschitz criterion is violated allowing the energy to travel over a number of directional bins swan team 2019 hence the imposition of a courant number limiter is necessary for accurate predictions which is insufficient to resolve non convergence issues for d x 2 5 m in the roelvink and reniers 1995 case this is another known issue of swan booij et al 2004 though the limiter restricts the problem locally lastly in the lai et al 1989 case larger h values result in a poor representation of the bathymetry with the u profile near the bar transforming to a shape resembling the letter λ instead of the anticipated π as resolution decreases fig 7b poor results nearshore with coarser resolution are also exhibited in the large scale experiment of roelvink and reniers 1995 hence in the last two aforementioned cases an unstructured mesh is employed in thetis utilising a finer resolution focused on in the area of interest other resolution variables related to computational cost are the time steps employed by the models δ t swan and δ t thetis considering that the ranges tested exhibited no apparent impact on the results but immensely influenced the cpu and convergence time their selection was made on the basis of limiting convergence duration imposing a limit on the convergence time of 5 min for the quasi 1 d cases longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 lai et al 1989 and 10 min for the dingemans 1987 experiment the time step with the minimum cpu time conforming to this restriction is chosen table 3 resulting in relatively large time steps for swan generally δ t swan 10 s and smaller time steps for thetis δ t thetis 5 s swan s limitations on refraction resulting in non convergence necessitated the change of swan s numerical scheme for refraction to a first order upwind and a small time step δ t swan 3 s in the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment refraction s numerical scheme was also converted to a first order upwind in the dingemans 1987 experiment to decrease convergence time additionally for the model to converge within the specified time frame ν was increased to 1 m 2 s 1 in thetis the timestep and mesh sensitivity analyses led to a reduced cpu time ranging from an acceleration of 2 3 for the idealised case of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 to 45 8 for the 2 d experiment of dingemans 1987 table 13 substantially constraining the computational cost for the subsequent analyses 5 1 2 swan parameters considering the monochromatic or narrow band wave conditions implemented the suggested directional standard deviation σ θ 30 by swan booij et al 2004 was not considered instead smaller σ θ values are investigated table 4 with the majority of cases employing σ θ 3 5 table 3 the relatively high σ θ 5 in the case of lai et al 1989 is chosen to reduce the wave height to provide more precise h predictions downstream of the bar since it has been observed that higher values of the spreading index s or as denoted in swan m correspond to higher values of h venugopal et al 2005 while s is negatively correlated with σ θ holthuijsen 2010 booij et al 2004 on bed friction losses the shallow water depths dominating the boers 1997 experiment require a decreased value from the suggested k n 0 05 m table 3 to avoid overestimating bed friction dissipation this issue does not arise on the large scale roelvink and reniers 1995 and the 2 d experiment dingemans 1987 0 04 m k n 0 05 m most likely due to the bathymetry resembling regional scales no analysis is performed for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 idealised setup as all phenomena except for depth induced wave breaking are neglected similar findings are observed for the parameters describing the depth induced dissipation α b j and γ specifically roelvink and reniers 1995 and dingemans 1987 both employ the default values α b j 1 and γ 0 73 to accurately represent the phenomenon on the other hand a slight adjustment of α b j 1 5 is crucial for the small scale setups longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 due to dissipation under estimation on the breaker index the analytical solution of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 considers γ 0 83 confirmed by the investigation table 4 since smaller γ results in wave breaking shifting towards deeper waters in the boers 1997 experiment γ 0 63 and γ 0 73 return statistically similar predictions with the former γ 0 63 providing a better wave breaking prediction at the beach compared to the latter γ 0 73 fig 5c considering the small wave height h 0 02 m traversing the domain and the relative deep waters h 0 45 m no depth induced wave breaking occurs in the lai et al 1989 experiment verified by the analysis for α b j tables 4 3 lastly in addition to the sensitivity summarised in table 3 an investigation on the high frequency cut off limit f m a x was performed specifically for the lai et al 1989 case f m a x together with the low frequency cut off f m i n define the spectrum s prognostic range f m i n f f m a x where energy density develops unrestricted and the diagnostic range f f m i n and f f m a x where the wave wave interactions at high frequencies and integral wave parameters are calculated holthuijsen 2010 the default f m a x 1 hz suggested for conditions at sea does not capture accurately wave blocking a range of f m a x 1 2 hz was examined with higher f m a x generating smaller h downstream the bar however for f m a x 1 8 hz the model does not accurately capture h on the left side where the wave condition is imposed fig 7a most likely due to excluding significant frequencies from the diagnostic spectrum range hence f m a x 1 8 hz was employed to accurately account for wave blocking conditions 5 1 3 thetis parameters moving on to the remaining thetis parameters apparent is the effect of eddy viscosity ν on the cases where current measurements are provided lai et al 1989 dingemans 1987 considering how a constant eddy viscosity turbulence modelling approach is imposed for simplicity higher values of ν are accompanied by a decline in current magnitude due to the smoothing effect of the viscosity term consistently smaller ν was encouraged to accurately predict wave current interactions table 3 however depending on the domain and the bathymetry smaller ν could lead to convergence complications as exhibited in the test case of boers 1997 where for ν 0 25 m 2 s 1 the model failed to converge while for the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment this was observed for ν 1 m 2 s 1 table 4 on the cases where only wave height and water elevation are examined longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 apart from a decrease on convergence time as ν increases the results remained constant thus while low values of ν are recommended in low turbulence regions to minimise turbulent diffusion in current predictions there is a constraint associated with convergence finally to eliminate any spurious oscillations at boundaries resulting in our model diverging a viscosity sponge is imposed in the numerical setup of roelvink and reniers 1995 the wetting and drying parameter α w d modifies the bathymetry by shifting it downwards the larger the α w d the bigger the depth increase hence considering the under estimation of currents already present in the dingemans 1987 case and the slight underestimation of u in the lai et al 1989 experiment no wetting and drying is considered α w d 0 tables 3 4 lest the velocities decrease further in the remaining cases α w d is proportional to the bathymetric range of each domain with α w d 0 1 m for the small setup of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 h 0 45 m and α w d 0 5 m for the boers 1997 experiment h 0 80 m a distinctively high value of 2 5 m considered in the undertow current case roelvink and reniers 1995 is a result of the sensitivity analysis table 4 the undertow current formulated by the waves and the bathymetry varies in depth the top part travels shorewards and the bottom seawards a behaviour not captured by a depth averaged model hence by considerably deepening the waters a greater depth averaged current is recovered that can represent the higher flow velocity near the surface interacting with the waves the manning coefficient n m has virtually no effect on the results due to the small velocities with magnitude 0 004 m s 1 for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 booij et al 1999 and roelvink and reniers 1995 case and u 0 217 m s 1 for the lai et al 1989 setup in the quasi 1 d setups table 1 its influence is only significant in the 2 d case dingemans 1987 where bed shear stress τ b are generated in the submerged bar area affecting the velocities fig 8b c the formation of τ b is facilitated by shallow waters and the decrease of η due to radiation stress hence a decrease of n m table 3 provides more accurate velocities on the bar as the dissipation due to bottom friction is not being over estimated an influence on the results of lai et al 1989 was also expected but for n m 0 06 table 4 the results were identical with negligible difference for n m 0 060 this behaviour is attributed to the small velocities in conjunction with the deep water conditions relative to the wave height 5 2 model cross comparison observations 5 2 1 on the numerical implementation and computational cost computational cost is a critical aspect of numerical models with cpu times under 5 min for the smaller setups and approximately 8 min for the large scale experiment of roelvink and reniers 1995 table 5 our model has promising computational efficiency while linking both wave and current models the coupled model competency is also demonstrated through its rapid convergence in its results this is under 4 min for the quasi 1 d cases longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 lai et al 1989 and nearly 10 min for the sole 2 d setup dingemans 1987 equivalent information in the literature is scarce withn roland et al 2012 documenting some convergence times but abstaining from any cpu times while the other coupled models xia et al 2004 marsooli et al 2017 do not expand on computational details omitting in some cases the simulation times table 7 based on convergence rates our model converges faster than roland et al 2012 the ratio ranging from 1 4 for the dingemans 1987 experiment to 18 for the idealised setup longuet higgins and stewart 1964 respectively thetis semi implicit numerical scheme alongside swan s implicit allow the employment of sufficiently large time steps with swan utilising δ t swan 3 60 s and thetis δ t thetis 1 5 s resulting in coupling time step δ t c o u p l i n g ranging from 3 to 60 s table 3 the latter is at least 120 larger dingemans 1987 experiment and utmost 1 0 4 larger xia et al 2004 for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 setup than the coupling time steps employed by the models we use for comparison table 7 though more iterations may be required by our model constituents to advance in time furthermore the schemes applied in the coupled model support coarser meshes with the same level of accuracy in the results with swan structured mesh resolution being 3 2 to 25 coarser than the mesh applied in the other coupled models tables 3 7 the unstructured nature of thetis mesh permits resolution refinement only in the area of interest without needlessly increasing the computational cost such as in the roelvink and reniers 1995 setup where h 0 5 m was employed nearshore with h 2 5 m near the deep waters table 3 compared to the constant 1 m resolution of marsooli et al 2017 table 7 therefore the combination of larger timesteps coarser mesh resolution and local refinement could culminate in a substantial reduction of computational resources compared to the existing coupled models 5 2 2 on the depth induced wave breaking and wave setup on depth induced wave breaking investigation at small scales longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 our water elevation prediction η is more accurate than roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 where data is available in the idealised setup longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this is attributed to their models applying η 0 m as boundary condition instead of the calculated one in the ocean model fig 4b leading to r 2 0 90 against r 2 0 99 for our calibrated setup table 8 on the experimental study of boers 1997 superior performance against roland et al 2012 r 2 0 76 opposed to 0 91 r 2 0 64 table 9 lies in the overestimation of η nearshore from the latter fig 5b d f most likely as a consequence of the different formulations employed for the calculation of radiation stress roland et al 2012 implement a simplified formulation of longuet higgins and stewart 1962 without accounting for any other wave induced effect while we introduce wave roller effects alongside the formulation of mellor 2015 although statistically the cross model performance for h is comparable in the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 setup table 8 we do not capture the sharp peak of wave breaking fig 4a presumably due to swan s inability to represent such sharp crests to avoid introducing instabilities another reason could lie in the coupled model framework which assumes parallel computations by default even when the coupled model is run on a single core swan assumes that it runs in parallel with one core disabling some of its functionality supported solely in serial booij et al 2004 one such command is the inclusion of wave setup such differences are not observed in the boers 1997 experiment with both roland et al 2012 and swan thetis exhibiting similar h s profiles and statistical parameters fig 5a c e table 9 attributed to both models employing the jonswap spectrum the difference in spectrum could explain the superior performance of marsooli et al 2017 in wave condition c fig 5e with r 2 0 87 table 9 capturing the peaks representing wave breaking since they utilised the donelan et al 1985 spectrum the distinct features among models notably between swan thetis and roland et al 2012 become apparent in the adjustments utilised to accurately capture depth induced wave breaking dissipation roland et al 2012 adjusted their depth induced wave breaking parameters by decreasing α b j from 1 0 to 0 5 and increasing γ to 0 8 from 0 73 to refrain from over dissipation in comparison we increased the rate of dissipation α b j to 1 5 and decreased the breaker index to 0 63 table 3 this disparity is attributed to the different numerical schemes employed by the models 5 2 3 on the large scale experiment progressing on the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment even though the models have almost identical h s profiles fig 6a and similar statistics for η table 10 their η predictions are quite distinct pertaining to the wave induced undertow current leading to sandbar formation the 3 d nature of marsooli et al 2017 recognises the early influence of waves on currents x 60 m thus exhibiting more precision in the intermediate waters while nearshore they are under predicting the gradient of η fig 6b the improved performance of our model emanates from the distinctively high value of the wetting and drying parameter α w d 2 5 m to accurately capture the 3 d nature of undertow current with depth averaged velocities thus a tremendous adjustment of the bathymetry is fundamental for our satisfying performance easily corroborated by the η profile of our default setup see swan thetis def fig 6b 5 2 4 on the strong opposing current having verified the effects of waves on currents we investigate our ability to capture the effects of currents on waves through the experiment of lai et al 1989 though the case has also been utilised by another coupled model roland et al 2012 only energy spectra for the wave gauges location fig 3d have been provided which were converted to wave height following e 1 16 ρ g h 2 for easier comparison with the other model results due to observation scarcity it is ambiguous if the waves break reflect as a result of the bar or are weakened by the current hence our uniqueness in not predicting an increased h near the bar s top does not indicate an error specifically ris and holthuijsen 1996 who although not employing a coupled model exploited this experiment to validate swan s whitecapping formulation dashed blue line fig 7a do comment on the peculiarity of the elevated h in that location since they expected a reduction of h 5 2 5 on the 2 d configuration we conclude with the 2 d experiment dingemans 1987 where the calibrated setup achieves 1 54 more accurate h s predictions than roland et al 2012 with r 2 0 92 opposed to r 2 0 59 respectively table 12 though our model favours smaller h s compared to dingemans 1987 the differences are small ranging from 11 25 to 14 73 with mean at 2 12 and s d error 5 65 in contrast roland et al 2012 over estimates extensively h s 0 1 m values which are located on the top and at the right of the bar with differences δ h s h s o b s 3 74 44 44 with 10 63 mean and 12 44 s d error hence our model appraises the depth induced wave breaking dissipation and refraction more appropriately than roland et al 2012 on currents predictions we accurately capture the flow pattern with some discrepancies on the magnitude though both models exhibit comparable current predictions by over estimating the smaller velocities and under estimating the higher ones fig 8b c these differences are slightly amplified in our model the current travels faster on the top of the bar as a consequence of the elevated bathymetry and the decreased water level courtesy of radiation stress while the smaller velocities occur on the north side of the bar 17 5 m x 25 m 10 m y 20 m fig 3f the culpability lies with the imprecise calculation of bed shear stress it is virtually zero except at the bar location by implementing a varying manning coefficient field these predictions could be improved as a smaller n m value assigned to the elevated bottom would consider the effects of waves on currents curtailing the bed shear stress miscount 5 3 limitations extensions and prospective applications considering the coupled framework s structure some limitations are inherent by the model constituents such as swan s inability to calculate wave characteristics for very shallow water depths and to resolve refraction in non stationary or large applications others stem from the use of thetis in its 2 d form where depth averaged velocities are unable to capture 3 d phenomena such as an undertow current furthermore the implementation of recommended i e default parameters could potentially lead to erroneous predictions as showcased by section 5 1 hence calibration on both models is required despite these constraints the coupled model presents several advantages the minimal modification required for the coupling at source code level maintains the models flexibility by supporting the further independent development of thetis and swan these improvements can be easily and almost effortlessly included in the coupled framework in addition the implementation of bmi facilitates the interoperability of either the coupled framework or the model components on their own with other models employing bmi hence we align with the goal set by the community surface dynamics modeling system csdms to promote a flexible inter operable and continually developing research software ecosystem tucker et al 2021 although not explicitly presented here parallel implementation of the model is supported reducing significantly the cpu time lastly the combination of the numerical schemes employed by the model combined with the 2 d nature of thetis promote computational efficiency while maintaining the same levels of accuracy presented in 3 d wave current interactions coupled models hence our coupled framework presents opportunities to support optimisation studies clare et al 2022 which include iterative simulations adjoint modelling or data assimilation techniques warder et al 2022 funke et al 2014 this work paves the way to practical applications regional scales a practical example within the coastal ocean domain relates to marine energy such as at the orkney shetland archipelagos where both wave and tidal sites have already been leased johnson et al 2012 earlier efforts have demonstrated the simulation and optimisation of tidal energy systems jordan et al 2022 pennock et al 2022 in the region but considering the highly energetic wave conditions the optimisation approaches that embed broader metocean conditions would be invaluable 6 conclusions a coupling between swan and thetis models to account for wave current interactions occurring by the co existence of wave and current flows has been developed swan is a 3rd generation spectral wave model booij et al 1999 while the 2 d configuration of the shallow water equation model thetis is utilised kärnä 2020 a python interface implemented through basic model interface hutton et al 2020 facilitates the coupling with minimal intrusion in the refactored source code the different grids and time steps employed by the model components allow greater flexibility the two models run consecutively and communicate internally to exchange the necessary parameters these are the significant wave height mean wave direction mean wavelength and percentage of wave breaking calculated by swan necessary for calculating radiation stress and wave roller effects while thetis provides water elevation and current velocity fields a suite of benchmarking cases for wave current interaction models consisting of analytical and experimental scenarios in quasi 1 d and 2 d configurations has been established their implementation by the coupled swan thetis framework successfully demonstrates its ability to represent wave current phenomena specifically its capability to account for depth induced wave breaking wave setup the effects of strong opposing currents in 1 d and 2 d configurations has been investigated through a systematic analysis calibration discrepancies between the recommended values are acknowledged and explained highlighting the necessity of calibration when wave current interactions are prominent some of the parameters showcasing such differences are the friction coefficient employed by either model the depth induced wave breaking parameters as well as thetis eddy viscosity our agreement with the data is strong for the calibrated setups and often on the same level of accuracy as other 3 d wave current interaction models this also entails less computational cost as our model converges faster and requires less cpu time compared to other

23774,wave current interaction phenomena are often represented through coupled model frameworks in ocean modelling however benchmarking of these models is scarce revealing a substantial research challenge we seek to address this through a selection of cases for coupled wave current interaction modelling this comprises a series of analytical and experimental test cases spanning three diverse conditions of wave run up one scenario of waves opposing a current flow and a 2 d arrangement of waves propagating over a submerged bar we simulate these through coupling the spectral wave model simulating waves nearshore swan with the coastal hydrodynamics shallow water equation model thetis using the basic model interface bmi structure by comparing calibrated versus default parameter settings we identify and highlight calibration uncertainties that emerge across a range of potential applications calibrated model results exhibit good correlation against experimental and analytical data alongside benchmarked wave current model predictions where available specifically inter model comparisons show equivalent accuracy finally the coupled model we developed as part of this work showcases its ability to account for wave current effects in a manner extensible to other coupled processes through bmi and applicable to more complex geometries keywords wave current interactions coupled model shallow water equation modelling spectral wave modelling validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wave current interaction phenomena are common in coastal areas where both surface gravity waves and ocean currents become influential to coastal hydrodynamics simultaneously wolf and prandle 1999 in such cases their concurring presence affects each other wave transformation processes generate radiation stress and are influenced by the water depth and the presence of underlying currents radiation stress in turn affects currents and wave setup compounded by bottom friction and vertical mixing dietrich et al 2011 accurate representation of such interactions is motivated by a plethora of applications such as capturing evolution of coastal morphology santos et al 2009 design of offshore and coastal infrastructure brown 2010 or quantifying storm surge effects zhang et al 2021 the need to account for wave current interactions was recognised early longuet higgins and stewart 1962 jonsson et al 1970 peregrine 1976 leading to the development of coupled ocean and spectral wave models the first coupled model configurations as well as some later ones employ a structured mesh either rectilinear xie et al 2001 xia et al 2004 marsooli et al 2017 or curvilinear warner et al 2008 kumar et al 2011 such a configuration could potentially incur high computational costs when multiple scales must be resolved in increasing versatility through multi scale modelling unstructured coupled models followed dietrich et al 2011 roland et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 dobbelaere et al 2022 alternative solutions were also presented that maintained independent discretisation allowing greater flexibility among model components dutour sikirić et al 2013 wave current interaction models are notoriously difficult to validate it is challenging to establish validation data for wave current interactions at regional scales as a fully controlled environment at such scales becomes unattainable hence models are often applied to either idealised cases focusing on an indirect validation by examining other processes of interest like sediment transport warner et al 2008 or more realistic setups on the effect of wave current interactions that contain a large margin of uncertainties dietrich et al 2011 xie et al 2001 especially during extreme events such as hurricane conditions dobbelaere et al 2022 a few studies demonstrated efforts to validate the modelling through analytical or experimental test cases where wave current interactions emerge roland et al 2012 marsooli et al 2017 kumar et al 2011 it is instructive to provide an overview of the models themselves presenting features that motivate this research in the process we include details to highlight the diversity of coupled modelling frameworks we begin with the study of roland et al 2012 on the coupling between the unstructured 3 d hydrodynamic model selfe zhang and baptista 2008 and the phase averaged spectral wave model wind wave model ii wwm ii roland 2008 the former applies a semi implicit time marching scheme while the advection is propagated through an eulerian lagrangian method which ensures model numerical stability the coupling of the two models is inherently integrated by including wwm ii in selfe s source code as a routine with both models written in fortran the coupled framework s ability to account for wave current interactions is evaluated through a series of analytical and experimental setups validating its capacity for a plethora of phenomena were wave current interactions are dominant selfe has expanded into the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2016 preserving its coupling with wwm ii in turn we have the study of marsooli et al 2017 who validated their model through the numerical implementation of a series of experimental setups the coupled framework consists of the 3 d stevens institute of technology estuarine and coastal ocean model secom blumberg and mellor 1987 and the mellor donelan oey mdo mellor et al 2008 spectral wave model where the same arakawa c orthogonal curvilinear grid with terrain following vertical coordinates is employed for both components the wave model simpler than 3rd generation wave models in omitting the solution of the spectral equation in the frequency space mellor et al 2008 solves the wave energy balance equation accounting for current induced refraction alongside the deep and shallow water phenomena it employs the spectrum of donelan et al 1985 which makes the wave wave interaction in the frequency space parametrisation computationally effective however to the best of our knowledge mdo relied on serial computation which in combination with its structured setup could hinder the scalability of any coupled model lastly we refer to the coupled model of xie et al 2001 consisting of the structured 3 d ocean circulation model princeton ocean model pom mellor 1998 and the spectral wave model wam komen et al 1996 in xie et al 2001 the coupled model was immediately applied for the simulation of a practical case the south atlantic bight xie et al 2001 subsequently when xia et al 2004 incorporated into the coupled model an extended formulation of radiation stress in the vertical direction some benchmarking using the analytical solution of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 was reported towards demonstrating the validity of their formulation considering the broad associated literature that apply wave current interaction models we observe that only a minority of wave current coupled models report on validation of wave current phenomena in controlled environments as regulating the various parameters at regional scales becomes a challenging task therefore this work documents our efforts towards a validated coupled model to capture wave current interactions our objective is to do so in an efficient manner while being mindful of a parallelisation and scalability requirements b the continuous development of the individual models and c coupled model extensions to other processes e g atmospheric the latter would render a non intrusive coupling configuration important for future development in this study the spectral wave model simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 is coupled with the shallow water equation model thetis kärnä et al 2018 kärnä 2020 this coupled framework presented in section 2 is the first 2 d model for wave current interactions that uses a collection of validation cases section 3 comprised of analytical and experimental setups while comparing its performance with other coupled models section 4 furthermore an effort is made to outline the calibration rationale for the cases considered and the applications of the coupled framework section 5 finally in maintaining versatility of the coupling framework we refactor model elements to use a minimally intrusive interface in python preserving the processing efficiency of fortran and c code for the iterative solving of swan and thetis respectively 2 methodology 2 1 spectral wave model

mean square wave height h r m s over maximum water height h max in turn the latter adheres to h max γ h where γ is the breaker index expressing the ratio of wave height and still water depth at the location waves start breaking holthuijsen 2010 in non stationary swan simulations a first order semi lagrangian scheme called backward space backward time bsbt is employed for propagating in time and space swan team 2019 here the structured rectilinear formulation of swan is employed either serially or in parallel 2 2 shallow water equation model thetis a 2 d 3 d coastal model kärnä et al 2018 employs the firedrake finite element modelling framework which uses abstraction for the description of the weak formulation of pdes and the generation of automated code rathgeber et al 2016 it considers the non conservative formulation of the shallow water equations eqs 5 6 the model accounts for wetting and drying by utilising the formulation of kärnä et al 2011 introducing a modified bathymetry to ensure positive water depth as defined by eq 7 therefore 5 η t h t h d u 0 6 u t u u g η ν u u t τ b τ rs τ wr ρ h d 7 f h d 1 2 h d 2 α w d 2 h d where η is the water elevation h d h η

equations in this study are discretised using the discontinuous galerkin finite element method dg fem the semi implicit crank nicolson scheme imposing an implicitness θ 0 5 time marches the solution in all cases the resulting system of equations is sequentially solved iteratively by newton s method as implemented in petsc balay et al 2019 2 3 basic model interface the coupled model is facilitated by the basic model interface bmi hutton et al 2020 a library of functions provided across several programming languages the functions are categorised as i model control functions to call a component of the model to bypass the mainstream time loop ii model information functions that provide general information about the exchange variables iii variable information functions to supply details about a particular input or output field iv time functions to administer information on the model times v variable getter and setter functions to access and modify the exchange items of the models and vi model grid functions to describe the model spatial discretisation 1 1 see https bmi readthedocs io en latest for more details the two models have been refactored to fit into a bmi template which is constructed in fortran for swan and in python for thetis due to the differing programming languages used by each model swan was converted into a package for invocation in python through utilising the refactored swan source code which is then fitted into the fortran 2003 bmi template by wrapping the latter with a c interoperability layer swan can be compiled and linked in a c library this library can be called from cython an extension language that enables a c library to be called from python as such the cythonised code can be converted into a python package fig 1 2 4 coupling procedure the parallel coupling procedure commences by initialising swan followed by thetis allowing for internal on the fly communication the two models run on an iterative basis marching forward following their own time stepping mechanism with δ t swan for swan and δ t thetis for thetis the time t in fig 2 is the time that the two models are required to reach to exchange the necessary information through bmi and is used to coordinate the serial implementation of the model components as such the coupling time step δ t c o u p l i n g i e the time interval between information exchange is a multiple of both time steps initialisation of thetis and swan launches the coupling procedure which iterates the process until the simulation end time t end swan provides the necessary statistical wave parameters for the calculation of the radiation stress and the wave roller contribution these parameters are the significant wave height h s the wave direction θ m the wavelength λ and the percentage of wave breaking q b in turn thetis provides swan with water elevation η and current u information we adopt the calculation of vertically integrated radiation stress proposed by mellor 2015 9 s i j z e n k i k j k 2 δ i j n 1 2 where s i j z is the vertically integrated radiation stress n is the ratio of the group over the phase velocity k is the wavenumber and δ i j is the kronecker delta function 1 when i j or 0 otherwise the gradient of s i j z describes the radiation stress on currents 10 τ rs s i j z the vertically integrated effect of the roller wave interface is calculated similarly reniers and battjes 1997 svendsen 1984 as 11 r i j 2 e r k i k j k 2 where e r ρ g a r sin ϕ is the energy due to roller wave interface according to duncan 1981 where a r 0 9 h 2 svendsen 1984 the roller area and

of waves on currents is the sum of the gradient of radiation stress and the wave roller effects τ rs τ wr 3 case studies a series of analytical and experimental setups of varying complexity table 1 are employed to validate the model s capability to accurately capture wave current interactions and evaluate performance against other models first we consider the idealised setup for the analytical solution developed by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 where wave setup is validated against an analytical solution next we move to the case of boers 1997 that considers a more realistic bathymetry that leads to wave setup depth induced wave breaking and bed friction losses in turn the case of roelvink and reniers 1995 explores the same effects at a scale that is closer to regional coastal applications we then examine the model s ability in the presence of a strong opposing current adopting the lai et al 1989 experiment finally we consider the 2 d experimental setup dingemans 1987 of a submerged bar subjected to wave action in all cases the mesh generation for thetis employs the open source qmesh avdis et al 2018 package returning an unstructured triangular mesh the mesh employed by swan is a structured orthogonal mesh constructed internally by swan for each case a nested setup is utilised composed of two domains domain d 1 i e the outer domain in which only swan is implemented and d 2 the area of interest where the coupled model is applied fig 3 d 1 provides the top n and bottom s wave boundary conditions for the latter domain in these setups to conserve computational resources stationary conditions are applied in domain d 1 while a stationary swan run of d 2 is executed to spin up the wave conditions before a coupled model is implemented sensitivity analyses are performed to examine the effect of model swan thetis parameters on the results to balance accuracy and computational cost for swan these include the geographical mesh spacing where d x d y timestep δ t swan limits of spectral wave direction θ 1 θ 2 alongside the spectral resolution δ θ standard directional deviation of wave spreading σ θ the equivalent roughness length k n implemented in the bed friction losses formulation of swan the rate of dissipation for depth induced wave breaking α b j followed by the maximum wave height over water depth ratio γ in addition the effects of triad wave wave interactions and whitecapping dissipation were tested in thetis the sensitivity explores effects of mesh element length h timestep δ t thetis eddy viscosity ν wetting and drying α w d and the manning coefficient n m the most salient observations of the sensitivity analyses are discussed in section 5 1 while the calibrated configurations resulting in improved predictions are described here for each of the cases the default setup including initial parameters is summarised in table 3 for each case for swan these follow recommended values of booij et al 2004 apart from the standard directional deviation of wave spreading as wave conditions listed in table 2 are narrow banded similarly thetis default parameters employ typical values for regional coastal scale simulations such as n m 0 03 the model mesh size was determined through a mesh convergence analysis that initiated from coarse configurations to reduce computational cost 3 1 longuet higgins and stewart 1964 case on wave set up on a linearly sloped beach longuet higgins and stewart 1964 provided an analytical solution for wave set up in a gradually varying beach for 1 d steady state situations the momentum balance is 13 d η d x 1 ρ g h d s x x d x in the absence of reflection outside the surf zone we can assume wave energy conservation 14 d e c g d x 0 where s x x is the radiation stress and c g the group velocity in the surf zone the wave height is controlled by h γ h solving eq 13 considering the aforementioned assumptions results in two areas i the outer zone and ii the surf zone the boundary between the two is denoted by coordinate x b in the outer zone i e for x x b the water elevation is described by 15 η a 2 k 2 sinh 2 k h while from the wave energy conservation we have 16 a 2 k 2 k h sinh 2 k h 1 a 0 2 k 0 where a is the local wave amplitude k is the wavenumber and the subscript 0 indicates deep water parameters within the surf zone i e for x x b as wave amplitude is proportional to local water depth the water elevation is 17 η 1 1 8 3 γ 2 h b h η b with the subscript b denoting quantities at the boundary between the outer and surf zones as the water elevation at the boundary has to be continuous equating eq 15 with eq 17 and including the dispersion relationship eq 18 18 ω g k tanh k h and the energy conservation eq 14 we determine the location of x b the system of equations has been solved for d x 0 125 m fig 3a red line in comparing our model to the analytical solution we apply a monochromatic wave of amplitude a 0 09 m and period t 1 5 s with normal incident direction to the shore on the nested setup of fig 3a following the modelling study of roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 the bathymetry is constant in the y direction while in the x direction it is flat with still water depth h 0 45 m for x 4 5 m for x 4 5 m the depth decreases linearly to h 0 05 m by a slope of 0 1 the numerical domain starts at x 0 5 m dotted line in fig 4 due to swan s limitation in predicting wave characteristics in very shallow water depths swan mesh spacing is d x d y 0 4 m whereas thetis employs an unstructured mesh with an element length h 0 4 m table 3 in terms of boundary conditions table 2 the wave condition is applied at the right boundary of swan for thetis the calculated water elevation from the analytical solution is also imposed there the left thetis boundary represents the shore and a no slip condition is set whilst a free slip boundary condition is utilised on the remaining boundaries the only physical process taken into account in swan is the depth induced wave breaking with maximum wave height over water depth ratio γ 0 83 following roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 and rate of dissipation α b j 1 5 while we neglect any energy losses due to bottom friction and wind driven waves thetis also disregards bed friction losses following sensitivity swan s timestep is δ t swan 20 s whereas δ t thetis 1 s with a coupling timestep δ t coupling equal to the largest of the two table 3 3 2 boers 1997 case on surf zone with a barred beach boers 1997 examined depth induced wave breaking and wave induced set up under laboratory conditions by use of a flume with length 40 m width 0 8 m and height 1 08 m they recorded the evolution of random unidirectional waves over a bar trough profile the flume s bottom was composed of sand with a smooth concrete layer finish three wave conditions described by their significant wave height h s and their peak period t p were applied a h s 0 16 m and t p 2 1 s b h s 0 22 m and t p 2 1 s and c h s 0 10 m and t p 3 4 s table 2 with normal incident wave direction towards the shore the numerical domain representing the experimental setup consists of the nested setup shown in fig 3b encompassing a subdomain of 45 m in length and 5 m in width in the area of interest d 2 the bathymetry is constant in the y direction and ranges from 0 05 m to 0 80 m in the x direction fig 3b the mesh employed by swan is uniformly structured in both directions with d x d y 0 4 m while the mesh in thetis retains an element length of 0 4 m table 3 the wave boundary condition is applied to the left boundary of swan with direction perpendicular to the shore located at the right e boundary of the domain similarly for thetis the measured water elevation is imposed on the left w boundary while a no slip condition is applied at the shore finally the top n and bottom s boundaries are described by a free slip condition mimicking smooth surfaces typical of lab scale experiments table 2 bed friction losses in swan are accounted for by employing the madsen formulation madsen et al 1989 with roughness length scale k n 0 02 m while no bed friction effects are included in thetis in addition depth induced wave breaking is considered with α b j 1 5 and γ 0 63 whereas no wind forcing is included the implicit nature of swan s propagation scheme allows the employment of a timestep δ t swan 10 s and considering the semi implicitness of thetis numerical scheme a smaller timestep δ t thetis 5 s is considered 3 3 roelvink and reniers 1995 case on wave induced undertow current as part of the eu large installations plan framework lip11d roelvink and reniers 1995 examined the phenomenon of a sandbar formation and migration caused by wave induced undertow current in a large scale flume with length 225 m width 5 m and depth 7 m during the experiment three wave conditions were applied resulting in different beach states we select the first one comprised of narrow banded irregular waves of h s 0 95 m and t p 5 s traversing perpendicular to the shore generating a stable beach to numerically reproduce the experiment the nested domain shown in fig 3c is implemented the bathymetry ranges from h 0 20 m to h 4 10 m specifically in the first 20 m the bathymetry is flat with h 4 10 m followed by a constant 1 20 slope until x 52 m after which the still water depth adheres to a power function h x 0 1 177 x 2 3 up to x 169 m and then following a 1 30 slope for the remaining length the uniform structured mesh in swan has a resolution of 5 0 m while thetis mesh resolution is h 0 5 m nearshore and h 2 5 m at deep water regarding the boundary conditions table 2 the forcing boundary conditions are imposed on the left boundary the wave boundary condition in swan and the known water elevation in thetis similar to the previous two cases bottom friction has been accounted in swan by madsen s k n 0 05 m in addition to the implementation of depth induced wave breaking dissipation with a b j 1 0 and γ 0 73 in thetis only wetting and drying has been included with α w d 2 5 m both models utilise the same timestep δ t swan δ t thetis 3 s which is also the coupling timestep table 3 3 4 lai et al 1989 case on a strong opposing current the blocking of waves breaking or non breaking caused by an opposing current was studied in the experiment of lai et al 1989 in a tank with a 18 3 m long 0 91 m wide and 1 22 m deep test section the waves were generated by the wave maker located at the left w side of the tank while a current was imposed through a pump on the opposite end we focus on a monochromatic wave described by h s 0 01 m and t p 0 57 s travelling from left w to right e while the current s speed starts at 0 13 m s 1 evolving to approximately 0 22 m s 1 over the bar the numerical domain for this setup is presented in fig 3d the domain of interest d 2 has 28 m length 10 m width and the water depth ranges from 0 45 m to 0 75 m the structured mesh utilised in swan is uniform with mesh spacing 0 5 m while the thetis mesh element length varies from h 0 4 m on the top of the bar gradually increasing to h 1 0 m at the forcing boundaries these boundaries entail a current entering the domain on the right e which is assigned a magnitude of 0 13 m s 1 that leaves through the left w of the domain this is imposed in thetis alongside the wave conditions in swan table 2 the effect of depth induced wave breaking and bottom friction are absent along with the negligible contribution of whitecapping dissipation similarly in thetis neither wetting and drying nor bed shear stress are included table 3 3 5 dingemans 1987 2 d setup on waves over a submerged bar the experiment of dingemans 1987 consists of a semi cylindrical submerged bar with bathymetry ranging from 0 10 m to 0 40 m in a flume 30 m long and 26 4 m wide alongside the left side of the flume is a wave generator while on the opposite site a wave absorbing beach was constructed with a 1 7 slope the bathymetry follows a 1 20 slope on the left bank of the bar and 1 10 on the right dingemans 1987 implemented a plethora of wave conditions the focus on this study falls on the case with a jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 described by h s 0 10 m and t p 1 25 s during the experiments the water velocities were recorded through 81 current gauges placed on a 3 m 3 m grid in addition to the water elevations captured by the wave gauges fig 3f the numerical domain utilised here fig 3e follows dingemans 1987 bathymetry but has extended the submerged bar a further 20 m to accurately calculate wave boundary conditions for domain d 2 and to minimise boundary errors swan and thetis meshes employ the same 2 m resolution the former in a uniform structured grid and the latter in terms of mesh element length the known wave boundary condition is applied on the left boundary while we emulate the wave absorbing beach on the right side through a no slip condition table 2 bed friction losses have been accounted in swan per madsen s formulation with k n 0 04 m and in thetis following the manning formulation with n m 0 022 depth induced wave breaking has also been considered with a b j 1 and γ 0 73 while no wind input is implemented swan s implicit scheme allows for a relatively big timestep of 60 s while thetis utilises a much shorter timestep δ t thetis 1 s table 3 4 results a synoptic table table 3 containing the default and calibrated values of the parameters examined in sensitivity analyses across cases is included alongside a table depicting the computational details including simulation convergence and cpu time for each test case table 5 the final configuration is compared against the analytical solution or experimental data its performance assessed through a series of statistical parameters table 6 when available a cross comparison between our model s and other models predictions found in literature is presented through infographics and statistical quantities the numerical configuration of the literature models is collated in table 7 4 1 longuet higgins and stewart 1964 case on wave set up on a linearly sloped beach this setup has specifically been employed by roland et al 2012 dashed green line fig 4 and xia et al 2004 blue dashed line fig 4b to validate their models the former on their coupled model framework and the latter on the implementation of a new vertical profile extension of the radiation stress for details of their numerical setup see table 7 our calibrated setup prediction for water elevation η continuous red line fig 4 verges on an exact match of the analytical solution of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 continuous black line fig 4b excluding the area of wave breaking 2 m x 3 m resulting in goodness of fit r 2 0 99 table 8 despite the lower r 2 of the literature models roland et al 2012 xia et al 2004 they capture better the shape of η profile during wave breaking despite their over estimation of η offshore and its under estimation closer to the shore fig 4b on the wave height h roland et al 2012 reproduced the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 analytical solution with r 2 1 fig 4a table 8 as we do not reproduce the abrupt transition due to wave breaking 2 m x 4 m in addition to a slight overestimation of h afterwards r 2 is smaller r 2 0 94 table 8 4 2 boers 1997 case on surf zone with a barred beach this experiment has been a popular validation case among wave current interaction coupled models see roland et al 2012 and marsooli et al 2017 roland et al 2012 dashed blue line fig 5 utilised all three wave conditions table 2 and marsooli et al 2017 only the last two dashed green line fig 5c f even though roland et al 2012 utilises a 3 d model our calibrated 2 d setup continuous red line fig 5 simulates η better as the former over estimates η near and after wave breaking x 20 m fig 5b d f this is also confirmed by the superior values of r 2 for swan thetis cal with r 2 0 76 compared to r 2 ranging from 0 91 to 0 64 for roland et al 2012 furthermore for wave conditions a and b sharing t p 2 1 s the significant wave height h s predictions of our calibrated model are more fitting to the observed values black dots fig 5a c in intermediate waters 5 m x 16 m in comparison to the other models exhibited on the other hand models in the literature simulate with more precision h s nearshore x 20 m in fig 5a c e table 9 this superior performance nearshore is also exhibited in η fig 5b d f since roland et al 2012 and marsooli et al 2017 capture the shape of η profile more accurately even though they generally overestimate it this behaviour is expressed through the higher values of the pearson correlation coefficient r in conjunction with the lower for roland et al 2012 or equivalent for marsooli et al 2017 r 2 table 9 compared to our calibrated results 4 3 roelvink and reniers 1995 case on wave induced undertow current the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment was studied to evaluate the model ability of marsooli et al 2017 to simulate wave induced undertow currents firstly marsooli et al 2017 dashed blue line fig 6 predicts more accurately the water elevation in waters of transitional depth 30 m x 120 m a drop in h s is instead observed for our calibrated model results continuous red line fig 6 nonetheless we provide a more accurate h s prediction nearshore x 150 m overall comparable statistics table 10 are derived with our model showing a marginally better performance concerning h s both models bear identical profiles in agreement with the observed values r 2 0 97 black dots fig 6a 4 4 lai et al 1989 case on a strong opposing current the experimental investigation of lai et al 1989 has been previously considered by roland et al 2012 and ris and holthuijsen 1996 although our model continuous red line fig 7a deviates from other model results that simulate current induced wave breaking as calculated by roland et al 2012 green triangles fig 7a and ris and holthuijsen 1996 dashed blue line fig 7a it exhibits the best overall r 2 0 69 table 11 as models in the literature over predict h near the false bottom 6 m x 11 m even though our modelling exhibits the best statistical performance the ineptitude to capture the reduced h after the bar is shared across all models on the current velocity u our calibrated prediction continuous red line fig 7b slightly underestimates the measured profile continuous black line fig 7b even though a noticeable difference is seen due to the scale of the y axis specifically i the predicted velocity over the bar is 0 213 m s 1 against the measured 0 217 m s 1 and ii the velocities near the bottom of the bar are marginally smaller i e 0 125 m s 1 against the observed 0 13 m s 1 these inconsistencies induce the small m a e of 0 004 m s 1 and a willmott index d 0 99 table 11 4 5 dingemans 1987 2 d setup on waves over a submerged bar roland et al 2012 black dots fig 8 also made use of the experiment by dingemans 1987 to validate their model performance with regards to the significant wave height h s and the current velocities u v in a 2 d setup their overestimation of the smaller h s for h s 0 10 m results in a much lower r 2 r 2 0 59 compared to r 2 0 89 table 12 for our calibrated setup red circles fig 8a similarly we simulate the v velocity with marginally more precision r 2 0 79 since roland et al 2012 tends to slightly under estimate 0 1 m s 1 v 0 1 m s 1 with r 2 0 74 concerning the other component of current velocities i e u fig 8b the models exhibit similar results in relative accordance to the measurements with r 2 0 81 and r m s e 0 04 m s 1 table 12 5 discussion 5 1 sensitivity analysis an exploration of a series of parameters was performed through sensitivity analyses for each case study the initial setup containing the default values is arranged alongside the calibrated model table 3 with the parameter range summarised in table 4 for completeness 5 1 1 temporal and mesh convergence the analysis commenced with the mesh resolution of swan d x and thetis h assuming that the time steps δ t swan δ t thetis 1 s are small enough for the cfl condition to be met ordinarily the coarser resolutions investigated table 4 yield insubstantial differences except when refraction is prominent roelvink and reniers 1995 dingemans 1987 the sensitivity of result accuracy to refraction in non stationary simulations is a known swan issue swan team 2019 here exhibited for smaller d x in the dingemans 1987 cases table 4 there the lipschitz criterion is violated allowing the energy to travel over a number of directional bins swan team 2019 hence the imposition of a courant number limiter is necessary for accurate predictions which is insufficient to resolve non convergence issues for d x 2 5 m in the roelvink and reniers 1995 case this is another known issue of swan booij et al 2004 though the limiter restricts the problem locally lastly in the lai et al 1989 case larger h values result in a poor representation of the bathymetry with the u profile near the bar transforming to a shape resembling the letter λ instead of the anticipated π as resolution decreases fig 7b poor results nearshore with coarser resolution are also exhibited in the large scale experiment of roelvink and reniers 1995 hence in the last two aforementioned cases an unstructured mesh is employed in thetis utilising a finer resolution focused on in the area of interest other resolution variables related to computational cost are the time steps employed by the models δ t swan and δ t thetis considering that the ranges tested exhibited no apparent impact on the results but immensely influenced the cpu and convergence time their selection was made on the basis of limiting convergence duration imposing a limit on the convergence time of 5 min for the quasi 1 d cases longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 lai et al 1989 and 10 min for the dingemans 1987 experiment the time step with the minimum cpu time conforming to this restriction is chosen table 3 resulting in relatively large time steps for swan generally δ t swan 10 s and smaller time steps for thetis δ t thetis 5 s swan s limitations on refraction resulting in non convergence necessitated the change of swan s numerical scheme for refraction to a first order upwind and a small time step δ t swan 3 s in the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment refraction s numerical scheme was also converted to a first order upwind in the dingemans 1987 experiment to decrease convergence time additionally for the model to converge within the specified time frame ν was increased to 1 m 2 s 1 in thetis the timestep and mesh sensitivity analyses led to a reduced cpu time ranging from an acceleration of 2 3 for the idealised case of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 to 45 8 for the 2 d experiment of dingemans 1987 table 13 substantially constraining the computational cost for the subsequent analyses 5 1 2 swan parameters considering the monochromatic or narrow band wave conditions implemented the suggested directional standard deviation σ θ 30 by swan booij et al 2004 was not considered instead smaller σ θ values are investigated table 4 with the majority of cases employing σ θ 3 5 table 3 the relatively high σ θ 5 in the case of lai et al 1989 is chosen to reduce the wave height to provide more precise h predictions downstream of the bar since it has been observed that higher values of the spreading index s or as denoted in swan m correspond to higher values of h venugopal et al 2005 while s is negatively correlated with σ θ holthuijsen 2010 booij et al 2004 on bed friction losses the shallow water depths dominating the boers 1997 experiment require a decreased value from the suggested k n 0 05 m table 3 to avoid overestimating bed friction dissipation this issue does not arise on the large scale roelvink and reniers 1995 and the 2 d experiment dingemans 1987 0 04 m k n 0 05 m most likely due to the bathymetry resembling regional scales no analysis is performed for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 idealised setup as all phenomena except for depth induced wave breaking are neglected similar findings are observed for the parameters describing the depth induced dissipation α b j and γ specifically roelvink and reniers 1995 and dingemans 1987 both employ the default values α b j 1 and γ 0 73 to accurately represent the phenomenon on the other hand a slight adjustment of α b j 1 5 is crucial for the small scale setups longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 due to dissipation under estimation on the breaker index the analytical solution of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 considers γ 0 83 confirmed by the investigation table 4 since smaller γ results in wave breaking shifting towards deeper waters in the boers 1997 experiment γ 0 63 and γ 0 73 return statistically similar predictions with the former γ 0 63 providing a better wave breaking prediction at the beach compared to the latter γ 0 73 fig 5c considering the small wave height h 0 02 m traversing the domain and the relative deep waters h 0 45 m no depth induced wave breaking occurs in the lai et al 1989 experiment verified by the analysis for α b j tables 4 3 lastly in addition to the sensitivity summarised in table 3 an investigation on the high frequency cut off limit f m a x was performed specifically for the lai et al 1989 case f m a x together with the low frequency cut off f m i n define the spectrum s prognostic range f m i n f f m a x where energy density develops unrestricted and the diagnostic range f f m i n and f f m a x where the wave wave interactions at high frequencies and integral wave parameters are calculated holthuijsen 2010 the default f m a x 1 hz suggested for conditions at sea does not capture accurately wave blocking a range of f m a x 1 2 hz was examined with higher f m a x generating smaller h downstream the bar however for f m a x 1 8 hz the model does not accurately capture h on the left side where the wave condition is imposed fig 7a most likely due to excluding significant frequencies from the diagnostic spectrum range hence f m a x 1 8 hz was employed to accurately account for wave blocking conditions 5 1 3 thetis parameters moving on to the remaining thetis parameters apparent is the effect of eddy viscosity ν on the cases where current measurements are provided lai et al 1989 dingemans 1987 considering how a constant eddy viscosity turbulence modelling approach is imposed for simplicity higher values of ν are accompanied by a decline in current magnitude due to the smoothing effect of the viscosity term consistently smaller ν was encouraged to accurately predict wave current interactions table 3 however depending on the domain and the bathymetry smaller ν could lead to convergence complications as exhibited in the test case of boers 1997 where for ν 0 25 m 2 s 1 the model failed to converge while for the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment this was observed for ν 1 m 2 s 1 table 4 on the cases where only wave height and water elevation are examined longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 apart from a decrease on convergence time as ν increases the results remained constant thus while low values of ν are recommended in low turbulence regions to minimise turbulent diffusion in current predictions there is a constraint associated with convergence finally to eliminate any spurious oscillations at boundaries resulting in our model diverging a viscosity sponge is imposed in the numerical setup of roelvink and reniers 1995 the wetting and drying parameter α w d modifies the bathymetry by shifting it downwards the larger the α w d the bigger the depth increase hence considering the under estimation of currents already present in the dingemans 1987 case and the slight underestimation of u in the lai et al 1989 experiment no wetting and drying is considered α w d 0 tables 3 4 lest the velocities decrease further in the remaining cases α w d is proportional to the bathymetric range of each domain with α w d 0 1 m for the small setup of longuet higgins and stewart 1964 h 0 45 m and α w d 0 5 m for the boers 1997 experiment h 0 80 m a distinctively high value of 2 5 m considered in the undertow current case roelvink and reniers 1995 is a result of the sensitivity analysis table 4 the undertow current formulated by the waves and the bathymetry varies in depth the top part travels shorewards and the bottom seawards a behaviour not captured by a depth averaged model hence by considerably deepening the waters a greater depth averaged current is recovered that can represent the higher flow velocity near the surface interacting with the waves the manning coefficient n m has virtually no effect on the results due to the small velocities with magnitude 0 004 m s 1 for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 booij et al 1999 and roelvink and reniers 1995 case and u 0 217 m s 1 for the lai et al 1989 setup in the quasi 1 d setups table 1 its influence is only significant in the 2 d case dingemans 1987 where bed shear stress τ b are generated in the submerged bar area affecting the velocities fig 8b c the formation of τ b is facilitated by shallow waters and the decrease of η due to radiation stress hence a decrease of n m table 3 provides more accurate velocities on the bar as the dissipation due to bottom friction is not being over estimated an influence on the results of lai et al 1989 was also expected but for n m 0 06 table 4 the results were identical with negligible difference for n m 0 060 this behaviour is attributed to the small velocities in conjunction with the deep water conditions relative to the wave height 5 2 model cross comparison observations 5 2 1 on the numerical implementation and computational cost computational cost is a critical aspect of numerical models with cpu times under 5 min for the smaller setups and approximately 8 min for the large scale experiment of roelvink and reniers 1995 table 5 our model has promising computational efficiency while linking both wave and current models the coupled model competency is also demonstrated through its rapid convergence in its results this is under 4 min for the quasi 1 d cases longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 roelvink and reniers 1995 lai et al 1989 and nearly 10 min for the sole 2 d setup dingemans 1987 equivalent information in the literature is scarce withn roland et al 2012 documenting some convergence times but abstaining from any cpu times while the other coupled models xia et al 2004 marsooli et al 2017 do not expand on computational details omitting in some cases the simulation times table 7 based on convergence rates our model converges faster than roland et al 2012 the ratio ranging from 1 4 for the dingemans 1987 experiment to 18 for the idealised setup longuet higgins and stewart 1964 respectively thetis semi implicit numerical scheme alongside swan s implicit allow the employment of sufficiently large time steps with swan utilising δ t swan 3 60 s and thetis δ t thetis 1 5 s resulting in coupling time step δ t c o u p l i n g ranging from 3 to 60 s table 3 the latter is at least 120 larger dingemans 1987 experiment and utmost 1 0 4 larger xia et al 2004 for the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 setup than the coupling time steps employed by the models we use for comparison table 7 though more iterations may be required by our model constituents to advance in time furthermore the schemes applied in the coupled model support coarser meshes with the same level of accuracy in the results with swan structured mesh resolution being 3 2 to 25 coarser than the mesh applied in the other coupled models tables 3 7 the unstructured nature of thetis mesh permits resolution refinement only in the area of interest without needlessly increasing the computational cost such as in the roelvink and reniers 1995 setup where h 0 5 m was employed nearshore with h 2 5 m near the deep waters table 3 compared to the constant 1 m resolution of marsooli et al 2017 table 7 therefore the combination of larger timesteps coarser mesh resolution and local refinement could culminate in a substantial reduction of computational resources compared to the existing coupled models 5 2 2 on the depth induced wave breaking and wave setup on depth induced wave breaking investigation at small scales longuet higgins and stewart 1964 boers 1997 our water elevation prediction η is more accurate than roland et al 2012 and xia et al 2004 where data is available in the idealised setup longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this is attributed to their models applying η 0 m as boundary condition instead of the calculated one in the ocean model fig 4b leading to r 2 0 90 against r 2 0 99 for our calibrated setup table 8 on the experimental study of boers 1997 superior performance against roland et al 2012 r 2 0 76 opposed to 0 91 r 2 0 64 table 9 lies in the overestimation of η nearshore from the latter fig 5b d f most likely as a consequence of the different formulations employed for the calculation of radiation stress roland et al 2012 implement a simplified formulation of longuet higgins and stewart 1962 without accounting for any other wave induced effect while we introduce wave roller effects alongside the formulation of mellor 2015 although statistically the cross model performance for h is comparable in the longuet higgins and stewart 1964 setup table 8 we do not capture the sharp peak of wave breaking fig 4a presumably due to swan s inability to represent such sharp crests to avoid introducing instabilities another reason could lie in the coupled model framework which assumes parallel computations by default even when the coupled model is run on a single core swan assumes that it runs in parallel with one core disabling some of its functionality supported solely in serial booij et al 2004 one such command is the inclusion of wave setup such differences are not observed in the boers 1997 experiment with both roland et al 2012 and swan thetis exhibiting similar h s profiles and statistical parameters fig 5a c e table 9 attributed to both models employing the jonswap spectrum the difference in spectrum could explain the superior performance of marsooli et al 2017 in wave condition c fig 5e with r 2 0 87 table 9 capturing the peaks representing wave breaking since they utilised the donelan et al 1985 spectrum the distinct features among models notably between swan thetis and roland et al 2012 become apparent in the adjustments utilised to accurately capture depth induced wave breaking dissipation roland et al 2012 adjusted their depth induced wave breaking parameters by decreasing α b j from 1 0 to 0 5 and increasing γ to 0 8 from 0 73 to refrain from over dissipation in comparison we increased the rate of dissipation α b j to 1 5 and decreased the breaker index to 0 63 table 3 this disparity is attributed to the different numerical schemes employed by the models 5 2 3 on the large scale experiment progressing on the roelvink and reniers 1995 experiment even though the models have almost identical h s profiles fig 6a and similar statistics for η table 10 their η predictions are quite distinct pertaining to the wave induced undertow current leading to sandbar formation the 3 d nature of marsooli et al 2017 recognises the early influence of waves on currents x 60 m thus exhibiting more precision in the intermediate waters while nearshore they are under predicting the gradient of η fig 6b the improved performance of our model emanates from the distinctively high value of the wetting and drying parameter α w d 2 5 m to accurately capture the 3 d nature of undertow current with depth averaged velocities thus a tremendous adjustment of the bathymetry is fundamental for our satisfying performance easily corroborated by the η profile of our default setup see swan thetis def fig 6b 5 2 4 on the strong opposing current having verified the effects of waves on currents we investigate our ability to capture the effects of currents on waves through the experiment of lai et al 1989 though the case has also been utilised by another coupled model roland et al 2012 only energy spectra for the wave gauges location fig 3d have been provided which were converted to wave height following e 1 16 ρ g h 2 for easier comparison with the other model results due to observation scarcity it is ambiguous if the waves break reflect as a result of the bar or are weakened by the current hence our uniqueness in not predicting an increased h near the bar s top does not indicate an error specifically ris and holthuijsen 1996 who although not employing a coupled model exploited this experiment to validate swan s whitecapping formulation dashed blue line fig 7a do comment on the peculiarity of the elevated h in that location since they expected a reduction of h 5 2 5 on the 2 d configuration we conclude with the 2 d experiment dingemans 1987 where the calibrated setup achieves 1 54 more accurate h s predictions than roland et al 2012 with r 2 0 92 opposed to r 2 0 59 respectively table 12 though our model favours smaller h s compared to dingemans 1987 the differences are small ranging from 11 25 to 14 73 with mean at 2 12 and s d error 5 65 in contrast roland et al 2012 over estimates extensively h s 0 1 m values which are located on the top and at the right of the bar with differences δ h s h s o b s 3 74 44 44 with 10 63 mean and 12 44 s d error hence our model appraises the depth induced wave breaking dissipation and refraction more appropriately than roland et al 2012 on currents predictions we accurately capture the flow pattern with some discrepancies on the magnitude though both models exhibit comparable current predictions by over estimating the smaller velocities and under estimating the higher ones fig 8b c these differences are slightly amplified in our model the current travels faster on the top of the bar as a consequence of the elevated bathymetry and the decreased water level courtesy of radiation stress while the smaller velocities occur on the north side of the bar 17 5 m x 25 m 10 m y 20 m fig 3f the culpability lies with the imprecise calculation of bed shear stress it is virtually zero except at the bar location by implementing a varying manning coefficient field these predictions could be improved as a smaller n m value assigned to the elevated bottom would consider the effects of waves on currents curtailing the bed shear stress miscount 5 3 limitations extensions and prospective applications considering the coupled framework s structure some limitations are inherent by the model constituents such as swan s inability to calculate wave characteristics for very shallow water depths and to resolve refraction in non stationary or large applications others stem from the use of thetis in its 2 d form where depth averaged velocities are unable to capture 3 d phenomena such as an undertow current furthermore the implementation of recommended i e default parameters could potentially lead to erroneous predictions as showcased by section 5 1 hence calibration on both models is required despite these constraints the coupled model presents several advantages the minimal modification required for the coupling at source code level maintains the models flexibility by supporting the further independent development of thetis and swan these improvements can be easily and almost effortlessly included in the coupled framework in addition the implementation of bmi facilitates the interoperability of either the coupled framework or the model components on their own with other models employing bmi hence we align with the goal set by the community surface dynamics modeling system csdms to promote a flexible inter operable and continually developing research software ecosystem tucker et al 2021 although not explicitly presented here parallel implementation of the model is supported reducing significantly the cpu time lastly the combination of the numerical schemes employed by the model combined with the 2 d nature of thetis promote computational efficiency while maintaining the same levels of accuracy presented in 3 d wave current interactions coupled models hence our coupled framework presents opportunities to support optimisation studies clare et al 2022 which include iterative simulations adjoint modelling or data assimilation techniques warder et al 2022 funke et al 2014 this work paves the way to practical applications regional scales a practical example within the coastal ocean domain relates to marine energy such as at the orkney shetland archipelagos where both wave and tidal sites have already been leased johnson et al 2012 earlier efforts have demonstrated the simulation and optimisation of tidal energy systems jordan et al 2022 pennock et al 2022 in the region but considering the highly energetic wave conditions the optimisation approaches that embed broader metocean conditions would be invaluable 6 conclusions a coupling between swan and thetis models to account for wave current interactions occurring by the co existence of wave and current flows has been developed swan is a 3rd generation spectral wave model booij et al 1999 while the 2 d configuration of the shallow water equation model thetis is utilised kärnä 2020 a python interface implemented through basic model interface hutton et al 2020 facilitates the coupling with minimal intrusion in the refactored source code the different grids and time steps employed by the model components allow greater flexibility the two models run consecutively and communicate internally to exchange the necessary parameters these are the significant wave height mean wave direction mean wavelength and percentage of wave breaking calculated by swan necessary for calculating radiation stress and wave roller effects while thetis provides water elevation and current velocity fields a suite of benchmarking cases for wave current interaction models consisting of analytical and experimental scenarios in quasi 1 d and 2 d configurations has been established their implementation by the coupled swan thetis framework successfully demonstrates its ability to represent wave current phenomena specifically its capability to account for depth induced wave breaking wave setup the effects of strong opposing currents in 1 d and 2 d configurations has been investigated through a systematic analysis calibration discrepancies between the recommended values are acknowledged and explained highlighting the necessity of calibration when wave current interactions are prominent some of the parameters showcasing such differences are the friction coefficient employed by either model the depth induced wave breaking parameters as well as thetis eddy viscosity our agreement with the data is strong for the calibrated setups and often on the same level of accuracy as other 3 d wave current interaction models this also entails less computational cost as our model converges faster and requires less cpu time compared to other
