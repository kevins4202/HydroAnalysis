20245,an experimental work was conducted to investigate effects of the deflector plate on the performance and flow characteristics of a drag type hydrokinetic rotor a measurement device was specifically designed to record instantaneous rotational speed and output torque of the hydrokinetic rotor the performance of the rotor and the near rotor flow were studied comprehensively the deflector angle and the upstream velocity were varied the results show that the maximum power coefficient of the rotor reaches 0 463 at the deflector angle of 60 approximately 2 5 times that obtained at the deflector angle of 30 as the upstream water velocity increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum power coefficient of the rotor is increased by 22 8 the deflector plate not only prevents the impingement of the upstream flow on the returning blade but also guides the upstream flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade as the deflector angle increases more upstream water with high velocity is guided toward the concave side of the advancing blade the coanda like flow arising at the convex side of the advancing blade is beneficial for the improvement of the rotor performance and is enhanced with increasing deflector angle the effect of the deflector plate on the operation of the savonius hydrokinetic rotor was clarified and the conclusions provide a sound support for the improvement of the rotor performance keywords drag type hydrokinetic rotor deflector plate deflector angle rotor performance flow pattern 1 introduction the hydrokinetic energy has attracted much attention with its high energy density more importantly it offers the benefit of lower emissions and other types of pollution birjandi et al 2013 kumar and sarkar 2016b the hydrokinetic rotor converts the hydrokinetic energy into manipulatable mechanical energy vanzwieten et al 2015 compared with conventional hydropower device the hydrokinetic rotor has simple structure and can operate without the support of the dam and the turbine house kirke 2020 these advantages enable it to work in irrigation canals rivers tidal streams or even pipelines chen et al 2013 kumar and saini 2016 as the hydrokinetic rotor is deployed in offshore regions the size constraint is minimized according to the orientation of the rotor axis relative to the upstream water flow hydrokinetic rotors can be categorized into the horizontal axis and the vertical axis hydrokinetic rotors golecha et al 2012 driven by the lift force acting on the blade the horizon axis hydrokinetic rotor has high operational efficiency khan et al 2009 however the fabrication and installation of the horizontal axis rotor are rather complex the vertical axis rotors are further divided into the lift type and the drag type rotors the latter is featured by high startup capability and output torque talukdar et al 2018 moreover the drag type vertical axis rotor is suitable for small scale power plants and off grid applications güney and kaygusuz 2010 wang and yeung 2016 for extracting the kinetic energy of seawater the lift type rotor is popular in comparison the drag type rotor attracts less attention due to its low operational efficiency as a representative of the drag type rotor the savonius rotor was invented in the 1920s for harnessing the wind energy savonius 1931 the rotation of the savonius rotor is driven by the pressure difference between the two sides of the rotor blades such a rotor can be used to extract the kinetic energy from flowing water vermaak et al 2014 the hydrokinetic savonius rotor proves to have high structural stability and operational versatility akwa et al 2012 al ghriybah et al 2019 nevertheless low efficiency limits its extensive applications zhang et al 2019b recently the majority of the studies on the savonius rotor has been dedicated to the improvement of the operational efficiency kumar et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c essentially geometric parameters of the rotor significantly influence the power coefficient of the rotor ahmed et al 2013 al ghriybah et al 2021 the rotor blades with large bucket arc angles or a lengthened straight segment and the elliptical blade have been proposed to improve the rotor performance basumatary et al 2021 ramadan et al 2018 shashikumar et al 2021 moreover the optimal number of the rotor blades is argued to fall within the range from 2 to 6 emmanuel and jun 2011 prasad et al 2018 wenehenubun et al 2015 besides the height diameter ratio of the rotor namely the aspect ratio has been prioritized kamoji et al 2009a patel et al 2017 saha et al 2008 the two parameters are directly related to the swept area of the rotor which determines to a large extent the magnitude of the kinetic energy received by the rotor and the hydraulic force acting on the rotor consequently a compromise between the rotational speed and the aspect ratio is expected to be reached additionally the overlap between the rotor blades influences the energy conversion ability of the rotor mabrouki 2012 ricci et al 2016 roy and saha 2013 essentially the gap flow between the advancing blade and the returning blade causes a significant change in pressure distributions over the surfaces of the two blades the maximum power coefficient of the savonius rotor is about 0 3 betz 2013 however such a limit is difficult to reach with a single rotor saini and saini 2020 actually the upstream flow pattern imposes a critical effect on the operation of the rotor kang et al 2018 various strategies of upstream flow control such as deploying auxiliary device have been exercised to improve the performance of the rotor kumar and sarkar 2016a mohammadi et al 2018 saad el deen et al 2020 the upstream flow was accelerated through the duct designed in thakur et al 2019 and the maximum power coefficient of the rotor was increased by 43 to enlarge the pressure gap between the upstream and downstream sides of the rotor a duct nozzle system was proposed in elbatran et al 2017 the upstream flow was guided toward the advancing blade while the returning blade was shielded by the duct consequently the maximum power coefficient was increased by 78 relative to that of the conventional rotor besides by installing a circular barrier upstream of the returning blade adverse flows were diverted away from the returning blade and accordingly negative torque on the returning blade was eliminated alizadeh et al 2020 the strategy of deploying a deflector upstream of the rotor proves effective for the improvement of the performance of the drag type hydrokinetic rotor kerikous and thévenin 2019 payambarpour et al 2020 essentially the deflector assumes the function of flow controller guo et al 2020 in general the deflector plate is installed upstream of the returning blade golecha et al 2011 meanwhile the deflector enables concentrated water streams to impact the advancing blade and therefore positive torque increases kailash et al 2012 the manner of installation is of importance for the application of the deflector the duct structure which enables the fixing of the deflector onto the inner wall of the duct is more suitable for such a combination this strategy has been implemented in the lift type hydrokinetic rotor produced by cape sharp tidal rajgor 2017 accordingly a yaw system is required to make the turbine unit adapt to flow direction from the flow aspect the deflector serves as a solid boundary and its geometry determines to a large extent the flow patterns kerikous and thévenin 2019 mosbahi et al 2019 hitherto the design of the auxiliary deflector relies overwhelmingly on experience although relevant studies have been performed no consensus has been reached about the optimal geometry and orientation of the deflector in this case a joint consideration of the near rotor flow characteristics and the performance of the rotor is of fundamental significance the present study aims to evaluate the performance of a drag type hydrokinetic rotor as an assistant deflector is deployed both the flow characteristics and the rotor performance are investigated an experimental work was performed to quantify the rotor performance and to describe the near rotor flow patterns instantaneous rotational speed and the output torque of the rotor were captured using a specifically developed measurement device flow patterns near the rotor were measured using the timed resolved particle image velocimetry tr piv the performance of the rotor and near rotor flow patterns were obtained and analyzed comprehensively effects of the setting angle of the deflector plate and the upstream water velocity on the rotor performance were inspected the conclusions are expected to supplement current knowledge about the drag type hydrokinetic rotor and to provide a sound reference to the improvement of the rotor performance 2 experimental setup 2 1 drag type hydrokinetic rotor a drag type hydrokinetic rotor was designed based on the conventional savonius rotor the cross sectional view and an image of the rotor are shown in fig 1 the blade is connected to the rotor hub via a straight segment and the length of the straight segment s is 48 mm the straight segment was argued to have a positive effect on improving the rotor performance kacprzak et al 2013 the diameter d and height h of the rotor are both 240 mm therefore the aspect ratio of the rotor h d is 1 0 according to the results obtained by kamoji et al 2009a the aspect ratio of 1 0 of the savonius rotor is responsible for the highest power coefficient the radius of the blade r is 60 0 mm the azimuthal angle θ is defined as the angle between the direction of the upstream flow and the line connecting the tip of the advancing blade and the center of the rotor in fig 1 a water flows from the right to the left with a constant velocity and the rotor rotates in counterclockwise direction the blade rotating along with the incident flow is termed advancing blade while the other one resisting the incident flow is the returning blade to conduct the visualization measurement the rotor is made of plexiglass as shown in fig 1 b the blade thickness is 12 0 mm which satisfies the requirement for the stiffness of the rotor 2 2 deflector plate for the rotor shown in fig 1 as it operated alone the maximum power coefficient was 0 276 which was obtained numerically during the design process this was then validated through comparisons with available performance data associated with similar rotors deployment of a deflector plate upstream of the rotor serves as an effective measure for the improvement of the rotor performance mohamed et al 2011 in the presented study a deflector plate was installed upstream of the returning blade as shown schematically in fig 2 it is noteworthy that certain flow direction is advised for the configuration illustrated in fig 2 therefore the ducted turbine structure is suitable for matching such a configuration as is in accordance with the scheme proposed in rajgor 2017 based on the results obtained in golecha et al 2011 the lower end of the plate is fixed and the horizontal and vertical distances between the lower end and the center of the rotor x and y are set to 160 0 mm and 175 0 mm respectively the length of the plate l is 100 0 mm the deflector angle β is defined as the angle between the deflector plate and the upstream flow direction here three deflector angles 30 45 and 60 are selected according to a preliminary numerical work the deflector angles smaller than 30 correspond to low power coefficients meanwhile the experimental observation indicated as the deflector angle exceeded 60 the flow immediately upstream of the rotor was unstable due to apparent vibration of the deflector plate 2 3 water loop the experiments were conducted in a water loop which is schematically shown in fig 3 in the test section the water velocity upstream of the deflector plate and the rotor u was adjusted through regulating the rotational speed of the pump during the experiment u was varied between 0 63 and 0 73 m s the flow rate of water was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter the length of the test section is 1200 0 mm and the cross section of the test section is measured by 410 0 410 0 mm as the model rotor is installed in the test section of a closed loop the blockage effect is expected to be considered in view of the gap between the rotor and the walls of the test section roy and saha 2014 quantitative methods have been proposed and compared for evaluating the effect of the blockage ratio on the performance of the lift type rotor ross and polagye 2020 regarding the presented configuration it was designed to mimic the ducted structure proposed in rajgor 2017 and the lateral walls of the test section were necessary for concentrating the upstream water furthermore the deflector plate is supposed to undermine the uniformity of velocity distributions in the upstream flow in this case the correction of the upstream flow velocity according to the blockage ratio is not appropriate moreover the test section remained being fully filled during the experiment and the disturbance of the free surface on the performance of the rotor was negligible to suppress turbulent fluctuations and foster uniform upstream flows at the inlet of the test section a flow stabilization segment was deployed upstream of the test section kailash et al 2012 the rotor is installed vertically in the test section as shown in fig 3 2 4 measurement of rotor performance a rotor performance measurement device was specifically designed as shown in fig 4 an integrated torque and rotational speed sensor is used to measure the torque on the rotor and the rotational speed of the rotor compared with the rope brake dynamometer talukdar et al 2018 the measurement device proposed here has a higher accuracy a magnetic powder brake is used to exert load on the rotor and the load regulation is accurate mosbahi et al 2019 the rotor the sensor and the magnetic powder brake are coaxial and connected through couplings therefore the frictional effect is minimized golecha et al 2011 the attainable data acquisition frequency is 10 000 hz which has not been accomplished in previous literature patel et al 2017 thiyagaraj et al 2016 the average power coefficient c p and average torque coefficient c t which are closely related to flow parameters are used to evaluate the rotor performance the ratio of the output power of the rotor to the ideal kinetic energy of the water received by the rotor is defined as the power coefficient 1 c p 2 m ω ρ a u 3 where m is the average torque produced in one period of rotation and can be calculated based on the instantaneous torque m i which is measured by the torque sensor at each azimuthal angle ω denotes the rotational speed of the rotor and is calculated based on the rotational speed n which is measured using the rotational speed sensor ρ denotes the density of water and a denotes the maximum rotor area that faces the upstream flow the average torque coefficient is defined as the ratio of the average torque produced by the rotor to the torque provided theoretically by the water flow 2 c t m m a 4 m ρ a d u 2 the instantaneous torque coefficient c ti is defined as the ratio of the instantaneous torque produced by the rotor to the theoretical torque 3 c t i m i m a 4 m i ρ a d u 2 the tip speed ratio is defined as the ratio of the tangential velocity at the rotor tip to upstream water velocity 4 t s r ω d 2 u based on eqs 1 4 the uncertainty of the rotor performance results mainly from the errors in the measurements of m i n and u during the experiment the instantaneous torque and the rotational speed were directly measured using the torque and rotational speed sensor with an accuracy of 1 0 the upstream velocity was calculated through dividing the volumetric flow rate with the cross sectional area of the test section the electromagnetic flowmeter has an accuracy of 0 2 according to the uncertainty analysis method proposed by moffat 1988 the uncertainties in the present experiment can be calculated through the following relationships the uncertainty for each quantity is thereby obtained 5 δ m i m i δ n n 1 0 6 δ q q 0 2 7 δ u u δ q q 2 0 2 8 δ t s r t s r δ ω ω 2 δ u u 2 δ n n 2 δ u u 2 1 02 9 δ m a m a 2 δ u u 2 0 28 10 δ c t c t δ c t i c t i δ m a m a 2 δ m i m i 2 1 04 11 δ c p c p δ c t c t 2 δ t s r t s r 2 1 46 2 5 tr piv system a lavision tr piv system was used to measure near rotor velocity distributions as shown in fig 5 a dm30 high frequency pulsed laser with the maximum energy of 70 mj was used as the light source a photron fastcam ux100 high speed cmos camera with the maximum resolution of 1280 1024 pixels was used to record the motion of seeding particles the davis software embedded in the control module of the tr piv system was used to synchronize laser emitting with the exposure of the camera the camera was used jointly by a nikon af nikkor 50 mm f 1 4d lens meanwhile another cylindrical lens was used to transform the point laser into a thin light sheet hollow glass beads with a mean diameter of 20 μm served as seeding particles the laser sheet and the camera were not perpendicular due the limited space below the test section therefore a mirror which is inclined by 45 was placed under the test section such an indirect manner ensures that the monitored plane is perpendicular to the shooting direction of the camera detailed optical layout is shown in fig 5 a a cross correlation algorithm was adopted to process the data in each interrogation window and the overlap between two neighboring interrogation windows was 75 the double frame and double exposure mode was applied and the sampling frequency was set to 2000 hz for each experimental condition the sampling time was set to 5 s to ensure the rotor can rotate at least 720 at any rotational speed for the tr piv experiment the particle displacement in two successively captured images was larger than the diameter of the seeding particle but smaller than 1 4 the width of the interrogation window therefore the time interval between two consecutive laser pulses varied with the upstream velocity uncertainty of velocity measurement mainly depends on velocity magnitude and the experimental rig wernet 2000 according to the specifications of the tr piv system the maximum uncertainty of this system is less than 0 1 other factors such as physical properties of the seeding particles and the rotation of the rotor and the circulation in the loop also affect the measurement accuracy uncertainties caused by these factors were controlled in the present experiment eventually overall uncertainty of the velocity measurement was less than 2 major operational parameters of the piv system are summarized in table 1 3 performance analysis the power coefficient and the torque coefficient of the rotor could be calculated based on the experimental data among the quantities that influence the rotor performance the deflector angle and upstream water velocity are predominant which has been substantiated through experimental observations and calculations therefore present emphasis was placed on detailing the effects of the two quantities on rotor performance 3 1 effects of the deflector angle at u 0 73 m s variations of the average power coefficient with the tip speed ratio at the three deflector angles are plotted in fig 6 the average power coefficient increases remarkably with the deflector angle at β 30 the maximum c p is 0 186 which is 13 4 higher than that of the rotor operating alone zhang et al 2019a normally the maximum power coefficients of the hydrokinetic rotor with auxiliary device range from 0 12 to 0 25 golecha et al 2011 mosbahi et al 2019 payambarpour et al 2020 by adding a barrier with quadrant surface upstream of the returning blade the maximum average power coefficient can reach 0 29 alizadeh et al 2020 the maximum average power coefficient of the rotor increased to 0 35 with the assistance of two deflector plates kailash et al 2012 the maximum average power coefficient of the rotor obtained here is higher than those previously reported the power coefficient and the torque coefficient are related via the torque produced on the rotor as evidenced by eqs 1 and 2 at u 0 73 m s variations of the torque coefficient with the tip speed ratio are plotted in fig 7 it is seen that the torque coefficient decreases continuously with increasing tip speed ratio furthermore the torque on the rotor is sensitive to the variation of the deflector angle it is indicated in fig 7 that the increase in the deflector angle leads to continuous increase of the torque coefficient the maximum torque coefficients of the rotor at β 30 45 and 60 are 0 29 0 55 and 0 60 respectively in fig 8 at the three deflector angles instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at optimal tsrs are plotted here the rotor has two blades therefore the instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor varies with the period of 180 within one rotational cycle at β 30 the curve plotted in fig 8 a exhibits a butterfly shape which is shared by the other two cases implying the fluctuations of the torque coefficient with the rotation of the rotor meanwhile it is evidenced that the value of the optimal tip speed ratio varies with the deflector angle furthermore based on a comparison of the magnitudes of the torque coefficient between fig 8 a b and c it is demonstrated that as the deflector angle increases from 30 to 60 the torque performance of the rotor is improved remarkably 3 2 effects of upstream velocity the upstream velocity influences the rotor performance significantly 6 variations of the power and torque coefficients with the tip speed ratio at different upstream velocities and β 60 are plotted separately in figs 9 and 10 the power coefficient of the rotor increases with the upstream velocity this is consistent with the results reported in hayashi et al 2005 kamoji et al 2008a b the maximum power coefficients of the rotor at u 0 63 m s 0 68 m s and 0 73 m s are 0 378 0 409 and 0 463 respectively as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum power coefficient is increased by about 22 8 meanwhile as u varies the tip speed ratio corresponding to the maximum power coefficient remains invariant it was argued in kamoji et al 2009b that for the helical savonius rotor the tip speed ratio corresponding to the maximum power coefficient increases with the upstream velocity it is indicated in fig 10 that at different upstream velocities the torque coefficient of the rotor decreases gradually with increasing tsr the maximum torque coefficient is reached at about tsr 0 65 and at the three upstream velocities the maximum torque coefficients are 0 512 0 539 and 0 601 respectively quantitatively the maximum torque coefficient is increased by 17 4 as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at different upstream velocities and optimal tsrs are plotted in fig 11 at different upstream velocities the distributions of instantaneous torque coefficients in one period of rotation are similar from θ 0 the torque coefficient increases gradually and reaches its maximum at about θ 60 after that the torque coefficient decreases with the rotation of the rotor and the minimum is attained at about θ 120 then the torque coefficient increases again until θ 180 the maximum instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at the three upstream velocities are 0 448 0 512 and 0 589 respectively as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum instantaneous torque coefficient is increased by about 31 5 the above analyses demonstrate that the performance of the rotor depends considerably on the operating condition to provide an overview of the rotor performance under the operating conditions considered the maximum average power coefficient and corresponding torque coefficient of the rotor are listed in table 2 accordingly combinations of the deflector angle and the upstream velocity are shown as well 4 flow characteristics essentially the performance of the rotor is closely related to the near rotor flow the integral of static pressure over the blade surface yields the hydraulic force acting on the rotor nonetheless the rotor performance and the near rotor flow respond non synchronously to variations of the operation parameters the rotor performance indices such as the power coefficient depend on multiple macroscopic variables in comparison the near rotor flow is subject to the bounding effect of the rotor blades which varies constantly as the rotor rotates 4 1 effects of deflector angle at u 0 73 m s instantaneous flow patterns near the rotor at five rotor setting angles and β 30 are shown in fig 12 due to the introduction of the deflector plate the upstream flow is accelerated near the tip of the plate and a high velocity region is formed downstream of the plate meanwhile a large scale vortex is seen immediately downstream of the plate at θ 0 as indicated in fig 12 a owing to the rotation of the rotor the upstream flow changes its direction and migrates towards the concave side of the advancing blade which has a positive effect on the rotation of the rotor the coanda effect is evidenced as water flows through a solid wall with small curvature in fig 12 a at the convex side of the advancing blade water moves along the blade surface and then flows into the space confined by the concave side of the returning blade yielding the coanda like flow this phenomenon is in accordance with the results visualized in nakajima et al 2008 and the influence of the coanda like flow on the rotor performance is significant fujisawa 1992 as the rotor rotates the rotor area that faces the upstream flow is gradually enlarged at θ 36 as indicated in fig 12 b the water collecting capability of the advancing blade is improved and more water flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade which stimulates the rotor to produce higher positive torque however under the guidance of the deflector plate more high velocity flow impinges on the returning blade and hinders the rotation of the rotor this explains why instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor decreases slightly as θ increases from 18 to 47 as indicated in fig 8 a meanwhile as θ increases the coanda like flow at the convex side of the advancing blade decays gradually as agrees with that reported in fujisawa 1996 flow separation arises in fig 12 d and e as θ increases velocity of the upstream flow that migrates toward the advancing blade increases as well this promotes the generation of positive torque and instantaneous torque coefficient increases accordingly at θ 108 the area of the advancing blade that faces the upstream flow is reduced as shown in fig 12 d meanwhile the gap between the deflector plate and the returning blade shrinks and more water flows directly toward the returning blade therefore instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor decreases it is noteworthy that the coanda like flow is produced at the convex sides of both the advancing and returning blades meanwhile two distinct vortices are trapped at the concave sides of the two blades as the azimuthal angle increases further the blade area that faces the upstream flow decreases for both the advancing and returning blades it is observed that a high velocity zone is attached to the convex side of the returning blade and the static pressure is correspondingly low with the coanda like flow velocity of the portion of water flowing toward the concave side of the advancing blade increases as illustrated in fig 12 e on the other hand the gap between the returning blade and the deflector plate is enlarged high velocity water passes through the gap instead of impinging on the returning blade consequently negative torque produced on the returning blade is reduced therefore the instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor at θ 144 is larger than that at θ 108 as the rotor rotates water is accelerated near the rotor and downstream of the rotor these differ explicitly from the flow patterns near a stationary rotor which is accompanied by large scale vortices and low velocity region zhang et al 2019a at β 45 and 60 instantaneous flow patterns near the rotor at optimal tsrs are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the high velocity region at the tip of the plate extends and velocity in this region decreases the large scale vortex downstream of the plate expands as the deflector angle increases at θ 0 high velocity water flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade velocity at the concave side of the advancing blade increases with the deflector angle as shown in figs 13 a and 12 a meanwhile the coanda like flow near the convex side of the advancing blade is strengthened with increasing deflector angle accordingly the resistance to the rotation of the rotor decreases due to reduced static pressure at the convex side of the advancing blade this facilitates an increase of the torque coefficient as indicated in fig 14 a a water stream with distinctly high velocity impinges onto the concave side of the returning blade at θ 36 and 72 more water streams with high velocities flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade as β increases particularly at β 60 as demonstrated in fig 14 b and c water with high velocity flows perpendicularly toward the concave side of the advancing blade consequently the torque produced by the advancing blade increases considerably furthermore the portion of water that otherwise impacts the returning blade is blocked by the deflector plate at large deflector angles the larger the deflector angle the less water flows toward the returning blade therefore negative torque produced on the returning blade varies inversely with the deflector angle accordingly the torque coefficient of the rotor reaches the highest at β 60 as evidenced in fig 8 at θ 108 a comparison of flow patterns between the cases with different deflector angles indicates that the low velocity area downstream of the rotor is enlarged as the deflector angle increases meanwhile more water with high velocity flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade eventually at θ 108 instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor still increases with the deflector angle at θ 144 the gap between the rotor and the deflector plate narrows with increasing deflector angle more water flows toward the convex side of the returning blade and a high velocity zone is formed along the surface of the returning blade velocity in this zone increases with the deflector angle based on the relationship between velocity and the static pressure the static pressure near the convex side of the returning blade decreases during this process to summarize as the deflector angle increases the coanda like flow is strengthened and the resultant decrease in the static pressure is beneficial for reducing the resistance to the rotation of the rotor 4 2 effects of upstream velocity at θ 0 and 72 flow patterns at different upstream velocities and corresponding optimal tsrs are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively at θ 0 the coanda like flow near the convex side of the advancing blade is gradually strengthened with increasing upstream velocity as indicated in fig 15 moreover it is seen in fig 15 c that a water stream with high velocity flows toward the concave side of the returning blade meanwhile the high velocity region attached to the convex surface of the advancing blade expands toward the blade tip as the upstream water velocity increases therefore low pressure effect at the convex side of the advancing blade is enhanced and positive torque produced on the advancing blade increases this promotes the increase of the power coefficient of the rotor the high velocity region at the tip of the deflector plate also expands with increasing upstream velocity as shown in fig 16 at u 0 73 m s the high velocity band initiated from the upstream side of the deflector plate arrives at the concave side of the advancing blade as shown in fig 16 c velocity at the concave side of the advancing blade increases remarkably and more kinetic energy of flowing water is expected to be converted by the advancing blade contributing to the increase of the power coefficient of the rotor 5 conclusions an experimental work was conducted to evaluate the operational performance of the hydrokinetic rotor assisted by a deflector plate the torque coefficient the rotational speed and near rotor flow velocity distributions were obtained and analyzed comprehensively it is evidenced that instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor increases with the deflector angle at a deflector angle of 60 the maximum power coefficient of the rotor reaches 0 463 which is higher than previously obtained results essentially the deflector plate not only prevents the upstream flow from impacting the returning blade but also guides the upstream water flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade this phenomenon is intensified as the deflector angle increases from 30 to 60 the coanda like flow arising at the convex side of the advancing blade is beneficial for the improvement of the rotor performance and is strengthened with increasing deflector angle furthermore as the upstream water velocity increases the guiding effect of the deflector plate is enhanced which leads to a remarkable increase in the power coefficient of the rotor credit authorship contribution statement yongchao zhang investigation data curation writing original draft

20245,an experimental work was conducted to investigate effects of the deflector plate on the performance and flow characteristics of a drag type hydrokinetic rotor a measurement device was specifically designed to record instantaneous rotational speed and output torque of the hydrokinetic rotor the performance of the rotor and the near rotor flow were studied comprehensively the deflector angle and the upstream velocity were varied the results show that the maximum power coefficient of the rotor reaches 0 463 at the deflector angle of 60 approximately 2 5 times that obtained at the deflector angle of 30 as the upstream water velocity increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum power coefficient of the rotor is increased by 22 8 the deflector plate not only prevents the impingement of the upstream flow on the returning blade but also guides the upstream flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade as the deflector angle increases more upstream water with high velocity is guided toward the concave side of the advancing blade the coanda like flow arising at the convex side of the advancing blade is beneficial for the improvement of the rotor performance and is enhanced with increasing deflector angle the effect of the deflector plate on the operation of the savonius hydrokinetic rotor was clarified and the conclusions provide a sound support for the

the hydrokinetic energy into manipulatable mechanical energy vanzwieten et al 2015 compared with conventional hydropower device the hydrokinetic rotor has simple structure and can operate without the

rotor proves to have high structural stability and operational versatility akwa et al 2012 al ghriybah et al 2019 nevertheless low efficiency limits its extensive applications zhang et al 2019b recently the majority of the studies on the savonius rotor has been dedicated to the improvement of the operational efficiency kumar et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c essentially geometric parameters of the rotor significantly influence the power coefficient of the rotor ahmed et al 2013 al ghriybah et al 2021 the rotor blades with large bucket arc angles or a lengthened straight segment and the elliptical blade have been proposed to improve the rotor performance basumatary et al 2021 ramadan et al 2018 shashikumar et al 2021 moreover the optimal number of the rotor blades is argued to fall within the range from 2 to 6 emmanuel and jun 2011 prasad et al 2018 wenehenubun et al 2015 besides the height diameter ratio of the rotor namely the aspect ratio has been prioritized kamoji et al 2009a patel et al 2017 saha et al 2008 the two parameters are directly related to the swept area of the rotor which determines to a large extent the magnitude of the kinetic energy received by the rotor and the hydraulic force acting on the rotor consequently a compromise between the rotational speed and the aspect ratio is expected to be reached additionally the overlap between the rotor blades influences the energy conversion ability of the rotor mabrouki 2012 ricci et al 2016 roy and saha 2013 essentially the gap flow between the advancing blade and the returning blade causes a significant change in pressure distributions over the surfaces of the two blades the maximum power coefficient of the savonius rotor is about 0 3 betz 2013 however such a limit is difficult to reach with a single rotor saini and saini 2020 actually the upstream flow pattern imposes a critical effect on the operation of the rotor kang et al 2018 various strategies of upstream flow control such as deploying auxiliary device have been exercised to improve the performance of the rotor kumar and sarkar 2016a mohammadi et al 2018 saad el deen et al 2020 the upstream flow was accelerated through the duct designed in thakur et al 2019 and the maximum power coefficient of the rotor was increased by 43 to enlarge the pressure gap between the upstream and downstream sides of the rotor a duct nozzle system was proposed in elbatran et al 2017 the upstream flow was guided toward the advancing blade while the returning blade was shielded by the duct consequently the maximum power coefficient was increased by 78 relative to that of the conventional rotor besides by installing a circular barrier upstream of the returning blade adverse flows were diverted away from the returning blade and accordingly negative torque on the returning blade was eliminated alizadeh et al 2020 the strategy of deploying a deflector upstream of the rotor proves effective for the improvement of the performance of the drag type hydrokinetic rotor kerikous and thévenin 2019 payambarpour et al 2020 essentially the deflector assumes the function of flow controller guo et al 2020 in general the deflector plate is installed upstream of the returning blade golecha et al 2011 meanwhile the deflector enables concentrated water streams to impact the advancing blade and therefore positive torque increases kailash et al 2012 the manner of installation is of importance for the application of the deflector the duct structure which enables the fixing of the deflector onto the inner wall of the duct is more suitable for such a combination this strategy has been implemented in the lift type hydrokinetic rotor produced by cape sharp tidal rajgor 2017 accordingly a yaw system is required to make the turbine unit adapt to flow direction from the flow aspect the deflector serves as a solid boundary and its geometry determines to a large extent the flow patterns kerikous and thévenin 2019 mosbahi et al 2019 hitherto the design of the auxiliary deflector relies overwhelmingly on experience although relevant studies have been performed no consensus has been reached about the optimal geometry and orientation of the deflector in this case a joint consideration of the near rotor flow characteristics and the performance of the rotor is of fundamental significance the present study aims to evaluate the performance of a drag type hydrokinetic rotor as an assistant deflector is deployed both the flow characteristics and the rotor performance are investigated an experimental work was performed to quantify the rotor performance and to describe the near rotor flow patterns instantaneous rotational speed and the output torque of the rotor were captured using a specifically developed measurement device flow patterns near the rotor were measured using the timed resolved particle image velocimetry tr piv the performance of the rotor and near rotor flow patterns were obtained and analyzed comprehensively effects of the setting angle of the deflector plate and the upstream water velocity on the rotor performance were inspected the conclusions are expected to supplement current knowledge about the drag type hydrokinetic rotor and to provide a sound reference to the improvement of the rotor performance 2 experimental setup 2 1 drag type hydrokinetic rotor a drag type hydrokinetic rotor was designed based on the conventional savonius rotor the cross sectional view and an image of the rotor are shown in fig 1 the blade is connected to the rotor hub via a straight segment and the length of the straight segment s is 48 mm the straight segment was argued to have a positive effect on improving the rotor performance kacprzak et al 2013 the diameter d and height h of the rotor are both 240 mm therefore the aspect ratio of the rotor h d is 1 0 according to the results obtained by kamoji et al 2009a the aspect ratio of 1 0 of the savonius rotor is responsible for the highest power coefficient the radius of the blade r is 60 0 mm the azimuthal angle θ is defined as the angle between the direction of the upstream flow and the line connecting the tip of the advancing blade and the center of the rotor in fig 1 a water flows from the right to the left with a constant velocity and the rotor rotates in counterclockwise direction the blade rotating along with the incident flow is termed advancing blade while the other one resisting the incident flow is the returning blade to conduct the visualization measurement the rotor is made of plexiglass as shown in fig 1 b the blade thickness is 12 0 mm which satisfies the requirement for the stiffness of the rotor 2 2 deflector plate for the rotor shown in fig 1 as it operated alone the maximum power coefficient was 0 276 which was obtained numerically during the design process this was then validated through comparisons with available performance data associated with similar rotors deployment of a deflector plate upstream of the rotor serves as an effective measure for the improvement of the rotor performance mohamed et al 2011 in the presented study a deflector plate was installed upstream of the returning blade as shown schematically in fig 2 it is noteworthy that certain flow direction is advised for the configuration illustrated in fig 2 therefore the ducted turbine structure is suitable for matching such a configuration as is in accordance with the scheme proposed in rajgor 2017 based on the results obtained in golecha et al 2011 the lower end of the plate is fixed and the horizontal and vertical distances between the lower end and the center of the rotor x and y are set to 160 0 mm and 175 0 mm respectively the length of the plate l is 100 0 mm the deflector angle β is defined as the angle between the deflector plate and the upstream flow direction here three deflector angles 30 45 and 60 are selected according to a preliminary numerical work the deflector angles smaller than 30 correspond to low power coefficients meanwhile the experimental observation indicated as the deflector angle exceeded 60 the flow immediately upstream of the rotor was unstable due to apparent vibration of the deflector plate 2 3 water loop the experiments were conducted in a water loop which is schematically shown in fig 3 in the test section the water velocity upstream of the deflector plate and the rotor u was adjusted through regulating the rotational speed of the pump during the experiment u was varied between 0 63 and 0 73 m s the flow rate of water was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter the length of the test section is 1200 0 mm and the cross section of the test section is measured by 410 0 410 0 mm as the model rotor is installed in the test section of a closed loop the blockage effect is expected to be considered in view of the gap between the rotor and the walls of the test section roy and saha 2014 quantitative methods have been proposed and compared for evaluating the effect of the blockage ratio on the performance of the lift type rotor ross and polagye 2020 regarding the presented configuration it was designed to mimic the ducted structure proposed in rajgor 2017 and the lateral walls of the test section were necessary for concentrating the upstream water furthermore the deflector plate is supposed to undermine the uniformity of velocity distributions in the upstream flow in this case the correction of the upstream flow velocity according to the blockage ratio is not appropriate moreover the test section remained being fully filled during the experiment and the disturbance of the free surface on the performance of the rotor was negligible to suppress turbulent fluctuations and foster uniform upstream flows at the inlet of the test section a flow stabilization segment was deployed upstream of the test section kailash et al 2012 the rotor is installed vertically in the test section as shown in fig 3 2 4 measurement of rotor performance a rotor performance measurement device was specifically designed as shown in fig 4 an integrated torque and rotational speed sensor is used to measure the torque on the rotor and the rotational speed of the rotor compared with the rope brake dynamometer talukdar et al 2018 the measurement device proposed here has a higher accuracy a magnetic powder brake is used to exert load on the rotor and the load regulation is accurate mosbahi et al 2019 the rotor the sensor and the magnetic powder brake are coaxial and connected through couplings therefore the frictional effect is minimized golecha et al 2011 the attainable data acquisition frequency is 10 000 hz which has not been accomplished in previous literature patel et al 2017 thiyagaraj et al 2016 the average power coefficient c p and average torque coefficient c t which are closely related to flow parameters are used to evaluate the rotor performance the ratio of the output power of the rotor to the ideal kinetic energy of the water received by the rotor is defined as the power coefficient 1 c p 2 m ω ρ a u 3 where m is the average torque produced in one period of rotation and can be calculated based on the instantaneous torque m i which is measured by the torque sensor at each azimuthal angle ω denotes the rotational speed of the rotor and is calculated based on the rotational speed n which is measured using the rotational speed sensor ρ denotes the density of water and a denotes the maximum rotor area that faces the upstream flow the average torque coefficient is defined as the ratio of the average torque produced by the rotor to the torque provided theoretically by the water flow 2 c t m m a 4 m ρ a d u 2 the instantaneous torque coefficient c ti is defined as the ratio of the instantaneous torque produced by the rotor to the theoretical torque 3 c t i m i m a 4 m i ρ a d u 2 the tip speed ratio is defined as the ratio of the tangential velocity at the rotor tip to upstream water velocity 4 t s r ω d 2 u based on eqs 1 4 the uncertainty of the rotor performance results mainly from the errors in the measurements of m i n and u during the experiment the instantaneous torque and the rotational speed were directly measured using the torque and rotational speed sensor with an accuracy of 1 0 the upstream velocity was calculated through dividing the volumetric flow rate with the cross sectional area of the test section the electromagnetic flowmeter has an accuracy of 0 2 according to the uncertainty analysis method proposed by moffat 1988 the uncertainties in the present experiment can be calculated through the following relationships the uncertainty for each quantity is thereby obtained 5 δ m i m i δ n n 1 0 6 δ q q 0 2 7 δ u u δ q q 2 0 2 8 δ t s r t s r δ ω ω 2 δ u u 2 δ n n 2 δ u u 2 1 02 9 δ m a m a 2 δ u u 2 0 28 10 δ c t c t δ c t i c t i δ m a m a 2 δ m i m i 2 1 04 11 δ c p c p δ c t c t 2 δ t s r t s r 2 1 46 2 5 tr piv system a lavision tr piv system was used to measure near rotor velocity distributions as shown in fig 5 a dm30 high frequency pulsed laser with the maximum energy of 70 mj was used as the light source a photron fastcam ux100 high speed cmos camera with the maximum resolution of 1280 1024 pixels was used to record the motion of seeding particles the davis software embedded in the control module of the tr piv system was used to synchronize laser emitting with the exposure of the camera the camera was used jointly by a nikon af nikkor 50 mm f 1 4d lens meanwhile another cylindrical lens was used to transform the point laser into a thin light sheet hollow glass beads with a mean diameter of 20 μm served as seeding particles the laser sheet and the camera were not perpendicular due the limited space below the test section therefore a mirror which is inclined by 45 was placed under the test section such an indirect manner ensures that the monitored plane is perpendicular to the shooting direction of the camera detailed optical layout is shown in fig 5 a a cross correlation algorithm was adopted to process the data in each interrogation window and the overlap between two neighboring interrogation windows was 75 the double frame and double exposure mode was applied and the sampling frequency was set to 2000 hz for each experimental condition the sampling time was set to 5 s to ensure the rotor can rotate at least 720 at any rotational speed for the tr piv experiment the particle displacement in two successively captured images was larger than the diameter of the seeding particle but smaller than 1 4 the width of the interrogation window therefore the time interval between two consecutive laser pulses varied with the upstream velocity uncertainty of velocity measurement mainly depends on velocity magnitude and the experimental rig wernet 2000 according to the specifications of the tr piv system the maximum uncertainty of this system is less than 0 1 other factors such as physical properties of the seeding particles and the rotation of the rotor and the circulation in the loop also affect the measurement accuracy uncertainties caused by these factors were controlled in the present experiment eventually overall uncertainty of the velocity measurement was less than 2 major operational parameters of the piv system are summarized in table 1 3 performance analysis the power coefficient and the torque coefficient of the rotor could be calculated based on the experimental data among the quantities that influence the rotor performance the deflector angle and upstream water velocity are predominant which has been substantiated through experimental observations and calculations therefore present emphasis was placed on detailing the effects of the two quantities on rotor performance 3 1 effects of the deflector angle at u 0 73 m s variations of the average power coefficient with the tip speed ratio at the three deflector angles are plotted in fig 6 the average power coefficient increases remarkably with the deflector angle at β 30 the maximum c p is 0 186 which is 13 4 higher than that of the rotor operating alone zhang et al 2019a normally the maximum power coefficients of the hydrokinetic rotor with auxiliary device range from 0 12 to 0 25 golecha et al 2011 mosbahi et al 2019 payambarpour et al 2020 by adding a barrier with quadrant surface upstream of the returning blade the maximum average power coefficient can reach 0 29 alizadeh et al 2020 the maximum average power coefficient of the rotor increased to 0 35 with the assistance of two deflector plates kailash et al 2012 the maximum average power coefficient of the rotor obtained here is higher than those previously reported the power coefficient and the torque coefficient are related via the torque produced on the rotor as evidenced by eqs 1 and 2 at u 0 73 m s variations of the torque coefficient with the tip speed ratio are plotted in fig 7 it is seen that the torque coefficient decreases continuously with increasing tip speed ratio furthermore the torque on the rotor is sensitive to the variation of the deflector angle it is indicated in fig 7 that the increase in the deflector angle leads to continuous increase of the torque coefficient the maximum torque coefficients of the rotor at β 30 45 and 60 are 0 29 0 55 and 0 60 respectively in fig 8 at the three deflector angles instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at optimal tsrs are plotted here the rotor has two blades therefore the instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor varies with the period of 180 within one rotational cycle at β 30 the curve plotted in fig 8 a exhibits a butterfly shape which is shared by the other two cases implying the fluctuations of the torque coefficient with the rotation of the rotor meanwhile it is evidenced that the value of the optimal tip speed ratio varies with the deflector angle furthermore based on a comparison of the magnitudes of the torque coefficient between fig 8 a b and c it is demonstrated that as the deflector angle increases from 30 to 60 the torque performance of the rotor is improved remarkably 3 2 effects of upstream velocity the upstream velocity influences the rotor performance significantly 6 variations of the power and torque coefficients with the tip speed ratio at different upstream velocities and β 60 are plotted separately in figs 9 and 10 the power coefficient of the rotor increases with the upstream velocity this is consistent with the results reported in hayashi et al 2005 kamoji et al 2008a b the maximum power coefficients of the rotor at u 0 63 m s 0 68 m s and 0 73 m s are 0 378 0 409 and 0 463 respectively as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum power coefficient is increased by about 22 8 meanwhile as u varies the tip speed ratio corresponding to the maximum power coefficient remains invariant it was argued in kamoji et al 2009b that for the helical savonius rotor the tip speed ratio corresponding to the maximum power coefficient increases with the upstream velocity it is indicated in fig 10 that at different upstream velocities the torque coefficient of the rotor decreases gradually with increasing tsr the maximum torque coefficient is reached at about tsr 0 65 and at the three upstream velocities the maximum torque coefficients are 0 512 0 539 and 0 601 respectively quantitatively the maximum torque coefficient is increased by 17 4 as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at different upstream velocities and optimal tsrs are plotted in fig 11 at different upstream velocities the distributions of instantaneous torque coefficients in one period of rotation are similar from θ 0 the torque coefficient increases gradually and reaches its maximum at about θ 60 after that the torque coefficient decreases with the rotation of the rotor and the minimum is attained at about θ 120 then the torque coefficient increases again until θ 180 the maximum instantaneous torque coefficients of the rotor at the three upstream velocities are 0 448 0 512 and 0 589 respectively as u increases from 0 63 m s to 0 73 m s the maximum instantaneous torque coefficient is increased by about 31 5 the above analyses demonstrate that the performance of the rotor depends considerably on the operating condition to provide an overview of the rotor performance under the operating conditions considered the maximum average power coefficient and corresponding torque coefficient of the rotor are listed in table 2 accordingly combinations of the deflector angle and the upstream velocity are shown as well 4 flow characteristics essentially the performance of the rotor is closely related to the near rotor flow the integral of static pressure over the blade surface yields the hydraulic force acting on the rotor nonetheless the rotor performance and the near rotor flow respond non synchronously to variations of the operation parameters the rotor performance indices such as the power coefficient depend on multiple macroscopic variables in comparison the near rotor flow is subject to the bounding effect of the rotor blades which varies constantly as the rotor rotates 4 1 effects of deflector angle at u 0 73 m s instantaneous flow patterns near the rotor at five rotor setting angles and β 30 are shown in fig 12 due to the introduction of the deflector plate the upstream flow is accelerated near the tip of the plate and a high velocity region is formed downstream of the plate meanwhile a large scale vortex is seen immediately downstream of the plate at θ 0 as indicated in fig 12 a owing to the rotation of the rotor the upstream flow changes its direction and migrates towards the concave side of the advancing blade which has a positive effect on the rotation of the rotor the coanda effect is evidenced as water flows through a solid wall with small curvature in fig 12 a at the convex side of the advancing blade water moves along the blade surface and then flows into the space confined by the concave side of the returning blade yielding the coanda like flow this phenomenon is in accordance with the results visualized in nakajima et al 2008 and the influence of the coanda like flow on the rotor performance is significant fujisawa 1992 as the rotor rotates the rotor area that faces the upstream flow is gradually enlarged at θ 36 as indicated in fig 12 b the water collecting capability of the advancing blade is improved and more water flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade which stimulates the rotor to produce higher positive torque however under the guidance of the deflector plate more high velocity flow impinges on the returning blade and hinders the rotation of the rotor this explains why instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor decreases slightly as θ increases from 18 to 47 as indicated in fig 8 a meanwhile as θ increases the coanda like flow at the convex side of the advancing blade decays gradually as agrees with that reported in fujisawa 1996 flow separation arises in fig 12 d and e as θ increases velocity of the upstream flow that migrates toward the advancing blade increases as well this promotes the generation of positive torque and instantaneous torque coefficient increases accordingly at θ 108 the area of the advancing blade that faces the upstream flow is reduced as shown in fig 12 d meanwhile the gap between the deflector plate and the returning blade shrinks and more water flows directly toward the returning blade therefore instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor decreases it is noteworthy that the coanda like flow is produced at the convex sides of both the advancing and returning blades meanwhile two distinct vortices are trapped at the concave sides of the two blades as the azimuthal angle increases further the blade area that faces the upstream flow decreases for both the advancing and returning blades it is observed that a high velocity zone is attached to the convex side of the returning blade and the static pressure is correspondingly low with the coanda like flow velocity of the portion of water flowing toward the concave side of the advancing blade increases as illustrated in fig 12 e on the other hand the gap between the returning blade and the deflector plate is enlarged high velocity water passes through the gap instead of impinging on the returning blade consequently negative torque produced on the returning blade is reduced therefore the instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor at θ 144 is larger than that at θ 108 as the rotor rotates water is accelerated near the rotor and downstream of the rotor these differ explicitly from the flow patterns near a stationary rotor which is accompanied by large scale vortices and low velocity region zhang et al 2019a at β 45 and 60 instantaneous flow patterns near the rotor at optimal tsrs are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively the high velocity region at the tip of the plate extends and velocity in this region decreases the large scale vortex downstream of the plate expands as the deflector angle increases at θ 0 high velocity water flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade velocity at the concave side of the advancing blade increases with the deflector angle as shown in figs 13 a and 12 a meanwhile the coanda like flow near the convex side of the advancing blade is strengthened with increasing deflector angle accordingly the resistance to the rotation of the rotor decreases due to reduced static pressure at the convex side of the advancing blade this facilitates an increase of the torque coefficient as indicated in fig 14 a a water stream with distinctly high velocity impinges onto the concave side of the returning blade at θ 36 and 72 more water streams with high velocities flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade as β increases particularly at β 60 as demonstrated in fig 14 b and c water with high velocity flows perpendicularly toward the concave side of the advancing blade consequently the torque produced by the advancing blade increases considerably furthermore the portion of water that otherwise impacts the returning blade is blocked by the deflector plate at large deflector angles the larger the deflector angle the less water flows toward the returning blade therefore negative torque produced on the returning blade varies inversely with the deflector angle accordingly the torque coefficient of the rotor reaches the highest at β 60 as evidenced in fig 8 at θ 108 a comparison of flow patterns between the cases with different deflector angles indicates that the low velocity area downstream of the rotor is enlarged as the deflector angle increases meanwhile more water with high velocity flows toward the concave side of the advancing blade eventually at θ 108 instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor still increases with the deflector angle at θ 144 the gap between the rotor and the deflector plate narrows with increasing deflector angle more water flows toward the convex side of the returning blade and a high velocity zone is formed along the surface of the returning blade velocity in this zone increases with the deflector angle based on the relationship between velocity and the static pressure the static pressure near the convex side of the returning blade decreases during this process to summarize as the deflector angle increases the coanda like flow is strengthened and the resultant decrease in the static pressure is beneficial for reducing the resistance to the rotation of the rotor 4 2 effects of upstream velocity at θ 0 and 72 flow patterns at different upstream velocities and corresponding optimal tsrs are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively at θ 0 the coanda like flow near the convex side of the advancing blade is gradually strengthened with increasing upstream velocity as indicated in fig 15 moreover it is seen in fig 15 c that a water stream with high velocity flows toward the concave side of the returning blade meanwhile the high velocity region attached to the convex surface of the advancing blade expands toward the blade tip as the upstream water velocity increases therefore low pressure effect at the convex side of the advancing blade is enhanced and positive torque produced on the advancing blade increases this promotes the increase of the power coefficient of the rotor the high velocity region at the tip of the deflector plate also expands with increasing upstream velocity as shown in fig 16 at u 0 73 m s the high velocity band initiated from the upstream side of the deflector plate arrives at the concave side of the advancing blade as shown in fig 16 c velocity at the concave side of the advancing blade increases remarkably and more kinetic energy of flowing water is expected to be converted by the advancing blade contributing to the increase of the power coefficient of the rotor 5 conclusions an experimental work was conducted to evaluate the operational performance of the hydrokinetic rotor assisted by a deflector plate the torque coefficient the rotational speed and near rotor flow velocity distributions were obtained and analyzed comprehensively it is evidenced that instantaneous torque coefficient of the rotor increases with the deflector angle at a deflector angle of 60 the maximum power coefficient of the rotor reaches 0 463 which is higher than previously obtained results essentially the deflector plate not only prevents the upstream flow from impacting the returning blade but also guides the upstream water flow toward the concave side of the advancing blade this phenomenon is intensified as the deflector angle increases from 30 to 60 the coanda like flow arising at the convex side of the advancing blade is beneficial for the improvement of the rotor performance and is strengthened with increasing deflector angle furthermore as the upstream water velocity increases the guiding effect of the deflector plate is enhanced which leads to a remarkable increase in the power coefficient of the rotor credit authorship contribution statement yongchao zhang investigation data curation writing original draft

20246,to further reveal vibration interference of a multicylinder system the vortex induced vibration of two degree of freedom upstream and downstream diamond cylinders with a center to center distance l 5b b is characteristic length of cylinders and a mass ratio of the oscillator fixed at m 2 was numerically investigated the influences of the reynolds number re 40 200 and the reduced

with increasing re numbers the lock in region for the upstream cylinder remains almost constant while that of the downstream cylinder increases unlike the low re numbers re 40 80 the trajectory of the upstream cylinder at high re numbers is a closed ring shape rather than a figure 8 within the lock in region the downstream cylinder is dominated by transverse vibration in most cases of re 40 while it exhibits a significant vibration in both the streamwise and transverse directions at re 80 200 additionally the wake of twin cylinders at re 40 and u r 3 4 displays a steady state with increasing

vibration viv diagonal arrangement dynamic response fluid structure interaction fsi wake mode 1 introduction the interaction between bluff bodies and fluids has attracted the ongoing attention from the research community due to its practical engineering significance and has been widely encountered in marine engineering civil engineering and mechanical engineering in particular the vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures is a rather typical phenomenon caused by the interaction between a bluff body and fluid it has conflicting roles in engineering one as a continuous source of structural energy harvest and the other as an undesirable phenomenon that can lead to fatigue failure zhao et al 2019 vivace vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy was a pioneering attempt for extracting ocean current energy made by bernitsas et al 2008 they designed a viv based energy harvester to successfully make ocean river current energy a more accessible and economically viable resource narendran et al 2016 carried out a detailed parametric investigation over a wide range of system parameters and proposed an analytical model to predict the mechanical efficiency of the oscillating system based on the viv a novel wind harvesting design which consisted of a cruciform cantilever beam with three bluff bodies was presented by qin et al 2019 they also found that the proposed configuration could give a large output within the wind speed between 2 0 m s to 7 0 m s however the collapse of the original tacoma narrows bridge in 1940 reminds scholars of the continuous analysis of fluid structure interaction therefore controlling or even reducing the viv of cylindrical structures has been a significant topic over decades of analysis bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 zhao 2015 note that compared with a single cylinder the flow fields of a multicylinder system will interfere with each other resulting in more complex dynamic responses flow induced force and flow field characteristics it is necessary to study the viv of the twin cylinder system the most straightforward multicylinder system bailey and kwok 1985 païdoussis et al 2011 to further reveal its internal relationship scholars have analyzed this system by selecting appropriate cylinder shapes such as circles and squares or altering the spacing between cylinders zhao et al 2015 in addition blevins 1990 reported that several critical nondimensional parameters such as the mass ratio m reynolds number re reduced velocity u r and damping ratio ξ could directly affect the characteristics of viv the ranges of these parameters and other dimensional variables achieved for the present study are given in table 1 according to the published literature zhao et al 2015 unlike a circular cylinder with smooth contour the existence of sharp corners on a square cylinder significantly changes the flow characteristics this is recognized as a significant factor affecting the flow separation however note that compared with the many pieces of research works on the viv of a circular cylinder there are relatively few on a square cylinder bearman et al 1987 carried out wind tunnel experiments and found that the separation of the shear layer from the surface of a single square cylinder led to the formation of a wake vortex and the transverse viv the viv of a two degree of freedom 2 dof square cylinder at low re 100 was numerically examined perhaps for the first time by su et al 2007 with the change in the natural frequency of the cylinder the phenomena of lock in and beat were successfully indicated zhao et al 2010 conducted an experimental investigation on the transverse viv of a square cylinder at two different angles of incidence to the free stream α 0 square cylinder and 45 diamond cylinder in a water tunnel they found that the expected galloping phenomenon occurred with the square cylinder while the viv response of the diamond cylinder was similar to that of the circular cylinder zhao et al 2013 carried out a numerical simulation to study the viv of a 2 dof square cylinder at three values of α α 0 22 5 and 45 at re 100 and a low mass ratio of m 3 the results showed that the transverse amplitude of a diamond cylinder at α 45 was more extensive than that at α 0 and that the lock in region at α 45 was wider in addition the wake mode of 2s appeared only at α 0 while the p s and 2p modes were obtained at α 45 leontini and thompson 2013 studied the influence of the corner sharpness r c r c 2 r d where r is the corner radius and d is the distance between the front and back corners on the dynamic responses and wake modes of a single diamond cylinder at re 200 and m 2 they concluded that for r c 0 15 the viv characteristics of the single diamond cylinder were similar to those of the single circular cylinder regarding r c 0 15 the wake mode of p s was also captured furthermore sourav et al 2019 simulated the viv of a single diamond cylinder with a higher mass ratio m 10 they found that the maximum values of the mean drag coefficient c d mean and the root mean square rms lift coefficient c l rms of a single diamond cylinder were larger than those of a single circular or square cylinder and that the reduced velocity was lower when the lock in phenomenon began to appear unlike the vibration of a single cylinder caused by its own vortex shedding the vibration of a cylinder in a twin cylinder system is not only affected by itself but also depends on the vortex generated by the adjacent cylinder therefore in the past few decades scholars have devoted themselves to analyzing the viv of two square cylinders via experiments and numerical simulations as seen in table 2 in which the experiments have mainly focused on high reynolds number cases in contrast numerical simulations have been performed at low reynolds numbers by changing the center to center distances mithun and tiwari 2014 numerically studied the influence of the transverse vibration frequency on the flow characteristics and flow fields of two tandem square cylinders oscillating transversely in phase at re 100 patil and tiwari 2009 and more et al 2015 analyzed the interference effect of a fixed downstream square cylinder on the vibration of the upstream cylinder zhao et al 2015 and jaiman et al 2016 studied the viv of two tandem square cylinders fixed upstream cylinder and oscillating downstream cylinder at a spacing ratio of l 4b and found that the lock in phenomenon of the downstream cylinder was not apparent bhatt and alam 2018 conducted a numerical simulation of the viv of two tandem square cylinders with the spacing ratios of l 2b and 4b at re 100 and 200 the upstream cylinder was stationary while the downstream cylinder was allowed to vibrate in only the transverse direction they pointed out that the gap flow had a significant impact on the vibration response of the downstream cylinder nepali et al 2020 explored the 2 dof viv of two square cylinders in the tandem arrangement at l 5b and re 40 200 in contrast with previous conclusions drawn by han et al 2018 they found that when the upstream square cylinder could freely vibrate the lock in region of the downstream square cylinder was much wider and that the wake mode was more complex qiu et al 2021 numerically investigated the 2 dof viv of two tandem square cylinders and focused on the spacing effect on flow characteristics nevertheless the basic dynamic characteristics of two tandem square cylinders are still inadequate on the one hand compared with a 1 dof or fixed single cylinder the effects of reynolds numbers on vibration responses flow induced forces and flow patterns are more complex however most of the studies restrict the dofs of the upstream or downstream square cylinder for example a single cylinder is fixed or allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction in the current paper twin tandem cylinders are allowed to vibrate freely in both the transverse and streamwise directions on the other hand most of the tandem square cylinders appear in the form of horizontal arrangements and there has been less research lately analyzing twin square cylinders in diagonal arrangements two square cylinders inclined at 45 i e two diamond cylinders as shown in fig 1 the main objective of the present work is to systematically study the effects of low reynolds numbers re 40 200 variation gradient δre 40 and reduced velocities u r 3 12 on the viv characteristics flow induced forces and flow field of twin tandem diamond cylinders and the fluid structure interaction fsi mechanism is further discussed the outline of the rest of the present paper is as follows the fluid governing equations and solid movement equations are briefly presented in section 2 section 3 describes the setup of the problem and model validation is carried out the detailed results are presented in section 4 involving dynamic responses and wake modes section 5 concludes the paper with several remarks based on the present work 2 governing equations the viv analysis of two tandem diamond cylinders involves governing equations in the fluid domain and solid domain for two dimensional incompressible laminar flow around two cylinders the governing equations of fluid flow are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i υ 2 u i x i x j where u i represents the velocity components and x i represents the cartesian coordinates ν is kinematic viscosity of the fluid p is the fluid pressure and ρ is the fluid density considering that both the upstream and downstream cylinders can vibrate freely in the transverse and streamwise directions the corresponding rigid body motion of a single cylinder is governed by the following vibration differential equations 3 x 2 π u r 2 x c d m 4 y 2 π u r 2 y c l m where x x and x are the instantaneous displacement velocity and acceleration in the streamwise direction respectively and y y and y are the instantaneous displacement velocity and acceleration in the transverse direction respectively notably the structural damping ratio ξ is set to its lower limit of zero in order to encourage high amplitude vibrations c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients which are defined as follows 5 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 b 6 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 b where f d and f l are the drag and lift forces acting on the unit length of the diamond cylinder respectively besides for follow up analysis the mean drag lift coefficients c d mean c l mean and root mean square rms lift coefficient c l rms are defined as follows 7 c d m e a n i 1 n c d i n 8 c l m e a n i 1 n c l i n 9 c l r m s i 1 n c l i c l m e a n 2 n 1 where n denotes sampling numbers the numerical simulations are performed with the ansys fluent 16 0 solver for computational fluid dynamics for the fluid domain the governing equations are solved via the finite volume method the pressure velocity coupling is obtained via the simplec algorithm and the second order accurate discrete format is used in equation 2 for the solid domain the fourth order runge kutta method used in equations 3 and 4 moreover the weakly coupling algorithm is employed to calculate the viv of two diamond cylinders in this paper the implementation process can be divided into the following steps ⅰ solve the fluid governing equations via the fluent solver obtain the velocity and pressure field of the fluid domain at each time step and reduce the fluid forces acting on the surface of the diamond cylinders ⅱ apply the fluid forces on the oscillating diamond cylinders solve the differential equations of diamond cylinders and achieve dynamic responses in both streamwise and transverse directions ⅲ transfer the vibration velocities of the oscillating cylinders via dynamic grid technology update the position of each grid node and provide a new mesh for the flow field calculation ⅳ return to step ⅰ to calculate the vibration responses of the diamond cylinder in the next time step as mentioned above the dynamic responses at each time step are obtained cyclically and the fsi algorithm is ultimately realized 3 problem description 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions fig 2 shows the geometric configuration and boundary conditions the computational model of the twin oscillating diamond cylinders is simplified as a mass spring damper system where u is the uniform velocity cy1 and cy2 represent the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the whole domain is defined as ω 30b 50b 25b 25b and the midpoint of the centers of the two cylinders is located at coordinate origin o 0 0 that is the distances from o to the inlet and upper and lower boundaries are all 25b while the distances to the inlet and outlet boundaries are 30b and 50b respectively no slip walls are applied on the surfaces of the diamond cylinders u x v y the uniform flow under free stream velocity conditions is prescribed at the inlet as u u v 0 along the outlet boundary conditions regarding the free flow are used u x 0 and v x 0 the symmetrical lateral boundaries have conditions of u y 0 and v 0 fig 3 shows the grid scheme of the twin diamond cylinders in the whole domain to ensure the calculation accuracy a structured grid is arranged in the near wall of the cylinders an unstructured grid is employed in the square frame area in contrast to the grids in the rest of the regions due to the complexity of the flow around diamond cylinders mesh refinement is performed near the cylinders walls additionally to reduce the number of actual calculations only the square frame area is defined as a dynamic grid area 3 2 verification and validation to assess the convergence of the above calculation model we simulate the viv of a single diamond cylinder at re 100 and m 3 considering the influence of the grid numbers and nondimensional time on the final calculation results the reduced velocity of u r 11 is selected for the grid test to highlight the maximum transverse amplitude the transverse amplitude a y y max y min the streamwise amplitude a x x max x min the transverse frequency ratio f y f n and the streamwise frequency ratio f x f n are compared for different operating cases y max and y min denote the maximum and minimum values of the transverse displacement respectively and x max and x min denote the maximum and minimum values of the streamwise displacement respectively f y and f x represent the transverse vibration frequency and the streamwise vibration frequency respectively table 3 shows that with increasing grid numbers and decreasing nondimensional time step the results tend to converge which shows that the calculation model in this paper has high reliability taking the calculation efficiency and accuracy into the overall consideration we use the case of a2 for the subsequent analysis furthermore the viv of a single diamond cylinder at re 100 mass ratio m 3 and u r 2 16 is calculated by using the grid scheme of a2 and the calculated results containing a y a x f y and f x are compared with the existing reference of zhao et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 4 our results are in good agreement with the published results hence suggesting that the simulation method and parameters in this paper have outstanding reliability for further analysis the oscillating trajectory time history and power spectrum of displacement and flow induced forces within and outside the lock in region are also shown in the fig 4 within the lock in region the main frequencies of the drag coefficient and displacement in the streamwise direction are not the same reasons accounting for it is that the drag coefficient has a frequency close to 1 which is more likely to promote the vibration of single diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction finally the single diamond cylinder basically displays a single frequency vibration in the streamwise direction with the passage of time for the transverse direction the main frequency of the lift coefficient is the same as that of the vibration both are the lock in frequency which results in the strong periodicity of the transverse displacement time history in addition within the lock in region the main vibration frequency of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction is equal to that in the transverse direction the phase angle between the transverse displacement and the streamwise displacement is about 90 which leads to the oscillating trajectory of a closed ring shape interestingly the trajectory is symmetrical about the transverse direction different from the case within the lock in region the drag and lift coefficient of the square cylinder outside the region only displays single frequency which also results in the single frequency vibration in both directions at this time the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is twice that in the transverse direction which causes the phase of the displacement to change with time and the oscillating trajectory of a single square cylinder displays a figure of 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 amplitude and frequency fig 5 outlines the nondimensional amplitudes a x b and a y b and transverse vibration frequency ratio f y f n of the two cylinders with the reduced velocity at different reynolds numbers according to zhao et al 2013 the vibration frequency of the cylinder is locked on to the natural frequency in the lock in region when the lock in phenomenon occurs the frequency ratio of diamond cylinders does not change with increasing reduced velocity generally when the reynolds number is low the streamwise amplitude is minimal as the reynolds number increases the streamwise vibrations of the two cylinders are obvious of which the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is larger based on the assumed criteria of the vibration frequency i e 20 of f n the range of the lock in region of the upstream diamond cylinder is basically unchanged in the transverse direction at re 40 and 80 the lock in region of the upstream cylinder is u r 5 11 and 4 8 respectively for other cases re 120 200 the lock in regions are all u r 4 7 the ratio f y f n is about 1 0 accompanied by large transverse vibration when re 80 200 and u r 7 the frequency ratio of the upstream diamond cylinder increases linearly with increasing reduced velocity which is not within the lock in region under the wake interference of the upstream diamond cylinder the downstream square cylinder does not change with increasing reduced velocity and the ratio is about 1 0 so the lock in phenomenon still occurs the lock in region of the downstream cylinder is narrowest at re 40 and increases with increasing reynolds numbers the lock in regions of the downstream cylinder at different reynolds numbers are u r 5 9 re 40 u r 4 7 and 10 12 re 80 u r 4 7 and 9 12 re 120 u r 4 12 re 160 and u r 3 12 re 200 notably the lock in ranges of the two diamond cylinders are not the same also the reynolds number is more sensitive to the transverse amplitude and lock in region of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders the maximum transverse amplitude first increases and then decreases with increasing reynolds numbers and the maximum value is a y max 1 07 at re 80 4 2 oscillating trajectories to further reveal the vibration characteristics of the twin diamond cylinders figs 6 7 summarize the trends of the oscillating trajectories of the upstream and downstream cylinders with the reduced velocity at different reynolds numbers in which the streamwise coordinate of the oscillating trajectory is amplified to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of trajectories the power spectra in the transverse and streamwise directions corresponding to the typical trajectories are also given it can be concluded that when the reynolds number is low re 40 and 80 the trajectory of the upstream cylinder is a figure 8 both within and outside the lock in region which is attributed to the dominant frequency ratio f x f y 2 of the upstream diamond cylinders the frequency ratio of the upstream cylinder in the lock in region is f x f y 1 and the oscillating trajectory becomes a closed ring shape in which that of re 200 is relatively disordered this phenomenon is only caused by obvious multifrequency vibration of the upstream diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction for the downstream cylinder generally speaking due to the influence of the wake of the upstream cylinder the trajectories of the downstream cylinder at other reynolds numbers are disordered except for the cases of re 40 and 80 4 3 flow induced forces figs 8 9 show the mean drag coefficient and the mean streamwise displacement of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders respectively it can be concluded the mean drag coefficient of upstream diamond cylinder will increase abruptly at the outset of the lock in region such as cases of re 40 u r 5 and re 120 u r 4 the strong vortex shedding from the leeward side of the upstream cylinder increases the drag force of the upstream cylinder which is shown in fig 14 below for details with increasing reduced velocity the strength of the vortex on the leeward side of the upstream cylinder decreases and then the mean drag coefficient of it decreases as well due to the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is generally lower than that of the upstream cylinder and reaches the minimum value at u r 4 the wake vortex of the upstream cylinder passes through both sides of the downstream cylinder and does not produce impact force in the streamwise direction like other cases and the drag coefficient is finally further weakened the main factors affecting the mean displacement in the streamwise direction are the mean drag coefficient and the stiffness coefficient k of the cylinder that is the stiffness of spring considering that the upstream diamond cylinder is within the lock in region although the mean drag coefficients at each reynolds number are different at this time the corresponding reduced velocities are not high that is to say the large stiffness of the diamond cylinder leads to a small position deviation of the upstream cylinder in the streamwise direction also the mean displacement of the upstream cylinder in the streamwise direction at each reynolds number is basically the same as the stiffness of the diamond cylinder decreases the reduced velocity increases and the mean displacement in the streamwise direction increases as well in addition the decrease of the stiffness also makes the drag coefficient more vulnerable to the mean streamwise displacement due to this the trend of the mean streamwise displacement is consistent with that of the mean drag coefficient at the same velocity similarly for the downstream diamond cylinder at a high reduced velocity the mean drag coefficient decreases with the increase of reynolds number resulting in the same trend of downstream square cylinder s displacement the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is the strongest at re 200 fig 10 shows the root mean square rms lift coefficient of two diamond cylinders the rms lift force of the upstream cylinder is considerable within the lock in region at each reynolds number and increases with increasing reynolds numbers at reduced velocities outside the lock in region for the downstream cylinder except for the case of re 40 the downstream cylinder at other reynolds numbers has a large rms lift force at these reduced velocities combined with fig 5 it can be seen that when the upstream diamond cylinder displays the maximum transverse amplitude at each reynolds number the corresponding rms lift force is minimal such as in the cases of re 80 and re 160 u r 7 the sizeable transverse amplitude is attributed to the transverse frequency ratio f y f n 1 the downstream cylinder except for the case of re 40 displays a large rms lift force when the maximum transverse amplitude occurs at other reynolds numbers fig 11 shows the variation in the mean lift coefficient of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders based on the reduced velocity the mean lift coefficient of the upstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers is basically zero while this is not the case at relatively high reynolds numbers such as re 120 at u r 5 re 160 at u r 4 and re 200 at u r 4 at relatively high reynolds numbers the mean lift force of the downstream cylinder deviates from zero but the deviation level is less than that of the upstream cylinder the reasons for the deviation of the mean lift coefficient for two cylinders are explained in combination with the flow field 4 4 force and displacement time history fig 12 and 13 show the displacement time history and the power spectrum response of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders at typical reynolds numbers the lift force and displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder at each reynolds number exhibit single frequency vibration in which the lift force and transverse displacement exhibit in phase vibration with time within the lock in region as shown in fig 12 a c and e and out of phase vibration outside the lock in region as shown in fig 12 b d and f for the downstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers the lift force and displacement are basically in phase single frequency vibrations within and outside the lock in region as shown in fig 13 a and b at relatively high reynolds numbers the power spectrum of the lift force of the downstream cylinder displays a multifrequency phenomenon resulting in multifrequency vibration of its transverse displacement which eventually leads to the occurrence of the beat phenomenon at this time the lift force and displacement of the downstream cylinder increase with time as shown in fig 13 d e and g 4 5 flow pattern 4 5 1 wake mode fig 14 summarizes the evolution process of wake modes with the reynolds number and reduced velocity the classification of the wake modes is based on the wake of the downstream diamond cylinder mode i is the steady state mode ii is the 2s mode in which the vortices merge in the near wake of the downstream cylinder mode iii is the two row vertex mode mode iv is the typical 2s mode mode v is the 2s mode where during one vibration cycle three vortices fall off from the near wake of the upstream cylinder and merge in the near wake of the downstream cylinder mode vi is the 2s mode where the downstream wake is very complex and changes continuously with time the wake modes at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 are regular and four kinds of wake types occur mode i mode ii mode iii and mode iv in which mode i does not occur at re 80 compared with low reynolds numbers mode ii mode iii and mode iv still occur at relatively high reynolds numbers but are more disordered furthermore mode v appears at low reduced velocity and mode vi appears at high reduced velocity it can be concluded that when the downstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers displays a significant transverse vibration the lift force exhibits multiple amplitudes in one cycle and the corresponding wake is mode iv when the lock in region appears on the upstream diamond cylinder at high reynolds numbers the mean lift value deviates to zero and the corresponding wake is mode v the downstream diamond cylinder at high reynolds number shows the beat phenomenon where the wake is mode vi the above phenomena are further discussed in combination with the instantaneous vorticity field displacement and lift time history of the twin diamond cylinders 4 5 2 instantaneous vorticity field 1 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅳ fig 15 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode iv and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 40 and u r 10 as an example it can be observed that in the process of the downstream cylinder moving upward from the equilibrium position t1 vortex a falling off from the upstream diamond cylinder reaches the lower side of the downstream diamond cylinder and exerts a suction force on the downstream cylinder resulting in a larger amplitude of lift force for the downstream cylinder when approaching the maximum positive displacement t2 wake vortex b of the upstream cylinder impacts the surface of the downstream cylinder leading to the reduced amplitude of the lift force for the downstream cylinder as time further passes t3 the impact effect of vortex c disappears vortex a merges with the vortex of the downstream cylinder and falls off from the surface of the downstream cylinder causing the lift force amplitude to increase again 2 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅴ fig 16 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode iv and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 160 and u r 5 as an example vortexes b1 and b2 successively fall off during the upward movement of the upstream diamond cylinder and over time t3 vortex b3 falls off during the downward movement of the upstream cylinder the number of vortices shedding from both sides and the strength of the vortices are fairly different which can explain the phenomenon of the mean lift force being nonzero and the absolute values of the maximum and minimum displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder in the transverse direction are not equal additionally vortex b1 simultaneously passes through both sides of the downstream cylinder as vortexes a1 and a2 which fell off of the upstream cylinder in the previous vibration period resulting in a small lift force and transverse amplitude of the downstream cylinder 3 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅵ fig 17 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode ⅵ and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 200 and u r 9 as an example when the amplitude of the displacement is large vortex a in the wake of the upstream diamond cylinder and vortex b falling off of the downstream diamond cylinder merge with each other during the upward movement of the downstream cylinder t1 when the downstream cylinder approaches the maximum positive displacement t2 vortex b falling off of the upstream cylinder collides with the lower side of the downstream cylinder and further produces an upward force resulting in the sizeable transverse vibration of the downstream cylinder for the case of a small displacement amplitude it can be observed that when downstream cylinder vi moves upward t3 t4 the vortex of the upstream cylinder impacts the upper side of the downstream cylinder and produces a downward force on it thus restraining the vibration of the downstream cylinder 4 6 comparison with the viv of twin tandem square cylinders to compare the viv characteristics of twin cylinders table 4 gives the research results of the downstream square cylinder nepali et al 2020 and the downstream diamond cylinder of this paper in which the spacing and reynolds number adopted in the published literature are the same as those in this paper in general the viv characteristics of diamond and square cylinder are quite different from each other at the same reynolds number the maximum amplitude of the diamond cylinder in the transverse direction is greater than that of the square cylinder and the lock in region of the diamond cylinder is much wider the maximum streamwise amplitude is less than that of square cylinder and the corresponding reduced velocity is also higher in addition the wake with the maximum transverse amplitude of the diamond cylinder is mostly two row vertex mode while the square cylinder displays 2s mode with increasing reynolds number the transverse amplitude and lock in region of square cylinder decrease while the maximum transverse amplitude of diamond cylinder decreases less and the lock in region accordingly increases like the square cylinder the maximum amplitude of the diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction increases with the increase of reynolds number 5 conclusion the change in the arrangement and the increase in the dofs make the viv problem more complicated a numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the viv of twin tandem diamond cylinders with spacing ratio l 5b at low reynolds numbers of re 40 200 considering that both the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders can freely vibrate i e they have 2 dofs the effects of the reynolds number and reduced velocity on the vibration responses flow induced forces and flow characteristics of the twin cylinders are studied the fsi mechanism of the twin diamond cylinders is further discussed based on the instantaneous vorticity displacement and force coefficient the significant findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows ⅰ for the dynamic responses with increasing reynolds number the range of the lock in region for the upstream diamond cylinder is basically unchanged in contrast that of the downstream diamond cylinder is increased at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 the upstream and downstream cylinders display large amplitude vibrations only in the transverse direction and the trajectories of the two cylinders are basically a figure 8 within and outside the lock in region however the upstream cylinder at relatively high reynolds numbers re 120 160 and 200 still mainly vibrates in the transverse direction and its trajectory within the lock in region becomes a closed ring shape the downstream cylinder vibrates significantly in both the transverse and streamwise directions and its trajectory is disordered within and outside the lock in region ⅱ for the flow induced forces the lift force and transverse displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder are in the same phase when the upstream cylinder displays a large amplitude at each reynolds number while the lift force and transverse displacement of the downstream diamond cylinder are in the opposite phase when a large transverse vibration occurs the results show that the mean lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 are basically zero within and outside the lock in region in contrast those at high reynolds numbers re 120 160 and 200 deviate from zero in the lock in region and the deviation of the upstream cylinder is more significant ⅲ for the flow field characteristics the wake modes of the twin diamond cylinders at low reynolds numbers are more regular with increasing reynolds number the wake mode of the twin cylinders becomes more disordered and complex the results show that the steady state 2s mode two row vertex mode and 2s mode where vortex fusion occurs in the near wake area of the downstream cylinder appear for the twin tandem diamond cylinders at re 40 with increasing reynolds number the steady state of the diamond cylinders disappears and the other three modes still exist but are more disordered additionally the 2s mode appears in the twin cylinders at relatively high reynolds numbers at this time three vortices with different strengths fall off of the upstream cylinder in one cycle two stronger vortices pass through both sides of the downstream cylinder at the same time resulting in a smaller amplitude of lift force for the downstream cylinder credit authorship contribution

20246,to further reveal vibration interference of a multicylinder system the vortex induced vibration of two degree of freedom upstream and downstream diamond cylinders with a center to center distance l 5b b is characteristic length of cylinders and a mass ratio of the oscillator fixed at m 2 was numerically investigated the influences of the reynolds number re 40 200 and the reduced velocity u r 3 12 on the dynamic characteristics were considered the results show that re has a remarkable effect on the viv characteristics of twin cylinders especially on the downstream cylinder with increasing re numbers the lock in region for the upstream cylinder remains almost constant while that of the downstream cylinder increases unlike the low re numbers re 40 80 the trajectory of the upstream cylinder at high re numbers is a closed ring shape rather than a figure 8 within the lock in region the downstream cylinder is dominated by transverse vibration in most cases of re 40 while it exhibits a significant vibration in both the streamwise and transverse directions at re 80 200 additionally the wake of twin cylinders at re 40 and u r 3 4 displays a steady state with increasing re numbers the steady state disappears and the wake modes with various reduced velocities at high re re 120 200 are more complicated and disordered keywords two tandem diamond cylinders vortex induced vibration viv diagonal arrangement dynamic response fluid structure interaction fsi wake mode 1 introduction the interaction between bluff bodies and fluids has attracted the ongoing attention from the research community due to its practical engineering significance and has been widely encountered in marine engineering civil engineering and mechanical engineering in particular the vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures is a rather typical phenomenon caused by the interaction between a bluff body and fluid it has conflicting roles in engineering one as a continuous source of structural energy harvest and the other as an undesirable phenomenon that can lead to fatigue failure zhao et al 2019 vivace vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy was a pioneering attempt for extracting ocean current energy made by bernitsas et al 2008 they designed a viv based energy harvester to successfully make ocean river current energy a more accessible and economically viable resource narendran et al 2016 carried out a detailed parametric investigation over a wide range of system parameters and proposed an analytical model to predict the mechanical efficiency of the oscillating system based on the viv a novel wind harvesting design which consisted of a cruciform cantilever beam with three bluff bodies was presented by qin et al 2019 they also found that the proposed configuration could give a large output within the wind speed between 2 0 m s to 7 0 m s however the collapse of the original tacoma narrows bridge in 1940 reminds scholars of the continuous analysis of fluid structure interaction therefore controlling or even reducing the viv of cylindrical structures has been a significant topic over decades of analysis bearman 1984 parkinson 1989 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 zhao 2015 note that compared with a single cylinder the flow fields of a multicylinder system will interfere with each other resulting in more complex dynamic responses flow induced force and flow field characteristics it is necessary to study the viv of the twin cylinder system the most straightforward multicylinder system bailey and kwok 1985 païdoussis et al 2011 to further reveal its internal relationship scholars have analyzed this system by selecting appropriate cylinder shapes such as circles and squares or altering the spacing between cylinders zhao et al 2015 in addition blevins 1990 reported that several critical nondimensional parameters such as the mass ratio m reynolds number re reduced velocity u r and damping ratio ξ could directly affect the characteristics of viv the ranges of these parameters and other dimensional variables achieved for the present study are given in table 1 according to the published literature zhao et al 2015 unlike a circular cylinder with smooth contour the existence of sharp corners on a square cylinder significantly changes the flow characteristics this is recognized as a significant factor affecting the flow separation however note that compared with the many pieces of research works on the viv of a circular cylinder there are relatively few on a square cylinder bearman et al 1987 carried out wind tunnel experiments and found that the separation of the shear layer from the surface of a single square cylinder led to the formation of a wake vortex and the transverse viv the viv of a two degree of freedom 2 dof square cylinder at low re 100 was numerically examined perhaps for the first time by su et al 2007 with the change in the natural frequency of the cylinder the phenomena of lock in and beat were successfully indicated zhao et al 2010 conducted an experimental investigation on the transverse viv of a square cylinder at two different angles of incidence to the free stream α 0 square cylinder and 45 diamond cylinder in a water tunnel they found that the expected galloping phenomenon occurred with the square cylinder while the viv response of the diamond cylinder was similar to that of the circular cylinder zhao et al 2013 carried out a numerical simulation to study the viv of a 2 dof square cylinder at three values of α α 0 22 5 and 45 at re 100 and a low mass ratio of m 3 the results showed that the transverse amplitude of a diamond cylinder at α 45 was more extensive than that at α 0 and that the lock in region at α 45 was wider in addition the wake mode of 2s appeared only at α 0 while the p s and 2p modes were obtained at α 45 leontini and thompson 2013 studied the influence of the corner sharpness r c r c 2 r d where r is the corner radius and d is the distance between the front and back corners on the dynamic responses and wake modes of a single diamond cylinder at re 200 and m 2 they concluded that for r c 0 15 the viv characteristics of the single diamond cylinder were similar to those of the single circular cylinder regarding r c 0 15 the wake mode of p s was also captured furthermore sourav et al 2019 simulated the viv of a single diamond cylinder with a higher mass ratio m 10 they found that the maximum values of the mean drag coefficient c d mean and the root mean square rms lift coefficient c l rms of a single diamond cylinder were larger than those of a single circular or square cylinder and that the reduced velocity was lower when the lock in phenomenon began to appear unlike the vibration of a single cylinder caused by its own vortex shedding the vibration of a cylinder in a twin cylinder system is not only affected by itself but also depends on the vortex generated by the adjacent cylinder therefore in the past few decades scholars have devoted themselves to analyzing the viv of two square cylinders via experiments and numerical simulations as seen in table 2 in which the experiments have mainly focused on high reynolds number cases in contrast numerical simulations have been performed at low reynolds numbers by changing the center to center distances mithun and tiwari 2014 numerically studied the influence of the transverse vibration frequency on the flow characteristics and flow fields of two tandem square cylinders oscillating transversely in phase at re 100 patil and tiwari 2009 and more et al 2015 analyzed the interference effect of a fixed downstream square cylinder on the vibration of the upstream cylinder zhao et al 2015 and jaiman et al 2016 studied the viv of two tandem square cylinders fixed upstream cylinder and oscillating downstream cylinder at a spacing ratio of l 4b and found that the lock in phenomenon of the downstream cylinder was not apparent bhatt and alam 2018 conducted a numerical simulation of the viv of two tandem square cylinders with the spacing ratios of l 2b and 4b at re 100 and 200 the upstream cylinder was stationary while the downstream cylinder was allowed to vibrate in only the transverse direction they pointed out that the gap flow had a significant impact on the vibration response of the downstream cylinder nepali et al 2020 explored the 2 dof viv of two square cylinders in the tandem arrangement at l 5b and re 40 200 in contrast with previous conclusions drawn by han et al 2018 they found that when the upstream square cylinder could freely vibrate the lock in region of the downstream square cylinder was much wider and that the wake mode was more complex qiu et al 2021 numerically investigated the 2 dof viv of two tandem square cylinders and focused on the spacing effect on flow characteristics nevertheless the basic dynamic characteristics of two tandem square cylinders are still inadequate on the one hand compared with a 1 dof or fixed single cylinder the effects of reynolds numbers on vibration responses flow induced forces and flow patterns are more complex however most of the studies restrict the dofs of the upstream or downstream square cylinder for example a single cylinder is fixed or allowed to vibrate only in the transverse direction in the current paper twin tandem cylinders are allowed to vibrate freely in both the transverse and streamwise directions on the other hand most of the tandem square cylinders appear in the form of horizontal arrangements and there has been less research lately analyzing twin square cylinders in diagonal arrangements two square cylinders inclined at 45 i e two diamond cylinders as shown in fig 1 the main objective of the present work is to systematically study the effects of low reynolds numbers re 40 200 variation gradient δre 40 and reduced velocities u r 3 12 on the viv characteristics flow induced forces and flow field of twin tandem diamond cylinders and the fluid structure interaction fsi mechanism is further discussed the outline of the rest of the present paper is as follows the fluid governing equations and solid movement equations are briefly presented in section 2 section 3 describes the setup of the problem and model validation is carried out the detailed results are presented in section 4 involving dynamic responses and wake modes section 5 concludes the paper with several remarks based on the present work 2 governing equations the viv analysis of two tandem diamond cylinders involves governing equations in the fluid domain and solid domain for two dimensional incompressible laminar flow around two cylinders the governing equations of fluid flow are the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i υ 2 u i x i x j where u i represents the velocity components and x i represents the cartesian coordinates ν is kinematic viscosity of the fluid p is the fluid pressure and ρ is the fluid density considering that both the upstream and downstream cylinders can vibrate freely in the transverse and streamwise directions the corresponding rigid body motion of a single cylinder is governed by the following vibration differential equations 3 x 2 π u r 2 x c d m 4 y 2 π u r 2 y c l m where x x and x are the instantaneous displacement velocity and acceleration in the streamwise direction respectively and y y and y are the instantaneous displacement velocity and acceleration in the transverse direction respectively notably the structural damping ratio ξ is set to its lower limit of zero in order to encourage high amplitude vibrations c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficients which are defined as follows 5 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 b 6 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 b where f d and f l are the drag and lift forces acting on the unit length of the diamond cylinder respectively besides for follow up analysis the mean drag lift coefficients c d mean c l mean and root mean square rms lift coefficient c l rms are defined as follows 7 c d m e a n i 1 n c d i n 8 c l m e a n i 1 n c l i n 9 c l r m s i 1 n c l i c l m e a n 2 n 1 where n denotes sampling numbers the numerical simulations are performed with the ansys fluent 16 0 solver for computational fluid dynamics for the fluid domain the governing equations are solved via the finite volume method the pressure velocity coupling is obtained via the simplec algorithm and the second order accurate discrete format is used in equation 2 for the solid domain the fourth order runge kutta method used in equations 3 and 4 moreover the weakly coupling algorithm is employed to calculate the viv of two diamond cylinders in this paper the implementation process can be divided into the following steps ⅰ solve the fluid governing equations via the fluent solver obtain the velocity and pressure field of the fluid domain at each time step and reduce the fluid forces acting on the surface of the diamond cylinders ⅱ apply the fluid forces on the oscillating diamond cylinders solve the differential equations of diamond cylinders and achieve dynamic responses in both streamwise and transverse directions ⅲ transfer the vibration velocities of the oscillating cylinders via dynamic grid technology update the position of each grid node and provide a new mesh for the flow field calculation ⅳ return to step ⅰ to calculate the vibration responses of the diamond cylinder in the next time step as mentioned above the dynamic responses at each time step are obtained cyclically and the fsi algorithm is ultimately realized 3 problem description 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions fig 2 shows the geometric configuration and boundary conditions the computational model of the twin oscillating diamond cylinders is simplified as a mass spring damper system where u is the uniform velocity cy1 and cy2 represent the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the whole domain is defined as ω 30b 50b 25b 25b and the midpoint of the centers of the two cylinders is located at coordinate origin o 0 0 that is the distances from o to the inlet and upper and lower boundaries are all 25b while the distances to the inlet and outlet boundaries are 30b and 50b respectively no slip walls are applied on the surfaces of the diamond cylinders u x v y the uniform flow under free stream velocity conditions is prescribed at the inlet as u u v 0 along the outlet boundary conditions regarding the free flow are used u x 0 and v x 0 the symmetrical lateral boundaries have conditions of u y 0 and v 0 fig 3 shows the grid scheme of the twin diamond cylinders in the whole domain to ensure the calculation accuracy a structured grid is arranged in the near wall of the cylinders an unstructured grid is employed in the square frame area in contrast to the grids in the rest of the regions due to the complexity of the flow around diamond cylinders mesh refinement is performed near the cylinders walls additionally to reduce the number of actual calculations only the square frame area is defined as a dynamic grid area 3 2 verification and validation to assess the convergence of the above calculation model we simulate the viv of a single diamond cylinder at re 100 and m 3 considering the influence of the grid numbers and nondimensional time on the final calculation results the reduced velocity of u r 11 is selected for the grid test to highlight the maximum transverse amplitude the transverse amplitude a y y max y min the streamwise amplitude a x x max x min the transverse frequency ratio f y f n and the streamwise frequency ratio f x f n are compared for different operating cases y max and y min denote the maximum and minimum values of the transverse displacement respectively and x max and x min denote the maximum and minimum values of the streamwise displacement respectively f y and f x represent the transverse vibration frequency and the streamwise vibration frequency respectively table 3 shows that with increasing grid numbers and decreasing nondimensional time step the results tend to converge which shows that the calculation model in this paper has high reliability taking the calculation efficiency and accuracy into the overall consideration we use the case of a2 for the subsequent analysis furthermore the viv of a single diamond cylinder at re 100 mass ratio m 3 and u r 2 16 is calculated by using the grid scheme of a2 and the calculated results containing a y a x f y and f x are compared with the existing reference of zhao et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 4 our results are in good agreement with the published results hence suggesting that the simulation method and parameters in this paper have outstanding reliability for further analysis the oscillating trajectory time history and power spectrum of displacement and flow induced forces within and outside the lock in region are also shown in the fig 4 within the lock in region the main frequencies of the drag coefficient and displacement in the streamwise direction are not the same reasons accounting for it is that the drag coefficient has a frequency close to 1 which is more likely to promote the vibration of single diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction finally the single diamond cylinder basically displays a single frequency vibration in the streamwise direction with the passage of time for the transverse direction the main frequency of the lift coefficient is the same as that of the vibration both are the lock in frequency which results in the strong periodicity of the transverse displacement time history in addition within the lock in region the main vibration frequency of the square cylinder in the streamwise direction is equal to that in the transverse direction the phase angle between the transverse displacement and the streamwise displacement is about 90 which leads to the oscillating trajectory of a closed ring shape interestingly the trajectory is symmetrical about the transverse direction different from the case within the lock in region the drag and lift coefficient of the square cylinder outside the region only displays single frequency which also results in the single frequency vibration in both directions at this time the vibration frequency in the streamwise direction is twice that in the transverse direction which causes the phase of the displacement to change with time and the oscillating trajectory of a single square cylinder displays a figure of 8 4 results and discussion 4 1 amplitude and frequency fig 5 outlines the nondimensional amplitudes a x b and a y b and transverse vibration frequency ratio f y f n of the two cylinders with the reduced velocity at different reynolds numbers according to zhao et al 2013 the vibration frequency of the cylinder is locked on to the natural frequency in the lock in region when the lock in phenomenon occurs the frequency ratio of diamond cylinders does not change with increasing reduced velocity generally when the reynolds number is low the streamwise amplitude is minimal as the reynolds number increases the streamwise vibrations of the two cylinders are obvious of which the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is larger based on the assumed criteria of the vibration frequency i e 20 of f n the range of the lock in region of the upstream diamond cylinder is basically unchanged in the transverse direction at re 40 and 80 the lock in region of the upstream cylinder is u r 5 11 and 4 8 respectively for other cases re 120 200 the lock in regions are all u r 4 7 the ratio f y f n is about 1 0 accompanied by large transverse vibration when re 80 200 and u r 7 the frequency ratio of the upstream diamond cylinder increases linearly with increasing reduced velocity which is not within the lock in region under the wake interference of the upstream diamond cylinder the downstream square cylinder does not change with increasing reduced velocity and the ratio is about 1 0 so the lock in phenomenon still occurs the lock in region of the downstream cylinder is narrowest at re 40 and increases with increasing reynolds numbers the lock in regions of the downstream cylinder at different reynolds numbers are u r 5 9 re 40 u r 4 7 and 10 12 re 80 u r 4 7 and 9 12 re 120 u r 4 12 re 160 and u r 3 12 re 200 notably the lock in ranges of the two diamond cylinders are not the same also the reynolds number is more sensitive to the transverse amplitude and lock in region of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders the maximum transverse amplitude first increases and then decreases with increasing reynolds numbers and the maximum value is a y max 1 07 at re 80 4 2 oscillating trajectories to further reveal the vibration characteristics of the twin diamond cylinders figs 6 7 summarize the trends of the oscillating trajectories of the upstream and downstream cylinders with the reduced velocity at different reynolds numbers in which the streamwise coordinate of the oscillating trajectory is amplified to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of trajectories the power spectra in the transverse and streamwise directions corresponding to the typical trajectories are also given it can be concluded that when the reynolds number is low re 40 and 80 the trajectory of the upstream cylinder is a figure 8 both within and outside the lock in region which is attributed to the dominant frequency ratio f x f y 2 of the upstream diamond cylinders the frequency ratio of the upstream cylinder in the lock in region is f x f y 1 and the oscillating trajectory becomes a closed ring shape in which that of re 200 is relatively disordered this phenomenon is only caused by obvious multifrequency vibration of the upstream diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction for the downstream cylinder generally speaking due to the influence of the wake of the upstream cylinder the trajectories of the downstream cylinder at other reynolds numbers are disordered except for the cases of re 40 and 80 4 3 flow induced forces figs 8 9 show the mean drag coefficient and the mean streamwise displacement of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders respectively it can be concluded the mean drag coefficient of upstream diamond cylinder will increase abruptly at the outset of the lock in region such as cases of re 40 u r 5 and re 120 u r 4 the strong vortex shedding from the leeward side of the upstream cylinder increases the drag force of the upstream cylinder which is shown in fig 14 below for details with increasing reduced velocity the strength of the vortex on the leeward side of the upstream cylinder decreases and then the mean drag coefficient of it decreases as well due to the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder the mean drag coefficient of the downstream cylinder is generally lower than that of the upstream cylinder and reaches the minimum value at u r 4 the wake vortex of the upstream cylinder passes through both sides of the downstream cylinder and does not produce impact force in the streamwise direction like other cases and the drag coefficient is finally further weakened the main factors affecting the mean displacement in the streamwise direction are the mean drag coefficient and the stiffness coefficient k of the cylinder that is the stiffness of spring considering that the upstream diamond cylinder is within the lock in region although the mean drag coefficients at each reynolds number are different at this time the corresponding reduced velocities are not high that is to say the large stiffness of the diamond cylinder leads to a small position deviation of the upstream cylinder in the streamwise direction also the mean displacement of the upstream cylinder in the streamwise direction at each reynolds number is basically the same as the stiffness of the diamond cylinder decreases the reduced velocity increases and the mean displacement in the streamwise direction increases as well in addition the decrease of the stiffness also makes the drag coefficient more vulnerable to the mean streamwise displacement due to this the trend of the mean streamwise displacement is consistent with that of the mean drag coefficient at the same velocity similarly for the downstream diamond cylinder at a high reduced velocity the mean drag coefficient decreases with the increase of reynolds number resulting in the same trend of downstream square cylinder s displacement the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder is the strongest at re 200 fig 10 shows the root mean square rms lift coefficient of two diamond cylinders the rms lift force of the upstream cylinder is considerable within the lock in region at each reynolds number and increases with increasing reynolds numbers at reduced velocities outside the lock in region for the downstream cylinder except for the case of re 40 the downstream cylinder at other reynolds numbers has a large rms lift force at these reduced velocities combined with fig 5 it can be seen that when the upstream diamond cylinder displays the maximum transverse amplitude at each reynolds number the corresponding rms lift force is minimal such as in the cases of re 80 and re 160 u r 7 the sizeable transverse amplitude is attributed to the transverse frequency ratio f y f n 1 the downstream cylinder except for the case of re 40 displays a large rms lift force when the maximum transverse amplitude occurs at other reynolds numbers fig 11 shows the variation in the mean lift coefficient of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders based on the reduced velocity the mean lift coefficient of the upstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers is basically zero while this is not the case at relatively high reynolds numbers such as re 120 at u r 5 re 160 at u r 4 and re 200 at u r 4 at relatively high reynolds numbers the mean lift force of the downstream cylinder deviates from zero but the deviation level is less than that of the upstream cylinder the reasons for the deviation of the mean lift coefficient for two cylinders are explained in combination with the flow field 4 4 force and displacement time history fig 12 and 13 show the displacement time history and the power spectrum response of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders at typical reynolds numbers the lift force and displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder at each reynolds number exhibit single frequency vibration in which the lift force and transverse displacement exhibit in phase vibration with time within the lock in region as shown in fig 12 a c and e and out of phase vibration outside the lock in region as shown in fig 12 b d and f for the downstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers the lift force and displacement are basically in phase single frequency vibrations within and outside the lock in region as shown in fig 13 a and b at relatively high reynolds numbers the power spectrum of the lift force of the downstream cylinder displays a multifrequency phenomenon resulting in multifrequency vibration of its transverse displacement which eventually leads to the occurrence of the beat phenomenon at this time the lift force and displacement of the downstream cylinder increase with time as shown in fig 13 d e and g 4 5 flow pattern 4 5 1 wake mode fig 14 summarizes the evolution process of wake modes with the reynolds number and reduced velocity the classification of the wake modes is based on the wake of the downstream diamond cylinder mode i is the steady state mode ii is the 2s mode in which the vortices merge in the near wake of the downstream cylinder mode iii is the two row vertex mode mode iv is the typical 2s mode mode v is the 2s mode where during one vibration cycle three vortices fall off from the near wake of the upstream cylinder and merge in the near wake of the downstream cylinder mode vi is the 2s mode where the downstream wake is very complex and changes continuously with time the wake modes at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 are regular and four kinds of wake types occur mode i mode ii mode iii and mode iv in which mode i does not occur at re 80 compared with low reynolds numbers mode ii mode iii and mode iv still occur at relatively high reynolds numbers but are more disordered furthermore mode v appears at low reduced velocity and mode vi appears at high reduced velocity it can be concluded that when the downstream diamond cylinder at low reynolds numbers displays a significant transverse vibration the lift force exhibits multiple amplitudes in one cycle and the corresponding wake is mode iv when the lock in region appears on the upstream diamond cylinder at high reynolds numbers the mean lift value deviates to zero and the corresponding wake is mode v the downstream diamond cylinder at high reynolds number shows the beat phenomenon where the wake is mode vi the above phenomena are further discussed in combination with the instantaneous vorticity field displacement and lift time history of the twin diamond cylinders 4 5 2 instantaneous vorticity field 1 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅳ fig 15 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode iv and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 40 and u r 10 as an example it can be observed that in the process of the downstream cylinder moving upward from the equilibrium position t1 vortex a falling off from the upstream diamond cylinder reaches the lower side of the downstream diamond cylinder and exerts a suction force on the downstream cylinder resulting in a larger amplitude of lift force for the downstream cylinder when approaching the maximum positive displacement t2 wake vortex b of the upstream cylinder impacts the surface of the downstream cylinder leading to the reduced amplitude of the lift force for the downstream cylinder as time further passes t3 the impact effect of vortex c disappears vortex a merges with the vortex of the downstream cylinder and falls off from the surface of the downstream cylinder causing the lift force amplitude to increase again 2 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅴ fig 16 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode iv and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 160 and u r 5 as an example vortexes b1 and b2 successively fall off during the upward movement of the upstream diamond cylinder and over time t3 vortex b3 falls off during the downward movement of the upstream cylinder the number of vortices shedding from both sides and the strength of the vortices are fairly different which can explain the phenomenon of the mean lift force being nonzero and the absolute values of the maximum and minimum displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder in the transverse direction are not equal additionally vortex b1 simultaneously passes through both sides of the downstream cylinder as vortexes a1 and a2 which fell off of the upstream cylinder in the previous vibration period resulting in a small lift force and transverse amplitude of the downstream cylinder 3 instantaneous analysis of mode ⅵ fig 17 shows the instantaneous vorticity of mode ⅵ and the corresponding transverse displacements and lift time histories of the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders are given taking the case of re 200 and u r 9 as an example when the amplitude of the displacement is large vortex a in the wake of the upstream diamond cylinder and vortex b falling off of the downstream diamond cylinder merge with each other during the upward movement of the downstream cylinder t1 when the downstream cylinder approaches the maximum positive displacement t2 vortex b falling off of the upstream cylinder collides with the lower side of the downstream cylinder and further produces an upward force resulting in the sizeable transverse vibration of the downstream cylinder for the case of a small displacement amplitude it can be observed that when downstream cylinder vi moves upward t3 t4 the vortex of the upstream cylinder impacts the upper side of the downstream cylinder and produces a downward force on it thus restraining the vibration of the downstream cylinder 4 6 comparison with the viv of twin tandem square cylinders to compare the viv characteristics of twin cylinders table 4 gives the research results of the downstream square cylinder nepali et al 2020 and the downstream diamond cylinder of this paper in which the spacing and reynolds number adopted in the published literature are the same as those in this paper in general the viv characteristics of diamond and square cylinder are quite different from each other at the same reynolds number the maximum amplitude of the diamond cylinder in the transverse direction is greater than that of the square cylinder and the lock in region of the diamond cylinder is much wider the maximum streamwise amplitude is less than that of square cylinder and the corresponding reduced velocity is also higher in addition the wake with the maximum transverse amplitude of the diamond cylinder is mostly two row vertex mode while the square cylinder displays 2s mode with increasing reynolds number the transverse amplitude and lock in region of square cylinder decrease while the maximum transverse amplitude of diamond cylinder decreases less and the lock in region accordingly increases like the square cylinder the maximum amplitude of the diamond cylinder in the streamwise direction increases with the increase of reynolds number 5 conclusion the change in the arrangement and the increase in the dofs make the viv problem more complicated a numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the viv of twin tandem diamond cylinders with spacing ratio l 5b at low reynolds numbers of re 40 200 considering that both the upstream and downstream diamond cylinders can freely vibrate i e they have 2 dofs the effects of the reynolds number and reduced velocity on the vibration responses flow induced forces and flow characteristics of the twin cylinders are studied the fsi mechanism of the twin diamond cylinders is further discussed based on the instantaneous vorticity displacement and force coefficient the significant findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows ⅰ for the dynamic responses with increasing reynolds number the range of the lock in region for the upstream diamond cylinder is basically unchanged in contrast that of the downstream diamond cylinder is increased at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 the upstream and downstream cylinders display large amplitude vibrations only in the transverse direction and the trajectories of the two cylinders are basically a figure 8 within and outside the lock in region however the upstream cylinder at relatively high reynolds numbers re 120 160 and 200 still mainly vibrates in the transverse direction and its trajectory within the lock in region becomes a closed ring shape the downstream cylinder vibrates significantly in both the transverse and streamwise directions and its trajectory is disordered within and outside the lock in region ⅱ for the flow induced forces the lift force and transverse displacement of the upstream diamond cylinder are in the same phase when the upstream cylinder displays a large amplitude at each reynolds number while the lift force and transverse displacement of the downstream diamond cylinder are in the opposite phase when a large transverse vibration occurs the results show that the mean lift coefficients of the upstream and downstream cylinders at low reynolds numbers re 40 and 80 are basically zero within and outside the lock in region in contrast those at high reynolds numbers re 120 160 and 200 deviate from zero in the lock in region and the deviation of the upstream cylinder is more significant ⅲ for the flow field characteristics the wake modes of the twin diamond cylinders at low reynolds numbers are more regular with increasing reynolds number the wake mode of the twin cylinders becomes more disordered and complex the results show that the steady state 2s mode two row vertex mode and 2s mode where vortex fusion occurs in the near wake area of the downstream cylinder appear for the twin tandem diamond cylinders at re 40 with increasing reynolds number the steady state of the diamond cylinders disappears and the other three modes still exist but are more disordered additionally the 2s mode appears in the twin cylinders at relatively high reynolds numbers at this time three vortices with different strengths fall off of the upstream cylinder in one cycle two stronger vortices pass through both sides of the downstream cylinder at the same time resulting in a smaller amplitude of lift force for the downstream cylinder credit authorship contribution

20247,owing to the drastic change in flow conditions and river boundary of sharp bend channels marine accidents occur frequently a typical sharp bend channel was selected whose flow velocity and navigation were studied by using a scaled hydrodynamic model and scaled vessel model maneuvering test based on the vessel speed drift angle and transverse flow velocity the stern swing index δ was deduced and a navigation risk model was established which showed different navigation status and corresponding ranges of δ transverse flow velocity is usually larger at the impact point of current on the river bank the impact point moves downstream when flow rate increases the hull undergoes swing rotation and drift under the combined action of current force and rudder force the resultant moment caused by these two forces was represented by δ when the absolute value of δ is in the range of 0 1 2 it can be used to judge the risk of a vessel passing through the sharp bend channel keywords sharp bend mountain rivers stern swing index navigation safety risk model 1 introduction sharp bend sections in mountainous rivers commonly have narrow bend channels with the character of rapid currents large seasonal variations in water level and flow and consequent changes in water surface width sawaf et al 2017 sorocovschi et al 2015 sharp bends strong currents and shallowness often become the serious problems in their channel construction and vessel navigation liang 2011 these sharp bend sections have considerable changes in flow velocity and direction due to abrupt boundary changes schley 2015 with superimposed bend circulation and secondary flow effects compared to other sections sharp bend faces great challenges in improving navigation efficiency and ensuring navigation safety vaghefi 2017 przywarty 2017 dong et al 2012 as there are a large number of sharp bend river sections in the central and western regions of southern china and because the development of navigation has a positive effect on the economic development of the hinterland the chinese government has presented the construction of high grade inland waterway network need in the 13th five year plan including a number of channel construction and upgrading works of sharp bend river sections in mountainous area ministry of transport of china 2017 the state council of china 2017 with the increase number of navigable sharp bend channel vessel collisions and capsizes have been frequently reported msa of china 2019 the navigation risk in sharp bend sections should be paid attention to when a vessel sails through a sharp bend section its speed rudder angle drift angle and other maneuvering parameters as well as flow conditions are related to navigation safety many scholars have obtained significant results in studies on the curved water flow structure simulation method secondary flow through numerical simulation combined with flume experiments for a 180 bend with a curvature ratio of r b 3 the k ϵ model was used to numerically simulate and predict flow phenomena such as streamlines and secondary flows as well as velocity components the accuracy was verified using flume experiments bai et al 2014 the accuracy of the bend flow characteristics model containing two turbulence sub models k ε and shear stress transport models was verified using flume experiment data and prototype data xiao et al 2017 two numerical simulation methods three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd and multi layer feed forward artificial neural networks mlff anns were used for a comparative study of the computational performance in simulating 90 bend open channel flow gholami et al 2015 based on flume experiments the evolution of the secondary flow in the bend was studied via particle image velocimetry piv measurements of the u shaped open channel flow conditions and it was concluded that the flow starts to redistribute before entering the bend and covers a relatively long distance to return to uniformity after leaving the bend bai et al 2019 in terms of maneuvering vessels passing bends the interaction effect when two vessels meet in a narrow waterway bend has been revealed based on hydrodynamics lee et al 2016 by studying the tug barge system navigating in a bend the small steering capability under the unloaded condition is considered to be inferior to that under the fully loaded condition sano et al 2018 vessel model tests as an important research tool can obtain vessel maneuvering parameters in bend channels and visually determine the advantages and disadvantages of navigable water flow conditions and are therefore widely applied in bend channel navigation studies dai 2009 chen 2016 zeng 2017 the navigation risk in sharp bend sections mainly comes from vessel rotation and drift influenced by the currents in the bend the drift of a vessel during steering is accompanied by rotation on the axis of the pivoting point and the linear speed of the stern is significantly greater than that of the bow this phenomenon is called stern swing there have been studies considering the influence factors such as current wind and channel dimensions for establishing the formula of drift amount of a vessel passing a bend under the influence of wind and currents liu et al 2006 xu et al 2011 and deducing the formula of drift angle in the bend channel tanaka and kijima 2009 cai and zheng 2012 ai and zhu 2020 the drift amount is used to refer to the navigation width design and safety distance which cannot fully reflect the vessel s bend passing state the existing drift angle formulas mostly use bend passing radius r and vessel length l as variables and consider the vessel draft and channel depth factor d h they do not analyze the effect of water flow from the force perspective and do not reflect the difference in bend passing caused by different vessel speeds therefore they have limitations in predicting the vessel s bend passing state the drift and rotation of the vessel are affected by the joint action of the oblique current force and the rudder force therefore the two influencing factors should not be considered separately in this study the water flow conditions and vessel trajectory in sharp bend section are studied by scaled hydrodynamic model combined with vessel model maneuvering test and the moment of action of current force and rudder force of vessels passing bends were analyzed based on which the vessel stern swing index δ and vessel navigation risk model applicable to sharp bend sections are proposed combining the stern swing index δ and the risk model can realize the prediction of the vessel s bend passing state and evaluation of the navigation risk level of the sharp bend section according to which the waterway and maritime departments can take measures to ensure navigation safety in advance 2 method 2 1 study region in the natural river stream type classification crosato 2008 a section with curvature coefficient greater than 1 5 is defined as a bend section the sharpness of the bend sections was further subdivided using the bend radius river width r b values sharp bends have r b values below 3 while gentle bends have r b greater than 8 and transitional bends have r b values between 3 and 8 kashyap et al 2012 constantinescu et al 2013 the smaller the bend radius the wider the river and the sharper the bend by investigating the geometric parameters and corresponding vessel scales of the sharp bend sections of major mountain navigable rivers in china table 1 it was found that sharp bends r b 2 are more widely distributed in small and medium sized mountain rivers compared with the parameters for large rivers such as yangtze and xijiang rivers the size of the vessel navigating in small and medium mountain rivers such as beijiang and lancang rivers is smaller while the space occupied ratio by the vessel in the river channel ship width river width is larger the allowable drift angle and drift amount are limited when passing the bend therefore the navigation risk for the same vessel passing the sharp bend in small and medium mountain rivers is more prominent than that in large rivers in accordance with the principle of selecting a larger vessel width river width ratio the xianglang bend section located in the beijiang river was taken as the representative sharp bend section for the study the xianglang bend section is located in the upper reaches of the beijiang river which belongs to the pearl river system as shown in fig 1 a the total length of the bend is approximately 3 km average specific drop is approximately 1 27 bend angle is approximately 160 bend radius is approximately 360 m upper and lower of bend are connected with the straight section of the river and the plan shape is shown in fig 1 b the width of the river varies between 200 and 340 m from the dry period to the flood period the average river width is approximately 260 m and the flow velocity exceeds 4 m s during the flood period which are typical characteristics of a mountain river the ratio of radius and river width r b is 1 38 the channel belongs to class iii the minimum channel dimension is 60 m in width 2 5 m in water depth and 270 m in turning radius navigable for 1000 dwt inland river vessels the size of vessel is 68 m in length 10 m in width and 2 m in full load draft 2 2 scaled hydrodynamic model the total length of the bend test section is 3 km based on froude number similarity criterion designed as a normal fixed bed model the geometric scaling is 1 100 considering the adjustment section in the hydrodynamic test and the vessel model maneuvering test are required 1 km adjustment section is reserved for each of the upper and lower reaches of the sharp bend test section therefore the total length of the simulated river section is 5 km and the corresponding model length is 50 m the layout of the hydrodynamic model test system for the sharp bend section is shown in fig 2 a the topography of the model river section was developed according to the prototype observation data of the xianglang bend section the measured water level and cross sectional flow velocity distribution data were used to rate the model accuracy and the water surface line and flow velocity distribution were kept consistent with the prototype by adjusting the surface roughness of the model as shown in fig 2 b c test flow selection according to the hydrological data of the xianglang bend section of the beijiang river 151 m3 s 605 m3 s 1200 m3 s and 2010 m3 s were selected as the test flow representing the dry period flow average annual flow small flood flow and medium flood flow of the river section to which they belong respectively all four flow rates are navigable 2 3 scaled vessel model test vessel model selection a 1000 dwt inland twin propeller and twin rudder dry bulk standard single vessel navigating in beijiang river was selected as the test vessel fig 3 with a length of 68 m width of 10 m and full load draft of 2 m the geometric scaling of the vessel model was adopted as 1 100 the draft speed turning ability index k and turning lag index t values of the vessel model were calibrated before the test to ensure similarity between the maneuverability of the vessel model and real vessel the speed of the model vessel was set to four fixed levels which were converted to 2 5 m s 3 0 m s 3 5 m s and 4 0 m s for the prototype 2 4 experimental set up experimental control and parameter measurements the inlet of the model in the sharp bend section controls the flow rate and the outlet controls the water level the flow relationship curve of the outlet is derived from the long term observation data of the water gauge in the prototype river section as shown in fig 2 d the water level is measured using a laser water level gauge as shown in fig 4 b and the sampling time interval is 0 5 s for the measurement of the flow field and trajectory of model vessel in the sharp bend section a measurement device based on image recognition technology and particle image velocimetry piv particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm is used as in fig 4 a c which can also calculate the drift angle decomposition of the flow velocity of the channel the course of the sharp bend section consists of arcs and tangents and when the current flow direction of the bend channel appears at an angle θ with the course its oblique current can be decomposed into the transverse flow velocity component v x v c sinθ perpendicular to the course and when the vessel is sailing along the course the rotational moment exerted by the transverse flow velocity v x on the vessel s bow and stern threatens the navigation safety and is an important parameter for analysis in this study 3 results the velocity distribution in sharp bend channel was reached according to the four flow rates test through the force analysis on the hull estimation formula for stern swing index δ was deduced based on the drift angle and flow velocity which can be verified by the result derived from ship model test in the following description all data have been converted into prototype data 3 1 flow impacts and velocity change fig 5 shows the flow field distribution of the four stage test flow in the xianglang bend section when the flow rate is 151 m3 s the mainstream flow velocity in the bend section is 1 m s the inertia of the flow is small the bed restraint is prominent and the mainstream line is close to a smooth circular arc as the flow rate increases the inertia of the flow increases and the mainstream line tends to straighten out into the concave bank and then move straight downstream when the flow rate is 2010 m3 s the mainstream flow velocity in the bend section exceeds 4 m s the impact phenomenon is more obvious the change in mainstream line fig 6 reflects that there are two flow impact points in the xianglang bend section which are located near 0 8 km and 2 0 km of the bend and the impact points move downstream with an increase in the flow rate comparing the changes in the position of the flow impact point and the changes in the velocity of the main stream fig 7 it is believed that the velocity of the main stream decreases to some extent after the impact the river bank and the higher the flow the more obvious the decrease in the velocity which also reflects the characteristics of energy consumption during the interaction between the water flow and the river bank 3 2 bimodal pattern of transverse flow the channel centerline current element can reflect the channel flow condition therefore the flow velocity of the channel centerline and the angle between the course and the current direction at four flow rates were measured to calculate the distribution of the transverse flow velocity v x at each flow rate along the waterway fig 8 from the overall distribution it can be seen that the two flow impacts cause a bimodal pattern in the along range variation of the transverse flow velocity in the sharp bend channel with the first peak being larger than the last peak and the peak located downstream of the flow impact point when the first impact occurs the current direction upstream of the flow impact point is the same as the course and after the impact the current bends back under the bank restraint and returns to the main channel and the course bends along the river regime which forms an angle θ with the course and generates a larger transverse flow velocity to result in the first peak after the second impact angle between the current direction downstream of the flow impact point and the course appears again with the water back to the main channel the transverse flow velocity again increases after leaving the sharp bend section the flow converges with the course and the transverse velocity decreases as the flow rate increases the location of the flow impact point moves downstream along with the location of the maximum transverse flow velocity in the channel 3 3 estimation formula of stern swing index δ when the vessel turns from the straight line in the bend channel the vessel centroid is not at the same point as the moment pivoting the former is generally considered to be in the middle while the latter moves from the middle to the bow which is a dynamic point the greater the speed of the vessel s motion the more its pivoting point moves forward michio et al 2009 shin et al 2009 hong 2007 the pivoting point is generally located 1 5 to 1 3 times the vessel length in front of the vessel s center of gravity which is simplified to 1 3 times the vessel length near the bow for the convenience of description and the point of action of the current force is approximately located at the bow and stern of the vessel fig 9 according to multiple regression analysis of the hydrodynamic derivatives based on the data of several ships oblique sailing tests jia 1999 yang and yu 1998 keiichi and others 1989 when the sailing drift angle β in vessel model maneuvering tests does not exceed 90 the estimation method of vessel hydrodynamic force and moment can be expressed as 1 n h 1 2 ρ l 2 d v 2 c n where 2 c n n u v u v n u

10 n h n r i z z r to establish a quick estimation equation assuming r 0 when the vessel passes a bend under an equilibrium state the moment momentum equilibrium equation can be simplified as follows 11 n h n r 0 where i z z is the vessel s rotational moment of inertia and r is the angular velocity the physical significance of 11 is that the vessel s rudder force is exactly resisting the current force the conditions under which stern swing occurs when a vessel passes through a sharp bend section depend mainly on the contrasting relationship of the moments substituting 7 and 8 into 11 it can be deduced that 12 3 k 0 a r v r 2 sin 2 δ ρ l d c n 4 v x 2 2 v x 1 2 thus the conditions under which a vessel swings its stern through a sharp bend section involve the vessel size and its

β 3 0 1243 cos β 2 sin β 0 0018 sin β 3 δ 0 indicates that the maneuvering stability of the vessel through the bend is good and the larger the absolute value the more stable the vessel when δ 0 the vessel swings its stern when passing the bend and the larger the absolute value the higher the risk of stern swing being out of control under the effect of transverse flow velocity 3 5 navigation trajectory and risk model six cases of hydrodynamic and vessel navigation sailed downstream tests under different four waterway schemes were carried out by selecting two flood flow rates of 1200 m3 s and 2010 m3 s four waterway schemes are different in dredged areas of the sharp bend section scheme 1 is the original channel topography scheme 2 dredges the riverbed on the left side of the channel in a small scale scheme 3 dredges the riverbed on the left side of the channel in a large scale and scheme 4 dredges the riverbed on both sides of the channel in a large scale the test condition is shown in table 2 and the measured navigation trajectory are given in fig 10 the trajectory sampling time interval between two adjacent vessel positions is 1 s according to 15 the δ variation values along the course are calculated based on the transverse flow velocity the current flow velocity and vessel speed obtained by the physical model test combined with the simulated vessel parameters the δ values and navigation drift angles along the course are plotted as shown in fig 11 regarding the calculation parameters the vessel used for the vessel model maneuvering test was a 1000 dwt inland vessel with a length l of 68 m a full load draft d of 2 m block coefficient c b 0 85 μ a r l d where 8 is adopted p n is obtained according to beaufoy s estimation equation hong 2007 where k is 576 2 δ is set as 45 v r v s 1 ω and ω is the wake coefficient which can be up to 0 4 for wide large inland vessels with high block coefficients yielding v r 0 6 v s in case 1 the vessel sails downstream with speed of 3 0 m s undergoes a stern swing when passing the bend near 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km and the maximum drift angle exceeds 40 this phenomenon coincides with the pattern of variation of transverse flow velocity along the course in fig 8 i e the transverse flow velocity is larger downstream of the flow impact point in the above two locations where the vessel undergoes a stern swing the δ value is less than 1 0 which indicates that the rotational moment caused by the transverse flow velocity exceeds the rotational moment caused by the rudder force and the absolute value is greater than 1 in case 2 under 1200 m3 s flow rate and 3 m s speed stern swing continues to occur at the bend at 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km with the maximum drift angle being 43 and the δ value at the corresponding position reaching 1 02 the extreme value variation of the vessel drift angle and δ value in case 1 and case 2 tests as shown in fig 11 is consistent in cases 3 and 4 the test conditions are 1200 m3 s flow rate and 3 0 m s speed and the δ value is greater than 0 3 the difference between the rotating moment caused by the transverse flow rate and the rotating moment caused by the rudder is reduced and the drift angle is reduced to approximately 20 when the vessel passing through the two sections that are prone to stern swing in cases 1 and 2 in case 5 the flow rate is 2010 m3 s speed is 4 0 m s δ values are 0 8 and 0 5 in the sections of 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km of the bend respectively and the maximum value of sailing drift angle is up to 30 in case 6 the flow rate is reduced to 1200 m3 s the vessel s speed is 3 5 m s the extreme value of δ along the channel is less than 0 2 the vessel navigation drift angle is reduced to within 15 and the vessel has a relatively good motion attitude when passing the bend the above analysis of vessel bend passing tests in the sharp bend sections shows that the extreme change in δ is closely related to the stern swing state of the bend passing vessel the correspondence between the stern swing index δ in the sharp bend section and the drift angle can be described as follows when the stern swing index δ is less than zero the larger its absolute value the larger the drift angle of the bend passing vessel according to the vessel s bend passing motion attitude and maneuvering parameters in this study combined with the existing vessel model test research results yu and others 1998 hao 2004 guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2017 yan and others 2018 chen et al 2016 when the drift angle is less than 25 in stage 1 the vessel handling is relatively easy when the drift angle is between 25 and 35 in stage 2 the vessel occasionally maneuvers a large rudder angle to adjust the attitude the absolute values of the stern swing index δ corresponding to the above drift angles in this study are 0 0 5 in stage 1 and 0 5 0 8 in stage 2 respectively when the drift angle is between 35 and 50 in stage 3 the vessel needs to operate with a large rudder angle for a long time to pass to bend in this study the absolute values of the corresponding stern swing index δ is within the range of 0 8 1 2 in stage 3 and at this time the ship exhibits the stern swing phenomenon when the drift angle is greater than 50 in stage 4 the stern swing phenomenon of the bend passing vessel is prominent and there is a certain chance that the vessel drifts out of control and crashes into the river bank liu et al 2005 the scatters represent the relationship between stern swing index δ and drift angle from the test in this study and existing achievements in fig 12 exponential curve is used to fit the scatters and four stages of risk levels are divided according to the different range of drift angle and the stern swing index finally a navigation risk model of the sharp bend channels in mountain rivers is established 4 discussion the significance of the vessel navigation risk model is that from the perspective of navigation the acceptable navigation risk range is set on the basis of the existing water flow conditions of the channel and the stern swing index δ is calculated to provide a reference for the speed selection of vessels heading downstream when the vessel speed is set and the stern swing index δ is calculated to judge the navigation risk level of mountain rivers with sharp bends from the perspective of mountain sharp bend channel remediation on the premise of clear remediation objectives channel grade navigation width navigation depth bend radius and other parameters and according to the geometric scale and maneuvering parameters of navigable vessels in this mountain channel a reasonable remediation plan can be determined to achieve water flow conditions that meet navigation safety requirements there is a positive correlation between the transverse flow velocity and the drift angle of the vessel in channels of sharp bend sections in mountain rivers and the drift angle is also larger near the position with higher transverse flow velocity therefore the traditional method uses the magnitude of the transverse flow velocity of the channel to judge the navigation conditions of the sharp bend section and the navigation safety of the bend passing vessel however the problem is that the transverse flow velocity in a given section remains the same under the same flow conditions while the drift angle is different at different speeds and rudder angles of the bend passing vessel therefore it is inaccurate to judge the drift angle and bend passing state of the vessel only using the transverse flow velocity the physical meaning of the stern swing index δ proposed in this study includes not only flow transverse velocity but also a series of vessel parameters such as vessel speed rudder efficiency coefficient and block coefficient δ integrates the water flow and vessel maneuvering factor and under the same water flow conditions in the sharp bend section the value of δ will also change accordingly with the vessel maneuvering parameters which can reflect the navigation status of the vessel more accurately the navigation risk model established on this basis can effectively evaluate navigation risk in mountain rivers with sharp bends 5 conclusions in this study a scaled hydrodynamic model combined with a 1000 dwt inland twin propeller vessel model was developed for flow and navigation tests the angle between the current direction and the waterway produces transverse flow which causes rotation and drift when vessels pass through bends transverse flow velocity is usually larger at the impact point of current on river bank with an increase in flow rate the impact point and the point of maximum transverse velocity move downstream a fast estimation formula for the vessel s stern swing index δ was derived on the basis of the navigation waterway velocity distribution and vessel hull force analysis which is applicable to sharp bend sections of mountain rivers scaled model test data were used to verify the corresponding relationship between the drift angle and δ compared with the traditional methods the physical meaning of the stern swing index δ is much more reliable to describe the navigation status in sharp bend channels however the effects of wind and wave were ignored in the derivation the navigation risk model was established based on the model test results of beijiang river upper reaches of yangtze river and upper reaches of xiangjiang river when the absolute value of δ is less than 1 2 the risk model can evaluate the navigation risk level of the sharp bend channel under the given vessel speed and can provide a reference for the speed selection of the vessel in each risk zone by using δ and the risk model a reasonable waterway remediation plan in sharp bend channels can be determined according to vessel size and maneuvering parameters data availability statement all data and models that support

20247,owing to the drastic change in flow conditions and river boundary of sharp bend channels marine accidents occur frequently a typical sharp bend channel was selected whose flow velocity and navigation were studied by using a scaled hydrodynamic model and scaled vessel model maneuvering test based on the vessel speed drift angle and transverse flow velocity the stern swing index δ was deduced and a navigation risk model was established which showed different navigation status and corresponding ranges of δ transverse flow velocity is usually larger at the impact point of current on the river bank the impact point moves downstream when flow rate increases the hull undergoes swing rotation and drift under the combined action of current force and rudder force the resultant moment caused by these two forces was represented by δ when the absolute value of δ is in the range of 0 1 2 it can be used to judge the risk of a vessel passing through the sharp bend channel keywords sharp bend mountain rivers stern swing index navigation safety risk model 1 introduction sharp bend sections in mountainous rivers commonly have narrow bend channels with the character of rapid currents large seasonal variations in water level and flow and consequent changes in water surface width sawaf et al 2017 sorocovschi et al 2015 sharp bends strong currents and shallowness often become the serious problems in their channel construction and vessel navigation liang 2011 these sharp bend sections have considerable changes in flow velocity and direction due to abrupt boundary changes schley 2015 with superimposed bend circulation and secondary flow effects compared to other sections sharp bend faces great challenges in improving navigation efficiency and ensuring navigation safety vaghefi 2017 przywarty 2017 dong et al 2012 as there are a large number of sharp bend river sections in the central and western regions of southern china and because the development of navigation has a positive effect on the economic development of the hinterland the chinese government has presented the construction of high grade inland waterway network need in the 13th five year plan including a number of channel construction and upgrading works of sharp bend river sections in mountainous area ministry of transport of china 2017 the state council of china 2017 with the increase number of navigable sharp bend channel vessel collisions and capsizes have been frequently reported msa of china 2019 the navigation risk in sharp bend sections should be paid attention to when a vessel sails through a sharp bend section its speed rudder angle drift angle and other maneuvering parameters as well as flow conditions are related to navigation safety many scholars have obtained significant results in studies on the curved water flow structure simulation method secondary flow through numerical simulation combined with flume experiments for a 180 bend with a curvature ratio of r b 3 the k ϵ model was used to numerically simulate and predict flow phenomena such as streamlines and secondary flows as well as velocity components the accuracy was verified using flume experiments bai et al 2014 the accuracy of the bend flow characteristics model containing two turbulence sub models k ε and shear stress transport models was verified using flume experiment data and prototype data xiao et al 2017 two numerical simulation methods three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd and multi layer feed forward artificial neural networks mlff anns were used for a comparative study of the computational performance in simulating 90 bend open channel flow gholami et al 2015 based on flume experiments the evolution of the secondary flow in the bend was studied via particle image velocimetry piv measurements of the u shaped open channel flow conditions and it was concluded that the flow starts to redistribute before entering the bend and covers a relatively long distance to return to uniformity after leaving the bend bai et al 2019 in terms of maneuvering vessels passing bends the interaction effect when two vessels meet in a narrow waterway bend has been revealed based on hydrodynamics lee et al 2016 by studying the tug barge system navigating in a bend the small steering capability under the unloaded condition is considered to be inferior to that under the fully loaded condition sano et al 2018 vessel model tests as an important research tool can obtain vessel maneuvering parameters in bend channels and visually determine the advantages and disadvantages of navigable water flow conditions and are therefore widely applied in bend channel navigation studies dai 2009 chen 2016 zeng 2017 the navigation risk in sharp bend sections mainly comes from vessel rotation and drift influenced by the currents in the bend the drift of a vessel during steering is accompanied by rotation on the axis of the pivoting point and the linear speed of the stern is significantly greater than that of the bow this phenomenon is called stern swing there have been studies considering the influence factors such as current wind and channel dimensions for establishing the formula of drift amount of a vessel passing a bend under the influence of wind and currents liu et al 2006 xu et al 2011 and deducing the formula of drift angle in the bend channel tanaka and kijima 2009 cai and zheng 2012 ai and zhu 2020 the drift amount is used to refer to the navigation width design and safety distance which cannot fully reflect the vessel s bend passing state the existing drift angle formulas mostly use bend passing radius r and vessel length l as variables and consider the vessel draft and channel depth factor d h they do not analyze the effect of water flow from the force perspective and do not reflect the difference in bend passing caused by different vessel speeds therefore they have limitations in predicting the vessel s bend passing state the drift and rotation of the vessel are affected by the joint action of the oblique current force and the rudder force therefore the two influencing factors should not be considered separately in this study the water flow conditions and vessel trajectory in sharp bend section are studied by scaled hydrodynamic model combined with vessel model maneuvering test and the moment of action of current force and rudder force of vessels passing bends were analyzed based on which the vessel stern swing index δ and vessel navigation risk model applicable to sharp bend sections are proposed combining the stern swing index δ and the risk model can realize the prediction of the vessel s bend passing state and evaluation of the navigation risk level of the sharp bend section according to which the waterway and maritime departments can take measures to ensure navigation safety in advance 2 method 2 1 study region in the natural river stream type classification crosato 2008 a section with curvature coefficient greater than 1 5 is defined as a bend section the sharpness of the bend sections was further subdivided using the bend radius river width r b values sharp bends have r b values below 3 while gentle bends have r b greater than 8 and transitional bends have r b values between 3 and 8 kashyap et al 2012 constantinescu et al 2013 the smaller the bend radius the wider the river and the sharper the bend by investigating the geometric parameters and corresponding vessel scales of the sharp bend sections of major mountain navigable rivers in china table 1 it was found that sharp bends r b 2 are more widely distributed in small and medium sized mountain rivers compared with the parameters for large rivers such as yangtze and xijiang rivers the size of the vessel navigating in small and medium mountain rivers such as beijiang and lancang rivers is smaller while the space occupied ratio by the vessel in the river channel ship width river width is larger the allowable drift angle and drift amount are limited when passing the bend therefore the navigation risk for the same vessel passing the sharp bend in small and medium mountain rivers is more prominent than that in large rivers in accordance with the principle of selecting a larger vessel width river width ratio the xianglang bend section located in the beijiang river was taken as the representative sharp bend section for the study the xianglang bend section is located in the upper reaches of the beijiang river which belongs to the pearl river system as shown in fig 1 a the total length of the bend is approximately 3 km average specific drop is approximately 1 27 bend angle is approximately 160 bend radius is approximately 360 m upper and lower of bend are connected with the straight section of the river and the plan shape is shown in fig 1 b the width of the river varies between 200 and 340 m from the dry period to the flood period the average river width is approximately 260 m and the flow velocity exceeds 4 m s during the flood period which are typical characteristics of a mountain river the ratio of radius and river width r b is 1 38 the channel belongs to class iii the minimum channel dimension is 60 m in width 2 5 m in water depth and 270 m in turning radius navigable for 1000 dwt inland river vessels the size of vessel is 68 m in length 10 m in width and 2 m in full load draft 2 2 scaled hydrodynamic model the total length of the bend test section is 3 km based on froude number similarity criterion designed as a normal fixed bed model the geometric scaling is 1 100 considering the adjustment section in the hydrodynamic test and the vessel model maneuvering test are required 1 km adjustment section is reserved for each of the upper and lower reaches of the sharp bend test section therefore the total length of the simulated river section is 5 km and the corresponding model length is 50 m the layout of the hydrodynamic model test system for the sharp bend section is shown in fig 2 a the topography of the model river section was developed according to the prototype observation data of the xianglang bend section the measured water level and cross sectional flow velocity distribution data were used to rate the model accuracy and the water surface line and flow velocity distribution were kept consistent with the prototype by adjusting the surface roughness of the model as shown in fig 2 b c test flow selection according to the hydrological data of the xianglang bend section of the beijiang river 151 m3 s 605 m3 s 1200 m3 s and 2010 m3 s were selected as the test flow representing the dry period flow average annual flow small flood flow and medium flood flow of the river section to which they belong respectively all four flow rates are navigable 2 3 scaled vessel model test vessel model selection a 1000 dwt inland twin propeller and twin rudder dry bulk standard single vessel navigating in beijiang river was selected as the test vessel fig 3 with a length of 68 m width of 10 m and full load draft of 2 m the geometric scaling of the vessel model was adopted as 1 100 the draft speed turning ability index k and turning lag index t values of the vessel model were calibrated before the test to ensure similarity between the maneuverability of the vessel model and real vessel the speed of the model vessel was set to four fixed levels which were converted to 2 5 m s 3 0 m s 3 5 m s and 4 0 m s for the prototype 2 4 experimental set up experimental control and parameter measurements the inlet of the model in the sharp bend section controls the flow rate and the outlet controls the water level the flow relationship curve of the outlet is derived from the long term observation data of the water gauge in the prototype river section as shown in fig 2 d the water level is measured using a laser water level gauge as shown in fig 4 b and the sampling time interval is 0 5 s for the measurement of the flow field and trajectory of model vessel in the sharp bend section a measurement device based on image recognition technology and particle image velocimetry piv particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm is used as in fig 4 a c which can also calculate the drift angle decomposition of the flow velocity of the channel the course of the sharp bend section consists of arcs and tangents and when the current flow direction of the bend channel appears at an angle θ with the course its oblique current can be decomposed into the transverse flow velocity component v x v c sinθ perpendicular to the course and when the vessel is sailing along the course the rotational moment exerted by the transverse flow velocity v x on the vessel s bow and stern threatens the navigation safety and is an important parameter for analysis in this study 3 results the velocity distribution in sharp bend channel was reached according to the four flow rates test through the force analysis on the hull estimation formula for stern swing index δ was deduced based on the drift angle and flow velocity which can be verified by the result derived from ship model test in the following description all data have been converted into prototype data 3 1 flow impacts and velocity change fig 5 shows the flow field distribution of the four stage test flow in the xianglang bend section when the flow rate is 151 m3 s the mainstream flow velocity in the bend section is 1 m s the inertia of the flow is small the bed restraint is prominent and the mainstream line is close to a smooth circular arc as the flow rate increases the inertia of the flow increases and the mainstream line tends to straighten out into the concave bank and then move straight downstream when the flow rate is 2010 m3 s the mainstream flow velocity in the bend section exceeds 4 m s the impact phenomenon is more obvious the change in mainstream line fig 6 reflects that there are two flow impact points in the xianglang bend section which are located near 0 8 km and 2 0 km of the bend and the impact points move downstream with an increase in the flow rate comparing the changes in the position of the flow impact point and the changes in the velocity of the main stream fig 7 it is believed that the velocity of the main stream decreases to some extent after the impact the river bank and the higher the flow the more obvious the decrease in the velocity which also reflects the characteristics of energy consumption during the interaction between the water flow and the river bank 3 2 bimodal pattern of transverse flow the channel centerline current element can reflect the channel flow condition therefore the flow velocity of the channel centerline and the angle between the course and the current direction at four flow rates were measured to calculate the distribution of the transverse flow velocity v x at each flow rate along the waterway fig 8 from the overall distribution it can be seen that the two flow impacts cause a bimodal pattern in the along range variation of the transverse flow velocity in the sharp bend channel with the first peak being larger than the last peak and the peak located downstream of the flow impact point when the first impact occurs the current direction upstream of the flow impact point is the same as the course and after the impact the current bends back under the bank restraint and returns to the main channel and the course bends along the river regime which forms an angle θ with the course and generates a larger transverse flow velocity to result in the first peak after the second impact angle between the current direction downstream of the flow impact point and the course appears again with the water back to the main channel the transverse flow velocity again increases after leaving the sharp bend section the flow converges with the course and the transverse velocity decreases as the flow rate increases the location of the flow impact point moves downstream along with the location of the maximum transverse flow velocity in the channel 3 3 estimation formula of stern swing index δ when the vessel turns from the straight line in the bend channel the vessel centroid is not at the same point as the moment pivoting the former is generally considered to be in the middle while the latter moves from the middle to the bow which is a dynamic point the greater the speed of the vessel s motion the more its pivoting point moves forward michio et al 2009 shin et al 2009 hong 2007 the pivoting point is generally located 1 5 to 1 3 times the vessel length in front of the vessel s center of gravity which is simplified to 1 3 times the vessel length near the bow for the convenience of description and the point of action of the current force is approximately located at the bow and stern of the vessel fig 9 according to multiple regression analysis of the hydrodynamic derivatives based on the data of several ships oblique sailing tests jia 1999 yang and yu 1998 keiichi and others 1989 when the sailing

10 n h n r i z z r to establish a quick estimation equation assuming r 0 when the vessel passes a bend under an equilibrium state the moment momentum equilibrium equation can be simplified as follows 11 n h n r 0 where i z z is the vessel s rotational moment of inertia and r is the angular velocity the physical significance of 11 is that the vessel s rudder force is exactly resisting the current force the conditions under which stern swing occurs when a vessel passes through a sharp bend section depend mainly on the contrasting relationship of the moments substituting 7 and 8 into 11 it can

vessel swings its stern when passing the bend and the larger the absolute value the higher the risk of stern swing being out of control under the effect of transverse flow velocity 3 5 navigation trajectory and risk model six cases of hydrodynamic and vessel navigation sailed downstream tests under different four waterway schemes were carried out by selecting two flood flow rates of 1200 m3 s and 2010 m3 s four waterway schemes are different in dredged areas of the sharp bend section scheme 1 is the original channel topography scheme 2 dredges the riverbed on the left side of the channel in a small scale scheme 3 dredges the riverbed on the left side of the channel in a large scale and scheme 4 dredges the riverbed on both sides of the channel in a large scale the test condition is shown in table 2 and the measured navigation trajectory are given in fig 10 the trajectory sampling time interval between two adjacent vessel positions is 1 s according to 15 the δ variation values along the course are calculated based on the transverse flow velocity the current flow velocity and vessel speed obtained by the physical model test combined with the simulated vessel parameters the δ values and navigation drift angles along the course are plotted as shown in fig 11 regarding the calculation parameters the vessel used for the vessel model maneuvering test was a 1000 dwt inland vessel with a length l of 68 m a full load draft d of 2 m block coefficient c b 0 85 μ a r l d where 8 is adopted p n is obtained according to beaufoy s estimation equation hong 2007 where k is 576 2 δ is set as 45 v r v s 1 ω and ω is the wake coefficient which can be up to 0 4 for wide large inland vessels with high block coefficients yielding v r 0 6 v s in case 1 the vessel sails downstream with speed of 3 0 m s undergoes a stern swing when passing the bend near 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km and the maximum drift angle exceeds 40 this phenomenon coincides with the pattern of variation of transverse flow velocity along the course in fig 8 i e the transverse flow velocity is larger downstream of the flow impact point in the above two locations where the vessel undergoes a stern swing the δ value is less than 1 0 which indicates that the rotational moment caused by the transverse flow velocity exceeds the rotational moment caused by the rudder force and the absolute value is greater than 1 in case 2 under 1200 m3 s flow rate and 3 m s speed stern swing continues to occur at the bend at 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km with the maximum drift angle being 43 and the δ value at the corresponding position reaching 1 02 the extreme value variation of the vessel drift angle and δ value in case 1 and case 2 tests as shown in fig 11 is consistent in cases 3 and 4 the test conditions are 1200 m3 s flow rate and 3 0 m s speed and the δ value is greater than 0 3 the difference between the rotating moment caused by the transverse flow rate and the rotating moment caused by the rudder is reduced and the drift angle is reduced to approximately 20 when the vessel passing through the two sections that are prone to stern swing in cases 1 and 2 in case 5 the flow rate is 2010 m3 s speed is 4 0 m s δ values are 0 8 and 0 5 in the sections of 1 0 1 2 km and 2 2 2 3 km of the bend respectively and the maximum value of sailing drift angle is up to 30 in case 6 the flow rate is reduced to 1200 m3 s the vessel s speed is 3 5 m s the extreme value of δ along the channel is less than 0 2 the vessel navigation drift angle is reduced to within 15 and the vessel has a relatively good motion attitude when passing the bend the above analysis of vessel bend passing tests in the sharp bend sections shows that the extreme change in δ is closely related to the stern swing state of the bend passing vessel the correspondence between the stern swing index δ in the sharp bend section and the drift angle can be described as follows when the stern swing index δ is less than zero the larger its absolute value the larger the drift angle of the bend passing vessel according to the vessel s bend passing motion attitude and maneuvering parameters in this study combined with the existing vessel model test research results yu and others 1998 hao 2004 guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2017 yan and others 2018 chen et al 2016 when the drift angle is less than 25 in stage 1 the vessel handling is relatively easy when the drift angle is between 25 and 35 in stage 2 the vessel occasionally maneuvers a large rudder angle to adjust the attitude the absolute values of the stern swing index δ corresponding to the above drift angles in this study are 0 0 5 in stage 1 and 0 5 0 8 in stage 2 respectively when the drift angle is between 35 and 50 in stage 3 the vessel needs to operate with a large rudder angle for a long time to pass to bend in this study the absolute values of the corresponding stern swing index δ is within the range of 0 8 1 2 in stage 3 and at this time the ship exhibits the stern swing phenomenon when the drift angle is greater than 50 in stage 4 the stern swing phenomenon of the bend passing vessel is prominent and there is a certain chance that the vessel drifts out of control and crashes into the river bank liu et al 2005 the scatters represent the relationship between stern swing index δ and drift angle from the test in this study and existing achievements in fig 12 exponential curve is used to fit the scatters and four stages of risk levels are divided according to the different range of drift angle and the stern swing index finally a navigation risk model of the sharp bend channels in mountain rivers is established 4 discussion the significance of the vessel navigation risk model is that from the perspective of navigation the acceptable navigation risk range is set on the basis of the existing water flow conditions of the channel and the stern swing index δ is calculated to provide a reference for the speed selection of vessels heading downstream when the vessel speed is set and the stern swing index δ is calculated to judge the navigation risk level of mountain rivers with sharp bends from the perspective of mountain sharp bend channel remediation on the premise of clear remediation objectives channel grade navigation width navigation depth bend radius and other parameters and according to the geometric scale and maneuvering parameters of navigable vessels in this mountain channel a reasonable remediation plan can be determined to achieve water flow conditions that meet navigation safety requirements there is a positive correlation between the transverse flow velocity and the drift angle of the vessel in channels of sharp bend sections in mountain rivers and the drift angle is also larger near the position with higher transverse flow velocity therefore the traditional method uses the magnitude of the transverse flow velocity of the channel to judge the navigation conditions of the sharp bend section and the navigation safety of the bend passing vessel however the problem is that the transverse flow velocity in a given section remains the same under the same flow conditions while the drift angle is different at different speeds and rudder angles of the bend passing vessel therefore it is inaccurate to judge the drift angle and bend passing state of the vessel only using the transverse flow velocity the physical meaning of the stern swing index δ proposed in this study includes not only flow transverse velocity but also a series of vessel parameters such as vessel speed rudder efficiency coefficient and block coefficient δ integrates the water flow and vessel maneuvering factor and under the same water flow conditions in the sharp bend section the value of δ will also change accordingly with the vessel maneuvering parameters which can reflect the navigation status of the vessel more accurately the navigation risk model established on this basis can effectively evaluate navigation risk in mountain rivers with sharp bends 5 conclusions in this study a scaled hydrodynamic model combined with a 1000 dwt inland twin propeller vessel model was developed for flow and navigation tests the angle between the current direction and the waterway produces transverse flow which causes rotation and drift when vessels pass through bends transverse flow velocity is usually larger at the impact point of current on river bank with an increase in flow rate the impact point and the point of maximum transverse velocity move downstream a fast estimation formula for the vessel s stern swing index δ was derived on the basis of the navigation waterway velocity distribution and vessel hull force analysis which is applicable to sharp bend sections of mountain rivers scaled model test data were used to verify the corresponding relationship between the drift angle and δ compared with the traditional methods the physical meaning of the stern swing index δ is much more reliable to describe the navigation status in sharp bend channels however the effects of wind and wave were ignored in the derivation the navigation risk model was established based on the model test results of beijiang river upper reaches of yangtze river and upper reaches of xiangjiang river when the absolute value of δ is less than 1 2 the risk model can evaluate the navigation risk level of the sharp bend channel under the given vessel speed and can provide a reference for the speed selection of the vessel in each risk zone by using δ and the risk model a reasonable waterway remediation plan in sharp bend channels can be determined according to vessel size and maneuvering parameters data availability statement all data and models that support

lock in flow regimes are presented and discussed in detail recirculation bubble behind the cylinder disappears for large oscillation amplitudes during lock in while a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected is observed behind the cylinder in the mean vorticity field which alters the shape of the cylinder trajectory average drag coefficient is shown to be directly proportional to the vortex formation length while it is inversely related to the influenced wake width streamwise oscillations are noted to be more sensitive to the increasing reynolds number during lock in as compared to the transverse oscillations progressively increasing space and time averaged nusselt number values comparably higher than stationary cylinder are observed as reynolds number increases the behavior of time averaged local nusselt number varies with position around the surface of the cylinder the maximum local nusselt number on the surface of the cylinder is also seen to vary both in magnitude as well as location on the surface of the cylinder in a direct correspondence with the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder moreover a regression correlation is proposed which relates reynolds number root mean squared streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal number with the space and time averaged nusselt number graphical abstract

dynamic response analysis and behavior of flow around freely oscillating circular cylinders is widely studied due to their practical applications in the design of heat exchangers risers tall buildings and offshore rigs as well as transmission cables and cables for structural support modeling them as freely oscillating cylinders is done for simplicity despite the simplistic circular geometry it can be related to many shapes of bluff bodies since many if not most of the examples discussed earlier have circular geometries a circular cylinder in fluid flow faces instabilities in the flow beyond r e 47 which culminate into the periodic shedding of vortices from the cylinder vibrations caused by these periodically shed vortices from the cylinder are known as vortex induced vibrations viv many review studies have been conducted to investigate the vortex induced vibrations from different perspectives for example bearman 1984 2011 blevins 1977 sarpkaya 1995 williamson and govardhan 2004 and nakamuraet al 2013 in scenarios when the ratio of the frequency of shedding vortices f v and the natural frequency of the system f n approaches unity i e lock in or synchronization oscillation amplitude is greatly increased and can have grave consequences resulting in structural failure for example nishihara et al 2005 besides the numerous hazards associated with vivs there are also some scenarios where they might be utilized for the better like harvesting the energy of the vibrating cylinder for electrical power generation using vortex turbines bernitsas et al 2008a 2008b and mehmood et al 2013 the natural frequency of the system f n the velocity of the free stream flow u characteristic length of the cylinder diameter d and viscosity of the flowing fluid μ greatly affect the dynamic response of the cylinder which is characterized by frequency ratio and oscillation amplitude among others these can be brought together in non dimensional terms namely reduced velocity u u f n d and reynolds number r e ρ u d μ vortex induced vibrations are mostly modeled considering only one degree of freedom of the cylinder where only oscillations transverse to the free stream flow are considered the mass damping parameter comprising of mass ratio m and structural damping coefficient ζ greatly affects the response of the cylinder as shown by feng 1968 brika and laneville 1993 and khalak and williamson 1996 1999 feng 1968 was the first to identify the presence of initial branch of cylinder response as well as a lower branch and observed that higher oscillation amplitudes were present in the lower branch of cylinder response only for high mass damping cases in low mass damping scenarios however a three branch initial lower and upper response was observed by khalak and williamson 1996 where the upper branch of cylinder response displayed higher oscillation amplitudes a hysteretic behavior was observed in the switching of modes between upper and initial branches possibly due to the sudden change in vibration amplitude and vortical structure however for cases showing insignificant changes to the structure of the wake a sporadic behavior was seen in the mode transition between upper and lower branches change in the wake mode in initial and upper branches was confirmed when govardhan and williamson 2000 observed a sudden jump in the phase angle between cylinder displacement and the vortex force experimental study was carried out by klamo et al 2006 which identified reynolds number as a critical influencer to the effect that only the initial and lower branches of cylinder response are seen for cases having low reynolds number and high damping while a three branched cylinder response is seen in cases having high reynolds number and low damping a three branch response however has also been observed for low damping as well as a low reynolds number re 300 by dorogi and baranyi 2020 where the upper branch is bounded by two phase changes between the initial and the lower branch in order to emulate a wider range of engineering applications a two degree of freedom motion is allowed for the cylinder in which the cylinder is free to translate both in line with the free stream flow as well as transverse to it generally different values of natural frequencies f n x a n d f n y are observed in each of the two directions a natural frequency ratio ranging from equal to twice i e f n x f n y 1 2 was studied by moe and wu 1990 sarpkaya 1995 and dahl et al 2006 2007 experimentally while similar studies were done numerically by bao et al 2012 and wang et al 2017 the effect of mass ratio on a special condition restrictive case of f n x f n y f n was analyzed by jauvtis and williamson 2004 it was seen that for a medium mass ratio 6 m 25 the in line component of oscillation has negligible effect on the transverse component of oscillation for lower mass ratios m 6 however a 2 t mode each cycle of motion has two triple vortices shed from cylinder of cylinder wake was observed accompanied by a super upper branch of cylinder response having higher oscillation amplitudes a third harmonic component of the total lift force associated with 2 t vortex shedding mode was thus defined increasing the reynolds number introduces three dimensional instabilities in the flow the three dimensional instabilities for a stationary circular cylinder were investigated using a floquet stability analysis by barkley and henderson 1996 and classified as mode a starting at re 189 while mode b starting at re 259 the cylinder oscillations tend to extend the two dimensionality of the flow structure over a wider reynolds number range the upper limit of which has not been realized yet as was seen experimentally by bearman and obasaju 1982 and koide et al 2002 and numerically by poncet 2002 apart from the mass damping parameter ζ and reduced velocity u reynolds number re is also a key influencer as shown by klamo et al 2006 and govardhan and williamson 2006 even though u and re are dependent variables many studies segregate them to probe into their influence independently leontini et al 2006 analyzed the effects of reduced velocity by restricting the cylinder to one dimensional transverse oscillations at a reynolds number of 200 mass ratio of 10 and damping coefficient of 0 01 two branches of response were thus identified a low amplitude initial and a relatively higher amplitude lower branch a 2 s mode of vortex shedding two single vortices shed in a vortex shedding period as per the notations of williamson and roshko 1988 was seen in the initial branch while a c 2 s mode was found in the lower branch where the c represents the coalescence of the negative and positive vortices in the cylinder wake singh and mittal 2005 investigated the influence of both reduced velocity as well as reynolds number by performing the computations firstly with reynolds number fixed at 100 and varying the reduced velocity and secondly by fixing the reduced velocity at 4 92 and varying the reynolds number they observed the hysteretic behavior of initial and lower branch switching the same way as shown by brika and laneville 1993 as well as at the upper boundary of the lower branch confirmed later by klamo et al 2006 they also identified 2 s mode in low oscillation range and c 2 s mode of vortex shedding for relatively higher amplitudes which is consistent with the findings of leontini et al 2006 besides these they noted the formation of a p s mode one pair one single vortex shed per cycle of motion of vortex shedding for re 300 dorogi and baranyi 2019 also identified similar asymmetric wake modes which they associated to the occurrence of raindrop shaped cylinder path when investigating the effects of varying natural frequency of the cylinder assuming a constant natural frequency reduced velocity has a linear relation with reynolds number r e k u where k f n d 2 v also known as the dimensionless natural frequency prasanth et al 2006 and prasanth and mittal 2008 investigated aspects of 2 dof free vibration for a circular cylinder prasanth et al 2006 focused on the influence of blockage ratio ratio of diameter of cylinder to the height of computation domain in good agreement with the observations noted by singh and mittal 2005 hysteresis loops were seen at both the upper as well as lower edges of the synchronization range they identified a direct relation of the blockage ratio to the width of hysteresis loop on the lower edge of the synchronization range prasanth and mittal 2008 calculated the phase angle between coefficient of lift and the transverse oscillation component and observed a phase jump of almost 180 at the middle of the synchronization region attributed to the pressure component of the total lift mittal and singh 2005 observed the vortex induced vibrations phenomenon occurring at reynolds number 20 for very low non dimensional natural frequencies which for a stationary cylinder is in steady state they also observed that an increase in the mass ratio tends to bring the values of vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency closer together confirming the experimental observations by williamson and govardhan 2004 dorogi and baranyi 2018 selected a range of non dimensional natural frequencies extending from 12 to 35 and found that the rms value of drag coefficient tends to zero around u s t o 0 5 the location of the jump in phase angle between in line oscillation component and the drag coefficient while numerous studies exist in literature for the investigation of heat transfer from stationary hieber and gebhart 1968 baranyi 2003 behara and mittal 2010 qu et al 2013 rotating badr and dennis 1985 ingham and tang 1990 kang et al 1999 sufyan et al

yawar et al 2019 those for the complex case of a freely oscillating cylinder are few and far karanth et al 1994 carried out the investigations for the heat transfer from a circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 by considering one dimensional forced oscillations of the cylinder they analyzed the effects of inline oscillations as well as transverse oscillations separately cheng et al 1997 investigated the heat transfer from a transversely oscillating cylinder an increase in drag coefficient as well as nusselt number was observed when oscillation amplitude was increased garg et al 2019 also analyzed the effects of thermal buoyancy on a transverse only oscillation of circular cylinder for a mixed convection heat transfer analysis and found that the presence of thermal buoyancy results in a wider lock in range and an amplified oscillation response of the cylinder as compared to when thermal buoyancy is not considered izadpanah et al 2018 numerically studied the effect of viv on the heat transfer of an oscillating circular cylinder as well as other arrangements by adding fins to the cylinder they discovered that convective heat transfer is enhanced by the addition of fins yang et al 2020 numerically analyzed the forced convection from a freely oscillating cylinder at reynolds number re 100 for a number of reduced velocities where they observed an increase of 5 73 in time and space averaged nusselt number in comparison with a stationary cylinder the change in the heat transfer behavior of flow around a 2 dof oscillating cylinder as it transitions from non lock in regime to lock in and again into non lock in regime for a reynolds number range within the laminar regime has not yet been discussed to the best of the authors knowledge in the current study an incompressible fluid flowing across a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder is investigated numerically the cylinder is allowed a freedom of two dimensional translational oscillations in undamped conditions i e ζ 0 a low mass ratio of m 10 is selected constant natural frequency cases at r e o 100 are investigated fixing the natural frequency as constant allows for the system to transition in and out of lock in or synchronization based on the inlet flow velocity variation alone which is a more realistic scenario the dynamic response of the cylinder variations in the aerodynamic coefficients frequency oscillation amplitude cylinder trajectory as well as the heat transfer behavior due to vortex induced vibrations for a reynolds number range spanning the pre lock in

circular cylinder immersed in an incompressible fluid with pr 7 is analyzed in a two dimensional laminar flow regime for 70 r e 150 with uniform flow at inlet the mass ratio is fixed as m 10 while the structural damping coefficient is set to zero ζ 0 natural frequency f n of the system is assumed equal to the frequency of vortex shedding from a stationary circular cylinder at r e 100 therefore the non dimensional natural frequency varies with reynolds number of the flow only oscillation frequencies both in the transverse and in line directions are equal i e f n f n x f n y dynamic response in

fluent the incompressible flow is solved on the grid using unsteady two dimensional segregated solvers momentum and energy equations are discretized using second order upwind scheme pressure implicit with split operator piso is applied to solve continuity momentum and energy equations quickly transient formulation is resolved using second order implicit approach with non iterative time advancement nita custom functions are employed to meet the specific modeling requirements allowing for the free oscillatory motion of the cylinder 4 independence studies for this research circular cylinder in the center of a polar domain is considered fig 1 diameter of the circular cylinder is d while the extents of the domain have a diameter d the domain size is most commonly referred to in non dimensional terms as a ratio of diameter of selected domain to the diameter of the cylinder i e d d for the present research three different diameter ratios d d were considered and compared in table 1 each of these domain sizes is used to simulate flow around the freely oscillating cylinder at reynolds number r e 100 considering a reduced velocity u 6 082 mildly informed arbitrary values selected through literature review are considered for the number of nodes on the cylinder n 200 and the non dimensional time step δ t 0 005 for initial testing results show negligible variation in values for the domain sizes d d 160 a n d 240 as can be seen in table 1 a maximum deviation of 0 085 is observed for y r m s domain size of d d 160 is therefore selected for further testing a detailed grid independence study is conducted for the selection of appropriately sized and distributed mesh to be used for simulation three different values for the number of nodes on the cylinder n 200 240 a n d 280 are selected structured grids with varying mesh density are generated the node distribution normal to the cylinder surface controlled by the number of nodes normal to the cylinder m is varied to achieve a much finer mesh distribution closer to the surface of the cylinder while keeping the aspect ratio of cells close to unity since the problem is dynamic in nature a diffusion based spring type dynamic mesh is used to emulate the freely oscillating motion of the cylinder where the mesh is updated using a feedback system to calculate the appropriate new positions for the nodes at every time step fig 2 a shows the complete meshed domain fig 2 b shows the mesh close to the cylinder while fig 2 c shows the mesh close to the cylinder when the cylinder is at maximum oscillation amplitude for r e 100 simulations are conducted using the same values of r e 100 a n d u 6 082 as for the domain selection however the domain size d d 160 is now used results show a maximum deviation of 1 23 for c lrms between n 240 and 280 a complete comparison of results can be seen in table 2 using this comparison a mesh of dimensions n x m 240 x 204 is selected for further detailed analysis in this work the effect of non dimensional time step size δ t is also observed for the selection of an appropriate time step size to better resolve the flow characteristics to this end three different time step sizes are selected to conduct a simulation for a flow having r e 100 and u 6 082 using the domain size d d 160 and mesh size n x m 240 x 204 as selected earlier the influence of non dimensional time step size is compared in table 3 the comparison yields a maximum variation of 0 3 for y r m s between time step sizes δ t 0 0025 a n d 0 001 on the basis of this comparison a non dimensional time step size of δ t 0 0025 is selected for simulating the flow this independence study yields a set of parameters that are most optimized in the current setup to successfully simulate the flow around a freely oscillating two degrees of freedom cylinder results obtained using these selected parameters are therefore compared with the published data prasanth and mittal 2008 in table 4 for a flow having reynolds number r e 100 a maximum deviation of 1 51 is observed in c drms in light of these results the aforementioned set of parameters is chosen for further detailed analysis in this work 5 validation the optimal compromise in the combination of parameters hence identified by the independence studies are used to perform various stationary as well as freely oscillating circular cylinder simulations results thus obtained are compared with the literature for validation purposes a two step validation scheme is adopted in this work initially aerodynamic and heat transfer parameters for the case of a stationary cylinder are compared with relevant literature followed on by the comparison of pertinent simulation parameters for the case of an oscillating cylinder 5 1 stationary cylinder values of strouhal number s t time average drag coefficient c davg and root mean square rms value of lift coefficient c lrms obtained using the parameters identified by the independence studies are validated against the values obtained from baranyi and lewis 2006 table 5 a maximum deviation of 1 56 is observed for c davg it may be noted that results from present study are in good agreement throughout with the results of baranyi and lewis 2006 in order to further strengthen the validity of this research strouhal number s t for the complete range under study was validated against results published by williamson and roshko 1988 prasanth and mittal 2008 dorogi and baranyi 2018 baranyi 2003 henderson 1995 posdziech and grundmann 2007 and lima e silva et al 2003 in fig 3 strouhal number st shows good agreement throughout the whole reynolds number range nusselt number averaged over space and time n u is also calculated using the same parameters for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number r e 100 and prandtl number p r 7 for the validation of n u the correlations proposed by kramers 1946 churchill and bernstein 1977 and žukauskas 1972 for a stationary cylinder are used table 6 the correlation proposed by kramers 1946 is given by 15 n u 0 42 p r 0 2 0 57 r e 0 5 p r 0 31 while churchill and bernstein 1977 proposed their correlation as 16 n u 0 3 0 62 re 0 5 pr 0 33 1 0 4 pr 0 66 0 25 1 re 282000 0 62 0 8 and the correlation proposed by žukauskas 1972 is given as 17 n u 0 683 re 0 466 pr 0 333 assuming the appropriate values in these correlations yields n u 11 04 11 74 and 11 16 respectively the value of spatio temporal mean nusselt number n u obtained from the present work is calculated to be n u 11 86 deviation from these proposed correlations is calculated to be 7 43 1 02 and 6 27 respectively while these numbers have been presented for completeness it is important to keep in mind that these are empirical correlations with limited applicability deviation is therefore expected based upon the data provided above it may be considered that the solution scheme used in the current research is acceptable for simulation of a stationary cylinder 5 2 freely oscillating cylinder selected parameters have also been validated for a freely oscillating cylinder in two degrees of freedom results from numerical simulations in the present work are compared with prasanth and mittal 2008 dorogi and baranyi 2018 and he and zhang 2017 in fig 4 and fig 5 importantly the natural frequency is kept constant and equal to the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder at r e 100 comparison of aerodynamic coefficients in terms of root mean square values of drag and lift coefficient c drms c lrms is given in fig 4 a and b considering c drms in fig 4 a it is clear that the values are in good agreement with the published data apart from very small disagreements on the higher and lower threshold of the lock in or synchronization region c drms gains its peak value of c drms 0 3739 at r e 86 the lift coefficient c lrms however is a bit more wayward and although the values of current research are centrally placed among the published data it is seen that the values from published data itself are not in complete agreement but rather spread out especially within the lock in region this may be due to the fact that the cross flow induces much higher amplitudes of transverse oscillation within lock in which is contributed to mainly by the lift coefficient making it more sensitive to small changes in reynolds number c lrms peaks at re 85 with a peak value of c lrms 0 85 fig 5 a and b presents the cylinder response in terms of maximum transverse oscillation amplitude y m a x and root mean square value of streamwise oscillation amplitude x r m s the maximum transverse oscillation amplitude y m a x shows a very strong agreement with the published data some deviations from the results of he and zhang 2017 are observed at the higher threshold of synchronization region where current study shows y m a x 0 0516 d at r e 129 while the results of he and zhang 2017 show y m a x 0 2994 d at the same reynolds number still a good agreement is maintained even with the results of prasanth and mittal 2008 y m a x 0 0437 d and dorogi and baranyi 2018 y m a x 0 0529 d y m a x reaches its peak value y m a x 0 5783 d at r e 85 the root mean square value of streamwise displacement x r m s shows favorable agreement with the published results everywhere except for both the higher and lower thresholds of the synchronization region the lower threshold especially shows an extremely large deviation from the results of prasanth and mittal 2008 which show x r m s 0 0138 d at r e 85 however the results of he and zhang 2017 x r m s 0 0059 d and dorogi and baranyi 2018 x r m s 0 0058 d are in good agreement with the current research x r m s 0 006 d at the same reynolds number the x r m s peaks out with a maximum value of x r m s 0 0061 d at r e 86 the proposed scheme and methodology agree reasonably well with literature and are acceptable for use in the simulation of a two dimensionally freely oscillating cylinder 6 results and discussion results are presented for a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder different regimes have been identified on the basis of variation of strouhal number with change in reynolds number of the flow as shown in fig 6 strouhal number of oscillating cylinder s t is compared with the strouhal number of stationary cylinder s t o shown in fig 6 as a dashed orange line and the non dimensional natural frequency f n 1 u shown in fig 6 as a dotted red line calculated at the same value of reynolds numbers throughout simulations classification of these regimes is also apparent in fig 7 in terms of frequency ratio where the frequency ratio of oscillating cylinder is compared to the frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder shown in fig 7 as a dashed orange line and a line representing a constant frequency ratio f r 1 shown in fig 7 as a dotted red line fig 7 also shows the selected cases from identified regimes to be further explored for an in depth analysis of each regime these regimes and their representative cases are described below 1 regime a 70 r e 79 2 regime b 80 r e 127 o regime b1 80 r e 84 o regime b2 85 r e 104 o regime b3 105 r e 127 3 regime c 128 r e 150 6 1 regime a regime a comprises of the pre lock in cases where the strouhal number s t for the freely oscillating cylinder follows the same trend as that of the strouhal number s t o for a stationary cylinder at the same values of reynolds number for the flow as shown in fig 6 the value of s t at r e 70 is 0 147 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 145 having a percentage difference in values of 1 37 also the value of s t at r e 79 is 0 155 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 152 having a percentage difference in values of 1 97 the same is also seen in fig 7 where the frequency ratio for the freely oscillating cylinder shows the same trend as the frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder albeit a slight offset the value of oscillating cylinder frequency ratio at r e 70 is 0 625 while at the same re the value of stationary cylinder frequency ratio is 0 618 having a percentage difference in values of 1 12 also the value of oscillating cylinder frequency ratio at r e 79 is 0 746 while at the same re the value of stationary cylinder frequency ratio is 0 726 having a percentage difference in values of 2 68 the slight offset is clearly visible between the two lines for strouhal number as well as frequency ratios in figs 6 and 7 for the case of freely oscillating cylinder this slight offset can be attributed to the motion of the cylinder prasanth and mittal 2008 regime b covers the lock in cases for the freely oscillating cylinder showing three individual jumps throughout the range at re 80 85 and 127 respectively these three jumps encapsulate three different kinds of behaviors in terms of strouhal number and frequency ratios as shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively this provides good basis for division of regime b into three different sub regimes showing distinct flow properties the sub regimes are described as follows regime b1 regime b1 starts after the first jump at r e 80 in strouhal number as well as frequency ratio figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 the s t deviates from s t o with a sudden jump towards the non dimensional natural frequency although not entirely achieving the same value of 0 206 but rather stopping short at 0 185 during the regime b1 s t maintains an almost consistent offset from the non dimensional natural frequency line while following its downward trend with increasing values of reynolds number in fig 7 the same is seen in terms of frequency ratio where the frequency ratio for the oscillating cylinder takes a jump towards the f r 1 line but stops short of it at 0 9 and then proceeds almost parallel to it with increasing reynolds number regime b2 regime b2 follows the second jump at r e 85 in strouhal number and frequency ratio in figs 6 and 7 after entering the regime b2 the s t starts closing its gap with the non dimensional natural frequency and attains the same value at the end of regime b2 when r e 105 as shown in fig 6 a similar behavior in terms of frequency ratio may be noted in fig 7 where after the second jump frequency ratio for the oscillating cylinder starts approaching the value of f r 1 with increasing reynolds number it becomes 1 at the end of the regime b2 at r e 105 regime b3 the third sub regime regime b3 starts with s t f n and f r 1 at r e 105 from fig 6 it is seen that during the regime b3 s t follows exactly along the line of non dimensional natural frequency without any deviation the same is true for frequency ratio where it retains the value of f r 1 throughout the regime the third jump at r e 127 marks the end of the regime b3 and throws the system out of lock in 6 2 regime c regime c comprises of the post lock in cases following the third jump at r e 127 where s t once again switches towards s t o instead of the non dimensional natural frequency and then follows the trend of s t o thereafter as shown in fig 6 the value of s t at r e 128 is 0 169 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 176 having a percentage difference in values of 3 98 also the value of s t at r e 150 is 0 178 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 183 having a percentage difference in values of 2 73 the s t shows a visibly larger offset of approximately 2 73 to almost 3 98 from s t o as compared to the one in regime a where it is in the range of 1 37 1 97 in fig 7 the frequency ratio also takes a jump from f r 1 towards the frequency ratio of stationary cylinder here also an offset larger than the one in regime a 1 37 1 97 is present seen to be showing similar percentage deviations 2 73 3 98 as strouhal number in the respective regimes this can again be similarly attributed to the oscillations of the cylinder as discussed by prasanth and mittal 2008 6 3 flow fields flow around a stationary cylinder has been thoroughly discussed in terms of the mean velocity fields but only a few studies have attempted to describe the velocity fields for an oscillating cylinder griffin 1971 forced oscillation at r e 200 and govardhan and williamson 2001 free oscillation at r e 3000 4000 have previously discussed them for the case of a circular cylinder oscillating only transversely using the mean velocity profiles downstream of the cylinder the contours for mean streamlines mean velocity fields for each of the components of velocity u and v and the root mean square value of u velocity for a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder are presented here the cases depicted here are an abstraction of their respective flow regimes as encountered by the freely oscillating circular cylinder they have all been normalized using the flow velocity of each case to highlight the variations in the mean velocity fields and an easier comparison 6 4 mean streamlines mean streamlines for the representative cases of flow regimes identified above are presented in fig 8 and show the presence of a recirculation bubble behind the cylinder for most cases discussed here similar to a stationary cylinder as seen by govardhan and williamson 2001 the recirculation bubble is a region of double spiraling reversed flow directed towards the cylinder bounded between the space saddle and the base of the cylinder as defined by younis et al 2016 the length of the recirculation bubble was calculated by measuring the distance of the space saddle point shown here as a red dot from the center of the cylinder the recirculation bubble length reaches 2 22 d downstream from the center of the cylinder for regime a r e 78 fig 8 a in regime b1 r e 82 fig 8 b it further extends to 2 29 d the recirculation bubble completely disappears in the regime b2 r e 95 fig 8 c whereby the saddle point is not observed even upon close inspection refer to in set fig 8 c large oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder may be attributed with the disappearance of the recirculation bubble in this regime the recirculation bubble once again appears for the regime b3 r e 121 fig 8 d and regime c r e 140 fig 8 e although with a much smaller recirculation bubble length of 1 23 d and 1 69 d respectively from fig 8 it is apparent that the formation as well as the length of recirculation bubble is dependent upon flow velocity as well as cylinder oscillation amplitudes it is seen to grow with an increase in flow velocity up to a certain length and diminish with an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the cylinder 6 5 mean streamwise velocity the contours of mean streamwise velocity u are presented in fig 9 a similar contour increment δ u 0 1 is adopted for all positive u for an easier comparison while the negative u is enclosed within a contour level u 0 representing the extents of the recirculation bubble the magnitude of u within that region and the size of the wake bubble gives a measure of recirculation strength referring to fig 9 it is observed that highly elongated negative velocity regions are present in regimes a and b1 fig 9 a and b while a comparatively much weaker and shorter wake bubble exists in regime b3 fig 9 d a moderately sized recirculation bubble observed in regime c fig 9 e shows the maximum strength of recirculation in all studied cases the wake bubble does not exist in regime b2 fig 9 c as has already been discussed in the previous section a representative measure of wake recovery is made in fig 9 on the basis of the position of a contour level u 0 4 along the wake symmetry line in each of the representative cases of the regimes wake recovery is noted to be the quickest for regime b2 fig 9 c where the non existence of a recirculation bubble and high oscillation amplitudes lead to a strong entrainment of ambient fluid into the wake while it is slowest for regime b1 fig 9 b having the longest recirculation bubble it is also seen that regime b3 fig 9 d has the weakest and shortest existing recirculation bubble which can also be attributed to its significant oscillation amplitudes as compared to the rest of the cases zafar and alam 2018 have previously noted that the maximum velocities u m a x in the shear layers and the minimum velocity u m i n in the recirculation bubble are connected to drag an increase in the magnitude of u m a x and or u m i n corresponds to an increased drag here however in fig 9 f it does not seem to follow the same narrative as it can be seen that although for regime a fig 9 a u m a x 1 219 and u m i n 0 162 for regime b1 fig 9 b u m a x 1 218 and u m i n 0 161 which are almost the same we see almost similar values of average drag c d 1 354 and 1 359 respectively however for regime b3 fig 9 d where u m a x 1 258 which is slightly higher than regime a fig 9 a and u m i n 0 047 which is greatly decreased from regime a fig 9 a the c d 1 381 is slightly higher it is seen that an almost 71 decrease in the u m i n could not balance out only a 3 increase in u m a x strictly in terms of c d also c d is minimum for regime c fig 9 e where both u m a x and u m i n are at their peak values of u m a x 1 289 and u m i n 0 188 this can be attributed to the smaller size of the recirculation bubble behind the cylinder as compared to regime a fig 9 a the maximum c d 1 955 is observed in regime b2 fig 9 c where u m a x 1 266 and no recirculation bubble exists the higher values of c d are seen in cases with higher oscillation amplitudes and no or very weak recirculation bubble i e regimes b2 and b3 this shall be further explored and discussed in detail in the next section 6 6 rms streamwise velocity the contours of root mean square values of streamwise velocities u r m s for the aforementioned flow regimes are presented in fig 10 two peaks of maximum u r m s are observed on either side of the wake symmetry line which represent the strength of roll up of shear layers in each case the strength of these peaks is seen to grow till it reaches a maximum strength somewhere within the lock in region in regime b2 and then declines further on the strongest peak u r m s 0 658 is seen for regime b2 fig 10 c which is the case with the highest oscillation amplitudes while the weakest peak u r m s 0 229 is observed for regime a fig 10 a having the smallest oscillation amplitudes streamwise location of these peaks from the center of the cylinder is the vortex formation length which is represented in fig 10 a as l f this vortex formation length is observed to be much longer in the regimes a fig 10 a and b1 fig 10 b representative cases l f 2 88 d and 3 47 d due to both having much elongated recirculation bubbles as previously discussed the shortest formation length is observed in regime b2 fig 10 c l f 0 56 d which is right off the edge of the cylinder after that the formation length grows up to l f 1 85 d in regime c fig 10 e another parameter usually considered in the same regard is the wake width which can be described as the transverse separation of the u r m s peaks and represented in fig 10 a as w while for a stationary cylinder this wake width is a significant parameter it considerably loses its usability if the cylinder is allowed to oscillate this is due to an increased influence of the oscillating cylinder upon the wake in the current research therefore a new parameter termed as influenced wake width is used and depicted in fig 10 b as w this influenced wake width is defined on the basis of width of a pre selected contour level at a pre defined distance downstream of the oscillating cylinder the influenced wake width w used for comparison of the regions of influence of the oscillating cylinder in the current research is based on the transverse locations of contour level u r m s 0 12 at a fixed streamwise distance of 3 0 d downstream from the center of the cylinder the influenced wake width is seen to increase with an increase in reynolds number until it reaches a maximum width within the lock in region and subsequently shrinks to smaller widths with increasing reynolds numbers the smallest influenced wake width w 2 65 is observed for regime a fig 10 a while the widest influenced wake width w 4 47 is observed in regime b2 fig 10 c due to the large oscillation amplitudes in the regime besides the downstream side peaks of u r m s there also exist fluctuations in the streamwise velocity in front of the cylinder i e on the upstream side of the cylinder in regime b2 and b3 as seen in fig 10 c and d these upstream peaks u r m s 0 14 and 0 06 for the representative cases of r e 95 and 121 fig 10 c and d respectively might be caused by the significant oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder in the streamwise direction fig 10 f plots the values of average drag coefficient c d formation length l f wake width w and the influenced wake width w against reynolds number for the selected cases from the previously identified regimes as can be easily inferred from fig 10 f the average drag coefficient is the combined effect of both the formation length l f and the influenced wake width w where the formation length l f parameter influences the drag forces such that a longer formation length may correspond to lower drag forces and vice versa alam et al 2010 while larger influenced wake width w correspond to larger drag forces it is evident from fig 10 f that the influenced wake width w holds an even greater influence on the drag forces as compared to the formation length l f it is also clear from fig 10 f that the wake width w parameter does not have much influence on the average drag forces as depicted here 6 7 mean transverse velocity time averaged transverse velocity contours are shown in fig 11 for the identified regimes positive values of transverse velocity are represented by solid lines and a red fill in the contours while negative values are represented using dashed lines and a blue fill it is seen for all selected cases that on the upstream side of the cylinder the flow gains a transverse component v to its velocity magnitude in order to flow around the cylinder which later switches directions as it crosses the cylinder towards the downstream side and then disappears some distance downstream from the center of the cylinder this added transverse component of velocity is shown to be positive for y 0 while it is negative for y 0 on the upstream side on the downstream side this transverse component of velocity is negative for y 0 and positive for y 0 due to the entrainment of ambient fluid into the wake as is apparent from the figure flow behavior in the upstream side is almost consistent for all cases and almost all the changes are observed only on the downstream side the value of maximum magnitude of transverse velocity as identified in each case represents an affinity for entrainment such that a higher value represents a stronger entrainment from fig 11 a it is seen that in regime a the flow reaches a maximum v 0 131 this maximum v is achieved approximately at a distance of x 2 7 downstream from the center of cylinder the flow accelerates from y 0 75 to its maximum value at y 0 75 and then decelerates as it approaches the wake symmetry line at y 0 symmetric horizontal line passing through the center of the cylinder whereupon the flow becomes parallel to the incident flow for all the selected cases the behavior of the downstream flow is seen to be mostly similar although changes to the positions and strength of the maximum lateral velocity are observed for each regime regime b1 fig 11 b shows minimal changes to the pattern depicted in regime a fig 11 a here the maximum lateral velocity has decreased slightly to v 0 128 representing a slower entrainment of fluid into the wake and hence the position of maximum lateral velocity shifts farther from the center of the cylinder to approximately x 3 0 during lock in the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder are greatly increased and for the representative case of regime b2 fig 11 c the maximum oscillation amplitude is y m a x 0 55 d i e the cylinder is oscillating with much greater amplitudes as compared to the other regimes this allows for a stronger fluid entrainment into the wake and a much quicker wake recovery this is also portrayed in fig 11 c where it is seen that the maximum lateral velocity magnitude v 0 391 is almost three times more than that for regime a fig 11 a while its position is shifted much closer to the cylinder at almost x 1 0 fig 11 d and e also continue the same trend of the value of maximum lateral velocity magnitudes controlling its location downstream from the center of the cylinder where for regime b3 v 0 282 at x 1 8 and for regime c v 0 222 at x 1 85 showing a relatively stronger fluid entrainment into the wake and hence a quicker wake recovery when compared with regime a fig 11 a although the changes among regime b3 and regime c fig 11 d and e are once again minimal as was the case with regime a and regime b1 fig 11 a and b 6 8 mean vorticity fig 12 shows the contours of normalized mean vorticity ω for the representative cases of identified regimes mean vorticity for each case was normalized using the free stream flow velocity for each case in order to make them more comparable a similar contour increment δ ω 0 2 is adopted for all positive and negative ω clockwise vorticity is assigned a negative value and depicted in fig 12 with blue color while anti clockwise vorticity is assigned a positive value and depicted by red color from fig 12 it is observed that the normalized mean vorticity contours for regimes a b1 and c fig 12 a b and e are more or less similar to those for a stationary cylinder but for regimes b2 and b3 fig 12 c and d there exists a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected in the wake of the cylinder the counter rotating vortex pair in the representative case of regime b2 fig 12 c has a maximum strength of ω 0 6241 with the peaks located at a streamwise distance of 1 5 d from the center of the cylinder while a maximum strength of ω 0 3306 is observed in the representative case of regime b3 fig 12 d having peaks located at a streamwise distance of 2 4 d from the center of the cylinder the strength and proximity of these counter rotating vortices is thus seen to fade as reynolds number increases and flow switches between different regimes as is also apparent from the cases depicted in fig 12 the existence of these counter rotating vortex pairs in regimes b2 and b3 fig 12 c and d can be attributed to the large transverse oscillation amplitudes that exist in these regimes the shedding of vortices from the cylinder when seen in conjunction with the cylinder position reveals that vortices are being shed on the opposite side of the wake symmetry line as compared to regimes a b1 and c fig 12 a b and e those shed vortices then translate towards their expected sides of the wake symmetry line it is also notable that faster wake recovery in regime b2 fig 12 c as discussed earlier enhances this translation of the counter rotating pair resulting in a quicker return to the normal side as compared to that in regime b3 fig 12 d 6 9 instantaneous vorticity fig 13 shows the instantaneous vorticity contours for the representative cases of identified regimes at three distinct instances namely ymax yzero and ymin which correspond to the cylinder position in terms of its transverse oscillation amplitudes the instantaneous vorticity iso contours have been normalized using the inlet flow velocity for each case and depicted here using the same contour maximum levels of 1 with a contour level increment of 0 1 for all cases the dashed red lined circle represents the original position of the cylinder and the horizonal dashed white line represents the wake symmetry line at y 0 these contours portray the vorticial structures generated due to the obstruction to flow offered by an oscillating circular cylinder placed in the flow the streamwise offset of the cylinder from the original position is visibly increasing as the reynolds number of the flow increases as seen from top to bottom the instantaneous vorticity contours for regime b2 and b3 clearly depict the penetration of oppositely signed vortices on the other sides of the wake symmetry line breaking the norm and resulting in the formation of counter rotating vortices in the mean vorticity contours fig 12 c and d as has been discussed earlier 6 10 oscillation parameters 6 10 1 c l and y oscillation phase also shown in fig 13 are a representation of the lift coefficient signal during a single cycle of cylinder oscillation and the corresponding signal of transverse oscillation during the same period of time for all identified regimes the signals have not been displayed on a similar scale in order to accommodate better visualization the difference in oscillation amplitudes is comparably shown later in fig 14 on a uniform scale the lift coefficient signal is shown as a black line while the transverse oscillation signal is shown as a red line it is seen from fig 13 that the lift coefficient c l is completely in phase with the y oscillation for regime a where the lift coefficient has peak values c l p e a k 0 28 and transverse oscillation has peak values y p e a k 0 02 d in regime b1 the two remain in phase while the peaks of lift coefficient shift to c l p e a k 0 71 and those for y oscillation reach the value y p e a k 0 125 d culminating in an almost six fold increase in transverse oscillation for a 2 5 times increase in lift coefficient as compared to regime a regime b2 continues the trend of in phase c l and y but with decreased lift amplitude having peaks at c l p e a k 0 39 and increased oscillation amplitude having y p e a k 0 54 d in regime b3 c l and y oscillation are observed to be anti phase with peaks of lift decreasing greatly in value to c l p e a k 0 03 while the y oscillation peaks also decrease to y p e a k 0 35 d similarly in regime c the c l and y oscillation remain anti phase however the lift coefficient rises significantly to c l p e a k 0 35 although the y oscillation amplitude peaks drop greatly to y p e a k 0 03 d this change in phase as observed here is in line with the observations made by prasanth and mittal 2008 where a similar phase switching was observed between the c l and y oscillations and the phase jump was observed in the middle of the synchronization region this jump in phase is attributed to the changes in the value as well as location of maximum suction pressure on both sides of the wake symmetry line this phase jump does not induce any significant changes to the pattern of shedding vortices and simply acts as one of the self limiting mechanisms of the oscillator to return the system to limit cycle oscillations 6 11 cylinder trajectory fig 14 shows a comparison of the oscillation paths followed by the cylinder for each of the representative cases of identified regimes the distance traversed by the cylinder was normalized using the cylinder diameter d it is seen here that in regime a r e 78 and c r e 140 the oscillation amplitude is quite small while it increases greatly within the lock in or synchronization region i e regime b r e 82 r e 95 and r e 121 the path traversed by the cylinder in regime a r e 78 and regime c r e 140 is a figure eight path having a concave orientation with respect to the inlet flow direction refer to in sets in fig 14 in regime b1 r e 82 the cylinder shows a transitioning pattern and follows a size varying figure eight path only a single cycle of which is shown here in fig 14 the trajectory followed by the cylinder in regime b2 r e 95 and b3 r e 121 is a figure eight path having a convex orientation with respect to the inlet flow direction this change in orientation from concave to convex to concave again can be attributed to the presence of counter rotating vortices on the opposite sides of the wake symmetry lines in the synchronization or lock in region that tend to alter the direction vector of the forces exerted by the shedding vortices consequently contributing to the change in orientation of the figure eight path taken by the cylinder projections of streamwise and transverse oscillations of the cylinder normalized by cylinder diameter are presented for a reynolds number range of r e 70 to r e 150 in fig 15 the change in projections of y oscillation shows a similar trend to the changes in projections of x oscillation throughout the reynolds number range albeit having vastly differing amplitudes since y projection shows a maximum value of 1 17 d while the maximum projection of x oscillations reaches only 0 017 d which is almost seventy times lower than the y oscillation projections although when comparing the changes in x and y projections for the selected reynolds number range to those for r e 70 the influence of lock in or synchronization becomes apparent as shown in fig 16 it is observed that the change in x oscillation projections is much greater than the change in y oscillation projections when compared to the corresponding projections of r e 70 throughout the regime b2 and almost halfway through regime b3 y oscillation projections show a maximum of 58 times increase when compared to the y oscillation projections of r e 70 the x oscillation projections however show a maximum change of 109 times increase from the x oscillation projections of r e 70 this behavior can also be explained by the strength and location of the counter rotating vortices as already discussed before present on the opposite sides of the wake symmetry line in the downstream vicinity of the cylinder as the reynolds number increases these counter rotating vortices decrease in strength and move further away from the cylinder their influence on the streamwise displacement of the cylinder becomes minimal and eventually disappears by the middle of regime b3 6 12 heat transfer vortex shedding from a surface can enhance the heat transfer from the body through convection vortices shed from the body allow the fluid enclosed within these low pressure regions to carry heat away from the surface in order to gain a better insight into this phenomenon a constant temperature difference was maintained between the incident flow and the cylinder surface the temperature difference was kept very small i e δt 2 k for all cases completed in this study so that it does not affect the thermo physical properties of the fluid effects of this temperature difference have been analyzed here in terms of nusselt number 6 13 space and time averaged nusselt number n u heat transfer from the surface of a cylinder is known to be sensitive to the flow conditions around the cylinder fig 17 shows a plot of time and space averaged nusselt number n u for the cylinder exposed to flows having reynolds number ranging from r e 70 to r e 150 as observed from fig 17 n u value increases almost monotonically with an increase in reynolds number starting from n u 10 02 at r e 70 all the way to n u 15 23 at r e 150 however the slope of n u in regime b1 and in the latter portion of regime b3 drops slightly in comparison with other regimes this changing slope of n u is easily discernible in fig 17 a sudden drop in n u is observed right before switching from regime b1 to b2 the red line in fig 17 represents the standard deviation plot for all cases discussed it is observed that the standard deviation in n u shows a large spike upon entry into the synchronization region whereby it gradually decreases as reynolds number is increased further into the lock in regime this shows that a much greater difference exists between the maximum and minimum values of nusselt number n u for each case within the lock in region especially in regime b2 than it does outside the synchronization region this can be attributed to the large oscillation amplitudes and consequently shifting of position of maximum nusselt number in the lock in region 6 14 time averaged local nusselt number nu time averaged local nusselt number n u along the surface of the cylinder is shown in fig 18 for the identified regimes where θ 0 lies at the mean downstream stagnation point and θ 180 lies at the front of the cylinder facing incident flow it is observed that at the mean front stagnation point θ 180 mean local nusselt number n u 19 4 19 9 22 24 9 and 27 shows a monotonic increase with reynolds number r e 78 82 95 121 and 140 this is however not the case on the downstream side of the cylinder where at the downstream stagnation point θ 0 even though the higher reynolds numbers r e 121 and 140 do yield the higher nusselt numbers n u 10 1 and 12 2 respectively but for the remaining cases under observation i e r e 78 82 and 95 the corresponding nusselt numbers n u 8 29 8 12 and 6 56 show an inverse trend of decreasing values with increasing reynolds numbers it is also interesting to note that when locating the minimum values of nusselt numbers for an increasing order of reynolds numbers r e 78 82 95 121 and 140 the minimum values of nusselt numbers n u 2 54 2 72 4 79 4 12 and 3 04 respectively are seen which show an exactly inverted trend to the observation made at the downstream stagnation point the locations of these minimum values of mean nusselt number also vary along the surface of the cylinder it is also seen that the representative case of regime b2 i e r e 95 shows the highest minimum nusselt number value which can be attributed to the absence of recirculation bubble behind the cylinder and the large oscillation amplitudes contributing to a better convective heat transfer from the cylinder surface all around it rather than only the front face this can also be seen in the mean temperature iso contours in fig 19 c where the mean temperature contours for regime b2 r e 95 clearly show a much quicker heat dissipation as compared to the rest of the cases also worth noting here is the more centrally aligned shape of mean temperature gradient in fig 19 c and d rather than the two pronged iso contours for the other regimes this can be attributed to the path taken by the shedding vortices for each case 6 15 maximum local nusselt number the value of local nusselt number on the cylinder surface is not constant but changes due to development of the thermal boundary layer the maximum value of local nusselt number n u m a x for a stationary cylinder lies at the front stagnation point i e θ 180 when the cylinder is free to oscillate location of the front stagnation point and consequently the maximum local nusselt number n u m a x on the cylinder surface changes this change in location is caused by the presence of asymmetric boundary layers on either side of the cylinder changes to the location and value of n u m a x over one complete cycle of cylinder oscillation have been shown in fig 20 the smallest changes in location of n u m a x are observed in the cases with the smallest oscillation amplitudes r e 78 and 140 reaching up to θ 3 and 6 respectively the largest change in location is seen for r e 95 reaching up to θ 63 a change in n u m a x location of θ 18 and 33 is seen for r e 82 and 121 respectively changes in the value of n u m a x are also observed to follow a similar trend with r e 78 having the smallest change of δ n u m a x 0 0066 while r e 95 showed the largest change of δ n u m a x 1 8531 the changes to the value of n u m a x for the remaining cases are also seen to be representative of their oscillation angles as δ n u m a x 0 159 0 581 and 0 007 for r e 82 121 and 140 respectively 6 16 normalized mean velocity contours boundary layer profile fig 21 shows the mean streamwise velocity contours normalized by the inlet flow velocity for reynolds number r e 78 this was done to accentuate the change in velocities and consequently elaborate the effects of shear thinning of the boundary layer around the cylinder with an increase in reynolds number a constant contour increment of δ u 0 1 was adopted for all positive values for an easier comparison a maximum contour level u 1 was selected to emphasize the locations in the contours where the flow velocity exceeds that of reynolds number r e 78 mean velocity profiles for all selected cases have been plotted in fig 22 along the normal to two distinct locations on the surface of the cylinder depicted in fig 21 as dashed black lines i when the normal is parallel to the incident flow θ 180 ii when the normal is perpendicular to the incident flow θ 90 the velocity profiles have been shown up to a distance of 2 d from the surface of the cylinder for a stationary cylinder the front stagnation point lies at θ 180 while for a freely oscillating cylinder the front stagnation point shifts across a wider range of angular locations on the surface of the cylinder during a complete cycle of oscillations hence the mean velocity profiles for a stationary cylinder tend to be completely different from the ones depicted here in fig 22 the value of relative velocity u u r e 78 1 is depicted as a vertical dotted line black in fig 22 when a flow is obstructed by a bluff body effects of that obstruction can be observed at considerable distances upstream from the location of the body in the form of a decrease in velocity the same is observed in fig 22 a where the r e 78 velocity profile does not achieve the inlet velocity even at a distance of 2 d upstream from the cylinder same is also seen for r e 82 as the reduction in velocity is considerable and even an increased inlet velocity does not achieve the flow velocity for r e 78 on the front of the cylinder the velocity profile for r e 140 achieves the relative velocity u u r e 78 1 at a distance of 0 37 d from the surface of the cylinder comparatively it is seen that in fig 22 b all velocity profiles manage to cross the threshold of u u r e 78 1 on the top side of the cylinder this is because the resistance to the flow is minimum at the top edge of the cylinder it is seen that the re78 velocity profile crosses the threshold at a distance of 0 16 d from the cylinder surface while that of r e 140 crosses the u u r e 78 1 threshold at 0 065 d this shows the thinning effect of the boundary layer at the top of the cylinder by a factor of almost 5 6 times that at the front of the cylinder this thinning of the boundary layer on the surface of the cylinder also contributes to increased heat transfer from the surface of the cylinder due to higher flow velocities and increased proximity of the cylinder surface to the free stream flow 6 17 correlation for space and time averaged nusselt number space and time averaged nusselt number n u is affected by various factors which include reynolds number of the flow strouhal frequency transverse and streamwise oscillation amplitudes the dependence of n u on these parameters can be consolidated into a linear correlation obtained by performing an extensive multivariate regression analysis as done by yawar et al 2019 for a rotationally oscillating cylinder to this effect a least squares based method is used for performing the analysis in which reynolds number root mean square values of streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal number have been treated as independent variables whose effects on the dependent variable n u were recorded simultaneously the correlation thus obtained is presented in eqn 18 18 n u ˆ 6 2043 0 0687 r e 252 7345 x r m s 2 1045 y r m s 6 5278 s t regarding the accuracy and reliability of the proposed correlation table 7 shows the regression statistics where the accuracy of regression is displayed in terms of r 2 and adjusted r 2 r 2 represents the percentage of output variable that is being explained by the input variable while adjusted r 2 gives a conservative estimate of the same in the current case r 2 0 9901 o r 99 01 while a d j u s t e d r 2 0 9891 o r 98 91 point out that almost 99 of the variants of the dependent variable n u have been explained by the independent variables selected for the regression table 8 shows the analysis of variance for the conducted test and as shown by the extremely low value of s i g n i f i c a n c e f 1 9854 e 42 which is the probability of error and has a commonly acceptable standard value of 5 or 0 05 the regression performed is extremely reliable table 9 shows a comparison of the actual simulation results for n u in the present work with the values of n u ˆ obtained from the above correlation maximum difference between the predicted and actual values is found to be under 3 25 for all cases fig 23 compares the predicted values and the actual values it is also worth mentioning here that the regression analysis performed also divulged the contribution of various independent variables towards the dependent variable it was observed that x r m s contributes almost twice as much as the y r m s towards the nusselt number this also explains the decreasing slope of n u in latter half of regime b3 in fig 17 as it has previously been observed in fig 16 the relative change in x projection takes a steep dive in the latter half of the regime b3 and thus may be responsible for the levelling out of the slope of n u in the same regime 7 conclusions flow dynamics cylinder response and heat transfer from a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder were analyzed numerically for an incompressible laminar flow within a reynolds number range 70 r e 150 the structural natural frequency f n was set as constant along both axis f n f n x f n y and equal to the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder at r e 100 variations in strouhal number frequency ratios oscillation amplitudes force coefficients as well as local and space and time averaged nusselt number were studied in detail some interesting phenomenon was observed during this study that had not before been discussed in literature strouhal number is observed to change its behavior depending upon the flow regime while for the non lock in regions it follows almost the same trend as a stationary cylinder with in lock in or synchronization region it switches towards the non dimensional natural frequency with identifiable variations in its behavior within the different regimes of lock in frequency ratio also follows a similar trend as set by strouhal number while it follows the trends of frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder in the non lock in region it jumps towards a constant frequency ratio f r 1 in the lock in region albeit with differing behaviors in the different identified regimes of lock in larger recirculation bubbles are observed in the non lock in regimes while the recirculation bubbles are seen to completely disappear in pure lock in cases and then re appear in the transition to post lock in cases this disappearance hasn t been noted in literature before and may be attributed to the large oscillation amplitudes within the lock in regime the vortex formation length l f decreases while the influenced wake width w increases with an increase in oscillation amplitudes the wake width w remains almost independent of any variations in cylinder oscillations a much quicker wake recovery is observed for cases having small formation lengths l f coupled with large influenced wake widths w average drag coefficient c d is also higher for cases having smaller formation lengths l f and large influenced wake widths w streamwise velocity fluctuations are observed in front of the cylinder as well for cases having small formation lengths l f and large influenced wake widths w a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected is observed behind the cylinder in the mean vorticity field for high oscillation amplitude cases which alters the cylinder trajectory from a concave figure eight shape to a convex figure eight shape with reference to inlet flow direction the signals of lift coefficient and transverse oscillation are also observed to change phase from in phase to anti phase in the middle of the synchronization region the transverse and streamwise oscillations are observed to follow an almost identical pattern of rise and fall with an increase in reynolds number as the system enters and exits the lock in region however the maximum relative change in values when compared to the values at r e 78 is observed to be much greater for the streamwise oscillations 109 times than the transverse oscillations 58 times an almost monotonous increase in space and time averaged nusselt number n u is observed for increasing reynolds numbers although the standard deviation is much higher in lock in region as compared to the non lock in regions the time averaged local nusselt number n u around the cylinder shows an increasing trend with an increase in reynolds number on the upstream side θ 180 however on the downstream side θ 0 it decreases with an increase in reynolds number till the middle of the synchronization region after which it again increases with an increase in reynolds number the maximum local nusselt number varies in value as well as location on the surface of the cylinder in direct correspondence with the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder a linear correlation is proposed by performing a multivariate regression analysis that uses reynolds number root mean square values of streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal frequency to predict the space and time averaged nusselt number n u ˆ up to a maximum of 3 5 deviation with the simulation data

20248,numerical analyses are carried out to investigate the flow physics and heat transfer from an undamped freely oscillating circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers for an incompressible constant property newtonian fluid mass ratio is fixed at 10 while the prandtl number is 7 natural frequency of the system is set equal to the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary circular cylinder at reynolds number of 100 new results pertaining to the oscillation trajectory shapes vortex formation length influenced wake width and average nusselt number in view of the pre lock in lock in and post lock in flow regimes are presented and discussed in detail recirculation bubble behind the cylinder disappears for large oscillation amplitudes during lock in while a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected is observed behind the cylinder in the mean vorticity field which alters the shape of the cylinder trajectory average drag coefficient is shown to be directly proportional to the vortex formation length while it is inversely related to the influenced wake width streamwise oscillations are noted to be more sensitive to the increasing reynolds number during lock in as compared to the transverse oscillations progressively increasing space and time averaged nusselt number values comparably higher than stationary cylinder are observed as reynolds number increases the behavior of time averaged local nusselt number varies with position around the surface of the cylinder the maximum local nusselt number on the surface of the cylinder is also seen to vary both in magnitude as well as location on the surface of the cylinder in a direct correspondence with the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder moreover a regression correlation is proposed which relates reynolds number root mean squared streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal number with the space and time averaged nusselt number graphical abstract

dynamic response analysis and behavior of flow around freely oscillating circular cylinders is widely studied due to their practical applications in the design of heat exchangers risers tall buildings and offshore rigs as well as transmission cables and cables for structural support modeling them as freely oscillating cylinders is done for simplicity despite the simplistic circular geometry it can be related to many shapes of bluff bodies since many if not most of the examples discussed earlier have circular geometries a circular cylinder in fluid flow faces instabilities in the flow beyond r e 47 which culminate into the periodic shedding of vortices from the cylinder vibrations caused by these periodically shed vortices from the cylinder are known as vortex induced vibrations viv many review studies have been conducted to investigate the vortex induced vibrations from different perspectives for example bearman 1984 2011 blevins 1977 sarpkaya 1995 williamson and govardhan 2004 and nakamuraet al 2013 in scenarios when the ratio of the frequency of shedding vortices f v and the natural frequency of the system f n approaches unity i e lock in or synchronization oscillation amplitude is greatly increased and can have grave consequences resulting in structural failure for example nishihara et al 2005 besides the numerous hazards associated with vivs there are also some scenarios where they might be utilized for the better like harvesting the energy of the vibrating cylinder for electrical power generation using vortex turbines bernitsas et al 2008a 2008b and mehmood et al 2013 the natural frequency of the system f n the velocity of the free stream flow u characteristic length of the cylinder diameter d and viscosity of the flowing fluid μ greatly affect the dynamic response of the cylinder which is characterized by frequency ratio and oscillation amplitude among others these can be brought together in non dimensional terms namely reduced velocity u u f n d and reynolds number r e ρ u d μ vortex induced vibrations are mostly modeled considering only one degree of freedom of the cylinder where only oscillations transverse to the free stream flow are considered the mass damping parameter comprising of mass ratio m and structural damping coefficient ζ greatly affects the response of the cylinder as shown by feng 1968 brika and laneville 1993 and khalak and williamson 1996 1999 feng 1968 was the first to identify the presence of initial branch of cylinder response as well as a lower branch and observed that higher oscillation amplitudes were present in the lower branch of cylinder response only for high mass damping cases in low mass damping scenarios however a three branch initial lower and upper response was observed by khalak and williamson 1996 where the upper branch of cylinder response displayed higher oscillation amplitudes a hysteretic behavior was observed in the switching of modes between upper and initial branches possibly due to the sudden change in vibration amplitude and vortical structure however for cases showing insignificant changes to the structure of the wake a sporadic behavior was seen in the mode transition between upper and lower branches change in the wake mode in initial and upper branches was confirmed when govardhan and williamson 2000 observed a sudden jump in the phase angle between cylinder displacement and the vortex force experimental study was carried out by klamo et al 2006 which identified reynolds number as a critical influencer to the effect that only the initial and lower branches of cylinder response are seen for cases having low reynolds number and high damping while a three branched cylinder response is seen in cases having high reynolds number and low damping a three branch response however has also been observed for low damping as well as a low reynolds number re 300 by dorogi and baranyi 2020 where the upper branch is bounded by two phase changes between the initial and the lower branch in order to emulate a wider range of engineering applications a two degree of freedom motion is allowed for the cylinder in which the cylinder is free to translate both in line with the free stream flow as well as transverse to it generally different values of natural frequencies f n x a n d f n y are observed in each of the two directions a natural frequency ratio ranging from equal to twice i e f n x f n y 1 2 was studied by moe and wu 1990 sarpkaya 1995 and dahl et al 2006 2007 experimentally while similar studies were done numerically by bao et al 2012 and wang et al 2017 the effect of mass ratio on a special condition restrictive case of f n x f n y f n was analyzed by jauvtis and williamson 2004 it was seen that for a medium mass ratio 6 m 25 the in line component of oscillation has negligible effect on the transverse component of oscillation for lower mass ratios m 6 however a 2 t mode each cycle of motion has two triple vortices shed from cylinder of cylinder wake was observed accompanied by a super upper branch of cylinder response having higher oscillation amplitudes a third harmonic component of the total lift force associated with 2 t vortex shedding mode was thus defined increasing the reynolds number introduces three dimensional instabilities in the flow the three dimensional instabilities for a stationary circular cylinder were investigated using a floquet stability analysis by barkley and henderson 1996 and classified as mode a starting at re 189 while mode b starting at re 259 the cylinder oscillations tend to extend the two dimensionality of the flow structure over a wider reynolds number range the upper limit of which has not been realized yet as was seen experimentally by bearman and obasaju 1982 and koide et al 2002 and numerically by poncet 2002 apart from the mass damping parameter ζ and reduced velocity u reynolds number re is also a key influencer as shown by klamo et al 2006 and govardhan and williamson 2006 even though u and re are dependent variables many studies segregate them to probe into their influence independently leontini et al 2006 analyzed the effects of reduced velocity by restricting the cylinder to one dimensional transverse oscillations at a reynolds number of 200 mass ratio of 10 and damping coefficient of 0 01 two branches of response were thus identified a low amplitude initial and a relatively higher amplitude lower branch a 2 s mode of vortex shedding two single vortices shed in a vortex shedding period as per the notations of williamson and roshko 1988 was seen in the initial branch while a c 2 s mode was found in the lower branch where the c represents the coalescence of the negative and positive vortices in the cylinder wake singh and mittal 2005 investigated the influence of both reduced velocity as well as reynolds number by performing the computations firstly with reynolds number fixed at 100 and varying the reduced velocity and secondly by fixing the reduced velocity at 4 92 and varying the reynolds number they observed the hysteretic behavior of initial and lower branch switching the same way as shown by brika and laneville 1993 as well as at the upper boundary of the lower branch confirmed later by klamo et al 2006 they also identified 2 s mode in low oscillation range and c 2 s mode of vortex shedding for relatively higher amplitudes which is consistent with the findings of leontini et al 2006 besides these they noted the formation of a p s mode one pair one single vortex shed per cycle of motion of vortex shedding for re 300 dorogi and baranyi 2019 also identified similar asymmetric wake modes which they associated to the occurrence of raindrop shaped cylinder path when investigating the effects of varying natural frequency of the cylinder assuming a constant natural frequency reduced velocity has a linear relation with reynolds number r e k u where k f n d 2 v also known as the dimensionless natural frequency prasanth et al 2006 and prasanth and mittal 2008 investigated aspects of 2 dof free vibration for a circular cylinder prasanth et al 2006 focused on the influence of blockage ratio ratio of diameter of cylinder to the height of computation domain in good agreement with the observations noted by singh and mittal 2005 hysteresis loops were seen at both the upper as well as lower edges of the synchronization range they identified a direct relation of the blockage ratio to the width of hysteresis loop on the lower edge of the synchronization range prasanth and mittal 2008 calculated the phase angle between coefficient of lift and the transverse oscillation component and observed a phase jump of almost 180 at the middle of the synchronization region attributed to the pressure component of the total lift mittal and singh 2005 observed the vortex induced vibrations phenomenon occurring at reynolds number 20 for very low non dimensional natural frequencies which for a stationary cylinder is in steady state they also observed that an increase in the mass ratio tends to bring the values of vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency closer together confirming the experimental observations by williamson and govardhan 2004 dorogi and baranyi 2018 selected a range of non dimensional natural frequencies extending from 12 to 35 and found that the rms value of drag coefficient tends to zero around u s t o 0 5 the location of the jump in phase angle between in line oscillation component and the drag coefficient while numerous studies exist in literature for the investigation of heat transfer from stationary hieber and gebhart 1968 baranyi 2003 behara and mittal 2010 qu et al 2013 rotating badr and dennis 1985 ingham and tang 1990 kang et al 1999 sufyan et al

yawar et al 2019 those for the complex case of a freely oscillating cylinder are few and far karanth et al 1994 carried out the investigations for the heat transfer from a circular cylinder at reynolds number r e 200 by considering one dimensional forced oscillations of the cylinder they analyzed the effects of inline oscillations as well as transverse oscillations separately cheng et al 1997 investigated the heat transfer from a transversely oscillating cylinder an increase in drag coefficient as well as nusselt number was observed when oscillation amplitude was increased garg et al 2019 also analyzed the effects of thermal buoyancy on a transverse only oscillation of circular cylinder for a mixed convection heat transfer analysis and found that the presence of thermal buoyancy results in a wider lock in range and an amplified oscillation response of the cylinder as compared to when thermal buoyancy is not considered izadpanah et al 2018 numerically studied the effect of viv on the heat transfer of an oscillating circular cylinder as well as other arrangements by adding fins to the cylinder they discovered that convective heat transfer is enhanced by the addition of fins yang et al 2020 numerically analyzed the forced convection from a freely oscillating cylinder at reynolds number re 100 for a number of reduced velocities where they observed an increase of 5 73 in time and space averaged nusselt number in comparison with a stationary cylinder the change in the heat transfer behavior of flow around a 2 dof oscillating cylinder as it transitions from non lock in regime to lock in and again into non lock in regime for a reynolds number range within the laminar regime has not yet been discussed to the best of the authors knowledge in the current study an incompressible fluid flowing across a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder is investigated numerically the cylinder is allowed a freedom of two dimensional translational oscillations in undamped conditions i e ζ 0 a low mass ratio of m 10 is selected constant natural frequency cases at r e o 100 are investigated fixing the natural frequency as constant allows for the system to transition in and out of lock in or synchronization based on the inlet flow velocity variation alone which is a more realistic scenario the dynamic response of the cylinder variations in the aerodynamic coefficients frequency oscillation amplitude cylinder trajectory as well as the heat transfer behavior due to vortex induced vibrations for a reynolds number range spanning the pre lock in to lock in and then proceeding into the post lock in regimes within the two dimensional flow regime are presented and discussed 2 problem description a two dimensional free oscillation of a rigid circular cylinder immersed in an incompressible fluid with pr 7 is analyzed in a two dimensional laminar flow regime for 70 r e 150 with uniform flow at inlet the mass ratio is fixed as m 10 while the structural damping coefficient is set to zero ζ 0 natural frequency f n of the system is assumed equal to the frequency of vortex shedding from a stationary circular cylinder at r e 100 therefore the non dimensional natural frequency varies with reynolds number of the flow only oscillation frequencies both in the transverse and in line directions are equal i e f n f n x f n y dynamic response in terms of oscillation amplitudes non dimensional lift and drag coefficients mean flow streamlines streamwise and transverse velocity fields and instantaneous vorticity contours at different cylinder positions along the oscillation curve is presented and discussed heat transfer analysis under these conditions is presented using space and time averaged nusselt number contours of normalized mean wake temperature and time averaged local nusselt number in addition boundary layer velocity profiles are used to discuss the flow dynamics near the cylinder surface a regression analysis is presented which highlights the contribution of various independent variables to the heat transfer from the cylinder surface in terms of space and time averaged nusselt number 3 governing equations dimensionless governing equations solved in the present study are the continuity equation the two relevant components of the navier stokes equations the energy equation for heat transfer and the two degree of

specific heat of the fluid fig 1 shows the setup used for the computations from a structural viewpoint the cylinder is assigned identical spring constants k as well as the damping coefficients b in both the streamwise and transverse directions i e k k x k y and b b x b y 0 the case specific two degree of freedom equations of motion for a circular cylinder translating in x as well as y directions may be written as follows 5 m x b x x k x x f d 6 m y b y y k y y f l where m b and k are the equivalent mass damping and spring stiffness for the vibration system while f d and f l are the drag and lift force per unit area the non dimensional structural equations used to determine the cylinder displacements in terms of non dimensional direction coordinates x y are written following dorogi and baranyi 2018 7 x 4 π ζ u x 2 π u 2 x 2 c d t π m and 8 y 4 π ζ u y 2 π u 2 y 2 c l t π m where x and y are the streamwise and transverse displacements of the cylinder in terms of non dimensional

local nusselt number respectively and polar angle θ is the angle determined in the counter clockwise direction with respect to the positive x axis numerical simulations are performed using ansys fluent the incompressible flow is solved on the grid using unsteady two dimensional segregated solvers momentum and energy equations are discretized using second order upwind scheme pressure implicit with split operator piso is applied to solve continuity momentum and energy equations quickly transient formulation is resolved using second order implicit approach with non iterative time advancement nita custom functions are employed to meet the specific modeling requirements allowing for the free oscillatory motion of the cylinder 4 independence studies for this research circular cylinder in the center of a polar domain is considered fig 1 diameter of the circular cylinder is d while the extents of the domain have a diameter d the domain size is most commonly referred to in non dimensional terms as a ratio of diameter of selected domain to the diameter of the cylinder i e d d for the present research three different diameter ratios d d were considered and compared in table 1 each of these domain sizes is used to simulate flow around the freely oscillating cylinder at reynolds number r e 100 considering a reduced velocity u 6 082 mildly informed arbitrary values selected through literature review are considered for the number of nodes on the cylinder n 200 and the non dimensional time step δ t 0 005 for initial testing results show negligible variation in values for the domain sizes d d 160 a n d 240 as can be seen in table 1 a maximum deviation of 0 085 is observed for y r m s domain size of d d 160 is therefore selected for further testing a detailed grid independence study is conducted for the selection of appropriately sized and distributed mesh to be used for simulation three different values for the number of nodes on the cylinder n 200 240 a n d 280 are selected structured grids with varying mesh density are generated the node distribution normal to the cylinder surface controlled by the number of nodes normal to the cylinder m is varied to achieve a much finer mesh distribution closer to the surface of the cylinder while keeping the aspect ratio of cells close to unity since the problem is dynamic in nature a diffusion based spring type dynamic mesh is used to emulate the freely oscillating motion of the cylinder where the mesh is updated using a feedback system to calculate the appropriate new positions for the nodes at every time step fig 2 a shows the complete meshed domain fig 2 b shows the mesh close to the cylinder while fig 2 c shows the mesh close to the cylinder when the cylinder is at maximum oscillation amplitude for r e 100 simulations are conducted using the same values of r e 100 a n d u 6 082 as for the domain selection however the domain size d d 160 is now used results show a maximum deviation of 1 23 for c lrms between n 240 and 280 a complete comparison of results can be seen in table 2 using this comparison a mesh of dimensions n x m 240 x 204 is selected for further detailed analysis in this work the effect of non dimensional time step size δ t is also observed for the selection of an appropriate time step size to better resolve the flow characteristics to this end three different time step sizes are selected to conduct a simulation for a flow having r e 100 and u 6 082 using the domain size d d 160 and mesh size n x m 240 x 204 as selected earlier the influence of non dimensional time step size is compared in table 3 the comparison yields a maximum variation of 0 3 for y r m s between time step sizes δ t 0 0025 a n d 0 001 on the basis of this comparison a non dimensional time step size of δ t 0 0025 is selected for simulating the flow this independence study yields a set of parameters that are most optimized in the current setup to successfully simulate the flow around a freely oscillating two degrees of freedom cylinder results obtained using these selected parameters are therefore compared with the published data prasanth and mittal 2008 in table 4 for a flow having reynolds number r e 100 a maximum deviation of 1 51 is observed in c drms in light of these results the aforementioned set of parameters is chosen for further detailed analysis in this work 5 validation the optimal compromise in the combination of parameters hence identified by the independence studies are used to perform various stationary as well as freely oscillating circular cylinder simulations results thus obtained are compared with the literature for validation purposes a two step validation scheme is adopted in this work initially aerodynamic and heat transfer parameters for the case of a stationary cylinder are compared with relevant literature followed on by the comparison of pertinent simulation parameters for the case of an oscillating cylinder 5 1 stationary cylinder values of strouhal number s t time average drag coefficient c davg and root mean square rms value of lift coefficient c lrms obtained using the parameters identified by the independence studies are validated against the values obtained from baranyi and lewis 2006 table 5 a maximum deviation of 1 56 is observed for c davg it may be noted that results from present study are in good agreement throughout with the results of baranyi and lewis 2006 in order to further strengthen the validity of this research strouhal number s t for the complete range under study was validated against results published by williamson and roshko 1988 prasanth and mittal 2008 dorogi and baranyi 2018 baranyi 2003 henderson 1995 posdziech and grundmann 2007 and lima e silva et al 2003 in fig 3 strouhal number st shows good agreement throughout the whole reynolds number range nusselt number averaged over space and time n u is also calculated using the same parameters for a stationary cylinder at reynolds number r e 100 and prandtl number p r 7 for the validation of n u the correlations proposed by kramers 1946 churchill and bernstein 1977 and žukauskas 1972 for a stationary cylinder are used table 6 the correlation proposed by kramers 1946 is given by 15 n u 0 42 p r 0 2 0 57 r e 0 5 p r 0 31 while churchill and bernstein 1977 proposed their correlation as 16 n u 0 3 0 62 re 0 5 pr 0 33 1 0 4 pr 0 66 0 25 1 re 282000 0 62 0 8 and the correlation proposed by žukauskas 1972 is given as 17 n u 0 683 re 0 466 pr 0 333 assuming the appropriate values in these correlations yields n u 11 04 11 74 and 11 16 respectively the value of spatio temporal mean nusselt number n u obtained from the present work is calculated to be n u 11 86 deviation from these proposed correlations is calculated to be 7 43 1 02 and 6 27 respectively while these numbers have been presented for completeness it is important to keep in mind that these are empirical correlations with limited applicability deviation is therefore expected based upon the data provided above it may be considered that the solution scheme used in the current research is acceptable for simulation of a stationary cylinder 5 2 freely oscillating cylinder selected parameters have also been validated for a freely oscillating cylinder in two degrees of freedom results from numerical simulations in the present work are compared with prasanth and mittal 2008 dorogi and baranyi 2018 and he and zhang 2017 in fig 4 and fig 5 importantly the natural frequency is kept constant and equal to the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder at r e 100 comparison of aerodynamic coefficients in terms of root mean square values of drag and lift coefficient c drms c lrms is given in fig 4 a and b considering c drms in fig 4 a it is clear that the values are in good agreement with the published data apart from very small disagreements on the higher and lower threshold of the lock in or synchronization region c drms gains its peak value of c drms 0 3739 at r e 86 the lift coefficient c lrms however is a bit more wayward and although the values of current research are centrally placed among the published data it is seen that the values from published data itself are not in complete agreement but rather spread out especially within the lock in region this may be due to the fact that the cross flow induces much higher amplitudes of transverse oscillation within lock in which is contributed to mainly by the lift coefficient making it more sensitive to small changes in reynolds number c lrms peaks at re 85 with a peak value of c lrms 0 85 fig 5 a and b presents the cylinder response in terms of maximum transverse oscillation amplitude y m a x and root mean square value of streamwise oscillation amplitude x r m s the maximum transverse oscillation amplitude y m a x shows a very strong agreement with the published data some deviations from the results of he and zhang 2017 are observed at the higher threshold of synchronization region where current study shows y m a x 0 0516 d at r e 129 while the results of he and zhang 2017 show y m a x 0 2994 d at the same reynolds number still a good agreement is maintained even with the results of prasanth and mittal 2008 y m a x 0 0437 d and dorogi and baranyi 2018 y m a x 0 0529 d y m a x reaches its peak value y m a x 0 5783 d at r e 85 the root mean square value of streamwise displacement x r m s shows favorable agreement with the published results everywhere except for both the higher and lower thresholds of the synchronization region the lower threshold especially shows an extremely large deviation from the results of prasanth and mittal 2008 which show x r m s 0 0138 d at r e 85 however the results of he and zhang 2017 x r m s 0 0059 d and dorogi and baranyi 2018 x r m s 0 0058 d are in good agreement with the current research x r m s 0 006 d at the same reynolds number the x r m s peaks out with a maximum value of x r m s 0 0061 d at r e 86 the proposed scheme and methodology agree reasonably well with literature and are acceptable for use in the simulation of a two dimensionally freely oscillating cylinder 6 results and discussion results are presented for a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder different regimes have been identified on the basis of variation of strouhal number with change in reynolds number of the flow as shown in fig 6 strouhal number of oscillating cylinder s t is compared with the strouhal number of stationary cylinder s t o shown in fig 6 as a dashed orange line and the non dimensional natural frequency f n 1 u shown in fig 6 as a dotted red line calculated at the same value of reynolds numbers throughout simulations classification of these regimes is also apparent in fig 7 in terms of frequency ratio where the frequency ratio of oscillating cylinder is compared to the frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder shown in fig 7 as a dashed orange line and a line representing a constant frequency ratio f r 1 shown in fig 7 as a dotted red line fig 7 also shows the selected cases from identified regimes to be further explored for an in depth analysis of each regime these regimes and their representative cases are described below 1 regime a 70 r e 79 2 regime b 80 r e 127 o regime b1 80 r e 84 o regime b2 85 r e 104 o regime b3 105 r e 127 3 regime c 128 r e 150 6 1 regime a regime a comprises of the pre lock in cases where the strouhal number s t for the freely oscillating cylinder follows the same trend as that of the strouhal number s t o for a stationary cylinder at the same values of reynolds number for the flow as shown in fig 6 the value of s t at r e 70 is 0 147 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 145 having a percentage difference in values of 1 37 also the value of s t at r e 79 is 0 155 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 152 having a percentage difference in values of 1 97 the same is also seen in fig 7 where the frequency ratio for the freely oscillating cylinder shows the same trend as the frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder albeit a slight offset the value of oscillating cylinder frequency ratio at r e 70 is 0 625 while at the same re the value of stationary cylinder frequency ratio is 0 618 having a percentage difference in values of 1 12 also the value of oscillating cylinder frequency ratio at r e 79 is 0 746 while at the same re the value of stationary cylinder frequency ratio is 0 726 having a percentage difference in values of 2 68 the slight offset is clearly visible between the two lines for strouhal number as well as frequency ratios in figs 6 and 7 for the case of freely oscillating cylinder this slight offset can be attributed to the motion of the cylinder prasanth and mittal 2008 regime b covers the lock in cases for the freely oscillating cylinder showing three individual jumps throughout the range at re 80 85 and 127 respectively these three jumps encapsulate three different kinds of behaviors in terms of strouhal number and frequency ratios as shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively this provides good basis for division of regime b into three different sub regimes showing distinct flow properties the sub regimes are described as follows regime b1 regime b1 starts after the first jump at r e 80 in strouhal number as well as frequency ratio figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 the s t deviates from s t o with a sudden jump towards the non dimensional natural frequency although not entirely achieving the same value of 0 206 but rather stopping short at 0 185 during the regime b1 s t maintains an almost consistent offset from the non dimensional natural frequency line while following its downward trend with increasing values of reynolds number in fig 7 the same is seen in terms of frequency ratio where the frequency ratio for the oscillating cylinder takes a jump towards the f r 1 line but stops short of it at 0 9 and then proceeds almost parallel to it with increasing reynolds number regime b2 regime b2 follows the second jump at r e 85 in strouhal number and frequency ratio in figs 6 and 7 after entering the regime b2 the s t starts closing its gap with the non dimensional natural frequency and attains the same value at the end of regime b2 when r e 105 as shown in fig 6 a similar behavior in terms of frequency ratio may be noted in fig 7 where after the second jump frequency ratio for the oscillating cylinder starts approaching the value of f r 1 with increasing reynolds number it becomes 1 at the end of the regime b2 at r e 105 regime b3 the third sub regime regime b3 starts with s t f n and f r 1 at r e 105 from fig 6 it is seen that during the regime b3 s t follows exactly along the line of non dimensional natural frequency without any deviation the same is true for frequency ratio where it retains the value of f r 1 throughout the regime the third jump at r e 127 marks the end of the regime b3 and throws the system out of lock in 6 2 regime c regime c comprises of the post lock in cases following the third jump at r e 127 where s t once again switches towards s t o instead of the non dimensional natural frequency and then follows the trend of s t o thereafter as shown in fig 6 the value of s t at r e 128 is 0 169 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 176 having a percentage difference in values of 3 98 also the value of s t at r e 150 is 0 178 while at the same re the value of s t o is 0 183 having a percentage difference in values of 2 73 the s t shows a visibly larger offset of approximately 2 73 to almost 3 98 from s t o as compared to the one in regime a where it is in the range of 1 37 1 97 in fig 7 the frequency ratio also takes a jump from f r 1 towards the frequency ratio of stationary cylinder here also an offset larger than the one in regime a 1 37 1 97 is present seen to be showing similar percentage deviations 2 73 3 98 as strouhal number in the respective regimes this can again be similarly attributed to the oscillations of the cylinder as discussed by prasanth and mittal 2008 6 3 flow fields flow around a stationary cylinder has been thoroughly discussed in terms of the mean velocity fields but only a few studies have attempted to describe the velocity fields for an oscillating cylinder griffin 1971 forced oscillation at r e 200 and govardhan and williamson 2001 free oscillation at r e 3000 4000 have previously discussed them for the case of a circular cylinder oscillating only transversely using the mean velocity profiles downstream of the cylinder the contours for mean streamlines mean velocity fields for each of the components of velocity u and v and the root mean square value of u velocity for a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder are presented here the cases depicted here are an abstraction of their respective flow regimes as encountered by the freely oscillating circular cylinder they have all been normalized using the flow velocity of each case to highlight the variations in the mean velocity fields and an easier comparison 6 4 mean streamlines mean streamlines for the representative cases of flow regimes identified above are presented in fig 8 and show the presence of a recirculation bubble behind the cylinder for most cases discussed here similar to a stationary cylinder as seen by govardhan and williamson 2001 the recirculation bubble is a region of double spiraling reversed flow directed towards the cylinder bounded between the space saddle and the base of the cylinder as defined by younis et al 2016 the length of the recirculation bubble was calculated by measuring the distance of the space saddle point shown here as a red dot from the center of the cylinder the recirculation bubble length reaches 2 22 d downstream from the center of the cylinder for regime a r e 78 fig 8 a in regime b1 r e 82 fig 8 b it further extends to 2 29 d the recirculation bubble completely disappears in the regime b2 r e 95 fig 8 c whereby the saddle point is not observed even upon close inspection refer to in set fig 8 c large oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder may be attributed with the disappearance of the recirculation bubble in this regime the recirculation bubble once again appears for the regime b3 r e 121 fig 8 d and regime c r e 140 fig 8 e although with a much smaller recirculation bubble length of 1 23 d and 1 69 d respectively from fig 8 it is apparent that the formation as well as the length of recirculation bubble is dependent upon flow velocity as well as cylinder oscillation amplitudes it is seen to grow with an increase in flow velocity up to a certain length and diminish with an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the cylinder 6 5 mean streamwise velocity the contours of mean streamwise velocity u are presented in fig 9 a similar contour increment δ u 0 1 is adopted for all positive u for an easier comparison while the negative u is enclosed within a contour level u 0 representing the extents of the recirculation bubble the magnitude of u within that region and the size of the wake bubble gives a measure of recirculation strength referring to fig 9 it is observed that highly elongated negative velocity regions are present in regimes a and b1 fig 9 a and b while a comparatively much weaker and shorter wake bubble exists in regime b3 fig 9 d a moderately sized recirculation bubble observed in regime c fig 9 e shows the maximum strength of recirculation in all studied cases the wake bubble does not exist in regime b2 fig 9 c as has already been discussed in the previous section a representative measure of wake recovery is made in fig 9 on the basis of the position of a contour level u 0 4 along the wake symmetry line in each of the representative cases of the regimes wake recovery is noted to be the quickest for regime b2 fig 9 c where the non existence of a recirculation bubble and high oscillation amplitudes lead to a strong entrainment of ambient fluid into the wake while it is slowest for regime b1 fig 9 b having the longest recirculation bubble it is also seen that regime b3 fig 9 d has the weakest and shortest existing recirculation bubble which can also be attributed to its significant oscillation amplitudes as compared to the rest of the cases zafar and alam 2018 have previously noted that the maximum velocities u m a x in the shear layers and the minimum velocity u m i n in the recirculation bubble are connected to drag an increase in the magnitude of u m a x and or u m i n corresponds to an increased drag here however in fig 9 f it does not seem to follow the same narrative as it can be seen that although for regime a fig 9 a u m a x 1 219 and u m i n 0 162 for regime b1 fig 9 b u m a x 1 218 and u m i n 0 161 which are almost the same we see almost similar values of average drag c d 1 354 and 1 359 respectively however for regime b3 fig 9 d where u m a x 1 258 which is slightly higher than regime a fig 9 a and u m i n 0 047 which is greatly decreased from regime a fig 9 a the c d 1 381 is slightly higher it is seen that an almost 71 decrease in the u m i n could not balance out only a 3 increase in u m a x strictly in terms of c d also c d is minimum for regime c fig 9 e where both u m a x and u m i n are at their peak values of u m a x 1 289 and u m i n 0 188 this can be attributed to the smaller size of the recirculation bubble behind the cylinder as compared to regime a fig 9 a the maximum c d 1 955 is observed in regime b2 fig 9 c where u m a x 1 266 and no recirculation bubble exists the higher values of c d are seen in cases with higher oscillation amplitudes and no or very weak recirculation bubble i e regimes b2 and b3 this shall be further explored and discussed in detail in the next section 6 6 rms streamwise velocity the contours of root mean square values of streamwise velocities u r m s for the aforementioned flow regimes are presented in fig 10 two peaks of maximum u r m s are observed on either side of the wake symmetry line which represent the strength of roll up of shear layers in each case the strength of these peaks is seen to grow till it reaches a maximum strength somewhere within the lock in region in regime b2 and then declines further on the strongest peak u r m s 0 658 is seen for regime b2 fig 10 c which is the case with the highest oscillation amplitudes while the weakest peak u r m s 0 229 is observed for regime a fig 10 a having the smallest oscillation amplitudes streamwise location of these peaks from the center of the cylinder is the vortex formation length which is represented in fig 10 a as l f this vortex formation length is observed to be much longer in the regimes a fig 10 a and b1 fig 10 b representative cases l f 2 88 d and 3 47 d due to both having much elongated recirculation bubbles as previously discussed the shortest formation length is observed in regime b2 fig 10 c l f 0 56 d which is right off the edge of the cylinder after that the formation length grows up to l f 1 85 d in regime c fig 10 e another parameter usually considered in the same regard is the wake width which can be described as the transverse separation of the u r m s peaks and represented in fig 10 a as w while for a stationary cylinder this wake width is a significant parameter it considerably loses its usability if the cylinder is allowed to oscillate this is due to an increased influence of the oscillating cylinder upon the wake in the current research therefore a new parameter termed as influenced wake width is used and depicted in fig 10 b as w this influenced wake width is defined on the basis of width of a pre selected contour level at a pre defined distance downstream of the oscillating cylinder the influenced wake width w used for comparison of the regions of influence of the oscillating cylinder in the current research is based on the transverse locations of contour level u r m s 0 12 at a fixed streamwise distance of 3 0 d downstream from the center of the cylinder the influenced wake width is seen to increase with an increase in reynolds number until it reaches a maximum width within the lock in region and subsequently shrinks to smaller widths with increasing reynolds numbers the smallest influenced wake width w 2 65 is observed for regime a fig 10 a while the widest influenced wake width w 4 47 is observed in regime b2 fig 10 c due to the large oscillation amplitudes in the regime besides the downstream side peaks of u r m s there also exist fluctuations in the streamwise velocity in front of the cylinder i e on the upstream side of the cylinder in regime b2 and b3 as seen in fig 10 c and d these upstream peaks u r m s 0 14 and 0 06 for the representative cases of r e 95 and 121 fig 10 c and d respectively might be caused by the significant oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder in the streamwise direction fig 10 f plots the values of average drag coefficient c d formation length l f wake width w and the influenced wake width w against reynolds number for the selected cases from the previously identified regimes as can be easily inferred from fig 10 f the average drag coefficient is the combined effect of both the formation length l f and the influenced wake width w where the formation length l f parameter influences the drag forces such that a longer formation length may correspond to lower drag forces and vice versa alam et al 2010 while larger influenced wake width w correspond to larger drag forces it is evident from fig 10 f that the influenced wake width w holds an even greater influence on the drag forces as compared to the formation length l f it is also clear from fig 10 f that the wake width w parameter does not have much influence on the average drag forces as depicted here 6 7 mean transverse velocity time averaged transverse velocity contours are shown in fig 11 for the identified regimes positive values of transverse velocity are represented by solid lines and a red fill in the contours while negative values are represented using dashed lines and a blue fill it is seen for all selected cases that on the upstream side of the cylinder the flow gains a transverse component v to its velocity magnitude in order to flow around the cylinder which later switches directions as it crosses the cylinder towards the downstream side and then disappears some distance downstream from the center of the cylinder this added transverse component of velocity is shown to be positive for y 0 while it is negative for y 0 on the upstream side on the downstream side this transverse component of velocity is negative for y 0 and positive for y 0 due to the entrainment of ambient fluid into the wake as is apparent from the figure flow behavior in the upstream side is almost consistent for all cases and almost all the changes are observed only on the downstream side the value of maximum magnitude of transverse velocity as identified in each case represents an affinity for entrainment such that a higher value represents a stronger entrainment from fig 11 a it is seen that in regime a the flow reaches a maximum v 0 131 this maximum v is achieved approximately at a distance of x 2 7 downstream from the center of cylinder the flow accelerates from y 0 75 to its maximum value at y 0 75 and then decelerates as it approaches the wake symmetry line at y 0 symmetric horizontal line passing through the center of the cylinder whereupon the flow becomes parallel to the incident flow for all the selected cases the behavior of the downstream flow is seen to be mostly similar although changes to the positions and strength of the maximum lateral velocity are observed for each regime regime b1 fig 11 b shows minimal changes to the pattern depicted in regime a fig 11 a here the maximum lateral velocity has decreased slightly to v 0 128 representing a slower entrainment of fluid into the wake and hence the position of maximum lateral velocity shifts farther from the center of the cylinder to approximately x 3 0 during lock in the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder are greatly increased and for the representative case of regime b2 fig 11 c the maximum oscillation amplitude is y m a x 0 55 d i e the cylinder is oscillating with much greater amplitudes as compared to the other regimes this allows for a stronger fluid entrainment into the wake and a much quicker wake recovery this is also portrayed in fig 11 c where it is seen that the maximum lateral velocity magnitude v 0 391 is almost three times more than that for regime a fig 11 a while its position is shifted much closer to the cylinder at almost x 1 0 fig 11 d and e also continue the same trend of the value of maximum lateral velocity magnitudes controlling its location downstream from the center of the cylinder where for regime b3 v 0 282 at x 1 8 and for regime c v 0 222 at x 1 85 showing a relatively stronger fluid entrainment into the wake and hence a quicker wake recovery when compared with regime a fig 11 a although the changes among regime b3 and regime c fig 11 d and e are once again minimal as was the case with regime a and regime b1 fig 11 a and b 6 8 mean vorticity fig 12 shows the contours of normalized mean vorticity ω for the representative cases of identified regimes mean vorticity for each case was normalized using the free stream flow velocity for each case in order to make them more comparable a similar contour increment δ ω 0 2 is adopted for all positive and negative ω clockwise vorticity is assigned a negative value and depicted in fig 12 with blue color while anti clockwise vorticity is assigned a positive value and depicted by red color from fig 12 it is observed that the normalized mean vorticity contours for regimes a b1 and c fig 12 a b and e are more or less similar to those for a stationary cylinder but for regimes b2 and b3 fig 12 c and d there exists a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected in the wake of the cylinder the counter rotating vortex pair in the representative case of regime b2 fig 12 c has a maximum strength of ω 0 6241 with the peaks located at a streamwise distance of 1 5 d from the center of the cylinder while a maximum strength of ω 0 3306 is observed in the representative case of regime b3 fig 12 d having peaks located at a streamwise distance of 2 4 d from the center of the cylinder the strength and proximity of these counter rotating vortices is thus seen to fade as reynolds number increases and flow switches between different regimes as is also apparent from the cases depicted in fig 12 the existence of these counter rotating vortex pairs in regimes b2 and b3 fig 12 c and d can be attributed to the large transverse oscillation amplitudes that exist in these regimes the shedding of vortices from the cylinder when seen in conjunction with the cylinder position reveals that vortices are being shed on the opposite side of the wake symmetry line as compared to regimes a b1 and c fig 12 a b and e those shed vortices then translate towards their expected sides of the wake symmetry line it is also notable that faster wake recovery in regime b2 fig 12 c as discussed earlier enhances this translation of the counter rotating pair resulting in a quicker return to the normal side as compared to that in regime b3 fig 12 d 6 9 instantaneous vorticity fig 13 shows the instantaneous vorticity contours for the representative cases of identified regimes at three distinct instances namely ymax yzero and ymin which correspond to the cylinder position in terms of its transverse oscillation amplitudes the instantaneous vorticity iso contours have been normalized using the inlet flow velocity for each case and depicted here using the same contour maximum levels of 1 with a contour level increment of 0 1 for all cases the dashed red lined circle represents the original position of the cylinder and the horizonal dashed white line represents the wake symmetry line at y 0 these contours portray the vorticial structures generated due to the obstruction to flow offered by an oscillating circular cylinder placed in the flow the streamwise offset of the cylinder from the original position is visibly increasing as the reynolds number of the flow increases as seen from top to bottom the instantaneous vorticity contours for regime b2 and b3 clearly depict the penetration of oppositely signed vortices on the other sides of the wake symmetry line breaking the norm and resulting in the formation of counter rotating vortices in the mean vorticity contours fig 12 c and d as has been discussed earlier 6 10 oscillation parameters 6 10 1 c l and y oscillation phase also shown in fig 13 are a representation of the lift coefficient signal during a single cycle of cylinder oscillation and the corresponding signal of transverse oscillation during the same period of time for all identified regimes the signals have not been displayed on a similar scale in order to accommodate better visualization the difference in oscillation amplitudes is comparably shown later in fig 14 on a uniform scale the lift coefficient signal is shown as a black line while the transverse oscillation signal is shown as a red line it is seen from fig 13 that the lift coefficient c l is completely in phase with the y oscillation for regime a where the lift coefficient has peak values c l p e a k 0 28 and transverse oscillation has peak values y p e a k 0 02 d in regime b1 the two remain in phase while the peaks of lift coefficient shift to c l p e a k 0 71 and those for y oscillation reach the value y p e a k 0 125 d culminating in an almost six fold increase in transverse oscillation for a 2 5 times increase in lift coefficient as compared to regime a regime b2 continues the trend of in phase c l and y but with decreased lift amplitude having peaks at c l p e a k 0 39 and increased oscillation amplitude having y p e a k 0 54 d in regime b3 c l and y oscillation are observed to be anti phase with peaks of lift decreasing greatly in value to c l p e a k 0 03 while the y oscillation peaks also decrease to y p e a k 0 35 d similarly in regime c the c l and y oscillation remain anti phase however the lift coefficient rises significantly to c l p e a k 0 35 although the y oscillation amplitude peaks drop greatly to y p e a k 0 03 d this change in phase as observed here is in line with the observations made by prasanth and mittal 2008 where a similar phase switching was observed between the c l and y oscillations and the phase jump was observed in the middle of the synchronization region this jump in phase is attributed to the changes in the value as well as location of maximum suction pressure on both sides of the wake symmetry line this phase jump does not induce any significant changes to the pattern of shedding vortices and simply acts as one of the self limiting mechanisms of the oscillator to return the system to limit cycle oscillations 6 11 cylinder trajectory fig 14 shows a comparison of the oscillation paths followed by the cylinder for each of the representative cases of identified regimes the distance traversed by the cylinder was normalized using the cylinder diameter d it is seen here that in regime a r e 78 and c r e 140 the oscillation amplitude is quite small while it increases greatly within the lock in or synchronization region i e regime b r e 82 r e 95 and r e 121 the path traversed by the cylinder in regime a r e 78 and regime c r e 140 is a figure eight path having a concave orientation with respect to the inlet flow direction refer to in sets in fig 14 in regime b1 r e 82 the cylinder shows a transitioning pattern and follows a size varying figure eight path only a single cycle of which is shown here in fig 14 the trajectory followed by the cylinder in regime b2 r e 95 and b3 r e 121 is a figure eight path having a convex orientation with respect to the inlet flow direction this change in orientation from concave to convex to concave again can be attributed to the presence of counter rotating vortices on the opposite sides of the wake symmetry lines in the synchronization or lock in region that tend to alter the direction vector of the forces exerted by the shedding vortices consequently contributing to the change in orientation of the figure eight path taken by the cylinder projections of streamwise and transverse oscillations of the cylinder normalized by cylinder diameter are presented for a reynolds number range of r e 70 to r e 150 in fig 15 the change in projections of y oscillation shows a similar trend to the changes in projections of x oscillation throughout the reynolds number range albeit having vastly differing amplitudes since y projection shows a maximum value of 1 17 d while the maximum projection of x oscillations reaches only 0 017 d which is almost seventy times lower than the y oscillation projections although when comparing the changes in x and y projections for the selected reynolds number range to those for r e 70 the influence of lock in or synchronization becomes apparent as shown in fig 16 it is observed that the change in x oscillation projections is much greater than the change in y oscillation projections when compared to the corresponding projections of r e 70 throughout the regime b2 and almost halfway through regime b3 y oscillation projections show a maximum of 58 times increase when compared to the y oscillation projections of r e 70 the x oscillation projections however show a maximum change of 109 times increase from the x oscillation projections of r e 70 this behavior can also be explained by the strength and location of the counter rotating vortices as already discussed before present on the opposite sides of the wake symmetry line in the downstream vicinity of the cylinder as the reynolds number increases these counter rotating vortices decrease in strength and move further away from the cylinder their influence on the streamwise displacement of the cylinder becomes minimal and eventually disappears by the middle of regime b3 6 12 heat transfer vortex shedding from a surface can enhance the heat transfer from the body through convection vortices shed from the body allow the fluid enclosed within these low pressure regions to carry heat away from the surface in order to gain a better insight into this phenomenon a constant temperature difference was maintained between the incident flow and the cylinder surface the temperature difference was kept very small i e δt 2 k for all cases completed in this study so that it does not affect the thermo physical properties of the fluid effects of this temperature difference have been analyzed here in terms of nusselt number 6 13 space and time averaged nusselt number n u heat transfer from the surface of a cylinder is known to be sensitive to the flow conditions around the cylinder fig 17 shows a plot of time and space averaged nusselt number n u for the cylinder exposed to flows having reynolds number ranging from r e 70 to r e 150 as observed from fig 17 n u value increases almost monotonically with an increase in reynolds number starting from n u 10 02 at r e 70 all the way to n u 15 23 at r e 150 however the slope of n u in regime b1 and in the latter portion of regime b3 drops slightly in comparison with other regimes this changing slope of n u is easily discernible in fig 17 a sudden drop in n u is observed right before switching from regime b1 to b2 the red line in fig 17 represents the standard deviation plot for all cases discussed it is observed that the standard deviation in n u shows a large spike upon entry into the synchronization region whereby it gradually decreases as reynolds number is increased further into the lock in regime this shows that a much greater difference exists between the maximum and minimum values of nusselt number n u for each case within the lock in region especially in regime b2 than it does outside the synchronization region this can be attributed to the large oscillation amplitudes and consequently shifting of position of maximum nusselt number in the lock in region 6 14 time averaged local nusselt number nu time averaged local nusselt number n u along the surface of the cylinder is shown in fig 18 for the identified regimes where θ 0 lies at the mean downstream stagnation point and θ 180 lies at the front of the cylinder facing incident flow it is observed that at the mean front stagnation point θ 180 mean local nusselt number n u 19 4 19 9 22 24 9 and 27 shows a monotonic increase with reynolds number r e 78 82 95 121 and 140 this is however not the case on the downstream side of the cylinder where at the downstream stagnation point θ 0 even though the higher reynolds numbers r e 121 and 140 do yield the higher nusselt numbers n u 10 1 and 12 2 respectively but for the remaining cases under observation i e r e 78 82 and 95 the corresponding nusselt numbers n u 8 29 8 12 and 6 56 show an inverse trend of decreasing values with increasing reynolds numbers it is also interesting to note that when locating the minimum values of nusselt numbers for an increasing order of reynolds numbers r e 78 82 95 121 and 140 the minimum values of nusselt numbers n u 2 54 2 72 4 79 4 12 and 3 04 respectively are seen which show an exactly inverted trend to the observation made at the downstream stagnation point the locations of these minimum values of mean nusselt number also vary along the surface of the cylinder it is also seen that the representative case of regime b2 i e r e 95 shows the highest minimum nusselt number value which can be attributed to the absence of recirculation bubble behind the cylinder and the large oscillation amplitudes contributing to a better convective heat transfer from the cylinder surface all around it rather than only the front face this can also be seen in the mean temperature iso contours in fig 19 c where the mean temperature contours for regime b2 r e 95 clearly show a much quicker heat dissipation as compared to the rest of the cases also worth noting here is the more centrally aligned shape of mean temperature gradient in fig 19 c and d rather than the two pronged iso contours for the other regimes this can be attributed to the path taken by the shedding vortices for each case 6 15 maximum local nusselt number the value of local nusselt number on the cylinder surface is not constant but changes due to development of the thermal boundary layer the maximum value of local nusselt number n u m a x for a stationary cylinder lies at the front stagnation point i e θ 180 when the cylinder is free to oscillate location of the front stagnation point and consequently the maximum local nusselt number n u m a x on the cylinder surface changes this change in location is caused by the presence of asymmetric boundary layers on either side of the cylinder changes to the location and value of n u m a x over one complete cycle of cylinder oscillation have been shown in fig 20 the smallest changes in location of n u m a x are observed in the cases with the smallest oscillation amplitudes r e 78 and 140 reaching up to θ 3 and 6 respectively the largest change in location is seen for r e 95 reaching up to θ 63 a change in n u m a x location of θ 18 and 33 is seen for r e 82 and 121 respectively changes in the value of n u m a x are also observed to follow a similar trend with r e 78 having the smallest change of δ n u m a x 0 0066 while r e 95 showed the largest change of δ n u m a x 1 8531 the changes to the value of n u m a x for the remaining cases are also seen to be representative of their oscillation angles as δ n u m a x 0 159 0 581 and 0 007 for r e 82 121 and 140 respectively 6 16 normalized mean velocity contours boundary layer profile fig 21 shows the mean streamwise velocity contours normalized by the inlet flow velocity for reynolds number r e 78 this was done to accentuate the change in velocities and consequently elaborate the effects of shear thinning of the boundary layer around the cylinder with an increase in reynolds number a constant contour increment of δ u 0 1 was adopted for all positive values for an easier comparison a maximum contour level u 1 was selected to emphasize the locations in the contours where the flow velocity exceeds that of reynolds number r e 78 mean velocity profiles for all selected cases have been plotted in fig 22 along the normal to two distinct locations on the surface of the cylinder depicted in fig 21 as dashed black lines i when the normal is parallel to the incident flow θ 180 ii when the normal is perpendicular to the incident flow θ 90 the velocity profiles have been shown up to a distance of 2 d from the surface of the cylinder for a stationary cylinder the front stagnation point lies at θ 180 while for a freely oscillating cylinder the front stagnation point shifts across a wider range of angular locations on the surface of the cylinder during a complete cycle of oscillations hence the mean velocity profiles for a stationary cylinder tend to be completely different from the ones depicted here in fig 22 the value of relative velocity u u r e 78 1 is depicted as a vertical dotted line black in fig 22 when a flow is obstructed by a bluff body effects of that obstruction can be observed at considerable distances upstream from the location of the body in the form of a decrease in velocity the same is observed in fig 22 a where the r e 78 velocity profile does not achieve the inlet velocity even at a distance of 2 d upstream from the cylinder same is also seen for r e 82 as the reduction in velocity is considerable and even an increased inlet velocity does not achieve the flow velocity for r e 78 on the front of the cylinder the velocity profile for r e 140 achieves the relative velocity u u r e 78 1 at a distance of 0 37 d from the surface of the cylinder comparatively it is seen that in fig 22 b all velocity profiles manage to cross the threshold of u u r e 78 1 on the top side of the cylinder this is because the resistance to the flow is minimum at the top edge of the cylinder it is seen that the re78 velocity profile crosses the threshold at a distance of 0 16 d from the cylinder surface while that of r e 140 crosses the u u r e 78 1 threshold at 0 065 d this shows the thinning effect of the boundary layer at the top of the cylinder by a factor of almost 5 6 times that at the front of the cylinder this thinning of the boundary layer on the surface of the cylinder also contributes to increased heat transfer from the surface of the cylinder due to higher flow velocities and increased proximity of the cylinder surface to the free stream flow 6 17 correlation for space and time averaged nusselt number space and time averaged nusselt number n u is affected by various factors which include reynolds number of the flow strouhal frequency transverse and streamwise oscillation amplitudes the dependence of n u on these parameters can be consolidated into a linear correlation obtained by performing an extensive multivariate regression analysis as done by yawar et al 2019 for a rotationally oscillating cylinder to this effect a least squares based method is used for performing the analysis in which reynolds number root mean square values of streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal number have been treated as independent variables whose effects on the dependent variable n u were recorded simultaneously the correlation thus obtained is presented in eqn 18 18 n u ˆ 6 2043 0 0687 r e 252 7345 x r m s 2 1045 y r m s 6 5278 s t regarding the accuracy and reliability of the proposed correlation table 7 shows the regression statistics where the accuracy of regression is displayed in terms of r 2 and adjusted r 2 r 2 represents the percentage of output variable that is being explained by the input variable while adjusted r 2 gives a conservative estimate of the same in the current case r 2 0 9901 o r 99 01 while a d j u s t e d r 2 0 9891 o r 98 91 point out that almost 99 of the variants of the dependent variable n u have been explained by the independent variables selected for the regression table 8 shows the analysis of variance for the conducted test and as shown by the extremely low value of s i g n i f i c a n c e f 1 9854 e 42 which is the probability of error and has a commonly acceptable standard value of 5 or 0 05 the regression performed is extremely reliable table 9 shows a comparison of the actual simulation results for n u in the present work with the values of n u ˆ obtained from the above correlation maximum difference between the predicted and actual values is found to be under 3 25 for all cases fig 23 compares the predicted values and the actual values it is also worth mentioning here that the regression analysis performed also divulged the contribution of various independent variables towards the dependent variable it was observed that x r m s contributes almost twice as much as the y r m s towards the nusselt number this also explains the decreasing slope of n u in latter half of regime b3 in fig 17 as it has previously been observed in fig 16 the relative change in x projection takes a steep dive in the latter half of the regime b3 and thus may be responsible for the levelling out of the slope of n u in the same regime 7 conclusions flow dynamics cylinder response and heat transfer from a two dimensionally freely oscillating circular cylinder were analyzed numerically for an incompressible laminar flow within a reynolds number range 70 r e 150 the structural natural frequency f n was set as constant along both axis f n f n x f n y and equal to the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder at r e 100 variations in strouhal number frequency ratios oscillation amplitudes force coefficients as well as local and space and time averaged nusselt number were studied in detail some interesting phenomenon was observed during this study that had not before been discussed in literature strouhal number is observed to change its behavior depending upon the flow regime while for the non lock in regions it follows almost the same trend as a stationary cylinder with in lock in or synchronization region it switches towards the non dimensional natural frequency with identifiable variations in its behavior within the different regimes of lock in frequency ratio also follows a similar trend as set by strouhal number while it follows the trends of frequency ratio of a stationary cylinder in the non lock in region it jumps towards a constant frequency ratio f r 1 in the lock in region albeit with differing behaviors in the different identified regimes of lock in larger recirculation bubbles are observed in the non lock in regimes while the recirculation bubbles are seen to completely disappear in pure lock in cases and then re appear in the transition to post lock in cases this disappearance hasn t been noted in literature before and may be attributed to the large oscillation amplitudes within the lock in regime the vortex formation length l f decreases while the influenced wake width w increases with an increase in oscillation amplitudes the wake width w remains almost independent of any variations in cylinder oscillations a much quicker wake recovery is observed for cases having small formation lengths l f coupled with large influenced wake widths w average drag coefficient c d is also higher for cases having smaller formation lengths l f and large influenced wake widths w streamwise velocity fluctuations are observed in front of the cylinder as well for cases having small formation lengths l f and large influenced wake widths w a pair of counter rotating vortices having opposite rotational directions to what might be expected is observed behind the cylinder in the mean vorticity field for high oscillation amplitude cases which alters the cylinder trajectory from a concave figure eight shape to a convex figure eight shape with reference to inlet flow direction the signals of lift coefficient and transverse oscillation are also observed to change phase from in phase to anti phase in the middle of the synchronization region the transverse and streamwise oscillations are observed to follow an almost identical pattern of rise and fall with an increase in reynolds number as the system enters and exits the lock in region however the maximum relative change in values when compared to the values at r e 78 is observed to be much greater for the streamwise oscillations 109 times than the transverse oscillations 58 times an almost monotonous increase in space and time averaged nusselt number n u is observed for increasing reynolds numbers although the standard deviation is much higher in lock in region as compared to the non lock in regions the time averaged local nusselt number n u around the cylinder shows an increasing trend with an increase in reynolds number on the upstream side θ 180 however on the downstream side θ 0 it decreases with an increase in reynolds number till the middle of the synchronization region after which it again increases with an increase in reynolds number the maximum local nusselt number varies in value as well as location on the surface of the cylinder in direct correspondence with the oscillation amplitudes of the cylinder a linear correlation is proposed by performing a multivariate regression analysis that uses reynolds number root mean square values of streamwise and transverse oscillation amplitudes and strouhal frequency to predict the space and time averaged nusselt number n u ˆ up to a maximum of 3 5 deviation with the simulation data

20249,the advancements in numerical tools has opened the opportunity for simulations to provide a more accurate prediction of the structural response of a semi planing hull than the current empirical methods that use historical data from early generation hull designs numerical tools first need to be able to predict the hydrodynamic response of a semi planing hull before attempting to predict the structural response to prove this an extensive study of a semi planing hull in waves has been conducted where the experiments were designed to work concurrently with simulation tools to understand the underlying hydrodynamics this work independently evaluated the effect of speed wave steepness and wavelength on the hydrodynamic response in addition to the experimental results a comprehensive analysis quantified the uncertainty and showed small differences between methods for the analysis as part of the unified approach to this study the test setup of the experiments have been well documented to improve the accuracy of the initial conditions in the simulations the assessment the simulations showed the usefulness of simulations by predicting time history trends that matched the experiments well the simulations were able to predict the vertical accelerations well while the error trends were larger for heave pitch and pressure keywords semi planing hull model test cfd uncertainty waves 1 introduction 1 1 background semi planing hull structural design has been based on empirical methods derived from many decades of historical data from early generation hull designs allen and jones 1978 american bureau of shipping 2017 these structural designs are robust and implemented on many successful semi planing hulls current demands for increased payload and speed as well as the advancement in numerical tools has provided the basis to reevaluate semi planing hull structural design methods to understand the structural response for semi planing hull structural design the motions of an semi planing hulls in waves first needs to be understood there have been a limited number of model tests of semi planing hulls in waves semi planing hull model tests include the high speed ship hayden et al 2009 a fast ferry fonseca and soares 2005 a series based on a fast torpedo boat lindgren and aake 1968 the ntua double chine series grigoropoulos et al 2010 the npl series bailey 1976 the vtt series based on the npl series lahtiharju et al 1991 and the marin slender hull series blok and beukelman 1984 various methods have been developed for predicting the motions of semi planing hulls in waves ogilvie and tuck 1969 have developed a strip theory method for slender hulls that was further refined by newman 1978 this method was developed for high speed hulls by faltinsen and zhao 1991 to simulate a semi displacement hull ibrahim et al 2009 used a time domain code based on a 3 d potential flow solution of the wave body hydrodynamic interaction problem called large amplitude motions program lamp ahmed et al 2005 simulated a semi planing hull in regular waves using a green s function method and a flexible appendage to approximate the dry transom in recent years research on planing hulls has increased unfortunately there has not been a similar increase in research for semi planing hulls recent work by baso et al 2020 showed the effect of trim angle on the powering requirement of a semi planing hull in clam water no recent research has been found for a semi planing hull in waves an extensive study of a semi planing hull in waves has been conducted where the experiments were designed to work concurrently with simulation tools to understand the underlying hydrodynamics whereas previous work focused on only the effect of wavelength on the hydrodynamic response this work evaluated the effect of wave steepness separately from wavelength this work also contributed to the existing body of experimental data by quantifying the uncertainty in addition to providing experimental results as part of the unified approach to this study the test setup of the experiments have been well documented to improve the accuracy of the initial conditions in the simulations the final contribution was the assessment of two different simulations tools for their suitability for design of semi planing hulls the semi planing hull r v athena was chosen to facilitate the public release of experimental results for validation of computational tools the hull was also chosen for the previous comparisons between experiments and simulations ratcliffe et al 2007 tested the r v athena fixed in pitch and heave in regular waves bhushan et al 2009 conducted blind simulations of the r v athena in regular waves therefore there was limited experimental data for the r v athena in waves the current study expands the experimental data set of the r v athena by testing the model free to pitch and heave in calm water regular and irregular waves the regular wave experimental data was useful for comparisons with cfd because the fundamental physics of the simulation can be evaluated quickly on repeatable waves of constant amplitude the free to pitch and heave in irregular waves model test was a good representation of the expected motions and wave impacts a semi planing hull will experience at full scale the r v athena was tested at naval surface warfare center carderock division for the current study on two different dates lee et al 2016 fullerton et al 2017 2019a 2019b 2019c this paper builds on the contributions of the previous related study of lee et al 2020 which provided an assessment of experiments and cfd for the semi planing r v athena model in calm water 1 2 objective the objective of the study was to improve understanding of the physics and prediction capability of the motions and slamming loads of a semi planing craft in a seaway via experiments and cfd simulations specifically 1 assessment of model tests evaluate the response of a semi planing hull in two degrees of freedom resistance heave pitch vertical accelerations and pressures in regular and irregular waves the regular wave wavelength and wave steepness was systematically varied to understand the underlying physics needed for numerical predictions of the dynamic response of semi planing craft in a seaway the data reduction equations follow the ittc recommended method international towing tank conference 2017 rigorous uncertainty analysis was conducted using multiple runs best run and ten best waves to understand the physics to help with design the ten best waves method for uncertainty analysis had the overall smallest total uncertainty and was used for validation 2 assessment of cfd verification and validation to determine the capability and usefulness of cfd for design predictions of semi planing hulls the ultimate goal as already stated is for increased payload and speed as well as the advancement in numerical tools has provided the basis to reevaluate hsnc structural design methods thus the present research was also preparatory to the subsequent grillage studies for athena and gpph as per weil et al 2018 and diez et al 2020 1 3 experimental approach 1 3 1 regular waves two model tests of the r v athena were conducted in regular waves at multiple speeds wave heights and wave periods to evaluate the motion response of a semi planing hull the wave conditions covered wavelengths λ normalized by the length between perpendiculars l λ l 1 00 1 45 and 2 00 with a range of wave steepness 1 h λ from 25 to 109 the measured variables were wave height encounter wave period resistance pitch heave bow and lcg vertical accelerations and pressure at two locations the uncertainty analysis was conducted using dimensional values for multiple runs best run and ten best waves the formulations for the three uncertainty methods are presented in appendix a 1 to allow the experimental results to be compared with other experiments the added resistance in waves peak trough pitch peak trough heave and peak accelerations were non dimensionalized using the ittc recommended method international towing tank conference 2017 additionally the non dimensional root mean squared rms resistance and the peak pressure was calculated the rms resistance was calculated to assess the resistance response during each wave impact the equations for the non dimensionalized measured variables can be found in appendix a2 2 the accelerations and pressures are important to use as inputs into hull structural design the pitch and heave motions are important for comparisons with simulations to ensure the simulations are correctly predicting the underlying hydrodynamics to more effectively compare the experiments with simulations the mean rms and peak value peak trough for pitch and heave was calculated for each measured variable the comparison with simulations were made using dimensional values to allow for a direct comparison a harmonic analysis was also conducted for one of the simulations 1 3 2 irregular waves the measured variables were wave height encounter period resistance pitch heave bow and lcg vertical accelerations and pressure at two locations the average rms standard deviation average peak value average of the 1 3rd highest a1 3 peak value and average of the 1 10th highest a1 10 peak value were calculated for each of the measured variables the peak values were determined as the maximum positive value within a window of one most probable wave period the average resistance was important in the selection of the propulsion plant as the propulsion must provide enough power to overcome the average resistance the experimental values were determined using the autocovariance analysis method detailed in diez et al 2018 the block bootstrap method was used with a block size of four times the most probable wave period to estimate the precision uncertainty for the average and rms values the block bootstrap method was used so that the correlation between groups of waves was maintained for the average and rms values the regular bootstrap method was used to estimate the precision uncertainty of the peak values 1 4 numerical approach predictions of r v athena in calm water were performed using two different computational codes the research code cfdship iowa and the commercial code star ccm predictions of r v athena in waves were performed using cfdship iowa cfdship iowa v4 5 is an incompressible urans des solver designed for ship hydrodynamics lee et al 2016 urans equations are used to compute the hydrodynamic loads f turbulence was modeled by isotropic menter s blended k ω k ε model a single phase level set method was used for the free surface finite difference schemes are used on body fitted curvilinear grids to discretize the continuum equations with second order implicit euler backward difference time integration the convective velocities are linearized when solving the momentum equations but are changed within the nonlinear iteration loop to account for nonlinearities from turbulence equations nonlinear momentum transport etc the spatial discretization of the convection terms uses a second order upwind approach the diffusion and pressure terms in the momentum equations are discretized using a second order central scheme the temporal and spatial discretization for the k ω k ε equations are consistent with the momentum equations the projection algorithm or the pressure implicit with splitting operator piso method couples the momentum and continuity equations finally a fully implicit predictor corrector method determines the six degrees of freedom motions details of equations and numerical methods can be found in huang et al 2008 simcenter star ccm is a finite volume based solver of navier stokes equations with options to solve euler equations viscous laminar navier stokes equations and consideration of various turbulence models rans family des les for the current work the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver was used for modeling the regular waves it has a robust meshing tool which needs little user interaction and a volume of fluid vof solver which was useful for wave impact and fluid structure interactions the vof approach assumes that the grid cells near the free surface are filled with both air and water and within each grid cell the vof pressure velocity and gravitational force acting on the fluid was calculated the ocean waves and the free surface are tracked by using the vof values in the domain this code has been applied to several past efforts concerning planing craft and surface ships 2 experimental methods 2 1 r v athena the r v athena was a converted pg 84 asheville class patrol gunboat with a semi planing hull form the body plan of the r v athena is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a picture of the r v athena model 5365 the model mass properties were measured using the process described in appendix b of lee et al 2017 table 1 shows the as tested model particulars 2 2 setup the r v athena model test was performed in the deep water basin at nswccd using towing carriage 2 the basin is approximately 574 m long 15 53 m wide and 6 7m deep carriage 2 has a maximum towing speed of 10 29 m s a pneumatic wavemaker is located at the east end of the basin with a wave absorbing beach at the west end ambient conditions during the test were nominally a 74 f basin water temperature 80 f air temperature and an 80 relative humidity no windscreen was employed from the carriage to mitigate wind resistance to simplify the simulations 2 3 measurement system the r v athena was equipped fig 3 with a suite of sensors to measure the wave height encounter wave period resistance pitch heave vertical accelerations and pressure the data reduction equations for each measurement can be found in appendix a2 1 the resistance measurement was acquired through two separate dynamometers mounted on the model the main dynamometer was attached to the model above the tow point and measured the resistance in an earth fixed orientation during testing a fixture was used to restrict yaw motions of the model because this additional fixture absorbed some of the resistance the second dynamometer measured forces exerted on the fixture to determine the total resistance on the model since the dynamometer was installed below the grasshopper fixture the forces exerted on the fixture were measured in the body fixed orientation these body fixed forces were transformed to an earth fixed orientation before being used to calculate the resistance on the model three string potentiometers string pots were used to measure vertical displacement of the model at the bow the tow post and the stern the bow and stern string potentiometers were used to calculate the pitch angle the tow post string potentiometer was used to measure the heave thetwo accelerometers were utilized during the r v athena model 5365 testing one vertical accelerometer was located near the bow and one tri axial accelerometer at the tow post near the lcg the accelerometers were mounted to give positive vertical values upward in the body fixed orientation the acceleration mean value was equal to the earth fixed gravity vector and removed from the raw accelerometer signals eighteen pressure sensors were mounted on the bottom of the model hull during testing three sensors were analyzed for this study p2 p5 and p11 these sensors were used to measure single point slamming pressures during the model tests the pressure sensors were npi 19 series sensors and had a reference pressure area with a 17 3 mm diameter the pressure sensor locations p5 and p11 were determined from initial simulation studies to have the largest impact pressures pressure sensor location p2 was selected because previous experience showed high pressures near the bow during wave impacts senix toughsonic 30 ultrasonic wave elevation sensors were used to measure the as encountered wave surface characteristics from the carriage the carriage mounted sensor provided near field wave data as encountered specifically wave height and encounter period t e 2 4 test conditions the irregular wave conditions were chosen to represent the r v athena operating in sea state 3 and 4 at full scale sea state 4 was the designed operating sea condition for the r v athena table 2 shows the scaled significant wave height h1 3 and the most probable wave period tm used to develop the bretschneider representation of the irregular wave field three speeds froude number fr 0 25 0 43 and 0 62 were run at each sea state the analysis of the sea state 4 wave conditions is presented in this paper table 3 shows the regular wave conditions tested one regular wave condition was tested in 2014 wave height of 231 1 mm and a period of 1 9 s regular wave conditions for the 2015 test were selected as representations of the irregular wave condition that produce similar enough craft motions in regular waves both the rw2 and the rw5 regular wave representation of the irregular wave spectrum have a regular wave height that was 2 2 times the significant wave height of the irregular wave spectrum diez et al 2013 the regular wave period of the rw2 representation was the peak period of the irregular wave energy spectrum the regular wave period of the rw5 representation was the period corresponding to the true average frequency in the encounter spectrum at fr 0 5 the regular wave condition with a wave height of 75 4 mm and a period of 2 3 s was selected as an rw2 representation of the sea state 3 condition the regular wave condition with a wave height of 161 5 mm and a period of 2 7 s was selected as an rw2 representation of the sea state 4 condition the regular wave condition with a wave height of 161 5 mm and a period of 2 3 s was selected as an rw5 representation of the sea state 4 condition finally a wave period of 1 91 s was selected at the wave height of 161 5 mm to match the wave period tested in 2014 all the wave conditions were tested at fr 0 25 0 43 and 0 62 there were errors in the data collection of the fr 0 43 h 161 5 mm t 2 7s wave condition and the data will not be presented table 3 also shows the number of runs conducted during the experiment for each wave conditions mrun mrun was used for the multiple run analysis and the number ten wave time blocks m10 used for the ten best wave analysis is also shown the data analysis below showed the accelerations and pressures were the highest for the waves with a wave period of 2 3 s and a froude number of 0 62 the fr 0 62 h 161 5 mm t 2 3 s and the fr 0 62 h 75 4 mm t 2 3 s wave conditions were selected for further comparison with simulations highlighted in table 3 3 numerical methods 3 1 cfdship iowa setup the cfdship iowa grid consisted of multi block body fitted boundary layer bl grids with 20 64 million grid points and a static cartesian background grid with 6 46 million grid points totaling to a grid size of 27 1m the bl grids were designed to ensure y 1 in all simulation conditions the background grid points were clustered around the free surface with at least 20 grid points per wave height to ensure accurate resolution of free surface evolution inside the computational domain a symmetry boundary condition was used for the midship while the inlet and side boundaries imposed wave and ship velocity inflow conditions zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the top and bottom boundaries and the second gradients were set to be zero at the exit boundary the grid design is shown in fig 4 below the simulations were carried out with 256 time steps per the incoming wave encounter period and the run lengths are at least 10 wave periods or until iterative convergence is achieved 3 2 star ccm the star ccm trimmed grid consisted of overset grids with 8 4 million grid points and a static trimmed background grid with 6 2 million grid points totaling to a grid size of 14 5m the all y wall function is used and the bl grids were designed for y 1 in all simulation conditions the background grid points were clustered around the free surface with at least 32 grid points per wave height to ensure accurate resolution of free surface evolution inside the computational domain a symmetry boundary condition was used for the midship while the inlet imposed wave and ship velocity inflow conditions zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the top and the outlet boundaries wall condition is used for bottom and the side boundaries to simulate the actual tow tanks walls the grid design is shown in fig 5 below 4 uncertainty analysis estimates total uncertainty u values were derived from the experimental precision uncertainty p and the estimated bias uncertainty b following the coleman and steele 1999 method the uncertainties were estimated at a 95 confidence level using a factor of 2 giving a 95 probability that the true experimental value x lies within the reported confidence interval i e μ true x u x u the bias uncertainty was the fixed component of the total uncertainty and was referred to as systematic uncertainty the uncertainty values using the multiple best run and ten waves methods for the regular waves are detailed in appendix b2 1 the precision uncertainty was generally larger by the multiple run and best run method than for the ten waves method due to the variability of the average data between each run this increased the total uncertainty because the bias uncertainty was the same for all three analysis methods the ten best wave uncertainty analysis will be used for the comparison of the experimental results with simulation because it represents the best set of waves that were run in the experiment the uncertainty values for the irregular waves are detailed in appendix b2 2 the precision uncertainty became a larger contributor to the total uncertainty as the peak amplitude went up due to the larger variability in the extreme peaks 4 1 wave group analysis due to the variability of the height of the regular wave a wave group analysis was conducted to determine if a wave group would be best to represent the incoming wave signal similar to previous 3 sister waves mousaviraad and carrica 2010 and wam v in single wave events mousaviraad et al 2018 table 4 shows the frequency and amplitude of the first 32 wave components to reconstruct the wave measured for h 161 5 mm and t 2 3 s table 5 shows the error between the measured wave and the reconstructed wave based on the number of wave components in the wave group for h 161 5 mm and t 2 3 s the total error was determined by summing the error between the measured wave and the reconstructed wave for each point 32 wave components were selected for use as the input wave group for the simulations simulations were run comparing the craft motions with the wave group and a single regular wave as input table 6 shows the difference between the two inputs the heave had the largest difference in error the overall average error reduced using the wave group because the additional wave components in the wave group created a more accurate measured wave for input into the cfd the single regular wave was used for further analysis as the difference between the predicted craft motions using the wave group and regular wave as inputs was small 4 2 cfdship iowa verification and validation 4 2 1 cfdship iowa cfdship iowa verification and validation v v studies follow the detailed procedures explained in xing and stern 2010 grid studies were carried out by refining coarsening both the bl and the background grids with a refinement ratio of r 2 the total grid sizes were 11 2m for the coarse grid 27 1m for the medium grid and 46 4m for the fine grid summary of cfdship iowa grid verification studies are presented in table 7 the v v analysis was carried out for the 1st harmonic amplitudes for force motions and accelerations for slamming pressure the v v variables are the peak pressure and slam duration monotonic convergence was achieved for all the variables the p values are close to 1 0 except for the slam duration the grid uncertainty was very large for the acceleration and peak pressure the time history for pitch is shown in fig 6 the time history results for the coarse grid were significantly different in terms of amplitudes and phases compared to the medium while the medium and the fine grid results were very close to each other 4 2 2 star ccm grid studies were carried out by refining coarsening both the bl and the background grids with a refinement ratio of r 2 the total grid sizes were 3 5m for the coarse grid and 14 5m for the fine grid the results for the coarse grid were not significantly different in terms of amplitudes and phases compared to the medium grid while the medium and the fine grid results were different each other as shown for pitch in the fig 7 below the fine mesh result were closer to the efd measurement 5 results and discussion 5 1 regular wave results a combination of the 2014 and 2015 tests enabled the evaluation of the effects of fr λ l and h λ table 8 and table 9 shows the experimental conditions measured value and total uncertainty as percentage of the measured value the total uncertainty values for resistance was as high as about 60 x at the highest speed this was due to the small added resistance in waves at that speeds the total uncertainty values were reasonable for motions i e less than 7 x with largest values for shortest wavelength for the accelerations the total uncertainty values were larger up to 3 times here again mostly with largest values for shorter waves figs 8 and 9 are for rms resistance figs 10 and 11 are for added resistance figs 12 and 13 are for pitch and figs 14 and 15 are for heave showing the response vs the encounter frequency normalized by the natural frequency ωe ωn and λ l respectively in figs 9 11 13 and 15 the data labels are the 1 h λ values the actual wave amplitude and encounter wave period was used for the calculation of the non dimensional resistance pitch and heave the nominal wave height was used for the h λ values for consistency across fr the natural frequency fn values for heave 1 15 hz and pitch 1 01 hz were estimated using cfdship iowa for fr 0 also shown are the results from ntua grigoropoulos et al 2010 in regular waves for a similar fr and displacement as the r v athena grigoropoulos et al 2010 experiments were for constant wave amplitude a such that the wave steepness varies from 1 36 to 1 97 for the shorter to longer waves and its effects cannot be separated cfd comparisons were made at two 1 h λ 109 and 51 at λ l 1 45 and fr 0 62 the rms resistance in waves showed a strong dependence on λ l with λ l 1 45 showing the largest response the rms resistance also increased with fr and generally decreased with larger h λ the added resistance in waves decreases with increasing fr with a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 875 the results vs λ l show that the r v athena added resistance had trends that were like those for ntua the lower speeds had a maximum response at a smaller λ l the highest speed had a maximum response at a larger λ l and showed a broad peak near the maximum response the steeper waves generally had lower added resistance in waves the motion trends were more clearly shown using ωe ωn i e the motion response increases with increasing fr for both heave and pitch which was like 5415 irvine et al 2008 including that the maximum response occurs near ωe ωn 0 75 the results vs λ l show that the r v athena motion response was also like that for ntua the effects of h λ show that mostly larger steepness has smaller response indicating increased damping for larger h λ irvine et al 2008 showed no effects of wave steepness for h λ 1 126 1 63 and 1 42 mousaviraad et al 2018 states that the maximum response conditions for a displacement hull occurs when the maximum excitation and wave radiation forces coincide the coincidence froude number frc was defined as mousaviraad et al 2018 29 f r c 1 33 l p p g f n 3 8 π where fn natural frequency of pitch or heave the calculated coincidence froude number of the r v athena for pitch was frc 0 32 and for heave was frc 0 43 the experimental results for r v athena showed that the motion response increased with fr the results show that semi displacement hull motion response was like that for displacement hulls at least for the current fr and λ l fig 16 through 19 are similar but for the vertical bow and lcg acceleration the trends are like those described for the motions the large accelerations correspond to large values of rms and added resistance fig 20 through 23 are similar plots for pressure at p2 located near the bow the highest pressure was at the slowest speed and the smallest λ l at p11 the pressure seems to have a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 95 this can be seen because the pressure is much smaller for fr 0 62 at λ l 1 and ωe ωn 1 16 than at the two lower froude numbers and the encounter frequency is higher than the encounter frequency of maximum response also the time history plots shown below show that at conditions with non dimensional pressure below 0 2 there was no initial pressure spike to indicate wave slamming 5 2 regular wave experimental comparisons with simulations 5 2 1 time domain comparisons fig 24 shows the third and fourth peak of the ten wave time history dataset for the resistance heave trim lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 for the h 75 4 mm wave the experiment and the two simulations were time aligned based on the first peak of the heave the experiments showed a double peak in resistance during each wave encounter both of the simulations predicted that the resistance during each wave encounter was not sinusoidal but they do not have the double peak shown the experiments the predicted trim and heave had similar trends to the measured results the lcg and bow vertical acceleration were nearly sinusoidal with the peak occurring in the middle of the cycle this would mean that at the h 75 4 mm wave height the hull was not experiencing slamming during a slam there was a sharp rise in the acceleration at the beginning of the cycle and then the acceleration drops to a lower steady state value before returning to zero the experimental bow and lcg vertical acceleration showed some noise at the peak of the acceleration this noise was also seen in the resistance this could be due to longitudinal bending due to the long length of the r v athena the star ccm bow vertical acceleration showed some spikes leading up to the slam the pressure at p11 confirms that there was no slam as there would normally be a sharp spike at the beginning of the cycle the star ccm simulation showed the same trends as the experiment but with an offset to a lower pressure table 10 shows the experimental uncertainty and the simulation error the error for mean and rms resistance was small the error for the peak was higher but it was still reasonable considering the simulated resistance through the cycle does not match the experiments the error for resistance and added did not fall within the experimental uncertainty for heave the cfdship iowa predictions were slightly larger than the experimental uncertainty the error for star ccm was larger and outside of the experimental uncertainty as the peak heave was over predicted cfdship iowa predicted a lower mean and rms pitch the peak trough error was small and fell within the experimental uncertainty star ccm predicted a higher mean rms and peak trough value the time history showed that the overall predicted pitch trend was higher than the experiment the cfdship iowa and star ccm rms and peak error for the lcg vertical acceleration fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed a small spike in the experimental data at the peak of the lcg vertical acceleration if the spike was excluded in the peak analysis the cfdship iowa error drops to 4 06 x and the star ccm error drops to 7 5 x the rms and peak bow vertical acceleration error for cfdship iowa fell within the experimental uncertainties the rms bow vertical acceleration error for star ccm fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed that star ccm had some spikes in the data leading up to the peak of the bow vertical acceleration that was higher than the peak if these spikes were not used to determine the peak the peak bow vertical acceleration error would be 1 47 x and would fall within the experimental uncertainty the cfdship iowa error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was barely outside of the experimental uncertainty for the mean and was within the experimental uncertainty for the rms and peak the star ccm mean and peak error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was large while the rms value was just within the uncertainty analysis looking at the time history the shape of the pressure impulses predicted by star ccm looks like the pressure pulse measured in the experiment but the prediction was lower this lead to the large error in mean and peak but smaller error in the rms value fig 25 shows the third and fourth peak of the ten wave time history dataset for the resistance heave trim lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 for the h 161 5 mm wave the experiments showed a double peak in resistance during each wave encounter both of the simulations predicted the double peak but the trends did not match the experiments this showed that the double peak in the resistance was physical and not an artifact of the hull attached to the carriage via the tow post the predicted trim and heave had similar trends to the measured results the lcg and bow vertical acceleration were somewhat sinusoidal with the peak occurring in the middle of the cycle both vertical accelerations started to show the initial spike of hull experiencing a wave slam during a slam there was a sharp rise in the acceleration at the beginning of the cycle and then the acceleration drops to a lower steady state value before returning to zero this would mean that at the h 161 5 mm wave height the hull was experiencing slamming the cfdship iowa bow vertical acceleration showed the leading spike to be higher than the steady state portion of the acceleration the pressure at p11 confirms that there was slamming as the sharp spike could be seen at the beginning of the cycle table 11 shows the experimental uncertainty and the simulation error the error for resistance and added resistance did not fall within the experimental uncertainty for heave the prediction error was much larger than the experimental uncertainty the time history showed that cfdship iowa and star ccm over predicted the peak and star ccm also under predicted the tough for trim the predicted errors for cfdship iowa and star ccm was small but fell outside the experimental uncertainty the cfdship iowa and star ccm rms and average peak amplitude error for the lcg vertical acceleration fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed a small spike in the experimental data at the peak of the lcg vertical acceleration if the spike was excluded in the peak analysis the cfdship iowa error drops to 8 35 x and the star ccm error drops to 4 72 x this brought the error in star ccm to fall within the experimental uncertainty and the cfdship iowa error to nearly fall within the experimental uncertainty the rms bow vertical acceleration error for star ccm fell within the experimental uncertainty the error in the peak for cfdship iowa was large 10 x the time history showed that cfdship iowa predicted the slam peak higher than the steady state value both the experiment and star ccm predicted the highest acceleration to occur during the steady state phase the error in the steady state peak for cfdship iowa was 7 86 x the cfdship iowa error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was within the experimental uncertainty for the mean and rms cfdship iowa over predicted the peak the star ccm error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was large 10 x looking at the time history the shape of the pressure impulses predicted by star ccm looks like the pressure pulse measured in the experiment but the prediction was lower 5 2 2 frequency domain comparisons with cfdship iowa in the frequency domain the validation variables were considered to be the 0th harmonic amplitude and the 1st to 3rd harmonic amplitude for resistance heave pitch lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 the error values for h 75 4 mm are presented in table 12 for resistance the error values were large due to the issues with different trends between the experiments and the cfd for the other variables the average error was smaller than 13 x the error values for h 161 5 mm are presented in table 13 for resistance the error was large due to the issues with different trends between experiments and cfd for heave the largest error was for the 0th amplitude while the error in the 1st amplitude and phase was the smallest for pitch the largest error was for the 3rd amplitude the error for the 0th amplitude and the 1st amplitude and phase was small for accelerations the largest error was for the 3rd amplitude while the error in the 1st amplitude and phase was the smallest for the pressure the largest error was for the 0th amplitude while error in the other harmonic amplitudes and phases was small the 1st amplitude and phase has the smallest error averaged over all of the validation variables 5 3 irregular wave results the resistance pitch heave acceleration and pressure values are shown in table 14 and table 15 the average rms standard deviation average peak a1 3 and a1 10 was calculated for each variable the irregular wave results were compared with the rw5 regular wave representation h 161 5m and t 2 3s results for resistance the maximum total uncertainty was about the largest for the standard deviation and the a1 10 peak amplitude the a1 10 peak amplitude of the resistance was about 3 times the average resistance the average and rms resistance in regular waves was nearly the same as the average and rms resistance in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for resistance in regular waves was lower than the average peak amplitude in irregular waves this was most likely due to the double peak of the resistance the resistance in irregular waves showed an increase over the resistance in calm water the mean calm water resistance at fr 0 62 was 246 36 n hoggard 1979 developed an empirical equation to predict the added resistance in irregular waves for planing hulls the r v athena was outside the range of applicability but the equation still provided a good comparison the equation was as follows 30 r a δ 1 3 h 1 3 b 0 5 l p p 1 3 2 5 f r v the predicted mean added resistance in irregular waves was 27 3 n 11 of the mean calm water resistance for a predicted mean resistance in irregular waves of 273 6 n the predicted mean resistance fell within the experimental uncertainty of the irregular wave mean resistance for pitch the maximum total uncertainty was for the a1 10 peak amplitude the a1 10 peak amplitude of the pitch was about 4 times the average pitch the average and rms pitch in regular waves was slightly higher than the average and rms pitch in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for pitch in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pitch in irregular waves for heave the maximum total uncertainty was for the average heave this was due to the small average heave the average heave was slightly higher in regular waves than the average heave in irregular waves the rms heave in regular waves was slightly larger than the rms heave in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for heave in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for heave in irregular waves for bow vertical acceleration the maximum total uncertainty was for the a1 10 peak amplitude bow vertical acceleration the rms bow vertical acceleration in regular waves was twice the rms bow vertical acceleration in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for bow vertical acceleration in regular waves was slightly higher than the a1 3 peak amplitude for bow vertical accelerations in irregular waves for lcg vertical acceleration the maximum total uncertainty was for the rms lcg vertical acceleration this was due to the small value of rms lcg vertical acceleration the rms lcg vertical acceleration in regular waves was larger than the rms lcg vertical acceleration in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for lcg vertical acceleration in regular waves was nearly the same as the a1 10 peak amplitude for lcg vertical accelerations in irregular waves for pressure at p2 the maximum total uncertainty was for the average of the pressure this was due to the small value of the average of the pressure the average peak amplitude for pressure at p2 in regular waves 3 476 kpa was slightly higher than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pressure in irregular waves for pressure at p5 the maximum total uncertainty was for the standard deviation of the pressure this was due to the small value of the standard deviation of pressure the average peak amplitude for pressure at p11 which is near p5 in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pressure in irregular waves the regular wave representation of the irregular wave showed that for most of the cases the average peak amplitude in regular waves correlated to the a1 3 peak amplitude in irregular waves there was potential to use regular wave representation of irregular waves to predict the structural design parameters acceleration and pressure this would help reduce cost of experiments by running shorter groups of regular waves instead of having to use multiple runs to get statistically significant irregular wave measurements 6 conclusions an experimental study in regular and irregular waves and a numerical study in regular waves were designed and executed with a unified approach to understand the motions of a semi planing hull the resistance heave pitch vertical accelerations and pressure response of the hull was evaluated experimentally in regular waves by systematically varying the froude number wavelength and wave steepness independently evaluating the wave steepness showed that larger wave steepnesses resulted in a lower response for motions and pressures the hull response was evaluated in irregular waves and compared with the regular wave hull response the experimental setup and the experimental uncertainty was well documented for future use in the validation of cfd the experimental results from the two regular wave conditions that exhibited the largest hull response were used for validation the simulations were able to predict the motions pressures and accelerations well showing that the cfd had the capability for design predictions of semi planing hulls the uncertainty analysis for the regular waves was analyzed using three different methods multiple run best run and ten best waves the uncertainty using the multiple run method was slightly higher overall than the ten best waves method the best run method had the largest uncertainty of the three methods the ten best waves uncertainty analysis was used for comparisons with simulations because the simulations simulated the ten best waves due to physical effects of the wavemaker and the model basin the regular waves produced in the experiment had slight imperfections a wave group analysis was conducted to determine if reproducing the wave more accurately in simulation with additional wave components would lead to simulation results that were more accurate the results showed that the small imperfections in the experimental waves did not have a large impact on the simulation results therefore the idealized regular wave can be used as the input wave for simulations the resistance motions and accelerations for the r v athena was compared with the ntua and similar trends showed increased with increasing froude number and a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 75 independently evaluating the effects of h λ showed that mostly larger steepness has smaller response the results show that semi displacement hull motion response was like that for displacement hulls at least for the current fr and λ l the simulations were able to predict the vertical accelerations well with errors less than 10 x the error for the trends of heave pitch and pressure at pressure gauge 11 were larger than 10 x but the predicted time history trends matched the experiments well the frequency domain analysis showed similar errors between the experiments and the simulation the added resistance in waves exhibited a double peak for each wave impact in the experimental and simulated resistance when looking at the experiments alone one would attribute the double peak in the experimental resistance to be part of the whipping of the tow post the simulation results showed that the double peak was a physical phenomenon for semi planing hulls the regular wave representation of the irregular wave showed that for most of the cases the average peak amplitude in regular waves correlated to the a1 3 peak amplitude in irregular waves there is potential to use regular wave representation rw5 of irregular waves to predict the structural design parameters acceleration and pressure this would help reduce cost of experiments by running shorter groups of regular waves instead of having to use multiple runs to get statistically significant irregular wave measurements the correlation of the regular wave results with the irregular wave results for a semi planing hull further supports the regular wave representations developed by diez et al 2013 and their wave correlations for a catamaran hull the mean resistance in irregular waves matched the empirical method for predicting added resistance of planing craft future research extends the current studies for investigations of fluid structure

methodology and the uncertainty equations are presented for the multiple runs best run and the ten best waves uncertainty analysis a1 1 multiple runs the experimental data was first evaluated using all the runs for each wave condition the following process was used for the multiple runs evaluation the mean experimental value for the multiple runs x was defined as a1 x 1 m r u n r u n 1 m r u n x r u n where x run was the experimental value for each run and m run was the total number of runs for each wave condition the standard deviation of the mean experimental value for the multiple runs σ x

20249,the advancements in numerical tools has opened the opportunity for simulations to provide a more accurate prediction of the structural response of a semi planing hull than the current empirical methods that use historical data from early generation hull designs numerical tools first need to be able to predict the hydrodynamic response of a semi planing hull before attempting to predict the structural response to prove this an extensive study of a semi planing hull in waves has been conducted where the experiments were designed to work concurrently with simulation tools to understand the underlying hydrodynamics this work independently evaluated the effect of speed wave steepness and wavelength on the hydrodynamic response in addition to the experimental results a comprehensive analysis quantified the uncertainty and showed small differences between methods for the analysis as part of the unified approach to this study the test setup of the experiments have been well documented to improve the accuracy of the initial conditions in the simulations the assessment the simulations showed the usefulness of simulations by predicting time history trends that matched the experiments well the simulations were able to predict the vertical accelerations well while the error trends were larger for heave pitch and pressure keywords semi planing hull model test cfd uncertainty waves 1 introduction 1 1 background semi planing hull structural design has been based on empirical methods derived from many decades of historical data from early generation hull designs allen and jones 1978 american bureau of shipping 2017 these structural designs are robust and implemented on many successful semi planing hulls current demands for increased payload and speed as well as the advancement in numerical tools has provided the basis to reevaluate semi planing hull structural design methods to understand the structural response for semi planing hull structural design the motions of an semi planing hulls in waves first needs to be understood there have been a limited number of model tests of semi planing hulls in waves semi planing hull model tests include the high speed ship hayden et al 2009 a fast ferry fonseca and soares 2005 a series based on a fast torpedo boat lindgren and aake 1968 the ntua double chine series grigoropoulos et al 2010 the npl series bailey 1976 the vtt series based on the npl series lahtiharju et al 1991 and the marin slender hull series blok and beukelman 1984 various methods have been developed for predicting the motions of semi planing hulls in waves ogilvie and tuck 1969 have developed a strip theory method for slender hulls that was further refined by newman 1978 this method was developed for high speed hulls by faltinsen and zhao 1991 to simulate a semi displacement hull ibrahim et al 2009 used a time domain code based on a 3 d potential flow solution of the wave body hydrodynamic interaction problem called large amplitude motions program lamp ahmed et al 2005 simulated a semi planing hull in regular waves using a green s function method and a flexible appendage to approximate the dry transom in recent years research on planing hulls has increased unfortunately there has not been a similar increase in research for semi planing hulls recent work by baso et al 2020 showed the effect of trim angle on the powering requirement of a semi planing hull in clam water no recent research has been found for a semi planing hull in waves an extensive study of a semi planing hull in waves has been conducted where the experiments were designed to work concurrently with simulation tools to understand the underlying hydrodynamics whereas previous work focused on only the effect of wavelength on the hydrodynamic response this work evaluated the effect of wave steepness separately from wavelength this work also contributed to the existing body of experimental data by quantifying the uncertainty in addition to providing experimental results as part of the unified approach to this study the test setup of the experiments have been well documented to improve the accuracy of the initial conditions in the simulations the final contribution was the assessment of two different simulations tools for their suitability for design of semi planing hulls the semi planing hull r v athena was chosen to facilitate the public release of experimental results for validation of computational tools the hull was also chosen for the previous comparisons between experiments and simulations ratcliffe et al 2007 tested the r v athena fixed in pitch and heave in regular waves bhushan et al 2009 conducted blind simulations of the r v athena in regular waves therefore there was limited experimental data for the r v athena in waves the current study expands the experimental data set of the r v athena by testing the model free to pitch and heave in calm water regular and irregular waves the regular wave experimental data was useful for comparisons with cfd because the fundamental physics of the simulation can be evaluated quickly on repeatable waves of constant amplitude the free to pitch and heave in irregular waves model test was a good representation of the expected motions and wave impacts a semi planing hull will experience at full scale the r v athena was tested at naval surface warfare center carderock division for the current study on two different dates lee et al 2016 fullerton et al 2017 2019a 2019b 2019c this paper builds on the contributions of the previous related study of lee et al 2020 which provided an assessment of experiments and cfd for the semi planing r v athena model in calm water 1 2 objective the objective of the study was to improve understanding of the physics and prediction capability of the motions and slamming loads of a semi planing craft in a seaway via experiments and cfd simulations specifically 1 assessment of model tests evaluate the response of a semi planing hull in two degrees of freedom resistance heave pitch vertical accelerations and pressures in regular and irregular waves the regular wave wavelength and wave steepness was systematically varied to understand the underlying physics needed for numerical predictions of the dynamic response of semi planing craft in a seaway the data reduction equations follow the ittc recommended method international towing tank conference 2017 rigorous uncertainty analysis was conducted using multiple runs best run and ten best waves to understand the physics to help with design the ten best waves method for uncertainty analysis had the overall smallest total uncertainty and was used for validation 2 assessment of cfd verification and validation to determine the capability and usefulness of cfd for design predictions of semi planing hulls the ultimate goal as already stated is for increased payload and speed as well as the advancement in numerical tools has provided the basis to reevaluate hsnc structural design methods thus the present research was also preparatory to the subsequent grillage studies for athena and gpph as per weil et al 2018 and diez et al 2020 1 3 experimental approach 1 3 1 regular waves two model tests of the r v athena were conducted in regular waves at multiple speeds wave heights and wave periods to evaluate the motion response of a semi planing hull the wave conditions covered wavelengths λ normalized by the length between perpendiculars l λ l 1 00 1 45 and 2 00 with a range of wave steepness 1 h λ from 25 to 109 the measured variables were wave height encounter wave period resistance pitch heave bow and lcg vertical accelerations and pressure at two locations the uncertainty analysis was conducted using dimensional values for multiple runs best run and ten best waves the formulations for the three uncertainty methods are presented in appendix a 1 to allow the experimental results to be compared with other experiments the added resistance in waves peak trough pitch peak trough heave and peak accelerations were non dimensionalized using the ittc recommended method international towing tank conference 2017 additionally the non dimensional root mean squared rms resistance and the peak pressure was calculated the rms resistance was calculated to assess the resistance response during each wave impact the equations for the non dimensionalized measured variables can be found in appendix a2 2 the accelerations and pressures are important to use as inputs into hull structural design the pitch and heave motions are important for comparisons with simulations to ensure the simulations are correctly predicting the underlying hydrodynamics to more effectively compare the experiments with simulations the mean rms and peak value peak trough for pitch and heave was calculated for each measured variable the comparison with simulations were made using dimensional values to allow for a direct comparison a harmonic analysis was also conducted for one of the simulations 1 3 2 irregular waves the measured variables were wave height encounter period resistance pitch heave bow and lcg vertical accelerations and pressure at two locations the average rms standard deviation average peak value average of the 1 3rd highest a1 3 peak value and average of the 1 10th highest a1 10 peak value were calculated for each of the measured variables the peak values were determined as the maximum positive value within a window of one most probable wave period the average resistance was important in the selection of the propulsion plant as the propulsion must provide enough power to overcome the average resistance the experimental values were determined using the autocovariance analysis method detailed in diez et al 2018 the block bootstrap method was used with a block size of four times the most probable wave period to estimate the precision uncertainty for the average and rms values the block bootstrap method was used so that the correlation between groups of waves was maintained for the average and rms values the regular bootstrap method was used to estimate the precision uncertainty of the peak values 1 4 numerical approach predictions of r v athena in calm water were performed using two different computational codes the research code cfdship iowa and the commercial code star ccm predictions of r v athena in waves were performed using cfdship iowa cfdship iowa v4 5 is an incompressible urans des solver designed for ship hydrodynamics lee et al 2016 urans equations are used to compute the

equations but are changed within the nonlinear iteration loop to account for nonlinearities from turbulence equations nonlinear momentum transport etc the spatial discretization of the convection terms uses a second order upwind approach the diffusion and pressure terms in the momentum equations are discretized using a second order central scheme the temporal and spatial discretization for the k ω k ε equations are consistent with the momentum equations the projection algorithm or the pressure implicit with splitting operator piso method couples the momentum and continuity equations finally a fully implicit predictor corrector method determines the six degrees of freedom motions details of equations and numerical methods can be found in huang et al 2008 simcenter star ccm is a finite volume based solver of navier stokes equations with options to solve euler equations viscous laminar navier stokes equations and consideration of various turbulence models rans family des les for the current work the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solver was used for modeling the regular waves it has a robust meshing tool which needs little user interaction and a volume of fluid vof solver which was useful for wave impact and fluid structure interactions the vof approach assumes that the grid cells near the free surface are filled with both air and water and within each grid cell the vof pressure velocity and gravitational force acting on the fluid was calculated the ocean waves and the free surface are tracked by using the vof values in the domain this code has been applied to several past efforts concerning planing craft and surface ships 2 experimental methods 2 1 r v athena the r v athena was a converted pg 84 asheville class patrol gunboat with a semi planing hull form the body plan of the r v athena is shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a picture of the r v athena model 5365 the model mass properties were measured using the process described in appendix b of lee et al 2017 table 1 shows the as tested model particulars 2 2 setup the r v athena model test was performed in the deep water basin at nswccd using towing carriage 2 the basin is approximately 574 m long 15 53 m wide and 6 7m deep carriage 2 has a maximum towing speed of 10 29 m s a pneumatic wavemaker is located at the east end of the basin with a wave absorbing beach at the west end ambient conditions during the test were nominally a 74 f basin water temperature 80 f air temperature and an 80 relative humidity no windscreen was employed from the carriage to mitigate wind resistance to simplify the simulations 2 3 measurement system the r v athena was equipped fig 3 with a suite of sensors to measure the wave height encounter wave period resistance pitch heave vertical accelerations and pressure the data reduction equations for each measurement can be found in appendix a2 1 the resistance measurement was acquired through two separate dynamometers mounted on the model the main dynamometer was attached to the model above the tow point and measured the resistance in an earth fixed orientation during testing a fixture was used to restrict yaw motions of the model because this additional fixture absorbed some of the resistance the second dynamometer measured forces exerted on the fixture to determine the total resistance on the model since the dynamometer was installed below the grasshopper fixture the forces exerted on the fixture were measured in the body fixed orientation these body fixed forces were transformed to an earth fixed orientation before being used to calculate the resistance on the model three string potentiometers string pots were used to measure vertical displacement of the model at the bow the tow post and the stern the bow and stern string potentiometers were used to calculate the pitch angle the tow post string potentiometer was used to measure the heave thetwo accelerometers were utilized during the r v athena model 5365 testing one vertical accelerometer was located near the bow and one tri axial accelerometer at the tow post near the lcg the accelerometers were mounted to give positive vertical values upward in the body fixed orientation the acceleration mean value was equal to the earth fixed gravity vector and removed from the raw accelerometer signals eighteen pressure sensors were mounted on the bottom of the model hull during testing three sensors were analyzed for this study p2 p5 and p11 these sensors were used to measure single point slamming pressures during the model tests the pressure sensors were npi 19 series sensors and had a reference pressure area with a 17 3 mm diameter the pressure sensor locations p5 and p11 were determined from initial simulation studies to have the largest impact pressures pressure sensor location p2 was selected because previous experience showed high pressures near the bow during wave impacts senix toughsonic 30 ultrasonic wave elevation sensors were used to measure the as encountered wave surface characteristics from the carriage the carriage mounted sensor provided near field wave data as encountered specifically wave height and encounter period t e 2 4 test conditions the irregular wave conditions were chosen to represent the r v athena operating in sea state 3 and 4 at full scale sea state 4 was the designed operating sea condition for the r v athena table 2 shows the scaled significant wave height h1 3 and the most probable wave period tm used to develop the bretschneider representation of the irregular wave field three speeds froude number fr 0 25 0 43 and 0 62 were run at each sea state the analysis of the sea state 4 wave conditions is presented in this paper table 3 shows the regular wave conditions tested one regular wave condition was tested in 2014 wave height of 231 1 mm and a period of 1 9 s regular wave conditions for the 2015 test were selected as representations of the irregular wave condition that produce similar enough craft motions in regular waves both the rw2 and the rw5 regular wave representation of the irregular wave spectrum have a regular wave height that was 2 2 times the significant wave height of the irregular wave spectrum diez et al 2013 the regular wave period of the rw2 representation was the peak period of the irregular wave energy spectrum the regular wave period of the rw5 representation was the period corresponding to the true average frequency in the encounter spectrum at fr 0 5 the regular wave condition with a wave height of 75 4 mm and a period of 2 3 s was selected as an rw2 representation of the sea state 3 condition the regular wave condition with a wave height of 161 5 mm and a period of 2 7 s was selected as an rw2 representation of the sea state 4 condition the regular wave condition with a wave height of 161 5 mm and a period of 2 3 s was selected as an rw5 representation of the sea state 4 condition finally a wave period of 1 91 s was selected at the wave height of 161 5 mm to match the wave period tested in 2014 all the wave conditions were tested at fr 0 25 0 43 and 0 62 there were errors in the data collection of the fr 0 43 h 161 5 mm t 2 7s wave condition and the data will not be presented table 3 also shows the number of runs conducted during the experiment for each wave conditions mrun mrun was used for the multiple run analysis and the number ten wave time blocks m10 used for the ten best wave analysis is also shown the data analysis below showed the accelerations and pressures were the highest for the waves with a wave period of 2 3 s and a froude number of 0 62 the fr 0 62 h 161 5 mm t 2 3 s and the fr 0 62 h 75 4 mm t 2 3 s wave conditions were selected for further comparison with simulations highlighted in table 3 3 numerical methods 3 1 cfdship iowa setup the cfdship iowa grid consisted of multi block body fitted boundary layer bl grids with 20 64 million grid points and a static cartesian background grid with 6 46 million grid points totaling to a grid size of 27 1m the bl grids were designed to ensure y 1 in all simulation conditions the background grid points were clustered around the free surface with at least 20 grid points per wave height to ensure accurate resolution of free surface evolution inside the computational domain a symmetry boundary condition was used for the midship while the inlet and side boundaries imposed wave and ship velocity inflow conditions zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the top and bottom boundaries and the second gradients were set to be zero at the exit boundary the grid design is shown in fig 4 below the simulations were carried out with 256 time steps per the incoming wave encounter period and the run lengths are at least 10 wave periods or until iterative convergence is achieved 3 2 star ccm the star ccm trimmed grid consisted of overset grids with 8 4 million grid points and a static trimmed background grid with 6 2 million grid points totaling to a grid size of 14 5m the all y wall function is used and the bl grids were designed for y 1 in all simulation conditions the background grid points were clustered around the free surface with at least 32 grid points per wave height to ensure accurate resolution of free surface evolution inside the computational domain a symmetry boundary condition was used for the midship while the inlet imposed wave and ship velocity inflow conditions zero gradient boundary conditions were used at the top and the outlet boundaries wall condition is used for bottom and the side boundaries to simulate the actual tow tanks walls the grid design is shown in fig 5 below 4 uncertainty analysis estimates total uncertainty u values were derived from the experimental precision uncertainty p and the estimated bias uncertainty b following the coleman and steele 1999 method the uncertainties were estimated at a 95 confidence level using a factor of 2 giving a 95 probability that the true experimental value x lies within the reported confidence interval i e μ true x u x u the bias uncertainty was the fixed component of the total uncertainty and was referred to as systematic uncertainty the uncertainty values using the multiple best run and ten waves methods for the regular waves are detailed in appendix b2 1 the precision uncertainty was generally larger by the multiple run and best run method than for the ten waves method due to the variability of the average data between each run this increased the total uncertainty because the bias uncertainty was the same for all three analysis methods the ten best wave uncertainty analysis will be used for the comparison of the experimental results with simulation because it represents the best set of waves that were run in the experiment the uncertainty values for the irregular waves are detailed in appendix b2 2 the precision uncertainty became a larger contributor to the total uncertainty as the peak amplitude went up due to the larger variability in the extreme peaks 4 1 wave group analysis due to the variability of the height of the regular wave a wave group analysis was conducted to determine if a wave group would be best to represent the incoming wave signal similar to previous 3 sister waves mousaviraad and carrica 2010 and wam v in single wave events mousaviraad et al 2018 table 4 shows the frequency and amplitude of the first 32 wave components to reconstruct the wave measured for h 161 5 mm and t 2 3 s table 5 shows the error between the measured wave and the reconstructed wave based on the number of wave components in the wave group for h 161 5 mm and t 2 3 s the total error was determined by summing the error between the measured wave and the reconstructed wave for each point 32 wave components were selected for use as the input wave group for the simulations simulations were run comparing the craft motions with the wave group and a single regular wave as input table 6 shows the difference between the two inputs the heave had the largest difference in error the overall average error reduced using the wave group because the additional wave components in the wave group created a more accurate measured wave for input into the cfd the single regular wave was used for further analysis as the difference between the predicted craft motions using the wave group and regular wave as inputs was small 4 2 cfdship iowa verification and validation 4 2 1 cfdship iowa cfdship iowa verification and validation v v studies follow the detailed procedures explained in xing and stern 2010 grid studies were carried out by refining coarsening both the bl and the background grids with a refinement ratio of r 2 the total grid sizes were 11 2m for the coarse grid 27 1m for the medium grid and 46 4m for the fine grid summary of cfdship iowa grid verification studies are presented in table 7 the v v analysis was carried out for the 1st harmonic amplitudes for force motions and accelerations for slamming pressure the v v variables are the peak pressure and slam duration monotonic convergence was achieved for all the variables the p values are close to 1 0 except for the slam duration the grid uncertainty was very large for the acceleration and peak pressure the time history for pitch is shown in fig 6 the time history results for the coarse grid were significantly different in terms of amplitudes and phases compared to the medium while the medium and the fine grid results were very close to each other 4 2 2 star ccm grid studies were carried out by refining coarsening both the bl and the background grids with a refinement ratio of r 2 the total grid sizes were 3 5m for the coarse grid and 14 5m for the fine grid the results for the coarse grid were not significantly different in terms of amplitudes and phases compared to the medium grid while the medium and the fine grid results were different each other as shown for pitch in the fig 7 below the fine mesh result were closer to the efd measurement 5 results and discussion 5 1 regular wave results a combination of the 2014 and 2015 tests enabled the evaluation of the effects of fr λ l and h λ table 8 and table 9 shows the experimental conditions measured value and total uncertainty as percentage of the measured value the total uncertainty values for resistance was as high as about 60 x at the highest speed this was due to the small added resistance in waves at that speeds the total uncertainty values were reasonable for motions i e less than 7 x with largest values for shortest wavelength for the accelerations the total uncertainty values were larger up to 3 times here again mostly with largest values for shorter waves figs 8 and 9 are for rms resistance figs 10 and 11 are for added resistance figs 12 and 13 are for pitch and figs 14 and 15 are for heave showing the response vs the encounter frequency normalized by the natural frequency ωe ωn and λ l respectively in figs 9 11 13 and 15 the data labels are the 1 h λ values the actual wave amplitude and encounter wave period was used for the calculation of the non dimensional resistance pitch and heave the nominal wave height was used for the h λ values for consistency across fr the natural frequency fn values for heave 1 15 hz and pitch 1 01 hz were estimated using cfdship iowa for fr 0 also shown are the results from ntua grigoropoulos et al 2010 in regular waves for a similar fr and displacement as the r v athena grigoropoulos et al 2010 experiments were for constant wave amplitude a such that the wave steepness varies from 1 36 to 1 97 for the shorter to longer waves and its effects cannot be separated cfd comparisons were made at two 1 h λ 109 and 51 at λ l 1 45 and fr 0 62 the rms resistance in waves showed a strong dependence on λ l with λ l 1 45 showing the largest response the rms resistance also increased with fr and generally decreased with larger h λ the added resistance in waves decreases with increasing fr with a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 875 the results vs λ l show that the r v athena added resistance had trends that were like those for ntua the lower speeds had a maximum response at a smaller λ l the highest speed had a maximum response at a larger λ l and showed a broad peak near the maximum response the steeper waves generally had lower added resistance in waves the motion trends were more clearly shown using ωe ωn i e the motion response increases with increasing fr for both heave and pitch which was like 5415 irvine et al 2008 including that the maximum response occurs near ωe ωn 0 75 the results vs λ l show that the r v athena motion response was also like that for ntua the effects of h λ show that mostly larger steepness has smaller response indicating increased damping for larger h λ irvine et al 2008 showed no effects of wave steepness for h λ 1 126 1 63 and 1 42 mousaviraad et al 2018 states that the maximum response conditions for a displacement hull occurs when the maximum excitation and wave radiation forces coincide the coincidence froude number frc was defined as mousaviraad et al 2018 29 f r c 1 33 l p p g f n 3 8 π where fn natural frequency of pitch or heave the calculated coincidence froude number of the r v athena for pitch was frc 0 32 and for heave was frc 0 43 the experimental results for r v athena showed that the motion response increased with fr the results show that semi displacement hull motion response was like that for displacement hulls at least for the current fr and λ l fig 16 through 19 are similar but for the vertical bow and lcg acceleration the trends are like those described for the motions the large accelerations correspond to large values of rms and added resistance fig 20 through 23 are similar plots for pressure at p2 located near the bow the highest pressure was at the slowest speed and the smallest λ l at p11 the pressure seems to have a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 95 this can be seen because the pressure is much smaller for fr 0 62 at λ l 1 and ωe ωn 1 16 than at the two lower froude numbers and the encounter frequency is higher than the encounter frequency of maximum response also the time history plots shown below show that at conditions with non dimensional pressure below 0 2 there was no initial pressure spike to indicate wave slamming 5 2 regular wave experimental comparisons with simulations 5 2 1 time domain comparisons fig 24 shows the third and fourth peak of the ten wave time history dataset for the resistance heave trim lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 for the h 75 4 mm wave the experiment and the two simulations were time aligned based on the first peak of the heave the experiments showed a double peak in resistance during each wave encounter both of the simulations predicted that the resistance during each wave encounter was not sinusoidal but they do not have the double peak shown the experiments the predicted trim and heave had similar trends to the measured results the lcg and bow vertical acceleration were nearly sinusoidal with the peak occurring in the middle of the cycle this would mean that at the h 75 4 mm wave height the hull was not experiencing slamming during a slam there was a sharp rise in the acceleration at the beginning of the cycle and then the acceleration drops to a lower steady state value before returning to zero the experimental bow and lcg vertical acceleration showed some noise at the peak of the acceleration this noise was also seen in the resistance this could be due to longitudinal bending due to the long length of the r v athena the star ccm bow vertical acceleration showed some spikes leading up to the slam the pressure at p11 confirms that there was no slam as there would normally be a sharp spike at the beginning of the cycle the star ccm simulation showed the same trends as the experiment but with an offset to a lower pressure table 10 shows the experimental uncertainty and the simulation error the error for mean and rms resistance was small the error for the peak was higher but it was still reasonable considering the simulated resistance through the cycle does not match the experiments the error for resistance and added did not fall within the experimental uncertainty for heave the cfdship iowa predictions were slightly larger than the experimental uncertainty the error for star ccm was larger and outside of the experimental uncertainty as the peak heave was over predicted cfdship iowa predicted a lower mean and rms pitch the peak trough error was small and fell within the experimental uncertainty star ccm predicted a higher mean rms and peak trough value the time history showed that the overall predicted pitch trend was higher than the experiment the cfdship iowa and star ccm rms and peak error for the lcg vertical acceleration fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed a small spike in the experimental data at the peak of the lcg vertical acceleration if the spike was excluded in the peak analysis the cfdship iowa error drops to 4 06 x and the star ccm error drops to 7 5 x the rms and peak bow vertical acceleration error for cfdship iowa fell within the experimental uncertainties the rms bow vertical acceleration error for star ccm fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed that star ccm had some spikes in the data leading up to the peak of the bow vertical acceleration that was higher than the peak if these spikes were not used to determine the peak the peak bow vertical acceleration error would be 1 47 x and would fall within the experimental uncertainty the cfdship iowa error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was barely outside of the experimental uncertainty for the mean and was within the experimental uncertainty for the rms and peak the star ccm mean and peak error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was large while the rms value was just within the uncertainty analysis looking at the time history the shape of the pressure impulses predicted by star ccm looks like the pressure pulse measured in the experiment but the prediction was lower this lead to the large error in mean and peak but smaller error in the rms value fig 25 shows the third and fourth peak of the ten wave time history dataset for the resistance heave trim lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 for the h 161 5 mm wave the experiments showed a double peak in resistance during each wave encounter both of the simulations predicted the double peak but the trends did not match the experiments this showed that the double peak in the resistance was physical and not an artifact of the hull attached to the carriage via the tow post the predicted trim and heave had similar trends to the measured results the lcg and bow vertical acceleration were somewhat sinusoidal with the peak occurring in the middle of the cycle both vertical accelerations started to show the initial spike of hull experiencing a wave slam during a slam there was a sharp rise in the acceleration at the beginning of the cycle and then the acceleration drops to a lower steady state value before returning to zero this would mean that at the h 161 5 mm wave height the hull was experiencing slamming the cfdship iowa bow vertical acceleration showed the leading spike to be higher than the steady state portion of the acceleration the pressure at p11 confirms that there was slamming as the sharp spike could be seen at the beginning of the cycle table 11 shows the experimental uncertainty and the simulation error the error for resistance and added resistance did not fall within the experimental uncertainty for heave the prediction error was much larger than the experimental uncertainty the time history showed that cfdship iowa and star ccm over predicted the peak and star ccm also under predicted the tough for trim the predicted errors for cfdship iowa and star ccm was small but fell outside the experimental uncertainty the cfdship iowa and star ccm rms and average peak amplitude error for the lcg vertical acceleration fell within the experimental uncertainty the time history showed a small spike in the experimental data at the peak of the lcg vertical acceleration if the spike was excluded in the peak analysis the cfdship iowa error drops to 8 35 x and the star ccm error drops to 4 72 x this brought the error in star ccm to fall within the experimental uncertainty and the cfdship iowa error to nearly fall within the experimental uncertainty the rms bow vertical acceleration error for star ccm fell within the experimental uncertainty the error in the peak for cfdship iowa was large 10 x the time history showed that cfdship iowa predicted the slam peak higher than the steady state value both the experiment and star ccm predicted the highest acceleration to occur during the steady state phase the error in the steady state peak for cfdship iowa was 7 86 x the cfdship iowa error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was within the experimental uncertainty for the mean and rms cfdship iowa over predicted the peak the star ccm error for pressure at pressure gauge 11 was large 10 x looking at the time history the shape of the pressure impulses predicted by star ccm looks like the pressure pulse measured in the experiment but the prediction was lower 5 2 2 frequency domain comparisons with cfdship iowa in the frequency domain the validation variables were considered to be the 0th harmonic amplitude and the 1st to 3rd harmonic amplitude for resistance heave pitch lcg vertical acceleration bow vertical acceleration and pressure at p11 the error values for h 75 4 mm are presented in table 12 for resistance the error values were large due to the issues with different trends between the experiments and the cfd for the other variables the average error was smaller than 13 x the error values for h 161 5 mm are presented in table 13 for resistance the error was large due to the issues with different trends between experiments and cfd for heave the largest error was for the 0th amplitude while the error in the 1st amplitude and phase was the smallest for pitch the largest error was for the 3rd amplitude the error for the 0th amplitude and the 1st amplitude and phase was small for accelerations the largest error was for the 3rd amplitude while the error in the 1st amplitude and phase was the smallest for the pressure the largest error was for the 0th amplitude while error in the other harmonic amplitudes and phases was small the 1st amplitude and phase has the smallest error averaged over all of the validation variables 5 3 irregular wave results the resistance pitch heave acceleration and pressure values are shown in table 14 and table 15 the average rms standard deviation average peak a1 3 and a1 10 was calculated for each variable the irregular wave results were compared with the rw5 regular wave representation h 161 5m and t 2 3s results for resistance the maximum total uncertainty was about the largest for the standard deviation and the a1 10 peak amplitude the a1 10 peak amplitude of the resistance was about 3 times the average resistance the average and rms resistance in regular waves was nearly the same as the average and rms resistance in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for resistance in regular waves was lower than the average peak amplitude in irregular waves this was most likely due to the double peak of the resistance the resistance in irregular waves showed an increase over the resistance in calm water the mean calm water resistance at fr 0 62 was 246 36 n hoggard 1979 developed an empirical equation to predict the added resistance in irregular waves for planing hulls the r v athena was outside the range of applicability but the equation still provided a good comparison the equation was as follows 30 r a δ 1 3 h 1 3 b 0 5 l p p 1 3 2 5 f r v the predicted mean added resistance in irregular waves was 27 3 n 11 of the mean calm water resistance for a predicted mean resistance in irregular waves of 273 6 n the predicted mean resistance fell within the experimental uncertainty of the irregular wave mean resistance for pitch the maximum total uncertainty was for the a1 10 peak amplitude the a1 10 peak amplitude of the pitch was about 4 times the average pitch the average and rms pitch in regular waves was slightly higher than the average and rms pitch in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for pitch in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pitch in irregular waves for heave the maximum total uncertainty was for the average heave this was due to the small average heave the average heave was slightly higher in regular waves than the average heave in irregular waves the rms heave in regular waves was slightly larger than the rms heave in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for heave in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for heave in irregular waves for bow vertical acceleration the maximum total uncertainty was for the a1 10 peak amplitude bow vertical acceleration the rms bow vertical acceleration in regular waves was twice the rms bow vertical acceleration in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for bow vertical acceleration in regular waves was slightly higher than the a1 3 peak amplitude for bow vertical accelerations in irregular waves for lcg vertical acceleration the maximum total uncertainty was for the rms lcg vertical acceleration this was due to the small value of rms lcg vertical acceleration the rms lcg vertical acceleration in regular waves was larger than the rms lcg vertical acceleration in irregular waves the average peak amplitude for lcg vertical acceleration in regular waves was nearly the same as the a1 10 peak amplitude for lcg vertical accelerations in irregular waves for pressure at p2 the maximum total uncertainty was for the average of the pressure this was due to the small value of the average of the pressure the average peak amplitude for pressure at p2 in regular waves 3 476 kpa was slightly higher than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pressure in irregular waves for pressure at p5 the maximum total uncertainty was for the standard deviation of the pressure this was due to the small value of the standard deviation of pressure the average peak amplitude for pressure at p11 which is near p5 in regular waves was slightly lower than the a1 3 peak amplitude for pressure in irregular waves the regular wave representation of the irregular wave showed that for most of the cases the average peak amplitude in regular waves correlated to the a1 3 peak amplitude in irregular waves there was potential to use regular wave representation of irregular waves to predict the structural design parameters acceleration and pressure this would help reduce cost of experiments by running shorter groups of regular waves instead of having to use multiple runs to get statistically significant irregular wave measurements 6 conclusions an experimental study in regular and irregular waves and a numerical study in regular waves were designed and executed with a unified approach to understand the motions of a semi planing hull the resistance heave pitch vertical accelerations and pressure response of the hull was evaluated experimentally in regular waves by systematically varying the froude number wavelength and wave steepness independently evaluating the wave steepness showed that larger wave steepnesses resulted in a lower response for motions and pressures the hull response was evaluated in irregular waves and compared with the regular wave hull response the experimental setup and the experimental uncertainty was well documented for future use in the validation of cfd the experimental results from the two regular wave conditions that exhibited the largest hull response were used for validation the simulations were able to predict the motions pressures and accelerations well showing that the cfd had the capability for design predictions of semi planing hulls the uncertainty analysis for the regular waves was analyzed using three different methods multiple run best run and ten best waves the uncertainty using the multiple run method was slightly higher overall than the ten best waves method the best run method had the largest uncertainty of the three methods the ten best waves uncertainty analysis was used for comparisons with simulations because the simulations simulated the ten best waves due to physical effects of the wavemaker and the model basin the regular waves produced in the experiment had slight imperfections a wave group analysis was conducted to determine if reproducing the wave more accurately in simulation with additional wave components would lead to simulation results that were more accurate the results showed that the small imperfections in the experimental waves did not have a large impact on the simulation results therefore the idealized regular wave can be used as the input wave for simulations the resistance motions and accelerations for the r v athena was compared with the ntua and similar trends showed increased with increasing froude number and a maximum response near ωe ωn 0 75 independently evaluating the effects of h λ showed that mostly larger steepness has smaller response the results show that semi displacement hull motion response was like that for displacement hulls at least for the current fr and λ l the simulations were able to predict the vertical accelerations well with errors less than 10 x the error for the trends of heave pitch and pressure at pressure gauge 11 were larger than 10 x but the predicted time history trends matched the experiments well the frequency domain analysis showed similar errors between the experiments and the simulation the added resistance in waves exhibited a double peak for each wave impact in the experimental and simulated resistance when looking at the experiments alone one would attribute the double peak in the experimental resistance to be part of the whipping of the tow post the simulation results showed that the double peak was a physical phenomenon for semi planing hulls the regular wave representation of the irregular wave showed that for most of the cases the average peak amplitude in regular waves correlated to the a1 3 peak amplitude in irregular waves there is potential to use regular wave representation rw5 of irregular waves to predict the structural design parameters acceleration and pressure this would help reduce cost of experiments by running shorter groups of regular waves instead of having to use multiple runs to get statistically significant irregular wave measurements the correlation of the regular wave results with the irregular wave results for a semi planing hull further supports the regular wave representations developed by diez et al 2013 and their wave correlations for a catamaran hull the mean resistance in irregular waves matched the empirical method for predicting added resistance of planing craft future research extends the current studies for investigations of fluid structure

conditions selected for comparisons with simulations the relative contributions of the bias and precision uncertainty showed that the bias uncertainty was usually larger than the precision uncertainty for all the variables except pitch the relative contribution of the precision uncertainty was highest in the peak trough value this was due to the larger variability of the peak and that the bias
