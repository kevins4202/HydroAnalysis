185,solute transport observed in subsurface formations shows complex behavior particularly in the presence of fractures in this work we focus on formations with fractures that are smaller compared to the domain of interest and which are distributed in a heterogeneous matrix at densities below the percolation threshold we developed a simplified lagrangian approach to characterize and predict advective transport in 2 d domains containing differently oriented fractures to this end we performed monte carlo simulation mcs studies using ensembles of random domain realizations and gathered analyzed tracer particle displacement statistics the series of displacement steps were defined by the locations of particles entering the matrix after traversing through one or several connected fractures then we identify key correlation structures in the evolution of and between displacement step coordinates namely the step length its orientation and the traverse time subsequently a correlated random walk model was derived which is able to accurately reproduce longitudinal and transverse macrodispersion as recorded in the mcs finally we explored the predictive capabilities of our stochastic model by simulating macrodispersion in stratified media composed of heterogeneous zones with different fracture orientations keywords macrodispersion random walk fractured porous media heterogeneity bimodal log conductivity distribution non fickian transport 1 introduction increasingly more realistic accurate and faster numerical models of transport processes in fractured porous media are desired because of their imperative role in numerous applications including the estimation of contaminant transport estimation of nuclear waste storage potential optimization of un conventional energy extraction processes etc ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 dispersion of solutes observed at the formation scale is caused by i mechanical dispersion at pore bifurcations ii molecular diffusion and iii spatial variations in the flow velocity due to domain hydraulic conductivity field heterogeneities gelhar 1986 greenkorn and kessler 1969 the contribution of iii i e macrodispersion relative to the combined contribution of i and ii i e pore scale dispersion is given by the péclet number the péclet number is defined as p e u l d where u is the mean flow velocity l is the characteristic length of the heterogeneous field and d is the dispersion coefficient characterizing the microscopic effects i and ii to isolate the effects of pure advection on large scale dispersion numerical studies are often conducted at infinite p e zarlenga and fiori 2015 meyer et al 2013 salandin and fiorotto 1998 such a scenario is not very far from reality because in natural domains the conductivity integral scale can be much larger than the pore scale dispersivity dagan 1989 in 2 d flows at infinite p e the solute plume s centered second moment in the transverse direction converges to a finite value attinger et al 2004 dagan 1988 the bounded nature of the solute particles motion as an ensemble is caused by the absence of mixing across streamlines interestingly this phenomena is observed only in 2 d in a 3 d domain the extra dimension allows the streamlines to cross each other without intersecting which results in an unbounded transverse spreading attinger et al 2004 jankovic et al 2009 solute plume spreading in heterogeneous formations shows non fickian behavior characterized by a non linear temporal growth of the plume s centered second moment this behavior is attributed to heterogeneities present across a large range of scales berkowitz and scher 1995 the multi scale heterogeneity structure leads to upscaled transport properties like the dispersion coefficient or dispersivity that are scale dependent berkowitz et al 2006 zech et al 2015 have suggested that the scaling laws are formation specific at the scales sufficiently larger than the velocity integral scale the asymptotic values are however attained fiori et al 2017 while the advection dispersion equation in its classical form with scale invariant dispersion coefficients is an accurate model in that large scale asymptotic limit we focus in this work on the pre asymptotic range due to the high level of uncertainty in subsurface domain characterization transport predictions are comprehensible only in a probabilistic sense bear 1972 de josselin de jong 1958 often the ensemble averaged concentration is chosen as the dependent state variable even if the advection dispersion equation is applicable for each realization in the ensemble the average transport is often found to be non fickian neuman and tartakovsky 2009 non local methods e g the lagrangian ones based on the versatile continuous time random walk ctrw framework berkowitz and scher 1997 provide a tenable description of the average non fickian transport they encapsulate the effect of medium heterogeneity into a random walk model for particle trajectories recently hyman et al 2019 have developed a time domain random walk model to estimate first passage time distributions in 3 d fracture networks the model is parametrized by the eulerian velocity distribution and characteristics of the network geometry i e average fracture length and tortuosity within the ctrw framework the correlated ctrw and spatial markov models successfully predict the longitudinal dispersion in continua le borgne et al 2008 and 2 d dispersion in fracture networks kang et al 2015a spatial markov models have also been developed for transport in 3 d fracture networks with a focus on capturing heavy tails of breakthrough curves the core of these models include a stochastic velocity process e g a parametric bernoulli process an empirically determined transition probability matrix kang et al 2020 and an ornstein uhlenbeck process for the normal scores of particle velocity hyman and dentz 2021 the polar markovian velocity process pmvp model was formulated to estimate 2 d dispersion in continua meyer et al 2013 recently a temporal variant of the pmvp model has been analytically derived meyer 2017 it is based on the eulerian first order perturbation theory and hence is suited for low heterogeneity media this model has subsequently been generalized for highly heterogeneous media meyer 2018b in continua models for the domains having large fractures defining representative elementary volumes revs at sufficiently small scales may not be possible schwartz and smith 1988 unless the effective representations of the matrix and fractures have segregation in their scales desbarats 1990 has modeled a sand shale system as a continuum with a bi modal distribution of the conductivity such a characterization can also be associated with a system of matrix and fractures rubin 1995 schwartz 1977 dagan and fiori 2003 fiori and dagan 2003 have formalized the time dependent behavior of longitudinal and transverse macrodispersivities in binary formations with a homogeneous matrix and isolated spherical circular inclusions different volume densities of inclusions and conductivity contrasts were considered in these studies though many recent efforts have focused on 3 d fractured media especially fracture networks we have considered transport in 2 d continua at infinite péclet number representing an extreme scenario characterized by strong correlations in particle motion and asymptotically bounded transverse dispersion the previously mentioned efforts to model 2 d dispersion in continua i e the pmvp model and its derivatives typify the conductivity heterogeneity with uni modal distributions without fractures in this contribution we analyze advection driven transport in a specific class of formations that is heterogeneous continua containing short fractures the fractures are distributed at densities below the percolation threshold which ensures that flow passes through both the matrix as well as the fractures in the domain model a multi variate bi modal distribution is adopted for the log conductivity as a first step we investigate transport statistics using a lagrangian approach guided by this statistical analyses we identify key characteristics of a minimalistic yet accurate random walk model for solute dispersion we further illustrate the capabilities of our dispersion model for fractured heterogeneous formations by extending it for predictions in non space stationary stratified media the paper starts in section 2 with summarizing a few approaches that form the basis of several stochastic methods for dispersion then in section 3 we describe the chosen domain characterization and two different set ups for monte carlo simulation of flow and transport which differ in the fracture orientation with respect to mean pressure gradient also we introduce a suitable effective particle pathline for the discussed domain types in section 4 detailed stochastic analyses of the effective pathlines are presented and based on the observations a definitive structure for the dispersion model was derived which is explained in section 5 the model validation and its predictive capabilities for the stratified media are discussed in section 6 2 computational stochastic methods the one point one time eulerian probability density function pdf is a first information to characterize uncertainties associated with a random field for example an eulerian velocity field u x t or a solute concentration field c x t are modeled as random fields due to uncertainty in conductivity field k x here x and t are spatial and temporal coordinates respectively the eulerian pdf of the concentration p c c x t where c is the sample space variable facilitates the extraction of eulerian statistical moments using the lagrangian descriptions of flow and transport offers a convenient approach to estimating the eulerian pdfs this is well explained by pope 1985 2011 in the context of pdf methods for reactive turbulent flows in such an approach fluid particles propagate in the physical and property velocity concentration etc spaces according to lagrangian equations e g in physical space as 1 d d t x t x 0 u x t x 0 t where x t x 0 is the position of a particle at time t 0 after starting at x 0 at time t 0 we conform to the definition of a fluid particle mentioned in pope 2011 to illustrate the applicability of pdf methods to model dispersion jenny et al 2006 meyer et al 2010 we continue with the previously mentioned example of a solute concentration field in the absence of pore scale dispersion and chemical reactions we can write 2 d d t c t x 0 0 where c t x 0 is the concentration of a fluid particle in the lagrangian reference frame if eq 2 is applicable the motion of passive solute tracer particles can be expressed by the motion of the associated fluid particles and the fluid particles are sufficient to evaluate p c c x t starting from a point source of volume v 0 with a concentration c 0 located at x 0 a fluid particle propagates and the associated solute concentration is conserved as we track its motion eq 1 further references of the term fluid particle shall be associated with the ones starting at the source meyer and tchelepi 2010 have shown a relation between p c c x t and the fluid particle position pdf p x x t which is p c c x t δ c c 0 v 0 p x x t δ c 1 v 0 p x x t consequently the ensemble averaged concentration is linearly related with the particle position pdf equation 9 25 in rubin 2003 given by 3 c x t c 0 v 0 p x x t in numerical simulations the motion of an ensemble of notional fluid particles according to the stochastic model provides p x x t given by 4 p x x t δ x x t x 0 in a time discretized representation eq 1 can be written as 5 x t δ t x 0 x t x 0 u x t x 0 t δ t the core of all stochastic models includes defining a temporal step δ t and the corresponding spatial step δ x t x 0 u x t x 0 t δ t in summary the one point one time solute concentration pdf p c c x t and moments such as c x t can be described by the random walk of an ensemble of notional particles in the following text wherever feasible the subscript in the pdf notation is dropped for better readability the random variable s associated with the pdf can be judged from the argument s in the pdf notation 2 1 monte carlo simulation methods in monte carlo simulation mcs methods for transport processes a number of k x realizations are generated based on a chosen geostatistical model freeze 1975 ostad ali askari et al 2018 and the eulerian velocity field is computed for each one of them de dreuzy et al 2007 salandin and fiorotto 1998 lagrangian particle tracking in the resulting velocity fields gives an ensemble of particle pathlines which simulates the solute transport eqs 4 and 5 along with eq 3 describe the ensemble averaged concentration generally the computational expenses of solving the flow field for each realization and the large number of realizations necessary to get good statistics limit the use of mcs methods random walk rw models for eq 5 are less constrained by such high computational demands a summary of two major categories of rw models is presented next 2 2 random walk models for dispersion 2 2 1 continuous time random walk in continuous time random walk ctrw theory particle motion has been conceptualized as a series of spatio temporal displacements between the locations of significant velocity transitions e g pore fracture intersections or fracture matrix interfaces berkowitz et al 2006 the classical ctrw model is fully characterized by a stationary joint pdf p s δ t where s denotes the particle s spatial displacement and δ t is the corresponding temporal step in the work of berkowitz and scher 1997 a ctrw model was formalized for random fracture networks using flow velocity and segment length distributions the resulting estimates of the longitudinal non fickian dispersion were presented the choice of s δ t and therefore its statistical structure is not universal and should be inspected for the specific formation and flow field under consideration berkowitz et al 2006 for continuous media having a multi gaussian l n k distribution le borgne et al 2007 have quantified spatio temporal correlations in the lagrangian velocity kang et al 2011 2015a have shown that an uncorrelated ctrw model when applied to regular 2 d fracture networks and characterized using the equidistantly sampled lagrangian velocity distribution alone is limited in its prediction of the plume spreadings and breakthrough curves even though the networks used in these studies have spatially uncorrelated conductivity the divergence free condition of velocity induces correlations in the velocities the proposition of correlated ctrw models is to account for the correlation structure of s δ t in the random walk for the velocity fields with finite correlation lengths times for all initial velocities the evolution of the lagrangian velocity can be characterized as a markov process in space time the stationary pdf p s δ t and a transition pdf of the form p s δ t s δ t where s δ t denotes the immediately preceding spatio temporal step form the basis of markov models for stationary processes spatial markov models have successfully predicted the longitudinal dispersion in continua at darcy scale le borgne et al 2008 and at pore scale de anna et al 2013 kang et al 2015a and kang et al 2017 have developed spatial markov models for 2 d dispersion in regular and 1 d dispersion in disordered fracture networks respectively frampton and cvetkovic 2007 have characterized lagrangian statistics and the travel time pdf f τ in random fracture networks in their work f τ obtained at a relatively small scale is upscaled to predict the breakthrough at larger scales 2 2 2 markovian velocity process models the markovian velocity process mvp model is a temporal markov model for independent characterizations of the longitudinal and transverse macrodispersions in spatially correlated multi variate gaussian l n k fields meyer and tchelepi 2010 the polar markovian velocity process pmvp model is a mixed markov model and involves markov processes for the polar components of particle velocity the velocity magnitude process and a velocity angle process have been formulated to be markovian in time isochronous steps and space equidistant steps respectively meyer et al 2013 independence between the two stochastic processes is justified when defined for the polar components and this holds true even for high l n k variance values in the p mvp models stochastic differential langevin equations have been parametrized using a limited number of mcs runs an auxiliary variable y measuring the transverse displacement is critical to reproduce the hole type autocorrelation observed for the transverse velocity component or velocity angle process and consequently to predict the bounded transverse spreading observed in the absence of pore scale dispersion these models were found to be accurate which justifies the use of stochastic models as computationally efficient surrogates of mcs a data driven discrete temporal markov velocity process dtmvp model has been presented in delgoshaie et al 2018 which accurately predicts 2 d dispersion in the multi gaussian l n k fields having gaussian and exponential correlation structures 3 geostatistical model for fractured media and particle tracking set up as per our knowledge no rw model has been developed for 2 d dispersion in continua characterized by heterogeneous matrix and fractures which motivates this study in this work we focus on the inspection of and a rw model development for dispersion in conductivity fields characterized by a heterogeneous matrix with isolated fractures consequently we adopted a bi modal l n k distribution one of the modes signifies large fractures whose effects on the flow structure cannot be incorporated if the medium is represented as a continuum with a uni modal distribution the other mode in the distribution may represent the effective conductivity of a heterogeneous porous matrix with smaller unresolved fractures we chose a space stationary geostatistical model for the matrix log conductivity y which deploys a multi variate gaussian l n k distribution having unit variance given by σ y 2 1 an isotropic exponential covariance function quantifies the two point spatial correlation given as c y r σ y 2 exp r l y where r is the separation between any two points of interest and l y is the correlation length of y fields the computational domain spreads over a region of 256 l y 128 l y which is large enough to achieve asymptotic macrodispersion the domain discretization uses a uniform orthogonal grid with a resolution of 16 cells per unit l y in both directions a grid of 4096 2048 cells a similar characterization of uni modal heterogeneous fields but on a square domain of size 128 l y 128 l y was used by meyer and tchelepi 2010 and meyer et al 2013 very thin isolated regions of high conductivity signifying fractures are uniformly distributed in the matrix a fracture is represented as a pixel line 320 cells long and a single cell wide these cells have a fixed l n k y f r 4 σ y overall the fractures cover 5 of the total area in the chosen medium characterization there is no percolation through fractures since the flow is bound to enter the matrix after exiting a series of a few connected fracture s using a fracture network representation is not warranted additionally an rev representation is not possible with the aforementioned size of the fractures relative to that of the computational domain the one point pdf of the described space stationary l n k field is given by p l n k κ 1 f 1 2 π σ y 2 exp κ 2 2 σ y 2 f δ κ y f r where f denotes the fractional area covered by the fractures and κ is the sample space variable for l n k the l n k fields were chosen to be periodic across all boundaries the following stochastic model development was mainly based on two cases which differ in fracture orientation relative to an applied mean pressure gradient p fig 1 a for both cases p is parallel to the longer domain boundary x 1 direction these two base cases are defined as 1 case transfrac transversely oriented fractures θ f r 9 0 i e the fractures are oriented normal to p and 2 case longfrac longitudinally oriented fractures θ f r 0 i e the fractures are oriented parallel to p 3 1 monte carlo simulation method with direct numerical simulations we performed mcs to obtain a statistical structure of the effective particle motion in the described class of fields similar to meyer 2018b a fixed mean pressure gradient p was applied in the domain periodic boundary conditions were used for the conductivity field and also for the local pressure gradient the local gradient includes contributions from the mean gradient p and the fluctuating pressure due to the medium heterogeneity periodic boundary conditions avoid the spatial inhomogeneities in the flow field statistics resulting from flux head or wall boundary conditions for mcs 1600 field realizations were generated for both base cases the velocity fields were solved using a finite volume approach and an algebraic multigrid pressure solver de dreuzy et al 2007 meyer and tchelepi 2010 fluid particle tracking provides the lagrangian velocity statistics and additionally simulates the advective component of the dispersion we used a conservative scheme which uses linear interpolation of the velocity components to the particle location delay et al 2005 meyer and jenny 2004 we have not considered solute mixing between fluid particles since we are interested in purely advective transport section 1 in each realization pathline starting points were located at a downstream distance of 4 l y from the left boundary and their lateral positions were uniformly distributed along a segment of length 120 l y oriented along the x 2 direction fig 1 a for case longfrac 80 pathlines were tracked in the eulerian velocity field of every l n k field realization for the other case with fractures being parallel to the line of particle release large initial separations are desirable as they lessen the likelihood of adjacent particles being seeded in the same fracture or their pathlines being correlated hence only 12 pathlines were tracked per realization for case transfrac the earliest particle breakthrough time recorded at x 1 252 is t b 175 4 and for case longfrac it is t b 67 8 note that denotes non dimensional quantities i e x x l y t t u l y u u u where u is the mean flow velocity 3 2 effective pathline advective transport can be approximated by effective particle pathlines trajectories consisting of discrete linear segments and average particle velocities defined over these segments eqs 4 and 5 our rw model simulates the effective pathlines with each random step being a statistical model of an effective segment we will use the term effective segment in reference to a linear segment of an effective pathline in mcs and effective step while referring to a modeled random walk step defining an effective step is very critical and the transition pdf p s δ t s δ t is dependent on this definition often the choice of the effective step is based on the velocity correlation structure puyguiraud et al 2019 the effective step is statistically equivalent to the effective segment in mcs whose definition is purely based on geometry an effective segment is defined as a linear segment between two successive locations where the particle trajectory passes from a fracture into the matrix fig 1 b as can be seen in the schematic this definition is suited for the flow fields with advective mass exchange between the matrix and the fractures tracked with particle pathlines an effective segment is characterized by its length l average velocity magnitude u and direction angle θ with respect to the direction of p in an effective step θ and l define the particle s spatial increment while l and u define its temporal increment effective segments steps should not be interpreted as upscaled transport over small scales but as model pathline segments ideally with an increasing number of particles the primary variable of interest c x t can be correctly resolved up to the resolution of the velocity field in the proposed correlated rw model for average transport section 5 the central entity is a transition pdf of the effective step and the average velocity p φ φ where φ θ l n l l n u t the prime denotes the values at the immediately preceding step using a logarithmic scaling helps to adequately resolve the smaller length scales in the presence of larger scales fig 5 similarly the log normal conductivity distribution motivates the use of a logarithmic scale for velocity the notation p denotes a conditional pdf however the term transition pdf will be used for those conditional pdfs which signify a transition from one effective step or segment to a subsequent one in an effort to arrive at a minimalistic rw model we analyze the statistical structure of effective particle pathlines and identify the relevant conditioning states in the transition pdf 4 stochastic analyses of particle pathlines in comparison to the solute particle motion in low p e flows the motion in high p e flows tends to remain correlated for relatively longer lengths in space time in low p e flows the particles can jump across pathlines due to pore scale dispersion the components of φ deduced from the effective segments in mcs were checked for dependencies with their respective preceding segment counterparts as well as the cross dependencies with other components the ensemble of φ is defined by an equal number of segments from each of the particle pathlines this number is the minimum of the segment counts amongst all pathlines which is 146 for case transfrac and 12 for case longfrac this ensures an unbiased representation of all pathlines in the stochastic analyses additionally ergodicity of pathline statistics is assumed 4 1 stochastic analysis orientation angle of effective segment figs 2 a and 2 b show the correlation coefficients between θ and the components of φ associated with the same effective segment denoted by lag m 0 and those associated with preceding segments denoted by lags m 1 2 and 3 additionally correlation coefficients with y the transverse coordinate used in the p mvp models and introduced in section 2 2 2 for multiple lags are shown the red diagonally hatched bars denote the auto correlation coefficients of the θ evolution process for each lag value the black horizontally hatched and blue cross hatched bars represent the cross correlation coefficients between the θ and the l n l and l n u processes respectively for case transfrac θ values are statistically correlated with the preceding ones which is not true for case longfrac in the latter the fractures are oriented along p which leads to significantly longer travel distances within single fractures than what is seen in case transfrac the larger segment lengths also translate into larger averaging lengths over which θ and l n u values are defined as a result θ values get decorrelated from their preceding states in both base cases correlation between θ and the particle s transverse coordinate y is significant green vertically hatched bars therefore incorporating this dependence into the stochastic model is critical to predict the transverse dispersion accurately meyer and tchelepi 2010 meyer et al 2013 however the zero correlation coefficient between θ and l n l l n u at different lags is inconclusive due to the symmetry in the θ distribution figs 2 c and 2 d show the contour maps of p θ l n l the pdf of θ conditional on l n l associated with the same effective segment i e for m 0 such conditional pdfs were estimated using a kernel density estimation framework developed to test the markovian nature of stochastic processes meyer and saggini 2016 convergence of these pdf estimates is discussed in the supporting information as shown in the figures pdf p θ l n l is not invariant with l n l indicating dependence between θ and l n l however this variation is mild in case longfrac figs 2 e and 2 f suggest that the dependence between θ and l n u is considerable only for case longfrac 4 2 stochastic analysis length of effective segment figs 3 a and 3 b show the correlation coefficients between l n l and the components of φ associated with the same effective segment and a few preceding segments the l n l evolution process is a very weakly correlated one since the segment lengths are determined by the geometrical set up of the fractures which in this study includes a uniformly distributed placement of the fractures in the matrix once again the correlation between l n l and θ is zero due to the symmetry of the θ distribution the negative correlation coefficient between l n l and l n u especially observable for case transfrac is a consequence of a disproportionate increase in travel distance within the matrix compared with that in a fracture when the effective segment length attains a larger value with a higher proportion of travel distance within the matrix the average velocity magnitude tends to be lower the dependence between l n l and θ is conclusive from figs 3 c and 3 d supporting the analyses of figs 2 c and 2 d for m 0 the negative correlation coefficient between l n l and l n u signifies dependence between the two especially for case transfrac for case transfrac p l n l l n u varies with l n u fig 3 e for case longfrac p l n l l n u is essentially invariant with l n u fig 3 f 4 3 stochastic analysis average velocity over effective segment figs 4 a and 4 b show that the l n u evolution process is a strongly correlated one and this is especially true for case transfrac in this case the particle travel distance in a single fracture is generally smaller than the correlation length in the matrix upon particle s re entry into the matrix after travel in a fractured region its instantaneous velocity tends to be strongly correlated with the one just prior to its entry into the fractured region the correlations of the instantaneous velocities are translated into the correlations of the segment averaged velocities since with σ y 2 1 there is a reasonable amount of persistence of the velocity values in the matrix due to the flow continuity for case transfrac p l n u θ is invariant with θ fig 4 c however the same cannot be said for case longfrac fig 4 d also supporting the analysis of fig 2 f for generality the dependence between l n u and θ shall be incorporated into the stochastic model fig 4 e shows that for case transfrac the pdf p l n u l n l is not invariant with l n l however the variation of p l n u l n l with l n l is insignificant for case longfrac fig 4 f 5 stochastic model for dispersion in fractured media 5 1 discrete representation of transition pdfs the strong dependence of some components of φ on the respective preceding states and the cross dependencies necessitate the use of a transition pdf of the form p φ φ here φ includes the relevant conditioning states of φ and additionally those of y so as to honor the non zero correlation of θ with y figs 2 a and 2 b ideally φ shall include all the preceding states in the joint space of all the components of φ and y however because of numerical constraints only the most relevant dependencies of θ l n l and l n u with their respective preceding states and with each other are considered in the proposed model section 5 1 1 given the stationary l n k distribution the transition pdf p φ φ is assumed to be stationary transition matrices offer a convenient means of conditional pdf estimation and conditional sampling in the form of inverse transform sampling kang et al 2015a delgoshaie et al 2018 a transition matrix for the transition probability is defined in terms of p φ φ the joint pdf at φ φ given by 6 t i j ω j ω i p φ φ d ω d ω j ω j ω i p φ φ d ω d ω where i z 1 i n b n d c and j z 1 j n b n d n with n b being the number of discretization bins for each dimension in the φ and φ spaces n d c denoting the number of dimensions in the φ space relevant dimensions in defining the conditioning state and n d n denoting the number of relevant dimensions in the φ space ω i and ω j are the elementary volumes hypercuboids in the φ and φ spaces respectively the associated subscripts i and j denote the linearized indices in the respective multidimensional spaces a describes an empirical cumulative density function based approach for data classification in multidimensional spaces which forms the basis for defining ω i ω j and subsequently t i j 5 1 1 structure of transition pdfs the size of the transition matrix i e n b n d c n d n and the size of the effective segment ensemble available from mcs are decisive factors for the representation of p φ φ the matrix size has a theoretical upper bound which comes from the available computational resources additionally a practical limitation for the matrix size comes from statistical errors in the pdf estimation however in order to adequately resolve the conditional pdfs represented by columns of the matrix a certain minimum value of n b is essential hence the value of n d c n d n shall be constrained though its larger values allow for more statistical dependencies to be included in p φ φ a larger data set of effective pathline segments would be required to keep the statistical errors low this would entail more mcs realizations for the estimation of p φ φ heuristically we restricted n d c n d n to 4 in our study n b 20 provided an acceptable resolution of φ and the resulting matrix size offers a good trade off between the statistical errors and computational cost of mcs being cautious about the curse of dimensionality and therefore considering only the critical dependencies deduced from the statistical analyses outlined in section 4 we propose the transition pdfs 7 p θ l n l θ y and 8 p l n u l n u θ l n l initial pathline segments do not adhere to the definition of an effective segment given in section 3 2 the starting point of a pathline lies on the start line and is not necessarily an entry point into the matrix consequently the initial effective segment of a pathline is a partial segment with a random length or travel time whose distribution is governed by the geometry of the problem set up in a stochastic simulation initial θ and l are unconditionally sampled from the joint distribution of θ 0 l n l 0 where l 0 and θ 0 are the initial segment length and angle respectively the initial u is sampled from the conditional pdf p l n u 0 θ 0 l n l 0 where u 0 is the average velocity magnitude over an initial segment p l n u 0 θ 0 l n l 0 can be interpreted as a reduced form of the transition pdf given in expression 8 5 2 particle trajectories with stochastic model in a stochastic simulation the lagrangian evolution of each particle is independently dictated by the model random sampling of the initial conditions for a particle defining its first rw step is described in section 5 1 1 for the subsequent steps the step length and direction angle spatial displacement are sampled from p θ l n l θ y while the average velocity magnitude consequently the temporal increment is sampled from p l n u l n u θ l n l a forward euler scheme is used for the integration i e 9 x n 1 x n cos θ n sin θ n l n 10 and t n 1 t n l n u n where x n and t n denote the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively after n effective steps note that for the estimation of p x x t and hence c x t the particle is not coarse grained to either end of the effective step i e x n or x n 1 rather the position at time t t n t n 1 is interpolated along the segment length with u n being constant over the effective step 6 transport statistics with stochastic model to validate the stochastic model expressions 7 and 8 we compare in a first step the transport statistics estimated with the stochastic model against those of mcs this comprises a standard practice to validate the results of an empirical random walk model with those directly obtained from the data set the model is derived from kang et al 2015a 2017 de anna et al 2013 delgoshaie et al 2018 in a next step we assess the model s predictive capabilities by simulating test cases which involve non stationary conductivity field these cases are rigorous tests for the model which is still based on the transition probabilities estimated from the stationary fields i e base cases velocity distribution and correlation of the velocity process have been identified to be amongst the most important facets of transport in heterogeneous media kang et al 2015a if a sufficient number of samples are used the stationary transition pdfs result in ergodic processes whose ensemble distributions can be defined by the frequencies associated with a single particle as well as across a number of particles for each base case an ensemble of 25 600 particles was released at t 0 at position x 0 0 in fig 5 we show that marginal pdfs of velocity components and step length generated with the stochastic model resemble the ones obtained from mcs in fig 6 the correlation coefficients of the modeled φ components are compared against those from mcs a qualitative match of the correlations which offer an insight into two point statistics for multiple lags and of the velocity distributions show that the stochastic model is able to adequately capture the velocity statistics 6 1 model validation the ensemble averaged solute concentration at a spatio temporal point is linearly related to the particle position pdf eq 3 for small times spreading of the solute plume is ballistic in nature second spatial moment of the solute plume grows with t 2 le borgne et al 2008 kang et al 2015a from eq 3 it is clear that the centered second spatial moment of the ensemble averaged solute plume scales linearly with the particle position variance the macrodispersion coefficient conventionally used in upscaled fickian dispersion models is linearly related to the rate of change of the plume s second spatial moment figs 7 a d show the time evolution of the particle position variance for the two base cases the transverse position variance reaches an asymptotic limit and this trend is well captured by the stochastic model the growth rate of the longitudinal position variance attains an asymptotic value after a few time units as a check for the convergence the evolution of position variance was also estimated with higher particle numbers and n b 30 respectively supporting information the transition pdfs were estimated from the effective pathline data sampled up to x 1 252 red curves and x 1 128 blue curves the effective pathline data sampled up to x 1 128 is referred to as partial pathline data set the transition pdfs resulting from the partial data set lead to the transport statistics with only a slight decrement in accuracy this illustrates that mcs runs with smaller domains can be used for the definition of a surrogate stochastic model which can predict the average concentration in a larger domain reduction of the pathline sampling region is constrained by a minimal size of the domain in the limiting case two effective segments for a pathline and entails larger statistical errors in the transition pdf estimates the longitudinal position variance is slightly underestimated for case transfrac fig 7 a because the model underestimates the velocity autocorrelation at lags m 2 and higher in this case with comparatively smaller travel distances in the fractures and smaller segment lengths decorrelation of velocity with subsequent states is rather slow section 4 3 the exponential fit that approximates the velocity autocorrelation coefficients in mcs renders a correlation scale of 1 46 fig 4 a the autocorrelation coefficients reproduced by the stochastic model which assumes markovianity with the proposed definition of effective segments have an exponential fit characterized by a correlation scale of 1 26 fig 6 e in the opted structure of the velocity transition pdf expression 8 there is no explicit consideration of the autocorrelation coefficients at lags m 2 and higher figs 7 e h show the modeled and reference particle plume shapes at a very early time t 2 and a very late time t b the joint pdfs were estimated using rectangular elements with bi linear models following meyer 2018a the marginal pdf plots show that the plume shapes in either direction are non gaussian especially at early times fig 8 skewness is more prominent for the longitudinal dispersion in case longfrac as fractures act as long and fast pathways for the particles only after long times when the particles have sampled a range of steps lengths and velocities the position pdfs tend towards gaussian shapes the discrepancies in the variance estimates figs 7 a d are not well resolved in the marginal pdf plots fig 8 because the latter focus on the tails and are thus presented on a logarithmic scale 6 2 estimation of transport in stratified media we illustrate that the stochastic model is predictive for transport in stratified media in this context we use a domain model consisting of multiple strata each of which is characterized by a bimodal l n k distribution the individual strata l n k fields are statistically independent of each other fig 9 shows a l n k field realization for the two different configurations of stratified domain model considered in this study which differ in the direction of stratification the one with strata interfaces being parallel to p is referred to as case longstrat while case transstrat refers to the model with the interfaces being normal to p in these models the interfaces are located at x 2 48 80 and x 1 88 168 respectively in the three strata numbered in fig 9 fractures are oriented at θ f r 0 0 90 and 9 0 respectively the l n k statistics in the three strata are the same as in the two corresponding base cases discussed before and a similar space stationary ergodic case with fractures oriented at θ f r 0 90 the last of these cases is not discussed in this article but the average transport results in it are presented in fig 10 in the following we discuss the set up of the stochastic dispersion model and the details apply to both of the stratified domain configurations i e case longstrat and case transstrat the θ l n u l n l evolution processes are governed by three sets of transition pdfs each one corresponding to an individual stratum however the pdf sets need not be specifically estimated for the particular stratified domain instead the ones estimated in the ergodic settings of each stratum e g the base cases are used to validate the transport results we perform mcs for the stratified domain and the resulting particle position statistics are used as a reference in these transport simulations the release points of notional particles were uniformly distributed over a segment normal to p with x 2 44 84 fig 9 when an effective step crosses an interface θ l n l l n u t for the next step is sampled like the one for an initial step but the sampling distributions are the pdfs associated with the next stratum the mean flow field in a stratum might be altered due to the presence of the other strata for example in case longstrat the magnitude of the mean velocity in stratum 3 is significantly lower than that in the ergodic case transfrac fig 11 to include such effects in the stochastic model the sampled effective step velocities are scaled the scaling factor in a stratum is the ratio of the magnitude of the mean velocity in it as obtained in the stratified domain mcs to the one in the ergodic field simulation i e mcs of the corresponding base case additionally the sampled θ in a stratum are corrected for the deviation of its mean flow relative to the one in the corresponding ergodic field simulation here the eulerian mean velocity in the ergodic field simulations is estimated using the tracked pathlines puyguiraud et al 2019 the plume shapes in case longstrat are clearly non gaussian as shown in figs 12 a and 12 b a comparison between the two qualitatively demonstrates that the stochastic model captures the plume spreading figs 12 c and 12 d show the marginal pdf of the longitudinal particle position and conditional pdfs of the transverse position respectively at a late time stratum 1 with θ f r 0 offers preferential pathways with least resistance and the stochastic model accounts for this information only through the transformation of the sampled velocities however the transformations consider the mean velocity which is calculated over the whole stratum and thus inflow into stratum 1 through the interface and the near interface flow field are not correctly accounted for this explains the slight underestimation of longitudinal spreading at downstream locations solute spreading in case transstrat is a cumulative effect of spreading in each stratum the overall plume shapes are well captured by the stochastic model figs 12 e and 12 f an over estimation of the estimated particle density just downstream of the interface at x 1 88 fig 12 g is because the final steps sampled as per the pdfs of stratum 1 have finite extensions reaching into stratum 2 the underestimation of longitudinal spreading in the ergodic cases with the transversely oriented fractures e g case transfrac figs 7 a and 10 a leads to similar deviations in strata 2 and 3 of case transstrat the previously discussed exercise of transport prediction in stratified domains illustrates that the model can easily be adapted to accommodate changes in the boundary or initial conditions without the necessity to rerun the mcs used for the definition of the transition pdfs knowledge of the eulerian mean flow velocity in a new configuration is sufficient 6 3 model performance and constraints simulations were performed on a state of the art multi node distributed cluster system we report average computation times per random field realization for mcs with each one being handled by a single processor core the time required for the generation of a random l n k field of case transfrac case longfrac was 9 854 1 s 9 964 4 s additionally evaluating the eulerian flow field followed by path tracking of 12 80 particles took 123 27 s 409 8 s for the stochastic simulations estimation of the transition pdfs from the complete mcs data set took 104 2 s 186 9 s the time taken for the stochastic modeling of 12 80 pathlines was 567 3 s 300 2 s in this work the numbers of fields and particle trajectories per field in mcs were very conservatively chosen this ensured low statistical errors in the estimation of transition pdfs for the given resolution though the model is quite general in nature and is applicable to a wide range of matrix heterogeneities and fracture geometries it is suited for the media with fracture densities well below the percolation threshold additionally it has to be stated that the pre processing step to empirically estimate the transition matrices is an expensive process with a focus on a specific fractured formation kang et al 2015b proposed parametric functional forms for the transition probability matrix and steady distribution of step transition times these quantities or inversely those for lagrangian velocity form the core of spatial markov models for longitudinal dispersion comparison of the simulated breakthrough curves btcs with those obtained from convergent and push pull tracer tests yielded the parameter estimates additionally sherman et al 2017 proposed a methodology to estimate the velocity transition probability matrix from discretized forms of two successive btcs though this methodology is quite promising it is not possible to define fixed size stationary unit cells in the context of this work considering the presence of large fractures and also the emphasis on transverse spreading alternatively direct simulations are applied in the present work for transition probability estimation however a domain much smaller than the formation of interest can be used in these direct simulations 7 conclusions transport processes in heterogeneous geological formations with large fractures are phenomena of significant interest considering their presence in many applications in this work we have used a lagrangian approach to describe non reactive solute transport in 2 d continua consisting of a porous matrix characterized by a multi variate gaussian log conductivity distribution and isolated fractures of uniform conductivity as part of the characterization the stochastic dependence structure of particle trajectories was studied eventually based on the recorded structure we have formulated a minimalistic random walk model for solute dispersion in fractured media the data for our statistical analyses was obtained by computing flow fields for a number of conductivity field realizations followed by tracking passive solute particles in order to arrive at a compact model formulation we simplify the particle trajectories via polygonal lines composed of effective segments each effective segment connects the points where the trajectory passes from a fracture into the matrix this effective representation merges the particle path sections in the matrix and fractures significantly simplifying the description our analyses indicated a strong auto correlation of velocity and orientation angle over successive segments which is especially true for the scenario with fractures being normal to the mean pressure gradient further the cross correlation between velocity and segment length is significant for the scenario with fractures being parallel to the mean pressure gradient cross correlation between velocity and the segment orientation angle is considerable in both of the fracture orientation scenarios the orientation angle and length are statistically dependent in addition the correlation between the orientation angle and the particle s transverse coordinate is significant and crucial for the accurate prediction of transverse dispersion based on our statistical analysis a random walk model for dispersion was devised which incorporates the dependencies of a particle s future state on the preceding state and the cross dependencies among the different state components differently from the previous works discussed in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 the velocity magnitude process is neither a spatial nor a temporal markov process rather it is assumed to be markovian in step increments using numerical simulations as a reference we validated our model for chosen configurations of fracture orientations with respect to the applied mean pressure gradient asymptotic longitudinal and transverse spreading especially its bounded nature in the 2 d flow scenarios with infinite péclet number are captured adequately well by the model additionally we successfully showcased the prediction of solute dispersion in spatially non stationary stratified domains as illustrated in these cases the model allows us to incorporate changes in the average flow rate pressure gradient and boundary conditions of the domain we envision extending the current work to more complex settings e g with fluid phase reactions where the conventional numerical methods become increasingly expensive in particle tracking simulations a retardation factor is often used for particle velocities so as to simulate equilibrium adsorption characterized by a linear isotherm liu et al 2000 in the context of our work this will result in slower effective velocities thus the effects of the adsorption or other unresolved phenomena can be incorporated in the stochastic model as of now a particle s future state depends only on the immediately preceding state incorporating further dependencies is possible by using an alternative to the transition matrix for the transition pdf

185,solute transport observed in subsurface formations shows complex behavior particularly in the presence of fractures in this work we focus on formations with fractures that are smaller compared to the domain of interest and which are distributed in a heterogeneous matrix at densities below the percolation threshold we developed a simplified lagrangian approach to characterize and predict advective transport in 2 d domains containing differently oriented fractures to this end we performed monte carlo simulation mcs studies using ensembles of random domain realizations and gathered analyzed tracer particle displacement statistics the series of displacement steps were defined by the locations of particles entering the matrix after traversing through one or several connected fractures then we identify key correlation structures in the evolution of and between displacement step coordinates namely the step length its orientation and the traverse time subsequently a correlated random walk model was derived which is able to accurately reproduce longitudinal and transverse macrodispersion as recorded in the mcs finally we explored the predictive capabilities of our stochastic model by simulating macrodispersion in stratified media composed of heterogeneous zones with different fracture orientations keywords macrodispersion random walk fractured porous media heterogeneity bimodal log conductivity distribution non fickian transport 1 introduction increasingly more realistic accurate and faster numerical models of transport processes in fractured porous media are desired because of their imperative role in numerous applications including the estimation of contaminant transport estimation of nuclear waste storage potential optimization of un conventional energy extraction processes etc ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 dispersion of solutes observed at the formation scale is caused by i mechanical dispersion at pore bifurcations ii molecular diffusion and iii spatial variations in the flow velocity due to domain hydraulic conductivity field heterogeneities gelhar 1986 greenkorn and kessler 1969 the contribution of iii i e macrodispersion relative to the combined contribution of i and ii i e pore scale dispersion is given by the péclet number the péclet number is defined as p e u l d where u is the mean flow velocity l is the characteristic length of the heterogeneous field and d is the dispersion coefficient characterizing the microscopic effects i and ii to isolate the effects of pure advection on large scale dispersion numerical studies are often conducted at infinite p e zarlenga and fiori 2015 meyer et al 2013 salandin and fiorotto 1998 such a scenario is not very far from reality because in natural domains the conductivity integral scale can be much larger than the pore scale dispersivity dagan 1989 in 2 d flows at infinite p e the solute plume s centered second moment in the transverse direction converges to a finite value attinger et al 2004 dagan 1988 the bounded nature of the solute particles motion as an ensemble is caused by the absence of mixing across streamlines interestingly this phenomena is observed only in 2 d in a 3 d domain the extra dimension allows the streamlines to cross each other without intersecting which results in an unbounded transverse spreading attinger et al 2004 jankovic et al 2009 solute plume spreading in heterogeneous formations shows non fickian behavior characterized by a non linear temporal growth of the plume s centered second moment this behavior is attributed to heterogeneities present across a large range of scales berkowitz and scher 1995 the multi scale heterogeneity structure leads to upscaled transport properties like the dispersion coefficient or dispersivity that are scale dependent berkowitz et al 2006 zech et al 2015 have suggested that the scaling laws are formation specific at the scales sufficiently larger than the velocity integral scale the asymptotic values are however attained fiori et al 2017 while the advection dispersion equation in its classical form with scale invariant dispersion coefficients is an accurate model in that large scale asymptotic limit we focus in this work on the pre asymptotic range due to the high level of uncertainty in subsurface domain characterization transport predictions are comprehensible only in a probabilistic sense bear 1972 de josselin de jong 1958 often the ensemble averaged concentration is chosen as the dependent state variable even if the advection dispersion equation is applicable for each realization in the ensemble the average transport is often found to be non fickian neuman and tartakovsky 2009 non local methods e g the lagrangian ones based on the versatile continuous time random walk ctrw framework berkowitz and scher 1997 provide a tenable description of the average non fickian transport they encapsulate the effect of medium heterogeneity into a random walk model for particle trajectories recently hyman et al 2019 have developed a time domain random walk model to estimate first passage time distributions in 3 d fracture networks the model is parametrized by the eulerian velocity distribution and characteristics of the network geometry i e average fracture length and tortuosity within the ctrw framework the correlated ctrw and spatial markov models successfully predict the longitudinal dispersion in continua le borgne et al 2008 and 2 d dispersion in fracture networks kang et al 2015a spatial markov models have also been developed for transport in 3 d fracture networks with a focus on capturing heavy tails of breakthrough curves the core of these models include a stochastic velocity process e g a parametric bernoulli process an empirically determined transition probability matrix kang et al 2020 and an ornstein uhlenbeck process for the normal scores of particle velocity hyman and dentz 2021 the polar markovian velocity process pmvp model was formulated to estimate 2 d dispersion in continua meyer et al 2013 recently a temporal variant of the pmvp model has been analytically derived meyer 2017 it is based on the eulerian first order perturbation theory and hence is suited for low heterogeneity media this model has subsequently been generalized for highly heterogeneous media meyer 2018b in continua models for the domains having large fractures defining representative elementary volumes revs at sufficiently small scales may not be possible schwartz and smith 1988 unless the effective representations of the matrix and fractures have segregation in their scales desbarats 1990 has modeled a sand shale system as a continuum with a bi modal distribution of the conductivity such a characterization can also be associated with a system of matrix and fractures rubin 1995 schwartz 1977 dagan and fiori 2003 fiori and dagan 2003 have formalized the time dependent behavior of longitudinal and transverse macrodispersivities in binary formations with a homogeneous matrix and isolated spherical circular inclusions different volume densities of inclusions and conductivity contrasts were considered in these studies though many recent efforts have focused on 3 d fractured media especially fracture networks we have considered transport in 2 d continua at infinite péclet number representing an extreme scenario characterized by strong correlations in particle motion and asymptotically bounded transverse dispersion the previously mentioned efforts to model 2 d dispersion in continua i e the pmvp model and its derivatives typify the conductivity heterogeneity with uni modal distributions without fractures in this contribution we analyze advection driven transport in a specific class of formations that is heterogeneous continua containing short fractures the fractures are distributed at densities below the percolation threshold which ensures that flow passes through both the matrix as well as the fractures in the domain model a multi variate bi modal distribution is adopted for the log conductivity as a first step we investigate transport statistics using a lagrangian approach guided by this statistical analyses we identify key characteristics of a minimalistic yet accurate random walk model for solute dispersion we further illustrate the capabilities of our dispersion model for fractured heterogeneous formations by extending it for predictions in non space stationary stratified media the paper starts in section 2 with summarizing a few approaches that form the basis of several stochastic methods for dispersion then in section 3 we describe the chosen domain characterization and two different set ups for monte carlo simulation of flow and transport which differ in the fracture orientation with respect to mean pressure gradient also we introduce a suitable effective particle pathline for the discussed domain types in section 4 detailed stochastic analyses of the effective pathlines are presented and based on the observations a definitive structure for the dispersion model was derived which is explained in section 5 the model validation and its predictive capabilities for the stratified media are discussed in section 6 2 computational stochastic methods the one point one time eulerian probability density function pdf is a first information to characterize uncertainties associated with a random field for example an eulerian velocity field u x t or a solute concentration field c x t are modeled as random fields due to uncertainty in conductivity field k x here x and t are spatial and temporal coordinates respectively the eulerian pdf of the concentration p c c x t where c is the sample space variable facilitates the extraction of eulerian statistical moments using the lagrangian descriptions of flow and transport offers a convenient approach to estimating the eulerian pdfs this is well explained by pope 1985 2011 in the context of pdf methods for reactive turbulent flows in such an approach fluid particles propagate in the physical and property velocity concentration etc spaces according to lagrangian equations e g in physical space as 1 d d t x t x 0 u x t x 0 t where x t x 0 is the position of a particle at time t 0 after starting at x 0 at time t 0 we conform to the definition of a fluid particle mentioned in pope 2011 to illustrate the applicability of pdf methods to model dispersion jenny et al 2006 meyer et al 2010 we continue with the previously mentioned example of a solute concentration field in the absence of pore scale dispersion and chemical reactions we can write 2 d d t c t x 0 0 where c t x 0 is the concentration of a fluid particle in the lagrangian reference frame if eq 2 is applicable the motion of passive solute tracer particles can be expressed by the motion of the associated fluid particles and the fluid particles are sufficient to evaluate p c c x t starting from a point source of volume v 0 with a concentration c 0 located at x 0 a fluid particle propagates and the associated solute concentration is conserved as we track its motion eq 1 further references of the term fluid particle shall be associated with the ones starting at the source meyer and tchelepi 2010 have shown a relation between p c c x t and the fluid particle position pdf p x x t which is p c c x t δ c c 0 v 0 p x x t δ c 1 v 0 p x x t consequently the ensemble averaged concentration is linearly related with the particle position pdf equation 9 25 in rubin 2003 given by 3 c x t c 0 v 0 p x x t in numerical simulations the motion of an ensemble of notional fluid particles according to the stochastic model provides p x x t given by 4 p x x t δ x x t x 0 in a time discretized representation eq 1 can be written as 5 x t δ t x 0 x t x 0 u x t x 0 t δ t the core of all stochastic models includes defining a temporal step δ t and the corresponding spatial step δ x t x 0 u x t x 0 t δ t in summary the one point one time solute concentration pdf p c c x t and moments such as c x t can be described by the random walk of an ensemble of notional particles in the following text wherever feasible the subscript in the pdf notation is dropped for better readability the random variable s associated with the pdf can be judged from the argument s in the pdf notation 2 1 monte carlo simulation methods in monte carlo simulation mcs methods for transport processes a number of k x realizations are generated based on a chosen geostatistical model freeze 1975 ostad ali askari et al 2018 and the eulerian velocity field is computed for each one of them de dreuzy et al 2007 salandin and fiorotto 1998 lagrangian particle tracking in the resulting velocity fields gives an ensemble of particle pathlines which simulates the solute transport eqs 4 and 5 along with eq 3 describe the ensemble averaged concentration generally the computational expenses of solving the flow field for each realization and the large number of realizations necessary to get good statistics limit the use of mcs methods random walk rw models for eq 5 are less constrained by such high computational demands a summary of two major categories of rw models is presented next 2 2 random walk models for dispersion 2 2 1 continuous time random walk in continuous time random walk ctrw theory particle motion has been conceptualized as a series of spatio temporal displacements between the locations of significant velocity transitions e g pore fracture intersections or fracture matrix interfaces berkowitz et al 2006 the classical ctrw model is fully characterized by a stationary joint pdf p s δ t where s denotes the particle s spatial displacement and δ t is the corresponding temporal step in the work of berkowitz and scher 1997 a ctrw model was formalized for random fracture networks using flow velocity and segment length distributions the resulting estimates of the longitudinal non fickian dispersion were presented the choice of s δ t and therefore its statistical structure is not universal and should be inspected for the specific formation and flow field under consideration berkowitz et al 2006 for continuous media having a multi gaussian l n k distribution le borgne et al 2007 have quantified spatio temporal correlations in the lagrangian velocity kang et al 2011 2015a have shown that an uncorrelated ctrw model when applied to regular 2 d fracture networks and characterized using the equidistantly sampled lagrangian velocity distribution alone is limited in its prediction of the plume spreadings and breakthrough curves even though the networks used in these studies have spatially uncorrelated conductivity the divergence free condition of velocity induces correlations in the velocities the proposition of correlated ctrw models is to account for the correlation structure of s δ t in the random walk for the velocity fields with finite correlation lengths times for all initial velocities the evolution of the lagrangian velocity can be characterized as a markov process in space time the stationary pdf p s δ t and a transition pdf of the form p s δ t s δ t where s δ t denotes the immediately preceding spatio temporal step form the basis of markov models for stationary processes spatial markov models have successfully predicted the longitudinal dispersion in continua at darcy scale le borgne et al 2008 and at pore scale de anna et al 2013 kang et al 2015a and kang et al 2017 have developed spatial markov models for 2 d dispersion in regular and 1 d dispersion in disordered fracture networks respectively frampton and cvetkovic 2007 have characterized lagrangian statistics and the travel time pdf f τ in random fracture networks in their work f τ obtained at a relatively small scale is upscaled to predict the breakthrough at larger scales 2 2 2 markovian velocity process models the markovian velocity process mvp model is a temporal markov model for independent characterizations of the longitudinal and transverse macrodispersions in spatially correlated multi variate gaussian l n k fields meyer and tchelepi 2010 the polar markovian velocity process pmvp model is a mixed markov model and involves markov processes for the polar components of particle velocity the velocity magnitude process and a velocity angle process have been formulated to be markovian in time isochronous steps and space equidistant steps respectively meyer et al 2013 independence between the two stochastic processes is justified when defined for the polar components and this holds true even for high l n k variance values in the p mvp models stochastic differential langevin equations have been parametrized using a limited number of mcs runs an auxiliary variable y measuring the transverse displacement is critical to reproduce the hole type autocorrelation observed for the transverse velocity component or velocity angle process and consequently to predict the bounded transverse spreading observed in the absence of pore scale dispersion these models were found to be accurate which justifies the use of stochastic models as computationally efficient surrogates of mcs a data driven discrete temporal markov velocity process dtmvp model has been presented in delgoshaie et al 2018 which accurately predicts 2 d dispersion in the multi gaussian l n k fields having gaussian and exponential correlation structures 3 geostatistical model for fractured media and particle tracking set up as per our knowledge no rw model has been developed for 2 d dispersion in continua characterized by heterogeneous matrix and fractures which motivates this study in this work we focus on the inspection of and a rw model development for dispersion in conductivity fields characterized by a heterogeneous matrix with isolated fractures consequently we adopted a bi modal l n k distribution one of the modes signifies large fractures whose effects on the flow structure cannot be incorporated if the medium is represented as a continuum with a uni modal distribution the other mode in the distribution may represent the effective conductivity of a heterogeneous porous matrix with smaller unresolved fractures we chose a space stationary geostatistical model for the matrix log conductivity y which deploys a multi variate gaussian l n k distribution having unit variance given by σ y 2 1 an isotropic exponential covariance function quantifies the two point spatial correlation given as c y r σ y 2 exp r l y where r is the separation between any two points of interest and l y is the correlation length of y fields the computational domain spreads over a region of 256 l y 128 l y which is large enough to achieve asymptotic macrodispersion the domain discretization uses a uniform orthogonal grid with a resolution of 16 cells per unit l y in both directions a grid of 4096 2048 cells a similar characterization of uni modal heterogeneous fields but on a square domain of size 128 l y 128 l y was used by meyer and tchelepi 2010 and meyer et al 2013 very thin isolated regions of high conductivity signifying fractures are uniformly distributed in the matrix a fracture is represented as a pixel line 320 cells long and a single cell wide these cells have a fixed l n k y f r 4 σ y overall the fractures cover 5 of the total area in the chosen medium characterization there is no percolation through fractures since the flow is bound to enter the matrix after exiting a series of a few connected fracture s using a fracture network representation is not warranted additionally an rev representation is not possible with the aforementioned size of the fractures relative to that of the computational domain the one point pdf of the described space stationary l n k field is given by p l n k κ 1 f 1 2 π σ y 2 exp κ 2 2 σ y 2 f δ κ y f r where f denotes the fractional area covered by the fractures and κ is the sample space variable for l n k the l n k fields were chosen to be periodic across all boundaries the following stochastic model development was mainly based on two cases which differ in fracture orientation relative to an applied mean pressure gradient p fig 1 a for both cases p is parallel to the longer domain boundary x 1 direction these two base cases are defined as 1 case transfrac transversely oriented fractures θ f r 9 0 i e the fractures are oriented normal to p and 2 case longfrac longitudinally oriented fractures θ f r 0 i e the fractures are oriented parallel to p 3 1 monte carlo simulation method with direct numerical simulations we performed mcs to obtain a statistical structure of the effective particle motion in the described class of fields similar to meyer 2018b a fixed mean pressure gradient p was applied in the domain periodic boundary conditions were used for the conductivity field and also for the local pressure gradient the local gradient includes contributions from the mean gradient p and the fluctuating pressure due to the medium heterogeneity periodic boundary conditions avoid the spatial inhomogeneities in the flow field statistics resulting from flux head or wall boundary conditions for mcs 1600 field realizations were generated for both base cases the velocity fields were solved using a finite volume approach and an algebraic multigrid pressure solver de dreuzy et al 2007 meyer and tchelepi 2010 fluid particle tracking provides the lagrangian velocity statistics and additionally simulates the advective component of the dispersion we used a conservative scheme which uses linear interpolation of the velocity components to the particle location delay et al 2005 meyer and jenny 2004 we have not considered solute mixing between fluid particles since we are interested in purely advective transport section 1 in each realization pathline starting points were located at a downstream distance of 4 l y from the left boundary and their lateral positions were uniformly distributed along a segment of length 120 l y oriented along the x 2 direction fig 1 a for case longfrac 80 pathlines were tracked in the eulerian velocity field of every l n k field realization for the other case with fractures being parallel to the line of particle release large initial separations are desirable as they lessen the likelihood of adjacent particles being seeded in the same fracture or their pathlines being correlated hence only 12 pathlines were tracked per realization for case transfrac the earliest particle breakthrough time recorded at x 1 252 is t b 175 4 and for case longfrac it is t b 67 8 note that denotes non dimensional quantities i e x x l y t t u l y u u u where u is the mean flow velocity 3 2 effective pathline advective transport can be approximated by effective particle pathlines trajectories consisting of discrete linear segments and average particle velocities defined over these segments eqs 4 and 5 our rw model simulates the effective pathlines with each random step being a statistical model of an effective segment we will use the term effective segment in reference to a linear segment of an effective pathline in mcs and effective step while referring to a modeled random walk step defining an effective step is very critical and the transition pdf p s δ t s δ t is dependent on this definition often the choice of the effective step is based on the velocity correlation structure puyguiraud et al 2019 the effective step is statistically equivalent to the effective segment in mcs whose definition is purely based on geometry an effective segment is defined as a linear segment between two successive locations where the particle trajectory passes from a fracture into the matrix fig 1 b as can be seen in the schematic this definition is suited for the flow fields with advective mass exchange between the matrix and the fractures tracked with particle pathlines an effective segment is characterized by its length l average velocity magnitude u and direction angle θ with respect to the direction of p in an effective step θ and l define the particle s spatial increment while l and u define its temporal increment effective segments steps should not be interpreted as upscaled transport over small scales but as model pathline segments ideally with an increasing number of particles the primary variable of interest c x t can be correctly resolved up to the resolution of the velocity field in the proposed correlated rw model for average transport section 5 the central entity is a transition pdf of the effective step and the average velocity p φ φ where φ θ l n l l n u t the prime denotes the values at the immediately preceding step using a logarithmic scaling helps to adequately resolve the smaller length scales in the presence of larger scales fig 5 similarly the log normal conductivity distribution motivates the use of a logarithmic scale for velocity the notation p denotes a conditional pdf however the term transition pdf will be used for those conditional pdfs which signify a transition from one effective step or segment to a subsequent one in an effort to arrive at a minimalistic rw model we analyze the statistical structure of effective particle pathlines and identify the relevant conditioning states in the transition pdf 4 stochastic analyses of particle pathlines in comparison to the solute particle motion in low p e flows the motion in high p e flows tends to remain correlated for relatively longer lengths in space time in low p e flows the particles can jump across pathlines due to pore scale dispersion the components of φ deduced from the effective segments in mcs were checked for dependencies with their respective preceding segment counterparts as well as the cross dependencies with other components the ensemble of φ is defined by an equal number of segments from each of the particle pathlines this number is the minimum of the segment counts amongst all pathlines which is 146 for case transfrac and 12 for case longfrac this ensures an unbiased representation of all pathlines in the stochastic analyses additionally ergodicity of pathline statistics is assumed 4 1 stochastic analysis orientation angle of effective segment figs 2 a and 2 b show the correlation coefficients between θ and the components of φ associated with the same effective segment denoted by lag m 0 and those associated with preceding segments denoted by lags m 1 2 and 3 additionally correlation coefficients with y the transverse coordinate used in the p mvp models and introduced in section 2 2 2 for multiple lags are shown the red diagonally hatched bars denote the auto correlation coefficients of the θ evolution process for each lag value the black horizontally hatched and blue cross hatched bars represent the cross correlation coefficients between the θ and the l n l and l n u processes respectively for case transfrac θ values are statistically correlated with the preceding ones which is not true for case longfrac in the latter the fractures are oriented along p which leads to significantly longer travel distances within single fractures than what is seen in case transfrac the larger segment lengths also translate into larger averaging lengths over which θ and l n u values are defined as a result θ values get decorrelated from their preceding states in both base cases correlation between θ and the particle s transverse coordinate y is significant green vertically hatched bars therefore incorporating this dependence into the stochastic model is critical to predict the transverse dispersion accurately meyer and tchelepi 2010 meyer et al 2013 however the zero correlation coefficient between θ and l n l l n u at different lags is inconclusive due to the symmetry in the θ distribution figs 2 c and 2 d show the contour maps of p θ l n l the pdf of θ conditional on l n l associated with the same effective segment i e for m 0 such conditional pdfs were estimated using a kernel density estimation framework developed to test the markovian nature of stochastic processes meyer and saggini 2016 convergence of these pdf estimates is discussed in the supporting information as shown in the figures pdf p θ l n l is not invariant with l n l indicating dependence between θ and l n l however this variation is mild in case longfrac figs 2 e and 2 f suggest that the dependence between θ and l n u is considerable only for case longfrac 4 2 stochastic analysis length of effective segment figs 3 a and 3 b show the correlation coefficients between l n l and the components of φ associated with the same effective segment and a few preceding segments the l n l evolution process is a very weakly correlated one since the segment lengths are determined by the geometrical set up of the fractures which in this study includes a uniformly distributed placement of the fractures in the matrix once again the correlation between l n l and θ is zero due to the symmetry of the θ distribution the negative correlation coefficient between l n l and l n u especially observable for case transfrac is a consequence of a disproportionate increase in travel distance within the matrix compared with that in a fracture when the effective segment length attains a larger value with a higher proportion of travel distance within the matrix the average velocity magnitude tends to be lower the dependence between l n l and θ is conclusive from figs 3 c and 3 d supporting the analyses of figs 2 c and 2 d for m 0 the negative correlation coefficient between l n l and l n u signifies dependence between the two especially for case transfrac for case transfrac p l n l l n u varies with l n u fig 3 e for case longfrac p l n l l n u is essentially invariant with l n u fig 3 f 4 3 stochastic analysis average velocity over effective segment figs 4 a and 4 b show that the l n u evolution process is a strongly correlated one and this is especially true for case transfrac in this case the particle travel distance in a single fracture is generally smaller than the correlation length in the matrix upon particle s re entry into the matrix after travel in a fractured region its instantaneous velocity tends to be strongly correlated with the one just prior to its entry into the fractured region the correlations of the instantaneous velocities are translated into the correlations of the segment averaged velocities since with σ y 2 1 there is a reasonable amount of persistence of the velocity values in the matrix due to the flow continuity for case transfrac p l n u θ is invariant with θ fig 4 c however the same cannot be said for case longfrac fig 4 d also supporting the analysis of fig 2 f for generality the dependence between l n u and θ shall be incorporated into the stochastic model fig 4 e shows that for case transfrac the pdf p l n u l n l is not invariant with l n l however the variation of p l n u l n l with l n l is insignificant for case longfrac fig 4 f 5 stochastic model for dispersion in fractured media 5 1 discrete representation of transition pdfs the strong dependence of some components of φ on the respective preceding states and the cross dependencies necessitate the use of a transition pdf of the form p φ φ here φ includes the relevant conditioning states of φ and additionally those of y so as to honor the non zero correlation of θ with y figs 2 a and 2 b ideally φ shall include all the preceding states in the joint space of all the components of φ and y however because of numerical constraints only the most relevant dependencies of θ l n l and l n u with their respective preceding states and with each other are considered in the proposed model section 5 1 1 given the stationary l n k distribution the transition pdf p φ φ is assumed to be stationary transition matrices offer a convenient means of conditional pdf estimation and conditional sampling in the form of inverse transform sampling kang et al 2015a delgoshaie et al 2018 a transition matrix for the transition probability is defined in terms of p φ φ the joint pdf at φ φ given by 6 t i j ω j ω i p φ φ d ω d ω j ω j ω i p φ φ d ω d ω where i z 1 i n b n d c and j z 1 j n b n d n with n b being the number of discretization bins for each dimension in the φ and φ spaces n d c denoting the number of dimensions in the φ space relevant dimensions in defining the conditioning state and n d n denoting the number of relevant dimensions in the φ space ω i and ω j are the elementary volumes hypercuboids in the φ and φ spaces respectively the associated subscripts i and j denote the linearized indices in the respective multidimensional spaces a describes an empirical cumulative density function based approach for data classification in multidimensional spaces which forms the basis for defining ω i ω j and subsequently t i j 5 1 1 structure of transition pdfs the size of the transition matrix i e n b n d c n d n and the size of the effective segment ensemble available from mcs are decisive factors for the representation of p φ φ the matrix size has a theoretical upper bound which comes from the available computational resources additionally a practical limitation for the matrix size comes from statistical errors in the pdf estimation however in order to adequately resolve the conditional pdfs represented by columns of the matrix a certain minimum value of n b is essential hence the value of n d c n d n shall be constrained though its larger values allow for more statistical dependencies to be included in p φ φ a larger data set of effective pathline segments would be required to keep the statistical errors low this would entail more mcs realizations for the estimation of p φ φ heuristically we restricted n d c n d n to 4 in our study n b 20 provided an acceptable resolution of φ and the resulting matrix size offers a good trade off between the statistical errors and computational cost of mcs being cautious about the curse of dimensionality and therefore considering only the critical dependencies deduced from the statistical analyses outlined in section 4 we propose the transition pdfs 7 p θ l n l θ y and 8 p l n u l n u θ l n l initial pathline segments do not adhere to the definition of an effective segment given in section 3 2 the starting point of a pathline lies on the start line and is not necessarily an entry point into the matrix consequently the initial effective segment of a pathline is a partial segment with a random length or travel time whose distribution is governed by the geometry of the problem set up in a stochastic simulation initial θ and l are unconditionally sampled from the joint distribution of θ 0 l n l 0 where l 0 and θ 0 are the initial segment length and angle respectively the initial u is sampled from the conditional pdf p l n u 0 θ 0 l n l 0 where u 0 is the average velocity magnitude over an initial segment p l n u 0 θ 0 l n l 0 can be interpreted as a reduced form of the transition pdf given in expression 8 5 2 particle trajectories with stochastic model in a stochastic simulation the lagrangian evolution of each particle is independently dictated by the model random sampling of the initial conditions for a particle defining its first rw step is described in section 5 1 1 for the subsequent steps the step length and direction angle spatial displacement are sampled from p θ l n l θ y while the average velocity magnitude consequently the temporal increment is sampled from p l n u l n u θ l n l a forward euler scheme is used for the integration i e 9 x n 1 x n cos θ n sin θ n l n 10 and t n 1 t n l n u n where x n and t n denote the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively after n effective steps note that for the estimation of p x x t and hence c x t the particle is not coarse grained to either end of the effective step i e x n or x n 1 rather the position at time t t n t n 1 is interpolated along the segment length with u n being constant over the effective step 6 transport statistics with stochastic model to validate the stochastic model expressions 7 and 8 we compare in a first step the transport statistics estimated with the stochastic model against those of mcs this comprises a standard practice to validate the results of an empirical random walk model with those directly obtained from the data set the model is derived from kang et al 2015a 2017 de anna et al 2013 delgoshaie et al 2018 in a next step we assess the model s predictive capabilities by simulating test cases which involve non stationary conductivity field these cases are rigorous tests for the model which is still based on the transition probabilities estimated from the stationary fields i e base cases velocity distribution and correlation of the velocity process have been identified to be amongst the most important facets of transport in heterogeneous media kang et al 2015a if a sufficient number of samples are used the stationary transition pdfs result in ergodic processes whose ensemble distributions can be defined by the frequencies associated with a single particle as well as across a number of particles for each base case an ensemble of 25 600 particles was released at t 0 at position x 0 0 in fig 5 we show that marginal pdfs of velocity components and step length generated with the stochastic model resemble the ones obtained from mcs in fig 6 the correlation coefficients of the modeled φ components are compared against those from mcs a qualitative match of the correlations which offer an insight into two point statistics for multiple lags and of the velocity distributions show that the stochastic model is able to adequately capture the velocity statistics 6 1 model validation the ensemble averaged solute concentration at a spatio temporal point is linearly related to the particle position pdf eq 3 for small times spreading of the solute plume is ballistic in nature second spatial moment of the solute plume grows with t 2 le borgne et al 2008 kang et al 2015a from eq 3 it is clear that the centered second spatial moment of the ensemble averaged solute plume scales linearly with the particle position variance the macrodispersion coefficient conventionally used in upscaled fickian dispersion models is linearly related to the rate of change of the plume s second spatial moment figs 7 a d show the time evolution of the particle position variance for the two base cases the transverse position variance reaches an asymptotic limit and this trend is well captured by the stochastic model the growth rate of the longitudinal position variance attains an asymptotic value after a few time units as a check for the convergence the evolution of position variance was also estimated with higher particle numbers and n b 30 respectively supporting information the transition pdfs were estimated from the effective pathline data sampled up to x 1 252 red curves and x 1 128 blue curves the effective pathline data sampled up to x 1 128 is referred to as partial pathline data set the transition pdfs resulting from the partial data set lead to the transport statistics with only a slight decrement in accuracy this illustrates that mcs runs with smaller domains can be used for the definition of a surrogate stochastic model which can predict the average concentration in a larger domain reduction of the pathline sampling region is constrained by a minimal size of the domain in the limiting case two effective segments for a pathline and entails larger statistical errors in the transition pdf estimates the longitudinal position variance is slightly underestimated for case transfrac fig 7 a because the model underestimates the velocity autocorrelation at lags m 2 and higher in this case with comparatively smaller travel distances in the fractures and smaller segment lengths decorrelation of velocity with subsequent states is rather slow section 4 3 the exponential fit that approximates the velocity autocorrelation coefficients in mcs renders a correlation scale of 1 46 fig 4 a the autocorrelation coefficients reproduced by the stochastic model which assumes markovianity with the proposed definition of effective segments have an exponential fit characterized by a correlation scale of 1 26 fig 6 e in the opted structure of the velocity transition pdf expression 8 there is no explicit consideration of the autocorrelation coefficients at lags m 2 and higher figs 7 e h show the modeled and reference particle plume shapes at a very early time t 2 and a very late time t b the joint pdfs were estimated using rectangular elements with bi linear models following meyer 2018a the marginal pdf plots show that the plume shapes in either direction are non gaussian especially at early times fig 8 skewness is more prominent for the longitudinal dispersion in case longfrac as fractures act as long and fast pathways for the particles only after long times when the particles have sampled a range of steps lengths and velocities the position pdfs tend towards gaussian shapes the discrepancies in the variance estimates figs 7 a d are not well resolved in the marginal pdf plots fig 8 because the latter focus on the tails and are thus presented on a logarithmic scale 6 2 estimation of transport in stratified media we illustrate that the stochastic model is predictive for transport in stratified media in this context we use a domain model consisting of multiple strata each of which is characterized by a bimodal l n k distribution the individual strata l n k fields are statistically independent of each other fig 9 shows a l n k field realization for the two different configurations of stratified domain model considered in this study which differ in the direction of stratification the one with strata interfaces being parallel to p is referred to as case longstrat while case transstrat refers to the model with the interfaces being normal to p in these models the interfaces are located at x 2 48 80 and x 1 88 168 respectively in the three strata numbered in fig 9 fractures are oriented at θ f r 0 0 90 and 9 0 respectively the l n k statistics in the three strata are the same as in the two corresponding base cases discussed before and a similar space stationary ergodic case with fractures oriented at θ f r 0 90 the last of these cases is not discussed in this article but the average transport results in it are presented in fig 10 in the following we discuss the set up of the stochastic dispersion model and the details apply to both of the stratified domain configurations i e case longstrat and case transstrat the θ l n u l n l evolution processes are governed by three sets of transition pdfs each one corresponding to an individual stratum however the pdf sets need not be specifically estimated for the particular stratified domain instead the ones estimated in the ergodic settings of each stratum e g the base cases are used to validate the transport results we perform mcs for the stratified domain and the resulting particle position statistics are used as a reference in these transport simulations the release points of notional particles were uniformly distributed over a segment normal to p with x 2 44 84 fig 9 when an effective step crosses an interface θ l n l l n u t for the next step is sampled like the one for an initial step but the sampling distributions are the pdfs associated with the next stratum the mean flow field in a stratum might be altered due to the presence of the other strata for example in case longstrat the magnitude of the mean velocity in stratum 3 is significantly lower than that in the ergodic case transfrac fig 11 to include such effects in the stochastic model the sampled effective step velocities are scaled the scaling factor in a stratum is the ratio of the magnitude of the mean velocity in it as obtained in the stratified domain mcs to the one in the ergodic field simulation i e mcs of the corresponding base case additionally the sampled θ in a stratum are corrected for the deviation of its mean flow relative to the one in the corresponding ergodic field simulation here the eulerian mean velocity in the ergodic field simulations is estimated using the tracked pathlines puyguiraud et al 2019 the plume shapes in case longstrat are clearly non gaussian as shown in figs 12 a and 12 b a comparison between the two qualitatively demonstrates that the stochastic model captures the plume spreading figs 12 c and 12 d show the marginal pdf of the longitudinal particle position and conditional pdfs of the transverse position respectively at a late time stratum 1 with θ f r 0 offers preferential pathways with least resistance and the stochastic model accounts for this information only through the transformation of the sampled velocities however the transformations consider the mean velocity which is calculated over the whole stratum and thus inflow into stratum 1 through the interface and the near interface flow field are not correctly accounted for this explains the slight underestimation of longitudinal spreading at downstream locations solute spreading in case transstrat is a cumulative effect of spreading in each stratum the overall plume shapes are well captured by the stochastic model figs 12 e and 12 f an over estimation of the estimated particle density just downstream of the interface at x 1 88 fig 12 g is because the final steps sampled as per the pdfs of stratum 1 have finite extensions reaching into stratum 2 the underestimation of longitudinal spreading in the ergodic cases with the transversely oriented fractures e g case transfrac figs 7 a and 10 a leads to similar deviations in strata 2 and 3 of case transstrat the previously discussed exercise of transport prediction in stratified domains illustrates that the model can easily be adapted to accommodate changes in the boundary or initial conditions without the necessity to rerun the mcs used for the definition of the transition pdfs knowledge of the eulerian mean flow velocity in a new configuration is sufficient 6 3 model performance and constraints simulations were performed on a state of the art multi node distributed cluster system we report average computation times per random field realization for mcs with each one being handled by a single processor core the time required for the generation of a random l n k field of case transfrac case longfrac was 9 854 1 s 9 964 4 s additionally evaluating the eulerian flow field followed by path tracking of 12 80 particles took 123 27 s 409 8 s for the stochastic simulations estimation of the transition pdfs from the complete mcs data set took 104 2 s 186 9 s the time taken for the stochastic modeling of 12 80 pathlines was 567 3 s 300 2 s in this work the numbers of fields and particle trajectories per field in mcs were very conservatively chosen this ensured low statistical errors in the estimation of transition pdfs for the given resolution though the model is quite general in nature and is applicable to a wide range of matrix heterogeneities and fracture geometries it is suited for the media with fracture densities well below the percolation threshold additionally it has to be stated that the pre processing step to empirically estimate the transition matrices is an expensive process with a focus on a specific fractured formation kang et al 2015b proposed parametric functional forms for the transition probability matrix and steady distribution of step transition times these quantities or inversely those for lagrangian velocity form the core of spatial markov models for longitudinal dispersion comparison of the simulated breakthrough curves btcs with those obtained from convergent and push pull tracer tests yielded the parameter estimates additionally sherman et al 2017 proposed a methodology to estimate the velocity transition probability matrix from discretized forms of two successive btcs though this methodology is quite promising it is not possible to define fixed size stationary unit cells in the context of this work considering the presence of large fractures and also the emphasis on transverse spreading alternatively direct simulations are applied in the present work for transition probability estimation however a domain much smaller than the formation of interest can be used in these direct simulations 7 conclusions transport processes in heterogeneous geological formations with large fractures are phenomena of significant interest considering their presence in many applications in this work we have used a lagrangian approach to describe non reactive solute transport in 2 d continua consisting of a porous matrix characterized by a multi variate gaussian log conductivity distribution and isolated fractures of uniform conductivity as part of the characterization the stochastic dependence structure of particle trajectories was studied eventually based on the recorded structure we have formulated a minimalistic random walk model for solute dispersion in fractured media the data for our statistical analyses was obtained by computing flow fields for a number of conductivity field realizations followed by tracking passive solute particles in order to arrive at a compact model formulation we simplify the particle trajectories via polygonal lines composed of effective segments each effective segment connects the points where the trajectory passes from a fracture into the matrix this effective representation merges the particle path sections in the matrix and fractures significantly simplifying the description our analyses indicated a strong auto correlation of velocity and orientation angle over successive segments which is especially true for the scenario with fractures being normal to the mean pressure gradient further the cross correlation between velocity and segment length is significant for the scenario with fractures being parallel to the mean pressure gradient cross correlation between velocity and the segment orientation angle is considerable in both of the fracture orientation scenarios the orientation angle and length are statistically dependent in addition the correlation between the orientation angle and the particle s transverse coordinate is significant and crucial for the accurate prediction of transverse dispersion based on our statistical analysis a random walk model for dispersion was devised which incorporates the dependencies of a particle s future state on the preceding state and the cross dependencies among the different state components differently from the previous works discussed in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 the velocity magnitude process is neither a spatial nor a temporal markov process rather it is assumed to be markovian in step increments using numerical simulations as a reference we validated our model for chosen configurations of fracture orientations with respect to the applied mean pressure gradient asymptotic longitudinal and transverse spreading especially its bounded nature in the 2 d flow scenarios with infinite péclet number are captured adequately well by the model additionally we successfully showcased the prediction of solute dispersion in spatially non stationary stratified domains as illustrated in these cases the model allows us to incorporate changes in the average flow rate pressure gradient and boundary conditions of the domain we envision extending the current work to more complex settings e g with fluid phase reactions where the conventional numerical methods become increasingly expensive in particle tracking simulations a retardation factor is often used for particle velocities so as to simulate equilibrium adsorption characterized by a linear isotherm liu et al 2000 in the context of our work this will result in slower effective velocities thus the effects of the adsorption or other unresolved phenomena can be incorporated in the stochastic model as of now a particle s future state depends only on the immediately preceding state incorporating further dependencies is possible by using an alternative to the transition matrix for the transition pdf estimation for example distribution element trees provide an efficient means for density estimation in a multidimensional sample space meyer 2018a and also for un conditional sampling meyer 2018c

186,a volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method was developed to study flow interactions with aquatic vegetation the model has been validated with data from laboratory experiments and previous high fidelity models with satisfactory results sensitivity analyzes on both penalty parameter and thickness parameter were conducted and optimal values for these parameters are recommended the validated model has been applied to study the effects of swaying motion of vegetation stems on the flow dynamics at both vegetate stem scale and patch scale the swaying motion of the vegetation stem is prescribed following a cubic law that peaks at the top and decreases to zero at the bottom at stem scale the hydrodynamics depend on the keulegan carpenter number k c which is defined as the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem to the diameter of the stem simulations with three k c values were carried out for k c 1 the flow turbulence is significantly enhanced by the swaying motion of the stem and turbulence becomes more isotropic in the wake the swaying motion of vegetation stems caused a 5 increase of the bottom shear stress at the shoulders of the stem and the effect is negligible in the wake at patch scale the hydrodynamics depend on the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size of the vegetation patch and the solid volume fraction for dense vegetation canopy solid volume fraction was varied while maintaining the same effective keulegan carpenter in the simulations when the effective keulgen carpenter number is small k c 1 effects of the swaying motion of vegetation stems on the large patch scale dynamics are not significant including both the turbulence statistics and the bottom stress keywords immersed boundary method flow vegetation interactions vegetation patch scale hydrodynamics 1 introduction aquatic vegetation provides many important ecological services micheli and kirchner 2002 kremen 2005 including shoreline protection nursery areas for fish shellfish and crustaceans and water quality improvement aquatic vegetation stabilizes coastal shorelines prevents erosion and traps sediment to promote intertidal accretion to keep up with sea level rise however due to human activities gedan et al 2009 and the threat of sea level rise craft et al 2009 a large amount of aquatic vegetation has been lost in recent decades marani et al 2011 on the other hand aquatic vegetation has been widely used as cost effective coastal defense systems to protect coastal communities gedan et al 2011 against the increased storminess and accelerated sea level rise it is of critical importance to understand the hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in vegetated regions for aquatic vegetation conservation and restoration because the evolution of estuarine and coastal morphology in vegetated regions strongly depends on the interplays of flow vegetation and sediment accretion in emergent vegetation canopy plant stems fill the entire water column when flow enters the vegetation canopy the mean flow velocity is reduced by drag and sediment carried into the canopy starts to settle the additional drag exerted by plants is commonly parameterized by a friction coefficient which is an important parameter in large scale circulation models and storm surge models to accurately predict the flow attenuation in rivers and estuaries by vegetation on the other hand vortices shed from the plants can enhance the turbulence in vegetation canopy vegetation generated turbulent eddies could interact with sediment bed resuspend sediment and enhance sediment transport tinoco and coco 2013 yang et al 2016 at vegetation stem scale when flow passes a single isolated vegetation stem the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the plant and the unsteady vortex shedding behind the plant are the key hydrodynamic processes numerical simulations and laboratory experiments zhao et al 2010 chen et al 2017 have been carried out to understand the flow structure and sediment transport around circular cylinders the entrainment and erosion of sediment near a circular cylinder strongly depend on the turbulence generation mechanisms due to complex interactions of both cylinder generated and wall generated turbulent eddies with the sediment bed accurate sediment transport model around a single vegetation stem represented by a circular cylinder has yet to be developed which is important for soil erosion control aquatic vegetation often grows in patches and heterogeneous plant forms understanding flow interactions with a patch of emergent vegetation including flow attenuation by vegetation turbulent mixing and sediment transport is of critical importance for natural resources management laboratory experiments zong and nepf 2012 shan et al 2020 and numerical simulations chang and constantinescu 2015 show that bleeding flow develops in a sparse vegetation canopy and large scale wake billows form in a dense vegetation canopy three distinct flow regimes have been identified by nicolle and eames 2011 based on the solid volume fraction s v f of vegetation at low solid volume fraction s v f 0 05 individual vegetation stems behave like isolated single stems at intermediate solid volume fraction 0 05 s v f 0 15 a shear layer is generated at the shoulder of the patch large scale wake billows are shed in the wake of the patch at high solid volume fraction s v f 0 15 the array of vegetation stems generates a wake in a similar way to a solid body of the same shape of the vegetation patch the sediment transport within and around the vegetation patch is directly linked with the hydrodynamic processes for sparse vegetation canopy the flow accelerates between vegetation stems and intensive erosion occurs within the canopy due to stem scale turbulence for dense vegetation canopy the large patch scale wake billows dominate the sediment transport leading to a scour hole around the patch process based models have been widely used to provide insights on interplays among flow vegetation and sediment most previous numerical model studies on flow and sediment transport in emergent vegetation canopy treat vegetation stems as regularly spaced or staggered rigid circular cylinders stoesser et al 2010 huai et al 2015 and only a few stems can be implemented due to the available computational resources however emergent vegetation stems are flexible and move back and forth by waves and wind which can stir water and possibly sediment in addition the spatial distribution of vegetation stems is heterogenous and the collective friction effects of vegetation due to drag play important roles in the dynamics with recent advancement in computational methods uhlmann 2005 lee and choi 2015 a massively parallel high fidelity model that can efficiently simulate flow interactions with moving deforming vegetation needs to be developed to model the fluid structure interaction two approaches have been developed one approach is to move the computational mesh to follow the motion of the solid object based on the relation between the motion of the computational grid and the motion of the fluid either lagrangian or eulerian framework is used in lagrangian framework the local fluid velocity is used to move the computational mesh in eulerian framework velocity on a separate fixed eulerian mesh is used to move the computational mesh the motion of the computational mesh can cause severely distorted mesh of poor quality under the lagrangian framework arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method hirt et al 1974 combines both lagrangian and eulerian framework after the explicit lagrangian update of the computational mesh with the updated solution a new mesh with better quality is defined by moving the mesh at a specified velocity and the lagrangian solution is transferred conservatively onto the new mesh berndt et al 2011 ale technique is easy to implement and accurate however for problems with large translations or rotations the computational mesh tends to be ill shaped which affects the accuracy of the solution in addition the remeshing can be expensive to compute the other approach is to not make any changes of the fluid mesh a widely used method is the immersed boundary ib method peskin 2002 the solid object interacts with the fluid through the local body forces applied to the fluid at the point locations at the fluid solid interface to enforce the boundary conditions at the solid surface one of the advantage of ib method is that the mesh generation is greatly simplified the generation of body fitting computational grid can be difficult for complex geometries and grid quality deteriorates with complexity of the geometry using unstructured grids for ib method block structured grids with local refinement can be used which are computationally efficient one of the drawbacks of ib method is the smear of the interface compared to the body fitting approach the counterpart of the ib method for finite element or spectral element methods is the fictitious domain method glowinski et al 1994 parussini and pediroda 2009 the coupling between the fluid and solid phase is done by constraining fluid and the solid body at the interface using a lagrangian multiplier that represents the body forces two approaches namely the direct forcing and the feedback forcing methods have been developed for the ib method mittal and iaccarino 2005 in the classical ib method peskin 2002 the direct forcing method lagrangian markers are used to describe the solid surface the ib methods use a distribution function to interpolate the fluid velocity from the eulerian fluid grids to the lagrangian markers to calculate the body force term tseng and ferziger 2003 the forcing is then spread from the lagrangian markers to the surrounding eulerian fluid grids via a smooth kernel function wang and liu 2004 to conserve the total force and torque different algorithms have been developed for both uniform and nonuniform eulerian grids akiki and balachandar 2016 the classical ib method is second order accurate at the solid surface the classical ib method poses a stiff problem and results in a small computational time step which severely restricts the simulation in addition the implementation of the ib method can be difficult and the accuracy of the method also depends on the distribution of lagrangian markers on the other hand the volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method a feedback forcing method simply represents solid bodies as porous medium with very small permeability and can be used in conjunction with high order numerical schemes kadoch et al 2012 piquet et al 2016 the implementation of the vpib method is of minimum effort by replacing the implementation of no slip boundary condition on the solid surface with a simple source term in the navier stokes equation the vpib method is also computationally more efficient without the need to calculate the coupling forcing terms between fluid and solid directly emergent vegetation is commonly modeled as rigid circular cylinder and the frictional dissipation due to vegetation is parameterized by a drag coefficient for marsh grass the reynolds number based on the stem size and current wave velocity is on the order of o 100 1000 for a single circular cylinder a drag coefficient around 1 is often used due to flow sheltering in vegetation canopy the drag coefficient also depends on the solid volume fraction nepf 1999 tanino and nepf 2008 augustin et al 2009 in natural environments emergent vegetation plants are flexible and they sway on wind the forced motion of the plant could stir the water column and affect the drag turbulent mixing and sediment transport on the other hand the marsh grass is stiff with a large cauchy number defined as the ratio of the elastic restoration force to the hydrodynamic drag force the movement of the vegetation stem is relatively small in this study we focus on the parameter range of small keulegan carpenter number which is defined as the ratio of the maximum excursion of the vegetation motion to the diameter of the vegetation stem a simplified prescribed motion of the vegetation is implemented to simulate the forced motion of the vegetation plant we focus on how the forced motion of vegetation affects the drag and turbulent mixing in the emergent vegetation canopy this paper is organized as follows first we present the governing equations for the volume penalization immersed boundary method and the numerical schemes next we extensively validate the method by comparing the numerical simulation results with data from previous laboratory experiments and high fidelity numerical simulations the validated model is then applied to investigate how a simplified prescribed swaying motion of vegetation affects flow turbulence and bed shear stress under steady current at both stem and patch scales 2 governing equation and numerical method in the volume penalization immersed boundary method the solid objects such as vegetation stems are modeled as porous media with low permeability the governing equations are given as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j α ε 1 u i u s i where ρ is the fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and p is the dynamic pressure x i u i and u s i are the i th component of the position vector fluid velocity vector and the solid object velocity vector i 1 2 3 represents the streamwise spanwise and vertical direction respectively the penalty parameter ε can be interpreted as permeability and a very small value is often implemented to find the optimal value for the penalty parameter ε a sensitivity analysis needs be conducted α is the mask function defined as 3 α x t 1 x ω s 0 x ω f where ω s is the solid phase and ω f is the fluid phase the no slip boundary conditions at the fluid solid interface are no longer included the solid object is represented by the mask function α to avoid numerical instabilities a smoothly transition of the mask function α at the solid liquid interface with values between 0 and 1 is required the thickness of the transition layer is defined by δ the thickness parameter δ measures the spreading of the influences from the solid structure such as forces or stresses to the fluid and is determined based on the grid spacing in the present work we use an analytical expression for the mask function which can be easily resampled on the fluid grid the 1d smoothed heaviside function is implemented as 4 h x 1 2 erf x x 0 δ 1 the smoothed heaviside function provides a good way to alleviate numerical instabilities at the sharp fluid solid interface the fluid solid interface is located at x 0 and the solid is at x x 0 for 3d problems the tensor product of 1d heaviside function is used at the fluid solid interface the sensitivity analysis of the thickness parameter δ needs to be conducted to determine the optimal value of δ in large eddy simulation les the large energy containing eddies are resolved and only small sub grid turbulent eddies are modeled with an appropriate subgrid closure les can accurately predict the unsteady vortex shedding of flow around solid object zedler and street 2001 kim et al 2004 in les the velocity is decomposed as u i u i u i with u i as the resolved velocity component and u i as the unresolved subgrid velocity component the governing equation with les turbulent closure can be written as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j α ε 1 u i u s i in which the shear stress τ i j is the sum of the viscous stress and turbulent stress following the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption 7 τ i j 2 ν ν s g s s i j where ν s g s is the subgrid eddy viscosity and s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the strain rate tensor of the resolved velocity field eddy viscosity ν s g s is given by the wall adaptive local eddy wale model 8 ν t δ s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 with 9 δ s c w v c 1 3 10 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 11 g i j u i x j the constant c w is 0 325 and v c is the volume of the grid cell we implemented the volume penalization immersed boundary method in openfoam weller et al 1998 due to the small value of the penalization parameter ε the momentum equation is a stiff equation the explicit treatment of the source term ε 1 α u i u s i requires an extremely small time step of δ t ε engels et al 2015 to alleviate the computational demands the source term is modeled implicitly a second order upwind scheme is used as the spatial discretization the volume penalization ibm is only first order accurate in time and hence the first order backward euler method is used for time marching the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is used to solve the filtered unsteady navier stokes equations the time step limited by the cfl criterion with the maximum cfl number of 0 5 for all simulations 3 model validation 3 1 turbulent flow over circular cylinder at re 3900 parnaudeau et al 2008 carried out experimental and les studies of the flow over a circular cylinder at reynolds number 3900 here we used the experimental data to validate the volume penalization immersed boundary vpib model for fully developed turbulent flow in terms of both the mean flow and turbulence statistics the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved on a regular cartesian grid the size of computational domain is 20 d by 10 d by π d in the streamwise x spanwise y and vertical z direction respectively in which d is the diameter of the circular cylinder a constant flow of u c is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain and outflow boundary condition is implemented at the exit the outflow boundary condition is a mixed boundary condition when the fluid flows out of the domain at the boundary the velocity gradient is set to zero when the fluid is flowing into the domain the flow velocity is set to zero so there is no backflow at the boundary periodic boundary conditions are applied in both the spanwise y and the vertical z directions the circular cylinder is located at 3 4 d downstream from the inlet and 5 d from the lateral boundaries a fixed time step is used with maximum cfl number below 0 5 uniform grid spacing was used in all three directions and the grid spacings in the horizontal directions are the same δ x δ y numerical simulations with three different grid resolutions were conducted by varying the ratio of cylinder diameter to the horizontal grid spacing d δ x the vertical grid resolution was kept the same for all three cases with δ z d 0 065 which is similar to the les simulation in parnaudeau et al 2008 we first ran each of the simulation for 50 eddy turnover times d u c to make sure the flow reached equilibrium the simulation was continued for another 50 eddy turnover time for data analysis the penalty parameter was kept the same for all three simulations d u c ε 25 000 and the thickness parameter δ was kept the same δ x δ 1 3 4 0 and 7 0 for the coarse medium and fine grid resolution respectively results from cases with medium resolution d δ x 24 and fine resolution d δ x 40 agree well with each other for the case with coarse resolution only 8 grid points were used in each horizontal directions d δ x 8 model results slightly over predicted the mean streamwise velocity near the shoulder of the circular cylinder in the wake fig 1a and under predicted the streamwise x component of the turbulent fluctuation fig 1b the medium grid resolution with d δ x 24 was used for further model validation and analysis previous studies of the volume penalization ibm method have evaluated the sensitivity of the penalty parameter ε and the thickness parameter δ with laminar flows and showed it is unlikely to find the optimal value of the penalty parameter ε in cases where no reference solution exists 9 in this study we focus on the model performance for fully developed turbulent flows at high reynolds number without reference solution fig 2 panel a and b show the comparison of simulation results with different penalty parameters with the same thickness parameter δ x δ 4 the penalty parameter is normalized as d u c ε because the flow through porous media depends on the incoming flow speed the flow through the porous media decreases with ε and converges with sufficient large d u c ε when the parameter ε is too large i e too permeable the model significantly under predicted the velocity defect in the wake fig 2a and the streamwise turbulent fluctuation fig 2b there is only a slight change from d u c ε 25 000 to 250 000 ideally a small value ε is preferred however the time step is restricted by ε even for the implicit scheme in this study d u c ε 25 000 is chosen fig 2 panels c and d show how the thickness parameter δ affects the model performance the thickness parameter depends on the grid spacing and is therefore normalized as δ x δ the penalty parameter is kept the same for all three simulations with small δ x δ or large δ the mask function spreads wider and hence the volume occupied by the solid object is expanded the model under predicts the velocity defect fig 2c in the wake and over predicts the streamwise turbulent fluctuation fig 2d due to the expansion of the solid object by the mask function the solid object in the simulation domain appears larger than the actual solid object the difference between δ x δ of 4 and 8 is not pronounced further increasing δ x δ can cause numerical instabilities at the fluid solid interface and the ratio δ x δ 4 8 is recommended in this study δ x δ 4 is chosen the vibm model is then validated against laboratory experiment data in detail the power spectrum of the velocity at numerical probe locations was used to obtain the shedding frequency the strouhal number from the les simulation is s t 0 21 compare to s t 0 208 0 001 from the hot wire laboratory experiment data of parnaudeau et al 2008 fig 3 shows the comparison of the vpib les model predictions of the streamwise x velocity with the laboratory experiment at three different downstream locations numerical model predicted the strong velocity defect in the recirculation region with a u shape close to the cylinder which evolves into a v shape profile further downstream the model slightly over predicted the mean velocity at x d 1 06 and x d 1 54 at the shoulder of the cylinder and under predicted the velocity defect in the wake at x d 2 02 the comparison of the spanwise y component velocity is presented in fig 3 panel b d and f the model results show a anti symmetry shape with respect to y 0 center of the cylinder model results agree reasonably well with the experiment data and previous les studies kravchenko and moin 2000 parnaudeau et al 2008 discrepancies at locations very close to the circular cylinder arise due to the smearing of the fluid solid interface by the immersed boundary method model results of the streamwise x component of the velocity fluctuation are compared with the laboratory experiment of parnaudeau et al 2008 symbols of and lourenco 1993 symbols in fig 4 at x d 1 06 the profile shows two strong peaks due to the transitional state of the shear layers the model underestimated these peaks compared to the laboratory experiment possibly due to smearing of the fluid solid interface again the model underpredicted the peak of the streamwise normal turbulent stress by about 50 at x d 1 06 and 20 at x d 1 54 at x d 1 06 these two peaks of the shear layer are overlapped by two large peaks and the model results agree well with experimental data the vpib method with les closure generates satisfactory results and can be used to study the turbulence generation mechanisms of emergent vegetation stems 3 2 flow over a patch of emergent vegetation aquatic vegetation often grows in patches flow interactions with a patch of emergent vegetation play important roles in the hydrodynamics how the solid volume fraction of the vegetation patch and the spatial arrangement of vegetation stems in the patch affect the hydrodynamics is one of the challenging research questions here we conducted a simulation of flow over a circular array of rigid circular cylinders to evaluate the model performance for flow over vegetation patches the length width and height of the computational domain are set to 15 d 10 d and π d respectively in which d is the diameter of the vegetation patch a constant flow of u is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain and a outlet boundary condition is implemented at the exit in the streamwise x direction periodic boundary condition is implemented in the vertical z direction open boundary condition with zero gradient of the velocity is implemented in the spanwise y direction the reynolds number based on the patch diameter and current velocity is r e d u d ν 10 000 the vegetation stem size is d 0 048 d the solid volume fraction is 0 023 with 10 stems and 0 05 with 21 stems in the circular patch three levels of grid refinement were used with the finest grid spacing of δ x δ y d 8 in the vegetation patch the coarsest grid spacing much away from the vegetation patch is close to d the grid resolution is similar to chang and constantinescu 2015 a fixed time step was chosen with c f l 0 5 after the solution became steady statistics were collected over 50 eddy turnover times d u model results have been compared with laboratory experiment data and previous les model results zong and nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 chang and constantinescu 2015 vibm model fig 5 shows satisfactory performance in terms of both the mean velocity u u and turbulence statistics the root mean square of the streamwise component of the velocity fluctuation u r m s u even with a relatively coarse resolution of d δ x 8 3 3 flow generated by an oscillating circular cylinder to evaluate the performance of vpib model for moving objects we conducted numerical simulations of flow generated by an oscillating cylinder at low keulegan carpenter number model results were compared with experimental data by dutsch et al 1998 the keulegan carpenter number is defined as 12 k c u m a x ω d where u m a x is the maximum velocity of the cylinder motion ω is the angular frequency of the oscillatory motion and d is the diameter of the cylinder we set up a two dimensional simulation with computational domain size of 55 d in the streamwise direction and 35 d in the spanwise direction open boundary conditions with zero gradient of velocities were implemented in both lateral directions the computational domain is sufficiently large so that the flow around the moving cylinder is not affected by the boundaries initially the circular cylinder is located at the center of the computational domain it oscillates with the time dependent velocity of u c y l u m a x cos ω t in x direction the reynolds number is 100 and the keulegan carpenter number k c is 5 cartesian grid with uniform size of δ x d δ y d 0 05 was implemented the permeability parameter was set to ε 1 0 5 s 1 in this simulation the thickness parameter δ was set to δ x δ 8 a fixed time step was used with the maximum cfl number below 0 5 fig 6 shows the comparison between model results and laboratory data at four different locations at wave phase ω t 0 when the cylinder is located at its origin the model predicts the u shaped velocity profile with two peaks near the edge of the cylinder at location x d 0 the u shaped velocity profile evolves into a v shaped profile at x d 0 6 which smooths out further downstream at x d 1 2 for spanwise velocity component the antisymmetry of velocity profile around y d 0 can be observed the model results agree well with laboratory experiment data and the vpib method is capable to capture flow interactions with moving objects 4 effect of swaying motion of vegetation on stem scale flow structures wetlands are highly complex environments with emergent vegetation that is rooted underwater but emerges through the air water interface on one hand emergent vegetation attenuates waves and shields the water surface from wind on the other hand emergent plants sway in wind because of wind plant interactions and stir the water column which could enhance turbulent mixing and sediment transport 4 1 simulation setup a single vegetation stem is placed in the turbulent channel flow the motion of the vegetation is mainly driven by the wind interaction with the part of the plant above the water and we prescribed the motion of the underwater part of vegetation for simplicity the vegetation stem is modeled as a cantilever beam with the force applied at the top of the submerged portion of the vegetation stem for stiff vegetation effects of hydrodynamic force on structure deformation could be negligible for simplicity we implemented a one way coupling scheme to model the fluid structure interaction only the displacement of the structure is transferred to the fluid solver and the fluid pressure acting on the structure is not transferred to the structure solver based on the elastic beam theory the deflection at any beam section is 13 δ x z f z 2 6 e i 3 h z where f is the magnitude of the force e is the young s modulus i is the area moment of inertia of the beam h is the water depth and δ x is the deflection of the beam at vertical elevation z the swaying motion is modeled by an oscillating force f t f m sin ω t with ω as the angular frequency in this study we use the maximum displacement δ m a x to characterize the stem motion as 14 δ x z t δ m a x sin ω t z 2 2 h 2 3 z h the velocity of the stem can therefore be derived as 15 u s z t ω δ m a x cos ω t z 2 2 h 2 3 z h the keulegan carpenter number is defined as k c u m a x ω d δ m a x d the size of the computational domain is 6 4 h 3 2 h h where h is the depth of the channel the computational domain is sufficiently large in both horizontal directions to contain the largest turbulent eddy periodic boundary conditions were implemented in both the streamwise x and spanwise y directions fig 7 the no slip boundary condition was applied at the bottom the free slip boundary condition was implemented at the top in which the gradient of the horizontal velocity components u and v is set to zero and the vertical component of the velocity w is set to zero uniform grids with two levels of grid refinement were used in the horizontal directions l 1 and l 2 in fig 7a the coarsest grid size is δ x h δ y h 0 02 and the finest grid is near the vegetation stem with δ x h δ y h 0 005 nonuniform grids are implemented in the vertical direction with the finest grid near the bottom and δ z m i n h 0 018 a constant pressure gradient is prescribed to drive the flow the reynolds number based on the friction velocity is r e τ u h ν 500 with u as the friction velocity a fixed time step is used with the maximum c f l number below 0 5 we first carried out the simulation without the vegetation stem to generate the fully developed turbulent channel flow after the simulation reached equilibrium with respect to the turbulence statistics we placed the swaying vegetation stem at the center of the computational domain x 0 and y 0 the penalty parameter is set to d ε u 25 000 and the thickness parameter is set to δ x δ 4 fig 7b shows the mask function for the vegetation stem and how the thickness parameter δ affects the mask function the vegetation stem size is d h 0 12 and 24 horizontal grid points are used to resolve flows around the stem we keep the angular frequency the same while varying the maximum displacement to get different k c we first run the simulation for 10 periods for model spin up then we continued the simulation for another 20 periods for data analysis 4 2 mean flow and turbulence statistics four probes were set up in the computational domain to examine the spatial patterns of the flow structure square symbols in fig 7a fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of the streamwise component of the mean velocity u and the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations along the center line y d 0 at x d 3 5 the mean velocity profiles show little variation above z h 0 4 in the wake near the wall the mean velocity first increases peaks around z h and then decreases the swaying motion of the cylinder has little influence on the mean velocity profiles fig 8a compared to the rigid case the root mean square of turbulent velocity fluctuations are significantly higher in the cases with swaying cylinders fig 8b d turbulent velocity fluctuations only increase slightly with k c because k c is greater than 1 for all cases at x d 18 3 along the centerline both the mean velocity and the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the rigid cylinder case are smaller than the cases with swaying cylinders fig 8e h the same pattern can be observed at x d 13 3 fig 8i l again the difference among the cases with swaying cylinders is not pronounced due to the range of k c used in this study at x d 13 3 and y d 12 7 fig 8m p the mean velocity in the case with a rigid cylinder is greater than the cases with a swaying cylinder and the spanwise component of the turbulent velocity fluctuation is smaller the streamwise and vertical components of turbulent fluctuations are only slightly affected by the swaying motion and the profiles collapse into a single curve the swaying motion of the cylinder could affect turbulent anisotropy fig 9 shows the turbulent coherent structures generated by the swaying cylinder the q criterion method jeong and hussain 1995 is used to visualize the turbulent coherent structures the horseshoe vortex in front of the stem and braided coherent structures in the wake persist at all phases at the peak ω t π 2 fig 9b when the displacement of the cylinder reaches its maximum the coherent structures are compressed in the wake because it moves in the same direction as the current during 0 ω t π 2 at the trough ω t 3 π 2 fig 9d the coherent structures are stretched in the wake because the cylinder moves in the opposite direction during π ω t 3 π 2 to characterize the turbulence anisotropy we conducted anisotropy invariant map analysis lumley 1978 simonsen and krogstad 2005 the non dimensional anisotropy tensor of the reynolds stress τ i j is defined as 16 b i j τ i j τ k k 1 3 δ i j in which δ is the kronecker delta for incompressible flow the second i i and third invariants i i i of the tensor b i j are used the origin indicates the isotropic turbulence i i i i i 0 fig 10 compares the anisotropy invariance mapping of two cases one with a rigid cylinder fig 10a and the other with a swaying cylinder fig 10b for both cases along the center line we observe the turbulence switches from the axisymmetric at x d 3 5 to two component at x d 13 3 also turbulence becomes more isotropic at the center of the domain away from the boundaries at x d 13 3 and y d 0 turbulence falls between two component and isotropic regimes with the swaying motion of the cylinder flow turbulence becomes more isotropic represented by clustered symbols around the origin the strong anisotropy of turbulence in the case of rigid cylinder suggests the classic reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach with two equation turbulence closure may fail to accurately predict the turbulent characteristics and hence the turbulent mixing due to the scalar eddy viscosity in the model the reynolds stress model rsm approach may work better with flow over emergent vegetation canopy 4 3 bottom shear stress fig 11a shows the time averaged bottom shear stress for the case with a rigid stem large eddy simulation resolves both wall generated turbulence and stem generated turbulence and hence the bottom shear stress includes interactions of both wall generated turbulent eddies and stem generated eddies with the bed regions of large bottom shear stress can be observed at shoulders of the stem in the wake of the stem a region with negative shear stress close to the stem exists followed by a region with large shear stress fig 11b shows the comparison of the spatially averaged bottom shear stress for all cases the bottom shear stress is averaged in the spanwise y direction and normalized by τ 0 ρ u 2 for all cases the bottom shear stress increases and peaks at the center of the stem then it decreases in the wake the bottom shear stress increases and reaches the asymptotic value in bare channel outside of the recirculation zone behind of the stem the bottom shear stress at the shoulders of the circular cylinder is around 5 larger in cases with a swaying cylinder compared to the case with a rigid stem suggesting enhanced erosion by the swaying motion of the vegetation stem because of the range of keulegan carpenter numbers k c 1 used in the study the difference between cases with a swaying cylinder is not pronounced a small increase of τ τ 0 can be observed in the wake of the cylinder for the case with the largest k c 4 4 drag force the hydrodynamic force acting on the vegetation stem can be computed by integrating the stress tensor including both the viscous stress and pressure over the surface 17 f τ n d a in which n is the unit surface normal vector in volume penalization immersed boundary method the stress tensor τ is continuous across the fluid solid interface and hence τ is interpolated at the interface to compute the drag force fig 12a shows the vertical profile of the time averaged drag coefficient c d f 0 5 ρ a u 2 the drag coefficient is calculated at the vertical elevation z z 1 z 2 2 the projected area in the flow direction is a d δ z with δ z z 2 z 1 and u is the depth averaged velocity results from cases with different k c show a similar pattern drag coefficient first increases with the vertical elevation z h approaches a constant value around 1 between z h of 0 2 and 0 6 and then drops towards the top of the domain the flow velocity past the cylinder is smaller in the bottom boundary layer than the depth averaged velocity so the drag coefficient is smaller in the bottom boundary layer the swaying motion of the cylinder generates a self induced wake zone that oscillates with the cylinder the wake is strongest at the top because the displacement is at its largest the flow sheltering due to the self induced wake generated by the swaying motion leads to the drag reduction overall the drag reduction increases with k c fig 12a the drag reduction also varies vertically close to the bottom the maximum displacement is relatively small compared to the stem size and the drag force is not significantly affected by the self induced wake of the swaying stem far away from the bottom effects of the self induced wake become increasingly important fig 12b and c show the phase averaged drag coefficient at two vertical elevations at z h 0 6 the peak of the drag coefficient occurs at ω t π when the velocity of the swaying cylinder reaches its peak the drag coefficient is symmetric at ω t π with a peaky crest and flat trough with k c 5 3 and 3 the drag coefficient does not vary much with k c 1 at z h 1 the variation of the drag coefficient within one wave cycle increases with k c the peak of the drag coefficient is not at ω t π anymore the phase lag might be due to the strong self induced wake of the cylinder 5 effect of swaying motion of vegetation on patch scale flow structures aquatic vegetation often form patches due to clonal growth sand jensen and madsen 1992 hydrodynamics over a patch of vegetation strongly depend on the patch properties including the solid volume fraction ϕ size and shape for a circular vegetation patch at low solid volume fraction ϕ 5 each individual stem behaves like an isolated vegetation stem nicolle and eames 2011 at intermediate to high solid volume fraction ϕ 0 05 patch scale wake billows form in the wake of the vegetation patch chang and constantinescu 2015 which is similar to the von karman vortex street behind a solid structure with the same size and shape we assume dense emergent vegetation shields the water surface from wind and attenuates surface waves only effects of swaying motion of vegetation on steady currents are investigated particularly we focus on how the swaying motions of vegetation stems affect the velocity structure and the turbulent transport in dense emergent vegetation canopies we conducted numerical simulations of flow over dense patches of vegetation the computation domain size is 6 4 h 3 2 h h where h is the channel height a nearly circular patch of vegetation consisted of 19 stems is located at the center of the domain the stems are regularly spaced in a hexagonal pattern and the centers of the circular cylinders are aligned along the y spanwise direction see 13a the diameter of the circular patch is set to d p h 0 8 the solid volume fraction is varied by changing the diameter of the vegetation stems two volume fractions were chosen as ϕ 11 75 intermediate and 32 65 high respectively simulations with both rigid and swaying vegetation stems were carried out to understand how the swaying motions affect the patch scale dynamics the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem δ m a x was set to 0 2 h for all simulations periodic boundary conditions were implemented in both the streamwise x and spanwise y directions the model setup can be interpreted as the flow over infinite arrays of regularly spaced circular patches at the bottom the no slip boundary condition was implemented free slip boundary condition was implemented at the top in which gradients of lateral velocities are set to zero and the vertical velocity is set to zero two levels of grid refinement were implemented with the finest grid of δ x h δ y h 0 005 one vegetation stem is resolved by 24 horizontal grids for the case with high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 and 16 horizontal grids for the case with intermediate solid volume fraction ϕ 11 75 a constant pressure gradient was implemented to drive the steady current and maintain the same mean velocity u m e a n the reynolds number based on the frictional velocity is r e τ 500 a constant time step was used with c f l 0 5 for all cases simulations with swaying vegetation reached the equilibrium in 10 wave cycles therefore the first 10 wave cycles of each simulation were model spin ups and not used for the analysis after spin up we continued the simulations for another 20 wave cycles to compute flow and turbulence statistics 5 1 flow kinematics fig 13 shows the instantaneous flow fields at different phases ω t 0 and 2 5 π at high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 the vegetation patch behaves like a solid cylinder at ω t 0 the recirculation zone in the case with swaying vegetation stems fig 13a and d is slightly larger compared to the case with rigid stems fig 13c and f at ω t 2 5 π the vegetation stems push the fluid forward and the wake structure varies strongly vertically fig 13e because the prescribed velocity of the stems increases with z h at intermediate solid fraction ϕ 11 75 similar patterns can be observed and the size of the recirculation zone is smaller than the case with larger solid volume fraction to examine how the swaying motion affects the patch scale vortex shedding we extracted the instantaneous spanwise y component velocity at x d p 2 25 and z h 0 25 upper panels in fig 14 show the time history of the spanwise velocity v and the energy spectrums are shown in the lower panels at high solid volume fraction the strouhal number peaks near s t 0 25 in both rigid and swaying cases and the shedding frequency is similar to that of flow past a solid circular cylinder for the case with swaying stems fig 14g we did not observe the peak at s t 0 1 which is the frequency of the swaying motion of individual stems the swaying motion does not affect the shedding frequency of the large patch scale eddies for cases with intermediate solid volume fraction fig 14f a peak around s t 0 13 can be identified a second peak around the second harmonic s t 0 26 can also be identified for the case with rigid stems with swaying stems the time history of the spanwise velocity shows a nonlinear saw tooth shape only a single peak at s t 0 133 can be identified in the normalized energy spectrum for all cases the 5 3 slope is evident suggesting the les model can resolve the inertial subrange reasonably well with given grid resolution 5 2 turbulence statistics at x d p 2 the flow is dominated by the large scale billows the frequency of the swaying motion does not show up as in fig 14 time average is therefore used to separate the mean velocity from the turbulent fluctuations instead of the phase average fig 15a shows the vertical profiles of the normalized mean stream velocity at y d p 1 9 the mean velocity profiles converge for cases with large volume fraction for cases with intermediate volume fraction the mean velocity is smaller with swaying stems at z h 0 5 for cases with high solid volume fraction all three turbulent fluctuation components are smaller when the swaying motions of the stems are included fig 15b to d for cases with intermediate solid volume fraction the spanwise component velocity fluctuation is significantly enhanced by the swaying motion of the stems fig 15c while both the streamwise component fig 15b and the vertical component fig 15d are attenuated along the center line y d p 0 large velocity defect of the mean velocity can be observed in the wake fig 15e the velocity defect is smaller for the case of intermediate solid volume fraction with swaying stems the swaying motion of the stems has little effect on the turbulent fluctuations for both cases fig 15f to h however the solid volume fraction significantly affects the spanwise and the vertical components of the turbulent fluctuations both of which increase with the solid volume fraction fig 15g and h dense vegetation patch behaves similar to a porous solid cylinder with a large patch scale wake an effective keulegan carpenter number can be defined as the ratio of the excursion δ m a x to the size of the patch d p which is k c 0 25 at low k c effects of the swaying motion of vegetation stems on turbulent generation is expected to be weak 5 3 bottom shear stress the time averaged normalized bottom shear stresses from cases with rigid stems are presented in fig 16 panel a and b regions with high bottom shear stress can be observed in the gaps between vegetation stems in both cases as well as the shoulders of the patch due to the formation of patch scale shear layer at the shoulders because the interstitial space in the case with low solid volume fraction is greater the averaged bottom shear stress decreases with increasing ϕ for dense vegetation patch the bottom shear stress decreases in the wake for both cases for the case with high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 a region with negative bottom shear stress at x d p 1 6 x h 1 3 can be observed in the wake of the patch the time averaged bottom shear stress fig 16c is averaged in the spanwise y direction and normalized by τ 0 ρ u 2 for all cases the bottom shear stress increases and reaches the maximum at the center of the patch with several peaks in the vegetation patch because the vegetation stems are aligned along the y direction for cases with high volume fraction the bottom shear stress decreases in the wake of the patch with a minimum and then increases and approaches the asymptotic value in bare channel outside of the patch scale recirculation zone for the case with intermediate volume fraction the bottom shear stress shows a smooth decrease in the wake and then reaches the asymptotic value by including the swaying motion the bottom shear stress increases by up to 4 with the maximum value at the shoulders of the patch the effect of the swaying motions on the bottom shear stress is not significant 5 4 drag force the time averaged non dimensional drag force acting on the solid cylinder within the array f 0 5 ρ u m e a n 2 d gives information on both the magnitude and orientation of the total drag force on a particular cylinder fig 17 the direction of the total drag force on a particular cylinder is a good indicator of the direction of the local flow in the gap between cylinders no significant difference is evident by including the swaying motion of the stems the solid volume fraction is greater than 5 in both cases and the patch behaves as a porous cylinder with formation of patch scale wake billows fig 13 the magnitude of the force acting on cylinders is largest at the leading edge of the patch cylinders 1 to 3 due to the direct exposure to the incoming flow large forces can also be observed on cylinders 8 and 12 where the separated shear layer forms with high velocity at the shoulders of the porous patch for both cases the bleeding flow within the porous patch has a lateral component which follows the separated shear layer the drag force on cylinders decreases away from the upstream side of the patch and the decay is more pronounced for the case with a larger solid volume fraction strong flow sheltering can be observed at the trailing edge of the vegetation patch where the drag forces are significantly smaller due to the small effective k c number in our simulations 5 5 application of sediment transport the large eddy simulation model resolves all the relevant turbulent eddies including wall generated turbulent eddies stem generated turbulent eddies and large patch scale turbulent eddies vegetation generated turbulent eddies are the main drivers of sediment transport in emergent vegetation canopy tinoco and coco 2013 yang et al 2016 in les models the bottom shear stress includes interactions of both wall generated and vegetation generated turbulent eddies with the sediment bed sediment transport pattern can therefore be directly linked with the spatial distribution of bottom shear stress predicted by les model in which regions with large bottom shear stress are more likely to be associated with erosion large bottom shear stress can be observed at the shoulders of the patch the shear stress is larger in the case with high solid volume fraction due to stronger flow blockage by the vegetation patch regions of large bottom shear stress can also be observed in the gaps between vegetation stems inside of the vegetation patch suggesting stronger sediment resuspension may occur in the vegetation canopy the shear stress in the vegetation canopy decreases away from the upstream leading edge of the patch in addition the area of regions with high bottom shear stress between vegetation stems is larger in the case of intermediate solid volume fraction fig 16b in classic sediment transport model rouse profile is widely used to model the transport of suspended sediment in the rouse model the shear stress profile is assumed to be linear following the logarithmic law of the velocity distribution and the turbulent diffusion is modeled by a parabolic profile hunter 1938 the rouse model is based on turbulent channel flow and only considers interactions of suspended sediment particles with wall generated turbulent eddies however in emergent vegetation canopy vegetation generated turbulence also plays an important role in the vertical distribution of suspended sediment at stem scale the swaying motion of vegetation stems significantly enhances the stem generated turbulence fig 8 and hence the turbulent diffusion at patch scale due to the small effective keulegan carpenter number the turbulence enhancement is not pronounced and mainly occurs in the wake a revisited suspended sediment transport model that considers vegetation generated turbulence needs to be developed to improve the prediction of suspended sediment transport in regions with emergent aquatic vegetation 6 conclusion a volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method was developed to study flow interactions with aquatic vegetation in which vegetation stems are modeled as porous solid objects the vpib method can be efficiently implemented in existing computational model framework with minimum effort with the implicit treatment of the source term the time step is not restricted by the penalty parameter the primary shortcoming of the vpib method is the smoothing of the sharp interface which affects the model accuracy on the boundary the model has been validated with data from laboratory experiment and previous high fidelity models of turbulent flow over a circular cylinder flow generated by an oscillating cylinder at low keulegan carpenter number and flow over circular patches of rigid cylinders with satisfactory model performance sensitivity analyzes of the penalty parameter and thickness parameter were carried out the optimal value of the thickness parameter was recommended based on the size of the computational grid the optimal value of penalty parameter should be chosen on a case by case basis effects of the swaying motion of vegetation on the hydrodynamics were investigated at both the stem and patch scale by forcing the stems with a simplified prescribed motion at stem scale we conducted simulations with three different keulegan carpenter numbers k c equals to 1 1 67 and 3 in which the keulegan carpenter number is defined as the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem to the diameter of the vegetation stem we observed the enhancement of the turbulent generation in the wake of the vegetation stem in all cases when the swaying motion is introduced in addition the swaying motions of stems resulted in more isotropic turbulence the time averaged bottom shear stress is only slightly enhanced around 5 at the shoulders of the stem by the swaying motion the effect is negligible in the wake this could be due to the prescribed motion of the vegetation stem which decreases to zero at the bed following a cubic law of the vertical elevation from the bed the time averaged drag coefficient based on the depth averaged flow velocity decreases with the keulegan carpenter number slightly due to flow sheltering from the self induced wake by the swaying motion we focused on steady currents over a dense vegetation patch which shields the water surface from wind for vegetation patch with intermediate or high solid volume fraction large patch scale wake billows form in the wake of the vegetation patch the hydrodynamics strongly depend on the solid volume fraction and the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size at high solid volume fraction the shedding frequency is similar to that of flow past a solid circular cylinder for both cases with rigid and swaying stems at intermediate solid volume fraction strouhal number peaks around 0 133 which is smaller than the value based on the vortex shedding frequency of a solid cylinder a second peak around the vortex shedding frequency appears in the case with rigid stems which is not evident in the case with swaying stems effects of the swaying motion on the patch scale velocity and turbulence statistics are not significant the swaying motion of vegetation stems enhances the size of the recirculation zone and the turbulence generation in the wake the enhancement in the streamwise component of the turbulent fluctuation is more pronounced compared to the spanwise and the vertical components the effects of swaying motion on turbulence generation are negligible outside of the wake the effect of swaying motion is insignificant for the bottom shear stress for the dense vegetation patch the patch scale hydrodynamics strongly depend the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size instead of the keulegan carpenter number based on stem size the effects of swaying motion on the patch scale hydrodynamics are not pronounced due to the small effective k c number the distribution of the time averaged drag coefficient on the vegetation stem in the canopy depends on the patch scale flow and the effect of swaying motion on the drag coefficient on individual stems is not pronounced again due to the small effective keulegan carpenter number credit authorship contribution statement xiao yu supervision conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

186,a volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method was developed to study flow interactions with aquatic vegetation the model has been validated with data from laboratory experiments and previous high fidelity models with satisfactory results sensitivity analyzes on both penalty parameter and thickness parameter were conducted and optimal values for these parameters are recommended the validated model has been applied to study the effects of swaying motion of vegetation stems on the flow dynamics at both vegetate stem scale and patch scale the swaying motion of the vegetation stem is prescribed following a cubic law that peaks at the top and decreases to zero at the bottom at stem scale the hydrodynamics depend on the keulegan carpenter number k c which is defined as the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem to the diameter of the stem simulations with three k c values were carried out for k c 1 the flow turbulence is significantly enhanced by the swaying motion of the stem and turbulence becomes more isotropic in the wake the swaying motion of vegetation stems caused a 5 increase of the bottom shear stress at the shoulders of the stem and the effect is negligible in the wake at patch scale the hydrodynamics depend on the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size of the vegetation patch and the solid volume fraction for dense vegetation canopy solid volume fraction was varied while maintaining the same effective keulegan carpenter in the simulations when the effective keulgen carpenter number is small k c 1 effects of the swaying motion of vegetation stems on the large patch scale dynamics are not significant including both the turbulence statistics and the bottom stress keywords immersed boundary method flow vegetation interactions vegetation patch scale hydrodynamics 1 introduction aquatic vegetation provides many important ecological services micheli and kirchner 2002 kremen 2005 including shoreline protection nursery areas for fish shellfish and crustaceans and water quality improvement aquatic vegetation stabilizes coastal shorelines prevents erosion and traps sediment to promote intertidal accretion to keep up with sea level rise however due to human activities gedan et al 2009 and the threat of sea level rise craft et al 2009 a large amount of aquatic vegetation has been lost in recent decades marani et al 2011 on the other hand aquatic vegetation has been widely used as cost effective coastal defense systems to protect coastal communities gedan et al 2011 against the increased storminess and accelerated sea level rise it is of critical importance to understand the hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in vegetated regions for aquatic vegetation conservation and restoration because the evolution of estuarine and coastal morphology in vegetated regions strongly depends on the interplays of flow vegetation and sediment accretion in emergent vegetation canopy plant stems fill the entire water column when flow enters the vegetation canopy the mean flow velocity is reduced by drag and sediment carried into the canopy starts to settle the additional drag exerted by plants is commonly parameterized by a friction coefficient which is an important parameter in large scale circulation models and storm surge models to accurately predict the flow attenuation in rivers and estuaries by vegetation on the other hand vortices shed from the plants can enhance the turbulence in vegetation canopy vegetation generated turbulent eddies could interact with sediment bed resuspend sediment and enhance sediment transport tinoco and coco 2013 yang et al 2016 at vegetation stem scale when flow passes a single isolated vegetation stem the formation of horseshoe vortex in front of the plant and the unsteady vortex shedding behind the plant are the key hydrodynamic processes numerical simulations and laboratory experiments zhao et al 2010 chen et al 2017 have been carried out to understand the flow structure and sediment transport around circular cylinders the entrainment and erosion of sediment near a circular cylinder strongly depend on the turbulence generation mechanisms due to complex interactions of both cylinder generated and wall generated turbulent eddies with the sediment bed accurate sediment transport model around a single vegetation stem represented by a circular cylinder has yet to be developed which is important for soil erosion control aquatic vegetation often grows in patches and heterogeneous plant forms understanding flow interactions with a patch of emergent vegetation including flow attenuation by vegetation turbulent mixing and sediment transport is of critical importance for natural resources management laboratory experiments zong and nepf 2012 shan et al 2020 and numerical simulations chang and constantinescu 2015 show that bleeding flow develops in a sparse vegetation canopy and large scale wake billows form in a dense vegetation canopy three distinct flow regimes have been identified by nicolle and eames 2011 based on the solid volume fraction s v f of vegetation at low solid volume fraction s v f 0 05 individual vegetation stems behave like isolated single stems at intermediate solid volume fraction 0 05 s v f 0 15 a shear layer is generated at the shoulder of the patch large scale wake billows are shed in the wake of the patch at high solid volume fraction s v f 0 15 the array of vegetation stems generates a wake in a similar way to a solid body of the same shape of the vegetation patch the sediment transport within and around the vegetation patch is directly linked with the hydrodynamic processes for sparse vegetation canopy the flow accelerates between vegetation stems and intensive erosion occurs within the canopy due to stem scale turbulence for dense vegetation canopy the large patch scale wake billows dominate the sediment transport leading to a scour hole around the patch process based models have been widely used to provide insights on interplays among flow vegetation and sediment most previous numerical model studies on flow and sediment transport in emergent vegetation canopy treat vegetation stems as regularly spaced or staggered rigid circular cylinders stoesser et al 2010 huai et al 2015 and only a few stems can be implemented due to the available computational resources however emergent vegetation stems are flexible and move back and forth by waves and wind which can stir water and possibly sediment in addition the spatial distribution of vegetation stems is heterogenous and the collective friction effects of vegetation due to drag play important roles in the dynamics with recent advancement in computational methods uhlmann 2005 lee and choi 2015 a massively parallel high fidelity model that can efficiently simulate flow interactions with moving deforming vegetation needs to be developed to model the fluid structure interaction two approaches have been developed one approach is to move the computational mesh to follow the motion of the solid object based on the relation between the motion of the computational grid and the motion of the fluid either lagrangian or eulerian framework is used in lagrangian framework the local fluid velocity is used to move the computational mesh in eulerian framework velocity on a separate fixed eulerian mesh is used to move the computational mesh the motion of the computational mesh can cause severely distorted mesh of poor quality under the lagrangian framework arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method hirt et al 1974 combines both lagrangian and eulerian framework after the explicit lagrangian update of the computational mesh with the updated solution a new mesh with better quality is defined by moving the mesh at a specified velocity and the lagrangian solution is transferred conservatively onto the new mesh berndt et al 2011 ale technique is easy to implement and accurate however for problems with large translations or rotations the computational mesh tends to be ill shaped which affects the accuracy of the solution in addition the remeshing can be expensive to compute the other approach is to not make any changes of the fluid mesh a widely used method is the immersed boundary ib method peskin 2002 the solid object interacts with the fluid through the local body forces applied to the fluid at the point locations at the fluid solid interface to enforce the boundary conditions at the solid surface one of the advantage of ib method is that the mesh generation is greatly simplified the generation of body fitting computational grid can be difficult for complex geometries and grid quality deteriorates with complexity of the geometry using unstructured grids for ib method block structured grids with local refinement can be used which are computationally efficient one of the drawbacks of ib method is the smear of the interface compared to the body fitting approach the counterpart of the ib method for finite element or spectral element methods is the fictitious domain method glowinski et al 1994 parussini and pediroda 2009 the coupling between the fluid and solid phase is done by constraining fluid and the solid body at the interface using a lagrangian multiplier that represents the body forces two approaches namely the direct forcing and the feedback forcing methods have been developed for the ib method mittal and iaccarino 2005 in the classical ib method peskin 2002 the direct forcing method lagrangian markers are used to describe the solid surface the ib methods use a distribution function to interpolate the fluid velocity from the eulerian fluid grids to the lagrangian markers to calculate the body force term tseng and ferziger 2003 the forcing is then spread from the lagrangian markers to the surrounding eulerian fluid grids via a smooth kernel function wang and liu 2004 to conserve the total force and torque different algorithms have been developed for both uniform and nonuniform eulerian grids akiki and balachandar 2016 the classical ib method is second order accurate at the solid surface the classical ib method poses a stiff problem and results in a small computational time step which severely restricts the simulation in addition the implementation of the ib method can be difficult and the accuracy of the method also depends on the distribution of lagrangian markers on the other hand the volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method a feedback forcing method simply represents solid bodies as porous medium with very small permeability and can be used in conjunction with high order numerical schemes kadoch et al 2012 piquet et al 2016 the implementation of the vpib method is of minimum effort by replacing the implementation of no slip boundary condition on the solid surface with a simple source term in the navier stokes equation the vpib method is also computationally more efficient without the need to calculate the coupling forcing terms between fluid and solid directly emergent vegetation is commonly modeled as rigid circular cylinder and the frictional dissipation due to vegetation is parameterized by a drag coefficient for marsh grass the reynolds number based on the stem size and current wave velocity is on the order of o 100 1000 for a single circular cylinder a drag coefficient around 1 is often used due to flow sheltering in vegetation canopy the drag coefficient also depends on the solid volume fraction nepf 1999 tanino and nepf 2008 augustin et al 2009 in natural environments emergent vegetation plants are flexible and they sway on wind the forced motion of the plant could stir the water column and affect the drag turbulent mixing and sediment transport on the other hand the marsh grass is stiff with a large cauchy number defined as the ratio of the elastic restoration force to the hydrodynamic drag force the movement of the vegetation stem is relatively small in this study we focus on the parameter range of small keulegan carpenter number which is defined as the ratio of the maximum excursion of the vegetation motion to the diameter of the vegetation stem a simplified prescribed motion of the vegetation is implemented to simulate the forced motion of the vegetation plant we focus on how the forced motion of vegetation affects the drag and turbulent mixing in the emergent vegetation canopy this paper is organized as follows first we present the governing equations for the volume penalization immersed boundary method and the numerical schemes next we extensively validate the method by comparing the numerical simulation results with data from previous laboratory experiments and high fidelity numerical simulations the validated model is then applied to investigate how a simplified prescribed swaying motion of vegetation affects flow turbulence and bed shear stress under steady current at both stem and patch scales 2 governing equation and numerical method in the volume penalization immersed boundary method the solid objects such as vegetation stems are modeled as porous media with low permeability the governing equations are given as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j α ε 1 u i u s i where ρ is the fluid density ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and p is the dynamic pressure x i u i and u s i are the i th component of the position vector fluid velocity vector and the solid object velocity vector i 1 2 3 represents the streamwise spanwise and vertical direction respectively the penalty parameter ε can be interpreted as permeability and a very small value is often implemented to find the optimal value for the penalty parameter ε a sensitivity analysis needs be conducted α is the mask function defined as 3 α x t 1 x ω s 0 x ω f where ω s is the solid phase and ω f is the fluid phase the no slip boundary conditions at the fluid solid interface are no longer included the solid object is represented by the mask function α to avoid numerical instabilities a smoothly transition of the mask function α at the solid liquid interface with values between 0 and 1 is required the thickness of the transition layer is defined by δ the thickness parameter δ measures the spreading of the influences from the solid structure such as forces or stresses to the fluid and is determined based on the grid spacing in the present work we use an analytical expression for the mask function which can be easily resampled on the fluid grid the 1d smoothed heaviside function is implemented as 4 h x 1 2 erf x x 0 δ 1 the smoothed heaviside function provides a good way to alleviate numerical instabilities at the sharp fluid solid interface the fluid solid interface is located at x 0 and the solid is at x x 0 for 3d problems the tensor product of 1d heaviside function is used at the fluid solid interface the sensitivity analysis of the thickness parameter δ needs to be conducted to determine the optimal value of δ in large eddy simulation les the large energy containing eddies are resolved and only small sub grid turbulent eddies are modeled with an appropriate subgrid closure les can accurately predict the unsteady vortex shedding of flow around solid object zedler and street 2001 kim et al 2004 in les the velocity is decomposed as u i u i u i with u i as the resolved velocity component and u i as the unresolved subgrid velocity component the governing equation with les turbulent closure can be written as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i τ i j x j α ε 1 u i u s i in which the shear stress τ i j is the sum of the viscous stress and turbulent stress following the boussinesq eddy viscosity assumption 7 τ i j 2 ν ν s g s s i j where ν s g s is the subgrid eddy viscosity and s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the strain rate tensor of the resolved velocity field eddy viscosity ν s g s is given by the wall adaptive local eddy wale model 8 ν t δ s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 with 9 δ s c w v c 1 3 10 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 11 g i j u i x j the constant c w is 0 325 and v c is the volume of the grid cell we implemented the volume penalization immersed boundary method in openfoam weller et al 1998 due to the small value of the penalization parameter ε the momentum equation is a stiff equation the explicit treatment of the source term ε 1 α u i u s i requires an extremely small time step of δ t ε engels et al 2015 to alleviate the computational demands the source term is modeled implicitly a second order upwind scheme is used as the spatial discretization the volume penalization ibm is only first order accurate in time and hence the first order backward euler method is used for time marching the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm is used to solve the filtered unsteady navier stokes equations the time step limited by the cfl criterion with the maximum cfl number of 0 5 for all simulations 3 model validation 3 1 turbulent flow over circular cylinder at re 3900 parnaudeau et al 2008 carried out experimental and les studies of the flow over a circular cylinder at reynolds number 3900 here we used the experimental data to validate the volume penalization immersed boundary vpib model for fully developed turbulent flow in terms of both the mean flow and turbulence statistics the incompressible navier stokes equations are solved on a regular cartesian grid the size of computational domain is 20 d by 10 d by π d in the streamwise x spanwise y and vertical z direction respectively in which d is the diameter of the circular cylinder a constant flow of u c is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain and outflow boundary condition is implemented at the exit the outflow boundary condition is a mixed boundary condition when the fluid flows out of the domain at the boundary the velocity gradient is set to zero when the fluid is flowing into the domain the flow velocity is set to zero so there is no backflow at the boundary periodic boundary conditions are applied in both the spanwise y and the vertical z directions the circular cylinder is located at 3 4 d downstream from the inlet and 5 d from the lateral boundaries a fixed time step is used with maximum cfl number below 0 5 uniform grid spacing was used in all three directions and the grid spacings in the horizontal directions are the same δ x δ y numerical simulations with three different grid resolutions were conducted by varying the ratio of cylinder diameter to the horizontal grid spacing d δ x the vertical grid resolution was kept the same for all three cases with δ z d 0 065 which is similar to the les simulation in parnaudeau et al 2008 we first ran each of the simulation for 50 eddy turnover times d u c to make sure the flow reached equilibrium the simulation was continued for another 50 eddy turnover time for data analysis the penalty parameter was kept the same for all three simulations d u c ε 25 000 and the thickness parameter δ was kept the same δ x δ 1 3 4 0 and 7 0 for the coarse medium and fine grid resolution respectively results from cases with medium resolution d δ x 24 and fine resolution d δ x 40 agree well with each other for the case with coarse resolution only 8 grid points were used in each horizontal directions d δ x 8 model results slightly over predicted the mean streamwise velocity near the shoulder of the circular cylinder in the wake fig 1a and under predicted the streamwise x component of the turbulent fluctuation fig 1b the medium grid resolution with d δ x 24 was used for further model validation and analysis previous studies of the volume penalization ibm method have evaluated the sensitivity of the penalty parameter ε and the thickness parameter δ with laminar flows and showed it is unlikely to find the optimal value of the penalty parameter ε in cases where no reference solution exists 9 in this study we focus on the model performance for fully developed turbulent flows at high reynolds number without reference solution fig 2 panel a and b show the comparison of simulation results with different penalty parameters with the same thickness parameter δ x δ 4 the penalty parameter is normalized as d u c ε because the flow through porous media depends on the incoming flow speed the flow through the porous media decreases with ε and converges with sufficient large d u c ε when the parameter ε is too large i e too permeable the model significantly under predicted the velocity defect in the wake fig 2a and the streamwise turbulent fluctuation fig 2b there is only a slight change from d u c ε 25 000 to 250 000 ideally a small value ε is preferred however the time step is restricted by ε even for the implicit scheme in this study d u c ε 25 000 is chosen fig 2 panels c and d show how the thickness parameter δ affects the model performance the thickness parameter depends on the grid spacing and is therefore normalized as δ x δ the penalty parameter is kept the same for all three simulations with small δ x δ or large δ the mask function spreads wider and hence the volume occupied by the solid object is expanded the model under predicts the velocity defect fig 2c in the wake and over predicts the streamwise turbulent fluctuation fig 2d due to the expansion of the solid object by the mask function the solid object in the simulation domain appears larger than the actual solid object the difference between δ x δ of 4 and 8 is not pronounced further increasing δ x δ can cause numerical instabilities at the fluid solid interface and the ratio δ x δ 4 8 is recommended in this study δ x δ 4 is chosen the vibm model is then validated against laboratory experiment data in detail the power spectrum of the velocity at numerical probe locations was used to obtain the shedding frequency the strouhal number from the les simulation is s t 0 21 compare to s t 0 208 0 001 from the hot wire laboratory experiment data of parnaudeau et al 2008 fig 3 shows the comparison of the vpib les model predictions of the streamwise x velocity with the laboratory experiment at three different downstream locations numerical model predicted the strong velocity defect in the recirculation region with a u shape close to the cylinder which evolves into a v shape profile further downstream the model slightly over predicted the mean velocity at x d 1 06 and x d 1 54 at the shoulder of the cylinder and under predicted the velocity defect in the wake at x d 2 02 the comparison of the spanwise y component velocity is presented in fig 3 panel b d and f the model results show a anti symmetry shape with respect to y 0 center of the cylinder model results agree reasonably well with the experiment data and previous les studies kravchenko and moin 2000 parnaudeau et al 2008 discrepancies at locations very close to the circular cylinder arise due to the smearing of the fluid solid interface by the immersed boundary method model results of the streamwise x component of the velocity fluctuation are compared with the laboratory experiment of parnaudeau et al 2008 symbols of and lourenco 1993 symbols in fig 4 at x d 1 06 the profile shows two strong peaks due to the transitional state of the shear layers the model underestimated these peaks compared to the laboratory experiment possibly due to smearing of the fluid solid interface again the model underpredicted the peak of the streamwise normal turbulent stress by about 50 at x d 1 06 and 20 at x d 1 54 at x d 1 06 these two peaks of the shear layer are overlapped by two large peaks and the model results agree well with experimental data the vpib method with les closure generates satisfactory results and can be used to study the turbulence generation mechanisms of emergent vegetation stems 3 2 flow over a patch of emergent vegetation aquatic vegetation often grows in patches flow interactions with a patch of emergent vegetation play important roles in the hydrodynamics how the solid volume fraction of the vegetation patch and the spatial arrangement of vegetation stems in the patch affect the hydrodynamics is one of the challenging research questions here we conducted a simulation of flow over a circular array of rigid circular cylinders to evaluate the model performance for flow over vegetation patches the length width and height of the computational domain are set to 15 d 10 d and π d respectively in which d is the diameter of the vegetation patch a constant flow of u is imposed at the inlet of the computational domain and a outlet boundary condition is implemented at the exit in the streamwise x direction periodic boundary condition is implemented in the vertical z direction open boundary condition with zero gradient of the velocity is implemented in the spanwise y direction the reynolds number based on the patch diameter and current velocity is r e d u d ν 10 000 the vegetation stem size is d 0 048 d the solid volume fraction is 0 023 with 10 stems and 0 05 with 21 stems in the circular patch three levels of grid refinement were used with the finest grid spacing of δ x δ y d 8 in the vegetation patch the coarsest grid spacing much away from the vegetation patch is close to d the grid resolution is similar to chang and constantinescu 2015 a fixed time step was chosen with c f l 0 5 after the solution became steady statistics were collected over 50 eddy turnover times d u model results have been compared with laboratory experiment data and previous les model results zong and nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 chang and constantinescu 2015 vibm model fig 5 shows satisfactory performance in terms of both the mean velocity u u and turbulence statistics the root mean square of the streamwise component of the velocity fluctuation u r m s u even with a relatively coarse resolution of d δ x 8 3 3 flow generated by an oscillating circular cylinder to evaluate the performance of vpib model for moving objects we conducted numerical simulations of flow generated by an oscillating cylinder at low keulegan carpenter number model results were compared with experimental data by dutsch et al 1998 the keulegan carpenter number is defined as 12 k c u m a x ω d where u m a x is the maximum velocity of the cylinder motion ω is the angular frequency of the oscillatory motion and d is the diameter of the cylinder we set up a two dimensional simulation with computational domain size of 55 d in the streamwise direction and 35 d in the spanwise direction open boundary conditions with zero gradient of velocities were implemented in both lateral directions the computational domain is sufficiently large so that the flow around the moving cylinder is not affected by the boundaries initially the circular cylinder is located at the center of the computational domain it oscillates with the time dependent velocity of u c y l u m a x cos ω t in x direction the reynolds number is 100 and the keulegan carpenter number k c is 5 cartesian grid with uniform size of δ x d δ y d 0 05 was implemented the permeability parameter was set to ε 1 0 5 s 1 in this simulation the thickness parameter δ was set to δ x δ 8 a fixed time step was used with the maximum cfl number below 0 5 fig 6 shows the comparison between model results and laboratory data at four different locations at wave phase ω t 0 when the cylinder is located at its origin the model predicts the u shaped velocity profile with two peaks near the edge of the cylinder at location x d 0 the u shaped velocity profile evolves into a v shaped profile at x d 0 6 which smooths out further downstream at x d 1 2 for spanwise velocity component the antisymmetry of velocity profile around y d 0 can be observed the model results agree well with laboratory experiment data and the vpib method is capable to capture flow interactions with moving objects 4 effect of swaying motion of vegetation on stem scale flow structures wetlands are highly complex environments with emergent vegetation that is rooted underwater but emerges through the air water interface on one hand emergent vegetation attenuates waves and shields the water surface from wind on the other hand emergent plants sway in wind because of wind plant interactions and stir the water column which could enhance turbulent mixing and sediment transport 4 1 simulation setup a single vegetation stem is placed in the turbulent channel flow the motion of the vegetation is mainly driven by the wind interaction with the part of the plant above the water and we prescribed the motion of the underwater part of vegetation for simplicity the vegetation stem is modeled as a cantilever beam with the force applied at the top of the submerged portion of the vegetation stem for stiff vegetation effects of hydrodynamic force on structure deformation could be negligible for simplicity we implemented a one way coupling scheme to model the fluid structure interaction only the displacement of the structure is transferred to the fluid solver and the fluid pressure acting on the structure is not transferred to the structure solver based on the elastic beam theory the deflection at any beam section is 13 δ x z f z 2 6 e i 3 h z where f is the magnitude of the force e is the young s modulus i is the area moment of inertia of the beam h is the water depth and δ x is the deflection of the beam at vertical elevation z the swaying motion is modeled by an oscillating force f t f m sin ω t with ω as the angular frequency in this study we use the maximum displacement δ m a x to characterize the stem motion as 14 δ x z t δ m a x sin ω t z 2 2 h 2 3 z h the velocity of the stem can therefore be derived as 15 u s z t ω δ m a x cos ω t z 2 2 h 2 3 z h the keulegan carpenter number is defined as k c u m a x ω d δ m a x d the size of the computational domain is 6 4 h 3 2 h h where h is the depth of the channel the computational domain is sufficiently large in both horizontal directions to contain the largest turbulent eddy periodic boundary conditions were implemented in both the streamwise x and spanwise y directions fig 7 the no slip boundary condition was applied at the bottom the free slip boundary condition was implemented at the top in which the gradient of the horizontal velocity components u and v is set to zero and the vertical component of the velocity w is set to zero uniform grids with two levels of grid refinement were used in the horizontal directions l 1 and l 2 in fig 7a the coarsest grid size is δ x h δ y h 0 02 and the finest grid is near the vegetation stem with δ x h δ y h 0 005 nonuniform grids are implemented in the vertical direction with the finest grid near the bottom and δ z m i n h 0 018 a constant pressure gradient is prescribed to drive the flow the reynolds number based on the friction velocity is r e τ u h ν 500 with u as the friction velocity a fixed time step is used with the maximum c f l number below 0 5 we first carried out the simulation without the vegetation stem to generate the fully developed turbulent channel flow after the simulation reached equilibrium with respect to the turbulence statistics we placed the swaying vegetation stem at the center of the computational domain x 0 and y 0 the penalty parameter is set to d ε u 25 000 and the thickness parameter is set to δ x δ 4 fig 7b shows the mask function for the vegetation stem and how the thickness parameter δ affects the mask function the vegetation stem size is d h 0 12 and 24 horizontal grid points are used to resolve flows around the stem we keep the angular frequency the same while varying the maximum displacement to get different k c we first run the simulation for 10 periods for model spin up then we continued the simulation for another 20 periods for data analysis 4 2 mean flow and turbulence statistics four probes were set up in the computational domain to examine the spatial patterns of the flow structure square symbols in fig 7a fig 8 shows the vertical profiles of the streamwise component of the mean velocity u and the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations along the center line y d 0 at x d 3 5 the mean velocity profiles show little variation above z h 0 4 in the wake near the wall the mean velocity first increases peaks around z h and then decreases the swaying motion of the cylinder has little influence on the mean velocity profiles fig 8a compared to the rigid case the root mean square of turbulent velocity fluctuations are significantly higher in the cases with swaying cylinders fig 8b d turbulent velocity fluctuations only increase slightly with k c because k c is greater than 1 for all cases at x d 18 3 along the centerline both the mean velocity and the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the rigid cylinder case are smaller than the cases with swaying cylinders fig 8e h the same pattern can be observed at x d 13 3 fig 8i l again the difference among the cases with swaying cylinders is not pronounced due to the range of k c used in this study at x d 13 3 and y d 12 7 fig 8m p the mean velocity in the case with a rigid cylinder is greater than the cases with a swaying cylinder and the spanwise component of the turbulent velocity fluctuation is smaller the streamwise and vertical components of turbulent fluctuations are only slightly affected by the swaying motion and the profiles collapse into a single curve the swaying motion of the cylinder could affect turbulent anisotropy fig 9 shows the turbulent coherent structures generated by the swaying cylinder the q criterion method jeong and hussain 1995 is used to visualize the turbulent coherent structures the horseshoe vortex in front of the stem and braided coherent structures in the wake persist at all phases at the peak ω t π 2 fig 9b when the displacement of the cylinder reaches its maximum the coherent structures are compressed in the wake because it moves in the same direction as the current during 0 ω t π 2 at the trough ω t 3 π 2 fig 9d the coherent structures are stretched in the wake because the cylinder moves in the opposite direction during π ω t 3 π 2 to characterize the turbulence anisotropy we conducted anisotropy invariant map analysis lumley 1978 simonsen and krogstad 2005 the non dimensional anisotropy tensor of the reynolds stress τ i j is defined as 16 b i j τ i j τ k k 1 3 δ i j in which δ is the kronecker delta for incompressible flow the second i i and third invariants i i i of the tensor b i j are used the origin indicates the isotropic turbulence i i i i i 0 fig 10 compares the anisotropy invariance mapping of two cases one with a rigid cylinder fig 10a and the other with a swaying cylinder fig 10b for both cases along the center line we observe the turbulence switches from the axisymmetric at x d 3 5 to two component at x d 13 3 also turbulence becomes more isotropic at the center of the domain away from the boundaries at x d 13 3 and y d 0 turbulence falls between two component and isotropic regimes with the swaying motion of the cylinder flow turbulence becomes more isotropic represented by clustered symbols around the origin the strong anisotropy of turbulence in the case of rigid cylinder suggests the classic reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach with two equation turbulence closure may fail to accurately predict the turbulent characteristics and hence the turbulent mixing due to the scalar eddy viscosity in the model the reynolds stress model rsm approach may work better with flow over emergent vegetation canopy 4 3 bottom shear stress fig 11a shows the time averaged bottom shear stress for the case with a rigid stem large eddy simulation resolves both wall generated turbulence and stem generated turbulence and hence the bottom shear stress includes interactions of both wall generated turbulent eddies and stem generated eddies with the bed regions of large bottom shear stress can be observed at shoulders of the stem in the wake of the stem a region with negative shear stress close to the stem exists followed by a region with large shear stress fig 11b shows the comparison of the spatially averaged bottom shear stress for all cases the bottom shear stress is averaged in the spanwise y direction and normalized by τ 0 ρ u 2 for all cases the bottom shear stress increases and peaks at the center of the stem then it decreases in the wake the bottom shear stress increases and reaches the asymptotic value in bare channel outside of the recirculation zone behind of the stem the bottom shear stress at the shoulders of the circular cylinder is around 5 larger in cases with a swaying cylinder compared to the case with a rigid stem suggesting enhanced erosion by the swaying motion of the vegetation stem because of the range of keulegan carpenter numbers k c 1 used in the study the difference between cases with a swaying cylinder is not pronounced a small increase of τ τ 0 can be observed in the wake of the cylinder for the case with the largest k c 4 4 drag force the hydrodynamic force acting on the vegetation stem can be computed by integrating the stress tensor including both the viscous stress and pressure over the surface 17 f τ n d a in which n is the unit surface normal vector in volume penalization immersed boundary method the stress tensor τ is continuous across the fluid solid interface and hence τ is interpolated at the interface to compute the drag force fig 12a shows the vertical profile of the time averaged drag coefficient c d f 0 5 ρ a u 2 the drag coefficient is calculated at the vertical elevation z z 1 z 2 2 the projected area in the flow direction is a d δ z with δ z z 2 z 1 and u is the depth averaged velocity results from cases with different k c show a similar pattern drag coefficient first increases with the vertical elevation z h approaches a constant value around 1 between z h of 0 2 and 0 6 and then drops towards the top of the domain the flow velocity past the cylinder is smaller in the bottom boundary layer than the depth averaged velocity so the drag coefficient is smaller in the bottom boundary layer the swaying motion of the cylinder generates a self induced wake zone that oscillates with the cylinder the wake is strongest at the top because the displacement is at its largest the flow sheltering due to the self induced wake generated by the swaying motion leads to the drag reduction overall the drag reduction increases with k c fig 12a the drag reduction also varies vertically close to the bottom the maximum displacement is relatively small compared to the stem size and the drag force is not significantly affected by the self induced wake of the swaying stem far away from the bottom effects of the self induced wake become increasingly important fig 12b and c show the phase averaged drag coefficient at two vertical elevations at z h 0 6 the peak of the drag coefficient occurs at ω t π when the velocity of the swaying cylinder reaches its peak the drag coefficient is symmetric at ω t π with a peaky crest and flat trough with k c 5 3 and 3 the drag coefficient does not vary much with k c 1 at z h 1 the variation of the drag coefficient within one wave cycle increases with k c the peak of the drag coefficient is not at ω t π anymore the phase lag might be due to the strong self induced wake of the cylinder 5 effect of swaying motion of vegetation on patch scale flow structures aquatic vegetation often form patches due to clonal growth sand jensen and madsen 1992 hydrodynamics over a patch of vegetation strongly depend on the patch properties including the solid volume fraction ϕ size and shape for a circular vegetation patch at low solid volume fraction ϕ 5 each individual stem behaves like an isolated vegetation stem nicolle and eames 2011 at intermediate to high solid volume fraction ϕ 0 05 patch scale wake billows form in the wake of the vegetation patch chang and constantinescu 2015 which is similar to the von karman vortex street behind a solid structure with the same size and shape we assume dense emergent vegetation shields the water surface from wind and attenuates surface waves only effects of swaying motion of vegetation on steady currents are investigated particularly we focus on how the swaying motions of vegetation stems affect the velocity structure and the turbulent transport in dense emergent vegetation canopies we conducted numerical simulations of flow over dense patches of vegetation the computation domain size is 6 4 h 3 2 h h where h is the channel height a nearly circular patch of vegetation consisted of 19 stems is located at the center of the domain the stems are regularly spaced in a hexagonal pattern and the centers of the circular cylinders are aligned along the y spanwise direction see 13a the diameter of the circular patch is set to d p h 0 8 the solid volume fraction is varied by changing the diameter of the vegetation stems two volume fractions were chosen as ϕ 11 75 intermediate and 32 65 high respectively simulations with both rigid and swaying vegetation stems were carried out to understand how the swaying motions affect the patch scale dynamics the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem δ m a x was set to 0 2 h for all simulations periodic boundary conditions were implemented in both the streamwise x and spanwise y directions the model setup can be interpreted as the flow over infinite arrays of regularly spaced circular patches at the bottom the no slip boundary condition was implemented free slip boundary condition was implemented at the top in which gradients of lateral velocities are set to zero and the vertical velocity is set to zero two levels of grid refinement were implemented with the finest grid of δ x h δ y h 0 005 one vegetation stem is resolved by 24 horizontal grids for the case with high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 and 16 horizontal grids for the case with intermediate solid volume fraction ϕ 11 75 a constant pressure gradient was implemented to drive the steady current and maintain the same mean velocity u m e a n the reynolds number based on the frictional velocity is r e τ 500 a constant time step was used with c f l 0 5 for all cases simulations with swaying vegetation reached the equilibrium in 10 wave cycles therefore the first 10 wave cycles of each simulation were model spin ups and not used for the analysis after spin up we continued the simulations for another 20 wave cycles to compute flow and turbulence statistics 5 1 flow kinematics fig 13 shows the instantaneous flow fields at different phases ω t 0 and 2 5 π at high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 the vegetation patch behaves like a solid cylinder at ω t 0 the recirculation zone in the case with swaying vegetation stems fig 13a and d is slightly larger compared to the case with rigid stems fig 13c and f at ω t 2 5 π the vegetation stems push the fluid forward and the wake structure varies strongly vertically fig 13e because the prescribed velocity of the stems increases with z h at intermediate solid fraction ϕ 11 75 similar patterns can be observed and the size of the recirculation zone is smaller than the case with larger solid volume fraction to examine how the swaying motion affects the patch scale vortex shedding we extracted the instantaneous spanwise y component velocity at x d p 2 25 and z h 0 25 upper panels in fig 14 show the time history of the spanwise velocity v and the energy spectrums are shown in the lower panels at high solid volume fraction the strouhal number peaks near s t 0 25 in both rigid and swaying cases and the shedding frequency is similar to that of flow past a solid circular cylinder for the case with swaying stems fig 14g we did not observe the peak at s t 0 1 which is the frequency of the swaying motion of individual stems the swaying motion does not affect the shedding frequency of the large patch scale eddies for cases with intermediate solid volume fraction fig 14f a peak around s t 0 13 can be identified a second peak around the second harmonic s t 0 26 can also be identified for the case with rigid stems with swaying stems the time history of the spanwise velocity shows a nonlinear saw tooth shape only a single peak at s t 0 133 can be identified in the normalized energy spectrum for all cases the 5 3 slope is evident suggesting the les model can resolve the inertial subrange reasonably well with given grid resolution 5 2 turbulence statistics at x d p 2 the flow is dominated by the large scale billows the frequency of the swaying motion does not show up as in fig 14 time average is therefore used to separate the mean velocity from the turbulent fluctuations instead of the phase average fig 15a shows the vertical profiles of the normalized mean stream velocity at y d p 1 9 the mean velocity profiles converge for cases with large volume fraction for cases with intermediate volume fraction the mean velocity is smaller with swaying stems at z h 0 5 for cases with high solid volume fraction all three turbulent fluctuation components are smaller when the swaying motions of the stems are included fig 15b to d for cases with intermediate solid volume fraction the spanwise component velocity fluctuation is significantly enhanced by the swaying motion of the stems fig 15c while both the streamwise component fig 15b and the vertical component fig 15d are attenuated along the center line y d p 0 large velocity defect of the mean velocity can be observed in the wake fig 15e the velocity defect is smaller for the case of intermediate solid volume fraction with swaying stems the swaying motion of the stems has little effect on the turbulent fluctuations for both cases fig 15f to h however the solid volume fraction significantly affects the spanwise and the vertical components of the turbulent fluctuations both of which increase with the solid volume fraction fig 15g and h dense vegetation patch behaves similar to a porous solid cylinder with a large patch scale wake an effective keulegan carpenter number can be defined as the ratio of the excursion δ m a x to the size of the patch d p which is k c 0 25 at low k c effects of the swaying motion of vegetation stems on turbulent generation is expected to be weak 5 3 bottom shear stress the time averaged normalized bottom shear stresses from cases with rigid stems are presented in fig 16 panel a and b regions with high bottom shear stress can be observed in the gaps between vegetation stems in both cases as well as the shoulders of the patch due to the formation of patch scale shear layer at the shoulders because the interstitial space in the case with low solid volume fraction is greater the averaged bottom shear stress decreases with increasing ϕ for dense vegetation patch the bottom shear stress decreases in the wake for both cases for the case with high solid volume fraction ϕ 32 65 a region with negative bottom shear stress at x d p 1 6 x h 1 3 can be observed in the wake of the patch the time averaged bottom shear stress fig 16c is averaged in the spanwise y direction and normalized by τ 0 ρ u 2 for all cases the bottom shear stress increases and reaches the maximum at the center of the patch with several peaks in the vegetation patch because the vegetation stems are aligned along the y direction for cases with high volume fraction the bottom shear stress decreases in the wake of the patch with a minimum and then increases and approaches the asymptotic value in bare channel outside of the patch scale recirculation zone for the case with intermediate volume fraction the bottom shear stress shows a smooth decrease in the wake and then reaches the asymptotic value by including the swaying motion the bottom shear stress increases by up to 4 with the maximum value at the shoulders of the patch the effect of the swaying motions on the bottom shear stress is not significant 5 4 drag force the time averaged non dimensional drag force acting on the solid cylinder within the array f 0 5 ρ u m e a n 2 d gives information on both the magnitude and orientation of the total drag force on a particular cylinder fig 17 the direction of the total drag force on a particular cylinder is a good indicator of the direction of the local flow in the gap between cylinders no significant difference is evident by including the swaying motion of the stems the solid volume fraction is greater than 5 in both cases and the patch behaves as a porous cylinder with formation of patch scale wake billows fig 13 the magnitude of the force acting on cylinders is largest at the leading edge of the patch cylinders 1 to 3 due to the direct exposure to the incoming flow large forces can also be observed on cylinders 8 and 12 where the separated shear layer forms with high velocity at the shoulders of the porous patch for both cases the bleeding flow within the porous patch has a lateral component which follows the separated shear layer the drag force on cylinders decreases away from the upstream side of the patch and the decay is more pronounced for the case with a larger solid volume fraction strong flow sheltering can be observed at the trailing edge of the vegetation patch where the drag forces are significantly smaller due to the small effective k c number in our simulations 5 5 application of sediment transport the large eddy simulation model resolves all the relevant turbulent eddies including wall generated turbulent eddies stem generated turbulent eddies and large patch scale turbulent eddies vegetation generated turbulent eddies are the main drivers of sediment transport in emergent vegetation canopy tinoco and coco 2013 yang et al 2016 in les models the bottom shear stress includes interactions of both wall generated and vegetation generated turbulent eddies with the sediment bed sediment transport pattern can therefore be directly linked with the spatial distribution of bottom shear stress predicted by les model in which regions with large bottom shear stress are more likely to be associated with erosion large bottom shear stress can be observed at the shoulders of the patch the shear stress is larger in the case with high solid volume fraction due to stronger flow blockage by the vegetation patch regions of large bottom shear stress can also be observed in the gaps between vegetation stems inside of the vegetation patch suggesting stronger sediment resuspension may occur in the vegetation canopy the shear stress in the vegetation canopy decreases away from the upstream leading edge of the patch in addition the area of regions with high bottom shear stress between vegetation stems is larger in the case of intermediate solid volume fraction fig 16b in classic sediment transport model rouse profile is widely used to model the transport of suspended sediment in the rouse model the shear stress profile is assumed to be linear following the logarithmic law of the velocity distribution and the turbulent diffusion is modeled by a parabolic profile hunter 1938 the rouse model is based on turbulent channel flow and only considers interactions of suspended sediment particles with wall generated turbulent eddies however in emergent vegetation canopy vegetation generated turbulence also plays an important role in the vertical distribution of suspended sediment at stem scale the swaying motion of vegetation stems significantly enhances the stem generated turbulence fig 8 and hence the turbulent diffusion at patch scale due to the small effective keulegan carpenter number the turbulence enhancement is not pronounced and mainly occurs in the wake a revisited suspended sediment transport model that considers vegetation generated turbulence needs to be developed to improve the prediction of suspended sediment transport in regions with emergent aquatic vegetation 6 conclusion a volume penalization immersed boundary vpib method was developed to study flow interactions with aquatic vegetation in which vegetation stems are modeled as porous solid objects the vpib method can be efficiently implemented in existing computational model framework with minimum effort with the implicit treatment of the source term the time step is not restricted by the penalty parameter the primary shortcoming of the vpib method is the smoothing of the sharp interface which affects the model accuracy on the boundary the model has been validated with data from laboratory experiment and previous high fidelity models of turbulent flow over a circular cylinder flow generated by an oscillating cylinder at low keulegan carpenter number and flow over circular patches of rigid cylinders with satisfactory model performance sensitivity analyzes of the penalty parameter and thickness parameter were carried out the optimal value of the thickness parameter was recommended based on the size of the computational grid the optimal value of penalty parameter should be chosen on a case by case basis effects of the swaying motion of vegetation on the hydrodynamics were investigated at both the stem and patch scale by forcing the stems with a simplified prescribed motion at stem scale we conducted simulations with three different keulegan carpenter numbers k c equals to 1 1 67 and 3 in which the keulegan carpenter number is defined as the maximum excursion of the vegetation stem to the diameter of the vegetation stem we observed the enhancement of the turbulent generation in the wake of the vegetation stem in all cases when the swaying motion is introduced in addition the swaying motions of stems resulted in more isotropic turbulence the time averaged bottom shear stress is only slightly enhanced around 5 at the shoulders of the stem by the swaying motion the effect is negligible in the wake this could be due to the prescribed motion of the vegetation stem which decreases to zero at the bed following a cubic law of the vertical elevation from the bed the time averaged drag coefficient based on the depth averaged flow velocity decreases with the keulegan carpenter number slightly due to flow sheltering from the self induced wake by the swaying motion we focused on steady currents over a dense vegetation patch which shields the water surface from wind for vegetation patch with intermediate or high solid volume fraction large patch scale wake billows form in the wake of the vegetation patch the hydrodynamics strongly depend on the solid volume fraction and the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size at high solid volume fraction the shedding frequency is similar to that of flow past a solid circular cylinder for both cases with rigid and swaying stems at intermediate solid volume fraction strouhal number peaks around 0 133 which is smaller than the value based on the vortex shedding frequency of a solid cylinder a second peak around the vortex shedding frequency appears in the case with rigid stems which is not evident in the case with swaying stems effects of the swaying motion on the patch scale velocity and turbulence statistics are not significant the swaying motion of vegetation stems enhances the size of the recirculation zone and the turbulence generation in the wake the enhancement in the streamwise component of the turbulent fluctuation is more pronounced compared to the spanwise and the vertical components the effects of swaying motion on turbulence generation are negligible outside of the wake the effect of swaying motion is insignificant for the bottom shear stress for the dense vegetation patch the patch scale hydrodynamics strongly depend the effective keulegan carpenter number based on the patch size instead of the keulegan carpenter number based on stem size the effects of swaying motion on the patch scale hydrodynamics are not pronounced due to the small effective k c number the distribution of the time averaged drag coefficient on the vegetation stem in the canopy depends on the patch scale flow and the effect of swaying motion on the drag coefficient on individual stems is not pronounced again due to the small effective keulegan carpenter number credit authorship contribution statement xiao yu supervision conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

187,understanding the effect of sample size on hydraulic characteristics of porous media and estimating their scale dependent properties have been challenging in subsurface hydrology an empirical power law relationship has been widely applied to link permeability k to sample volume however due to its empiricism accurately estimating the scale dependence of permeability k l in soils and rocks has remained unanswered in this paper we combine concepts of percolation theory and finite size effect develop a theoretical relationship to model k l and evaluate the proposed model using various types of porous media to estimate k l one requires porosity critical porosity critical scaling exponent a fundamental length scale system length and permeability determined at the smallest scale comparison with numerical simulations shows that incorporating effects of porosity and finite size results in accurate estimates of k l we find reasonable agreement between the theory and the simulations with average relative error ranged between 27 5 and 10 2 keywords finite size effect percolation theory permeability porosity scale dependence 1 introduction the effect of scale or sample volume on hydraulic and hydrologic properties of porous media has been known for decades in subsurface hydrology abidoye and das 2014 fernàndez garcia et al 2005 meile and tuncay 2006 taylor and howard 1987 such an effect even became more important in the past years due to capabilities in measurements or simulations across a wide range of scales e g from single fracture qian et al 2007 to globe gleeson et al 2014 although it is evident that the origin of scale dependency is the presence of spatial heterogeneity at various scales bear and corapcioglu 1987 nordahl and ringrose 2008 we are still far from fully understanding how hydraulic properties of soils and rocks such as porosity permeability and dispersivity may vary with scale numerous studies investigated the scale dependence of permeability of porous media experimentally garbesi et al 1996 javaux and vanclooster 2006 sánchez vila et al 1996 schulze makuch et al 1999 or numerically bazaikin et al 2017 han et al 2021 yoon and dewers 2013 zhang et al 2000 for instance mostaghimi et al 2013 studied the effect of image size on porosity specific surface area and permeability in different types of media including consolidated and unconsolidated porous rocks they demonstrated that by increasing heterogeneity the size of representative elementary volume rev increased mostaghimi et al 2013 also showed that the value of permeability based rev was up to twice as large as those based on porosity or specific surface area we should point out that accurate determination of rev requires simulations on high resolution images the effect of resolution on numerical simulations has been addressed in the literature alyafei et al 2015 guan et al 2019 pot et al 2020 although it is well documented that experimental measurements and numerical simulations are scale dependent only a few models have been developed in the literature to characterize the scale dependence of hydraulic properties of porous media a widely used model is a power law relationship i e k v s m relating permeability k to sample volume v s through an empirical exponent m schulze makuch et al 1999 in another study ghanbarian et al 2015 applied machine learning and the contrast pattern aided regression cpxr approach to develop scale dependent regression based relationships and estimate permeability from other soil properties those authors showed that including sample dimensions i e sample internal diameter and height improved permeability estimations substantially however such relationships and the power law model k v s m are purely empirical and because of their empiricism the interpretation of their parameters e g m and their variations from one medium to another is not clear hunt 2006 proposed a theoretical model based on concepts of percolation theory and power law pore throat radius distribution he compared theoretical estimations from his model with experimental data of schulze makuch 1996 collected from various sites within a carbonate rock aquifer in southeastern wisconsin and found generally well agreement in the ingenious scale dependent permeability model of hunt 2006 it is assumed that pore throat radius distribution follows the power law probability density function furthermore his model scales down permeability using its rev value while typically upscaling permeability is desired recently esmaeilpour et al 2021 generalized the hunt s approach to be independent of the shape of pore throat radius distribution and compared their generalized model with pore network simulations they found that their model estimated the scale dependence of permeability accurately from pore throat radius distribution with average relative error ranged between 3 7 and 3 8 the approach proposed by hunt 2006 and followed by esmaeilpour et al 2021 however requires detailed information on pore throat radius distribution in addition both models predict that permeability k should increase with the increase in scale or sample volume in accord with some experimental measurements pachepsky et al 2014 schulze makuch et al 1999 tinni et al 2012 on the contrary some numerical simulations sahimi et al 1986 shamsi et al 2020 tahmasebi et al 2016 appear to imply the opposite in this study we propose a theory and show that both increasing and decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability is theoretically supported the main objectives of this study therefore are to 1 develop a theoretical model by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size 2 demonstrate that permeability may increase or decrease with scale depending on the model parameters and 3 evaluate the proposed model using different types of porous media 2 theory there exist several theoretical frameworks through which one may relate permeability of a porous medium to its porosity such as the bundle of capillary tubes approach costa 2006 and percolation theory hunt et al 2014 sahimi 2011 in contrast to capillary bundle models percolation theory takes the effect of interconnectivity into account to model flow and transport in porous media although early models were developed based on regular lattices stauffer and aharony 1994 over the past decades percolation theory was successfully adopted and applied to real porous media such as soils rocks and fracture networks berkowitz and ewing 1998 hunt and sahimi 2017 king and masihi 2018 a fundamental concept in percolation theory is the existence of a critical occupation fraction above which permeability is related to occupation fraction p and its critical value p c as follows stauffer and aharony 1994 1 k p p c t where t is the critical scaling exponent for permeability the exponent t depends on the broadness of bond conductance distribution feng et al 1987 kogut and straley 1979 and therefore its value changes from one medium to another however if the bond conductance distribution is narrow enough in random and short range correlated media the exponent t would be universal and its value is 1 3 in two dimensions and 2 in three dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 the critical occupation fraction p c in eq 1 represents the percolation threshold of an infinitely large system pc based on the finite size scaling theory of fisher 1971 followed by levinshtein et al 1976 one should expect the finite size of a system causes a shift in the critical occupation fraction as follows 2 p c p c l a l 1 ν where pc l is the critical occupation fraction for a system of finite size l ν is the universal critical exponent scaling the correlation length and its value is 1 33 and 0 88 in two and three dimensions respectively stauffer and aharony 1994 in eq 2 the prefactor a is about 0 3 for the square lattice and 0 9 for the cubic lattice according to monte carlo simulations nakanishi and stanley 1980 to apply eq 1 to porous media one should replace p and p c with porosity φ and its critical value φ c accordingly permeability is related to porosity with the equation 3 k ϕ ϕ c t eq 3 is defined for media that are infinitely large in practice however the size of samples in experimental measurements or domains in numerical simulations is finite in the percolation theory framework the correlation length χ provides a measure of the largest length scale above which the system is macroscopically homogeneous l χ however when the system size l is less than the correlation length l χ the system is heterogeneous the correlation length of a porous medium may be defined as χ c φ φ c ν hunt et al 2014 in which c represents a fundamental length scale in the medium a numerical prefactor linking the correlation length χ to φ φ c theoretically near the critical porosity φ φ c the correlation length exceeds the system size and becomes the dominant length scale however for finite sized systems it is not possible to approach to the critical porosity closer than the value of porosity for which l χ instead one may set the system size equal to the correlation length l χ and then calculate an associated value of porosity φ to account for the effect of finite size accordingly all φ values ranged between φ c and φ correspond to χ l and cannot be detected in a system as small as the size of interest using this terminology the sensitivity of the system to small changes in φ near φ c is eliminated however very strong dependence on the system size emerges one may simply devise an expression for the permeability by taking the finite size effect c l 1 ν into eq 3 as follows 4 k ϕ ϕ c c l 1 ν t the value of c is 0 85 based on the monte carlo simulations of kapitulnik et al 1983 a similar modification to model the scale dependence of tortuosity was proposed by ghanbarian et al 2013 who successfully evaluated it by comparing with experiments and simulations in the limit l k follows the power law given by eq 3 as porosity approaches its critical value φ φ c permeability becomes dependent on system length and thus eq 4 reduces to the simple power law k l t ν which is in accord with the finite size scaling analysis stauffer and aharony 1994 normalizing eq 4 yields 5 k l k l m i n ϕ l ϕ c l c l l 1 ν ϕ l m i n ϕ c l m i n c l m i n l m i n 1 ν t where lmin represents the smallest scale at which permeability porosity and critical porosity are determined eq 5 holds in isotropic porous media if and only if the exponent t scaling permeability with porosity does not vary with scale in our theoretical model the spatial heterogeneity across pore and core scales is characterized via parameters porosity φ critical porosity φ c critical scaling exponent t and fundamental length scale c we show that interactions of such parameters lead to an increasing or decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability in accord with numerical simulations at pore and core scales to estimate the scale dependence of permeability via eq 5 one needs porosity φ critical porosity φ c and fundamental length scale c determined across scales as well as permeability at the smallest scale k lmin the exponent t can be calculated from pore throat radius distribution feng et al 1987 kogut and straley 1979 if available or from porosity and permeability measurements by fitting eq 3 to data by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size we demonstrate that eq 5 accurately estimates the scale dependence of permeability in different types of porous media 3 materials and methods in this section we first briefly describe numerical simulations collected from the literature and then explain how the critical porosity φ c and critical scaling exponent t are determined from porosity and permeability data the interested reader is referred to the original publications for further detailed information 3 1 numerical simulations sahimi et al 1986 sahimi et al 1986 simulated fluid flow in a two dimensional network composed of cylindrical pore throats of the same length but various radii the pore throat radius distribution followed the one parameter rayleigh probability density function those authors computed the steady state pressure distribution in the entire network by solving a standard kirchhoff law formulation sahimi et al 1986 calculated the average velocity of flow in each pore throat from the pressure distribution and then computed the permeability at different network sizes i e 15 15 30 30 40 40 50 50 and 60 60 in their simulations l represents the system length in units of the pore throat length the permeability of the 15 15 network was averaged over 40 iterations while those of other sizes over 10 iterations the percolation threhsold for an infinitely large square lattice is 0 5 pc 0 5 however sahimi et al 1986 carried out their simulations on lattices with finite sizes accordingly we corrected the percolation threshold using eq 2 by determinging pc l from pc 0 5 ν 1 33 stauffer and aharony 1994 and a 0 3 nakanishi and stanley 1980 sahimi et al 1986 stated that they conducted their simulations near the percolation threshold we approximately set p 0 52 in our analyses we also used t 1 3 the universal value in two dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 to estimate the scale dependence of permeability gao et al 2014 gao et al 2014 collected a typical tight sandstone sample from sulige gas field in changqing oilfield china after cleaning the sample porosity and permeability were experimentally measured then the core sample was imaged using a μ ct x ray scanner at a physical resolution of 3 4 μm to study the effect of scale six subsamples of various voxel sizes from 100 to 600 340 to 2040 μm were extracted from the entire 3d image to minimize uncertainties gao et al 2014 extracted six images for subsample of size 100 four for 200 and 300 three for 400 and two for 500 and 600 they reported the average values of porosity pore body radius pore throat length pore coordination number and permeability in their table 1 subsample images were first filtered by the non local means method and then thresholded by the watershed segmentation method next the pore networks were derived for which porosity and permeability were numerically computed berg et al 2016 berg et al 2016 investigated the representative elementary volume rev analysis of a gildehauser sandstone sample they numerically determined the values of porosity and permeability on μ ct image of various sizes i e l 154 307 615 1233 and 2465 μm on cylindrical samples of 4 mm diameter and 10 mm length berg et al 2016 experimentally found an average porosity of 20 and a permeability of 1 5 darcies their rev results showed that the sample size of 4 mm diameter was larger than the rev they also indicated that although for porosity the computed value became independent of the scale for images sizes larger than the rev for permeability it was not the case gerke and karsanina 2021 gerke karsanina 2021 collected two undisturbed core samples at two different depths indicated by high and low from ah and b horizons in russia overall eight samples were imaged using the x ray microtomography method under field moisture conditions with a resolution of 15 85 μm the stokes equation for creeping flow was solved using a finite difference approach and permeability was computed based on darcy s law along the major directions i e x y and z axes we calculated the geometric mean of the simulated k x k y k z values to determine the effective permeability for all samples except ah 2 high and ah 2 low in these two samples the effect of anisotropy seems to be significant therefore the effective permeability was determined by taking the geometric mean of only k x and k z values 3 2 determining the exponent t for the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 we set t 1 3 the universal scaling exponent in two dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 for the rest of the simulations to calculate the critical scaling exponent t the critical porosity was first estimated for each medium using the approximation φ c 0 1φ proposed by hunt 2004 permeability was then plotted against φ φ c and eq 3 was fitted to the data for samples b 2 high and b 2 low the trend between k and φ φ c was not monotonically increasing accordingly we selected a portion intermediate part of the data with an increasing trend to optimize the exponent t for these two samples to compare the theoretical estimations via eq 5 with the numerical simulations we assume that the parameter c does not vary with the scale and set it equal to 0 85 kapitulnik et al 1983 3 3 model evaluation to evaluate the performance of the proposed scale dependent permeability model eq 5 we calculated the average relative error and root mean square error rmse as follows 6 a v e r e 1 n i 1 n x e s t x s i m x s i m i 100 7 r m s e i 1 n x e s t x s i m i 2 n where x est and x sim are the estimated and simulated permeability values respectively and n is the number of data points 4 results in what follows we first demonstrate that the permeability may increase or decrease with the scale depending on the parameters φ φ c and c we then present the results of comparing the estimations by eq 5 with the numerical simulations for different types of porous media recall that we set φ c 0 1φ ν 0 88 and c 0 85 for all cases the exponent t was determined by directly fitting eq 3 to the porosity permeability data and its value is reported in fig 3 for each dataset 4 1 increasing and decreasing trend in scale dependent permeability fig 1 shows the scale dependent permeability determined via eq 5 against the system length with arbitrary units l for various conditions in all cases we set ν 0 88 and t 2 the universal values in three dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 in fig 1a φ c 0 03 c 0 85 and φ increases from 0 15 at the smallest scale l min 2 to 0 55 at the largest scale l max 131 072 is constant and equal to 0 15 or decreases from 0 15 at l min to 0 07 at l max for the increasing porosity case shown in blue k decreases with increasing l at small scales l 16 while its value increases with the system length for l 16 this is because the porosity term i e φ φ c becomes dominant compared to the finite size term i e c l 1 ν at larger scales fig 1a also shows that if the porosity does not change with the scale shown in black the normalized permeability becomes constant after reaching the rev however if the porosity decreases with the scale k l k lmin keeps decreasing as the system size increases shown in red in fig 1b φ 0 15 c 0 85 and φ c increases from 0 03 at l min 2 arbitrary units to 0 11 at l max 131 072 arbitrary units is constant and equal to 0 03 or decreases from 0 03 at l min to 0 014 at l max for constant critical porosity shown in black k l k lmin becomes constant at l 1024 however when the critical porosity decreases with the scale shown in red the permeability decreases for 2 l 128 remains constant for 128 l 1024 and then slightly increases for l 1024 fig 1b if the value of critical porosity increases as the scale increases shown in blue k l k lmin keeps decreasing with increasing the system size in fig 1c φ 0 15 φ c 0 03 and c increases from 0 85 at l min 2 arbitrary units to 16 85 at l max 131 072 arbitrary units is constant and equal to 0 85 or decreases from 0 85 at l min to 0 05 at l max fig 1c shows that the effect of variation in the parameter c is more profound at the smaller system sizes results for constant c and decreasing c are nearly the same the permeability decreases with the scale and then reaches the rev l 1024 however for the increasing c shown in blue the permeability first increases as the system size increases 2 l 4 and then decreases until reaching the rev l 4096 fig 1d presents integrated results for the increasing constant and decreasing trends in parameters φ φ c and c for example the increasing trend shown in blue corresponds to increase in such parameters with the scale as can be seen permeability first increases where the term c l 1 ν is dominant then decreases and next increases again with the scale this trend in the scale dependence of permeability is similar to those reported by bear corapcioglu 1987 and nordahl ringrose 2008 this means as long as parameters φ φ c and c vary with the scale e g due to spatial heterogeneity one should expect permeability to change with increase in system size fig 1 clearly demonstrates that one should theoretically expect the permeability to increase or decrease with the system size depending on the values of the parameters φ φ c and c comparing figs 1a and 1c with fig 1b displays that the influence of φ and c on the scale dependence of permeability is more than that of φ c fig 1 also shows that the effect of the fundamental length scale c is more profound than that of porosity φ at smaller system sizes however the impact of φ becomes more important at larger system sizes where the term c l 1 ν becomes small compared to φ φ c in what follow we show that the increasing and decreasing trends in the scale dependent permeability can be accurately estimated via eq 5 if the critical porosity φ c and the critical scaling exponent t are approximated well 4 1 comparison with sahimi et al 1986 simulations in fig 2 a we present the results of comparing eq 5 with t 1 3 to the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 the black line indicates the estimations when the percolation threshold was corrected for the effect of finite size using eq 2 while the red line represents no corrections eq 2 returned pc l 15 0 46 and pc l 60 0 49 the latter however is not greatly different from pc 0 5 based on the reported average relative error and rmse values correcting the percolation threshold resulted in more accurate estimates of scale dependent permeability however to correct the critical porosity for the finite size effect and apply eq 2 to real porous media one needs φ c and the constant a which may not be always known one should expect the value of a to vary from one sample to another for example liu regenauer lieb 2021 analyzed four carbonate rock samples and found 0 24 a 478 6 deduced from their fig 28 fig 2b shows the estimations via eq 5 with t 1 3 by only incorporating the effect of finite size i e k l k lmin lmin l t ν although the permeability was slightly underestimated the performance of the model is reasonably well with average relative error of 12 3 and rmse 0 058 this is because sahimi et al 1986 conducted their simulations above but near the percolation threshold comparing the average relative error and rmse values reported in fig 2b with those given in fig 2a indicates the importance of incorporating effects of both occupation probability p or porosity φ and finite size on the estimation of scale dependent permeability 4 2 comparison with gao et al 2014 simulations for the simulations of gao et al 2014 we found t 4 41 based on the trend between normalized permeability and porosity minus critical porosity as shown in fig 3 a eq 5 with t 4 41 c 0 85 and ν 0 88 resulted in the estimations that match the simulated permeabilities reasonably well we found the average relative error of 27 45 and rmse of 0 285 fig 4 a which are greater than those reported in fig 2 in this set of simulations although the porosity decreases from 4 63 at l 100 340 μm to 2 56 at l 300 1020 μm the normalized permeability first increases and then decreases the increasing trend in the permeability at the smaller scales is most probably because the average pore radius increased from nearly 5 5 μm at l 100 340 μm to 7 μm at l 200 680 μm see fig 4 of gao et al 2014 while porosity decreased from 4 63 to 4 04 in our terminology the effect of pore sizes and their distribution is indirectly incorporated in the exponent t as stated earlier eq 5 holds if pore throat radius distribution does not substantially change with scale if it does one value of t may not appropriately scale permeability with porosity across different system sizes the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν that does not incorporate the effect of porosity resulted in substantial underestimations not shown with the average relative error 78 26 and rmse 0 474 this is because this equation is valid at the percolation threshold where permeability is independent of porosity although fig 2b shows reasonable estimations of permeability above but near the percolation threshold for the sahimi et al 1986 simulations one should expect the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν to underestimate permeability far above the percolation threshold e g φ φ c 4 3 comparison with berg et al 2016 simulations the normalized permeability against the porosity minus the critical porosity is displayed in fig 3b for the simulations of berg et al 2016 we found t 3 74 with r2 0 89 using t 3 74 c 0 85 and ν 0 88 we estimated the scale dependence of permeability via eq 5 results presented in fig 4b show that the proposed model estimated the scale dependent permeability accurately with average relative error of 7 45 and rmse of 0 078 interestingly our model precisely predicted the sharp decrease in the permeability at the smaller scales and slight increase at the larger scales to explore which parameter φ or c contributes to such a sharp reduction in the k at the smaller system lengths fig 4b we first set c 0 in eq 5 to eliminate the effect of finite size and then estimated the permeability we found that the average relative error and rmse values increased to 10 9 overestimation on average and 0 088 respectively we also estimated the scale dependence of permeability by only incorporating the finite size effect using the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν φ φ c in eq 5 results not shown indicated significant underestimations with average relative error 77 72 which is substantially more negative than that we found for the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 and rmse 0 362 this is probably because sahimi et al 1986 simulated permeability near the percolation threshold while berg et al 2016 far above that recall that right at the percolation threshold one should expect that permeability to scale with system length as k l t ν results revealed that for the berg et al 2016 dataset φ has more profound impact on k l than the fundamental length scale c and the sharp decrease in the permeability is because of the substantial reduction in the porosity from 0 229 at l 154 μm to 0 179 at l 307 μm 4 4 comparison with gerke and karsanina 2021 simulations results of optimizing the scaling exponent t are presented in figs 3c j for samples ah 1 high ah 1 low ah 2 high ah 2 low b 1 high b 1 low b 2 high and b 2 low respectively for sample b 1 low we found t 1 67 fig 3h and for b 2 high t 1 35 fig 3i t values less than 2 were also reported in carbonate rocks by liu et al 2014 theoretically t 2 the universal value in three dimensions is supported in media with long range correlation sahimi and mukhopadhyay 1996 we should note that in random or short range correlated media if the critical porosity is overestimated one should expect the exponent t to be underestimated this however is not the case for samples b 1 low and b 2 high because setting φ c 0 did not change the optimized t values figs 4c j show the estimated and simulated k l values for eight samples analyzed by gerke karsanina 2021 as can be seen eq 5 with c 0 85 and φ c 0 1φ estimated the scale dependence of permeability accurately we found that the average relative error ranged from 2 03 ah 1 low to 11 08 b 2 low and rmse from 0 021 ah 1 low to 0 113 b 2 low indicating well agreement between the theory and the simulations we also found that neglecting the effect of porosity led to substantial underestimations of scale dependent permeability results not shown using k l k lmin lmin l t ν resulted in average relative error between 87 7 for sample ah 1 high and 44 6 for sample b 2 high which highlights the effect of porosity on the estimation of k l to study the effect of finite size on the results we set c 0 in eq 5 and estimated k l k l min for all samples in this dataset both the average relative error and rmse values insignificantly increased results not shown the average relative error ranged between 2 06 and 11 12 and rmse between 0 021 and 0 114 this is because the fundamental length scale c 0 85 is substantially less than the system size in this dataset making the term c l 1 ν very small the increasing or decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability is a function of several parameters in eq 5 i e φ φ c c and t φ c was estimated from φ φ c 0 1φ using the hunt 2004 approach and t was determined by fitting eq 3 to the porosity permeability data in our analyses accordingly the balance between the two terms φ φ c or 0 9φ and c l 1 ν played a crucial rule for large system sizes where l c the term c l 1 ν becomes negligible compared to φ φ c and thus the scale dependence of permeability is essentially controlled by the effect of porosity and its trend with the scale for small system sizes where l c the term c l 1 ν dominates φ φ c and k l k l min depends mainly on the value of c and its scale dependence in this study we however did not change c with the scale at filed scale one may need to consider the assumption of varying c with system size due to complexities and multi scale behavior at large scales 5 discussion 5 1 the fundamental length scale in this study we set the fundamental length scale c equal to 0 85 kapitulnik et al 1983 the value 0 85 in units of the bond length is based on monte carlo simulations of percolation on a square lattice although ghanbarian et al 2013 also used c 0 85 and found well agreement between simulations and theory one should expect that it is not necessarily valid in all types of porous media we also assumed that the fundamental length scale c does not vary with scale however if the pore throat length distribution and the typical pore throat length vary from one scale to another one should expect c to change with increasing the system length following hunt 2006 esmaeilpour et al 2021 recently set c equal to the typical pore throat length and accurately estimated the scale dependence of permeability from pore throat radius and length distributions in pore networks 5 2 spatial heterogeneity small versus large scales at small pore and core scales permeability is controlled by small scale heterogeneities such as pore space properties e g pore throat radius distribution pore connectivity and surface roughness however at large scales e g field or reservoir fluid flow is influenced by large scale heterogeneities such as spatial distribution of low and high permeability zones due to the presence of different lithofacies as well as fractures and their orientations nordahl ringrose 2008 studied how permeability varied as a function of scale using three dimensional numerical modeling of lithofacies they found that for formations with low mudstone contents vertical permeability increased with scale while horizontal permeability was nearly constant for systems with high mudstone content their results appear to imply the opposite horizontal permeability decreased with scale while vertical permeability was almost constant nordahl ringrose 2008 proposed a normalized standard deviation as a criterion to calculate the representative elementary volume they found that the size of rev depended on vertical and horizontal permeabilities as well as the correlation lengths of lithofacies capturing small scale heterogeneities compared to large scale ones is practically more feasible due to complexities associated with spatial and temporal variations as well as anisotropy at large scales further investigations are still required to develop a theoretical framework to estimate the scale dependence of permeability at field or reservoir scales where probably both matrix and fracture network contribute to flow and transport boutt et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2020 5 3 limitation in this study we estimated the value of the critical scaling exponent t from the porosity permeability data one should note that for media in which porosity does not vary with scale while permeability increases the exponent t determined from the porosity permeability data becomes unrealistically large similarly when porosity does not change with scale while permeability decreases the exponent t becomes negative although negative correlations between porosity and permeability have been experimentally reported in the literature garing et al 2015 mangane et al 2013 sabo and beckingham 2021 from percolation theory viewpoint the value of t is expected to be greater than its universal value in random and short range correlated media and greater than 0 in long range correlated systems sahimi 2011 one may also determine the value of t from the pore throat radius distribution feng et al 1987 hunt et al 2014 kogut and straley 1979 if available 6 conclusion to estimate the scale dependence of permeability we developed a theoretical model by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size we applied power law scaling law from percolation theory that links permeability to porosity and critical porosity through a critical scaling exponent and modified it by including the finite size effect i e c l 1 ν we demonstrated that within the proposed scale dependent approach eq 5 the permeability may increase or decrease with the scale depending on the model parameters to evaluate our methodology we compared the theoretical estimations via eq 5 with four different datasets including eleven simulations from the literature the critical porosity φ c was approximated as 10 of porosity and the critical scaling exponent t was determined from the porosity and permeability data results showed reasonable agreement between the theoretical estimations and the numerical simulations with average relative error ranged between 27 5 and 10 2 we also found that the effect of porosity and its trend with the scale is profound and neglecting its contribution may result in substantial underestimations in the scale dependence of permeability further investigation is still required to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model eq 5 using experimental measurements and a broader range of porous media credit authorship contribution statement behzad ghanbarian conceptualization methodology

187,understanding the effect of sample size on hydraulic characteristics of porous media and estimating their scale dependent properties have been challenging in subsurface hydrology an empirical power law relationship has been widely applied to link permeability k to sample volume however due to its empiricism accurately estimating the scale dependence of permeability k l in soils and rocks has remained unanswered in this paper we combine concepts of percolation theory and finite size effect develop a theoretical relationship to model k l and evaluate the proposed model using various types of porous media to estimate k l one requires porosity critical porosity critical scaling exponent a fundamental length scale system length and permeability determined at the smallest scale comparison with numerical simulations shows that incorporating effects of porosity and finite size results in accurate estimates of k l we find reasonable agreement between the theory and the simulations with average relative error ranged between 27 5 and 10 2 keywords finite size effect percolation theory permeability porosity scale dependence 1 introduction the effect of scale or sample volume on hydraulic and hydrologic properties of porous media has been known for decades in subsurface hydrology abidoye and das 2014 fernàndez garcia et al 2005 meile and tuncay 2006 taylor and howard 1987 such an effect even became more important in the past years due to capabilities in measurements or simulations across a wide range of scales e g from single fracture qian et al 2007 to globe gleeson et al 2014 although it is evident that the origin of scale dependency is the presence of spatial heterogeneity at various scales bear and corapcioglu 1987 nordahl and ringrose 2008 we are still far from fully understanding how hydraulic properties of soils and rocks such as porosity permeability and dispersivity may vary with scale numerous studies investigated the scale dependence of permeability of porous media experimentally garbesi et al 1996 javaux and vanclooster 2006 sánchez vila et al 1996 schulze makuch et al 1999 or numerically bazaikin et al 2017 han et al 2021 yoon and dewers 2013 zhang et al 2000 for instance mostaghimi et al 2013 studied the effect of image size on porosity specific surface area and permeability in different types of media including consolidated and unconsolidated porous rocks they demonstrated that by increasing heterogeneity the size of representative elementary volume rev increased mostaghimi et al 2013 also showed that the value of permeability based rev was up to twice as large as those based on porosity or specific surface area we should point out that accurate determination of rev requires simulations on high resolution images the effect of resolution on numerical simulations has been addressed in the literature alyafei et al 2015 guan et al 2019 pot et al 2020 although it is well documented that experimental measurements and numerical simulations are scale dependent only a few models have been developed in the literature to characterize the scale dependence of hydraulic properties of porous media a widely used model is a power law relationship i e k v s m relating permeability k to sample volume v s through an empirical exponent m schulze makuch et al 1999 in another study ghanbarian et al 2015 applied machine learning and the contrast pattern aided regression cpxr approach to develop scale dependent regression based relationships and estimate permeability from other soil properties those authors showed that including sample dimensions i e sample internal diameter and height improved permeability estimations substantially however such relationships and the power law model k v s m are purely empirical and because of their empiricism the interpretation of their parameters e g m and their variations from one medium to another is not clear hunt 2006 proposed a theoretical model based on concepts of percolation theory and power law pore throat radius distribution he compared theoretical estimations from his model with experimental data of schulze makuch 1996 collected from various sites within a carbonate rock aquifer in southeastern wisconsin and found generally well agreement in the ingenious scale dependent permeability model of hunt 2006 it is assumed that pore throat radius distribution follows the power law probability density function furthermore his model scales down permeability using its rev value while typically upscaling permeability is desired recently esmaeilpour et al 2021 generalized the hunt s approach to be independent of the shape of pore throat radius distribution and compared their generalized model with pore network simulations they found that their model estimated the scale dependence of permeability accurately from pore throat radius distribution with average relative error ranged between 3 7 and 3 8 the approach proposed by hunt 2006 and followed by esmaeilpour et al 2021 however requires detailed information on pore throat radius distribution in addition both models predict that permeability k should increase with the increase in scale or sample volume in accord with some experimental measurements pachepsky et al 2014 schulze makuch et al 1999 tinni et al 2012 on the contrary some numerical simulations sahimi et al 1986 shamsi et al 2020 tahmasebi et al 2016 appear to imply the opposite in this study we propose a theory and show that both increasing and decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability is theoretically supported the main objectives of this study therefore are to 1 develop a theoretical model by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size 2 demonstrate that permeability may increase or decrease with scale depending on the model parameters and 3 evaluate the proposed model using different types of porous media 2 theory there exist several theoretical frameworks through which one may relate permeability of a porous medium to its porosity such as the bundle of capillary tubes approach costa 2006 and percolation theory hunt et al 2014 sahimi 2011 in contrast to capillary bundle models percolation theory takes the effect of interconnectivity into account to model flow and transport in porous media although early models were developed based on regular lattices stauffer and aharony 1994 over the past decades percolation theory was successfully adopted and applied to real porous media such as soils rocks and fracture networks berkowitz and ewing 1998 hunt and sahimi 2017 king and masihi 2018 a fundamental concept in percolation theory is the existence of a critical occupation fraction above which permeability is related to occupation fraction p and its critical value p c as follows stauffer and aharony 1994 1 k p p c t where t is the critical scaling exponent for permeability the exponent t depends on the broadness of bond conductance distribution feng et al 1987 kogut and straley 1979 and therefore its value changes from one medium to another however if the bond conductance distribution is narrow enough in random and short range correlated media the exponent t would be universal and its value is 1 3 in two dimensions and 2 in three dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 the critical occupation fraction p c in eq 1 represents the percolation threshold of an infinitely large system pc based on the finite size scaling theory of fisher 1971 followed by levinshtein et al 1976 one should expect the finite size of a system causes a shift in the critical occupation fraction as follows 2 p c p c l a l 1 ν where pc l is the critical occupation fraction for a system of finite size l ν is the universal critical exponent scaling the correlation length and its value is 1 33 and 0 88 in two and three dimensions respectively stauffer and aharony 1994 in eq 2 the prefactor a is about 0 3 for the square lattice and 0 9 for the cubic lattice according to monte carlo simulations nakanishi and stanley 1980 to apply eq 1 to porous media one should replace p and p c with porosity φ and its critical value φ c accordingly permeability is related to porosity with the equation 3 k ϕ ϕ c t eq 3 is defined for media that are infinitely large in practice however the size of samples in experimental measurements or domains in numerical simulations is finite in the percolation theory framework the correlation length χ provides a measure of the largest length scale above which the system is macroscopically homogeneous l χ however when the system size l is less than the correlation length l χ the system is heterogeneous the correlation length of a porous medium may be defined as χ c φ φ c ν hunt et al 2014 in which c represents a fundamental length scale in the medium a numerical prefactor linking the correlation length χ to φ φ c theoretically near the critical porosity φ φ c the correlation length exceeds the system size and becomes the dominant length scale however for finite sized systems it is not possible to approach to the critical porosity closer than the value of porosity for which l χ instead one may set the system size equal to the correlation length l χ and then calculate an associated value of porosity φ to account for the effect of finite size accordingly all φ values ranged between φ c and φ correspond to χ l and cannot be detected in a system as small as the size of interest using this terminology the sensitivity of the system to small changes in φ near φ c is eliminated however very strong dependence on the system size emerges one may simply devise an expression for the permeability by taking the finite size effect c l 1 ν into eq 3 as follows 4 k ϕ ϕ c c l 1 ν t the value of c is 0 85 based on the monte carlo simulations of kapitulnik et al 1983 a similar modification to model the scale dependence of tortuosity was proposed by ghanbarian et al 2013 who successfully evaluated it by comparing with experiments and simulations in the limit l k follows the power law given by eq 3 as porosity approaches its critical value φ φ c permeability becomes dependent on system length and thus eq 4 reduces to the simple power law k l t ν which is in accord with the finite size scaling analysis stauffer and aharony 1994 normalizing eq 4 yields 5 k l k l m i n ϕ l ϕ c l c l l 1 ν ϕ l m i n ϕ c l m i n c l m i n l m i n 1 ν t where lmin represents the smallest scale at which permeability porosity and critical porosity are determined eq 5 holds in isotropic porous media if and only if the exponent t scaling permeability with porosity does not vary with scale in our theoretical model the spatial heterogeneity across pore and core scales is characterized via parameters porosity φ critical porosity φ c critical scaling exponent t and fundamental length scale c we show that interactions of such parameters lead to an increasing or decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability in accord with numerical simulations at pore and core scales to estimate the scale dependence of permeability via eq 5 one needs porosity φ critical porosity φ c and fundamental length scale c determined across scales as well as permeability at the smallest scale k lmin the exponent t can be calculated from pore throat radius distribution feng et al 1987 kogut and straley 1979 if available or from porosity and permeability measurements by fitting eq 3 to data by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size we demonstrate that eq 5 accurately estimates the scale dependence of permeability in different types of porous media 3 materials and methods in this section we first briefly describe numerical simulations collected from the literature and then explain how the critical porosity φ c and critical scaling exponent t are determined from porosity and permeability data the interested reader is referred to the original publications for further detailed information 3 1 numerical simulations sahimi et al 1986 sahimi et al 1986 simulated fluid flow in a two dimensional network composed of cylindrical pore throats of the same length but various radii the pore throat radius distribution followed the one parameter rayleigh probability density function those authors computed the steady state pressure distribution in the entire network by solving a standard kirchhoff law formulation sahimi et al 1986 calculated the average velocity of flow in each pore throat from the pressure distribution and then computed the permeability at different network sizes i e 15 15 30 30 40 40 50 50 and 60 60 in their simulations l represents the system length in units of the pore throat length the permeability of the 15 15 network was averaged over 40 iterations while those of other sizes over 10 iterations the percolation threhsold for an infinitely large square lattice is 0 5 pc 0 5 however sahimi et al 1986 carried out their simulations on lattices with finite sizes accordingly we corrected the percolation threshold using eq 2 by determinging pc l from pc 0 5 ν 1 33 stauffer and aharony 1994 and a 0 3 nakanishi and stanley 1980 sahimi et al 1986 stated that they conducted their simulations near the percolation threshold we approximately set p 0 52 in our analyses we also used t 1 3 the universal value in two dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 to estimate the scale dependence of permeability gao et al 2014 gao et al 2014 collected a typical tight sandstone sample from sulige gas field in changqing oilfield china after cleaning the sample porosity and permeability were experimentally measured then the core sample was imaged using a μ ct x ray scanner at a physical resolution of 3 4 μm to study the effect of scale six subsamples of various voxel sizes from 100 to 600 340 to 2040 μm were extracted from the entire 3d image to minimize uncertainties gao et al 2014 extracted six images for subsample of size 100 four for 200 and 300 three for 400 and two for 500 and 600 they reported the average values of porosity pore body radius pore throat length pore coordination number and permeability in their table 1 subsample images were first filtered by the non local means method and then thresholded by the watershed segmentation method next the pore networks were derived for which porosity and permeability were numerically computed berg et al 2016 berg et al 2016 investigated the representative elementary volume rev analysis of a gildehauser sandstone sample they numerically determined the values of porosity and permeability on μ ct image of various sizes i e l 154 307 615 1233 and 2465 μm on cylindrical samples of 4 mm diameter and 10 mm length berg et al 2016 experimentally found an average porosity of 20 and a permeability of 1 5 darcies their rev results showed that the sample size of 4 mm diameter was larger than the rev they also indicated that although for porosity the computed value became independent of the scale for images sizes larger than the rev for permeability it was not the case gerke and karsanina 2021 gerke karsanina 2021 collected two undisturbed core samples at two different depths indicated by high and low from ah and b horizons in russia overall eight samples were imaged using the x ray microtomography method under field moisture conditions with a resolution of 15 85 μm the stokes equation for creeping flow was solved using a finite difference approach and permeability was computed based on darcy s law along the major directions i e x y and z axes we calculated the geometric mean of the simulated k x k y k z values to determine the effective permeability for all samples except ah 2 high and ah 2 low in these two samples the effect of anisotropy seems to be significant therefore the effective permeability was determined by taking the geometric mean of only k x and k z values 3 2 determining the exponent t for the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 we set t 1 3 the universal scaling exponent in two dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 for the rest of the simulations to calculate the critical scaling exponent t the critical porosity was first estimated for each medium using the approximation φ c 0 1φ proposed by hunt 2004 permeability was then plotted against φ φ c and eq 3 was fitted to the data for samples b 2 high and b 2 low the trend between k and φ φ c was not monotonically increasing accordingly we selected a portion intermediate part of the data with an increasing trend to optimize the exponent t for these two samples to compare the theoretical estimations via eq 5 with the numerical simulations we assume that the parameter c does not vary with the scale and set it equal to 0 85 kapitulnik et al 1983 3 3 model evaluation to evaluate the performance of the proposed scale dependent permeability model eq 5 we calculated the average relative error and root mean square error rmse as follows 6 a v e r e 1 n i 1 n x e s t x s i m x s i m i 100 7 r m s e i 1 n x e s t x s i m i 2 n where x est and x sim are the estimated and simulated permeability values respectively and n is the number of data points 4 results in what follows we first demonstrate that the permeability may increase or decrease with the scale depending on the parameters φ φ c and c we then present the results of comparing the estimations by eq 5 with the numerical simulations for different types of porous media recall that we set φ c 0 1φ ν 0 88 and c 0 85 for all cases the exponent t was determined by directly fitting eq 3 to the porosity permeability data and its value is reported in fig 3 for each dataset 4 1 increasing and decreasing trend in scale dependent permeability fig 1 shows the scale dependent permeability determined via eq 5 against the system length with arbitrary units l for various conditions in all cases we set ν 0 88 and t 2 the universal values in three dimensions stauffer and aharony 1994 in fig 1a φ c 0 03 c 0 85 and φ increases from 0 15 at the smallest scale l min 2 to 0 55 at the largest scale l max 131 072 is constant and equal to 0 15 or decreases from 0 15 at l min to 0 07 at l max for the increasing porosity case shown in blue k decreases with increasing l at small scales l 16 while its value increases with the system length for l 16 this is because the porosity term i e φ φ c becomes dominant compared to the finite size term i e c l 1 ν at larger scales fig 1a also shows that if the porosity does not change with the scale shown in black the normalized permeability becomes constant after reaching the rev however if the porosity decreases with the scale k l k lmin keeps decreasing as the system size increases shown in red in fig 1b φ 0 15 c 0 85 and φ c increases from 0 03 at l min 2 arbitrary units to 0 11 at l max 131 072 arbitrary units is constant and equal to 0 03 or decreases from 0 03 at l min to 0 014 at l max for constant critical porosity shown in black k l k lmin becomes constant at l 1024 however when the critical porosity decreases with the scale shown in red the permeability decreases for 2 l 128 remains constant for 128 l 1024 and then slightly increases for l 1024 fig 1b if the value of critical porosity increases as the scale increases shown in blue k l k lmin keeps decreasing with increasing the system size in fig 1c φ 0 15 φ c 0 03 and c increases from 0 85 at l min 2 arbitrary units to 16 85 at l max 131 072 arbitrary units is constant and equal to 0 85 or decreases from 0 85 at l min to 0 05 at l max fig 1c shows that the effect of variation in the parameter c is more profound at the smaller system sizes results for constant c and decreasing c are nearly the same the permeability decreases with the scale and then reaches the rev l 1024 however for the increasing c shown in blue the permeability first increases as the system size increases 2 l 4 and then decreases until reaching the rev l 4096 fig 1d presents integrated results for the increasing constant and decreasing trends in parameters φ φ c and c for example the increasing trend shown in blue corresponds to increase in such parameters with the scale as can be seen permeability first increases where the term c l 1 ν is dominant then decreases and next increases again with the scale this trend in the scale dependence of permeability is similar to those reported by bear corapcioglu 1987 and nordahl ringrose 2008 this means as long as parameters φ φ c and c vary with the scale e g due to spatial heterogeneity one should expect permeability to change with increase in system size fig 1 clearly demonstrates that one should theoretically expect the permeability to increase or decrease with the system size depending on the values of the parameters φ φ c and c comparing figs 1a and 1c with fig 1b displays that the influence of φ and c on the scale dependence of permeability is more than that of φ c fig 1 also shows that the effect of the fundamental length scale c is more profound than that of porosity φ at smaller system sizes however the impact of φ becomes more important at larger system sizes where the term c l 1 ν becomes small compared to φ φ c in what follow we show that the increasing and decreasing trends in the scale dependent permeability can be accurately estimated via eq 5 if the critical porosity φ c and the critical scaling exponent t are approximated well 4 1 comparison with sahimi et al 1986 simulations in fig 2 a we present the results of comparing eq 5 with t 1 3 to the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 the black line indicates the estimations when the percolation threshold was corrected for the effect of finite size using eq 2 while the red line represents no corrections eq 2 returned pc l 15 0 46 and pc l 60 0 49 the latter however is not greatly different from pc 0 5 based on the reported average relative error and rmse values correcting the percolation threshold resulted in more accurate estimates of scale dependent permeability however to correct the critical porosity for the finite size effect and apply eq 2 to real porous media one needs φ c and the constant a which may not be always known one should expect the value of a to vary from one sample to another for example liu regenauer lieb 2021 analyzed four carbonate rock samples and found 0 24 a 478 6 deduced from their fig 28 fig 2b shows the estimations via eq 5 with t 1 3 by only incorporating the effect of finite size i e k l k lmin lmin l t ν although the permeability was slightly underestimated the performance of the model is reasonably well with average relative error of 12 3 and rmse 0 058 this is because sahimi et al 1986 conducted their simulations above but near the percolation threshold comparing the average relative error and rmse values reported in fig 2b with those given in fig 2a indicates the importance of incorporating effects of both occupation probability p or porosity φ and finite size on the estimation of scale dependent permeability 4 2 comparison with gao et al 2014 simulations for the simulations of gao et al 2014 we found t 4 41 based on the trend between normalized permeability and porosity minus critical porosity as shown in fig 3 a eq 5 with t 4 41 c 0 85 and ν 0 88 resulted in the estimations that match the simulated permeabilities reasonably well we found the average relative error of 27 45 and rmse of 0 285 fig 4 a which are greater than those reported in fig 2 in this set of simulations although the porosity decreases from 4 63 at l 100 340 μm to 2 56 at l 300 1020 μm the normalized permeability first increases and then decreases the increasing trend in the permeability at the smaller scales is most probably because the average pore radius increased from nearly 5 5 μm at l 100 340 μm to 7 μm at l 200 680 μm see fig 4 of gao et al 2014 while porosity decreased from 4 63 to 4 04 in our terminology the effect of pore sizes and their distribution is indirectly incorporated in the exponent t as stated earlier eq 5 holds if pore throat radius distribution does not substantially change with scale if it does one value of t may not appropriately scale permeability with porosity across different system sizes the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν that does not incorporate the effect of porosity resulted in substantial underestimations not shown with the average relative error 78 26 and rmse 0 474 this is because this equation is valid at the percolation threshold where permeability is independent of porosity although fig 2b shows reasonable estimations of permeability above but near the percolation threshold for the sahimi et al 1986 simulations one should expect the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν to underestimate permeability far above the percolation threshold e g φ φ c 4 3 comparison with berg et al 2016 simulations the normalized permeability against the porosity minus the critical porosity is displayed in fig 3b for the simulations of berg et al 2016 we found t 3 74 with r2 0 89 using t 3 74 c 0 85 and ν 0 88 we estimated the scale dependence of permeability via eq 5 results presented in fig 4b show that the proposed model estimated the scale dependent permeability accurately with average relative error of 7 45 and rmse of 0 078 interestingly our model precisely predicted the sharp decrease in the permeability at the smaller scales and slight increase at the larger scales to explore which parameter φ or c contributes to such a sharp reduction in the k at the smaller system lengths fig 4b we first set c 0 in eq 5 to eliminate the effect of finite size and then estimated the permeability we found that the average relative error and rmse values increased to 10 9 overestimation on average and 0 088 respectively we also estimated the scale dependence of permeability by only incorporating the finite size effect using the equation k l k lmin lmin l t ν φ φ c in eq 5 results not shown indicated significant underestimations with average relative error 77 72 which is substantially more negative than that we found for the simulations of sahimi et al 1986 and rmse 0 362 this is probably because sahimi et al 1986 simulated permeability near the percolation threshold while berg et al 2016 far above that recall that right at the percolation threshold one should expect that permeability to scale with system length as k l t ν results revealed that for the berg et al 2016 dataset φ has more profound impact on k l than the fundamental length scale c and the sharp decrease in the permeability is because of the substantial reduction in the porosity from 0 229 at l 154 μm to 0 179 at l 307 μm 4 4 comparison with gerke and karsanina 2021 simulations results of optimizing the scaling exponent t are presented in figs 3c j for samples ah 1 high ah 1 low ah 2 high ah 2 low b 1 high b 1 low b 2 high and b 2 low respectively for sample b 1 low we found t 1 67 fig 3h and for b 2 high t 1 35 fig 3i t values less than 2 were also reported in carbonate rocks by liu et al 2014 theoretically t 2 the universal value in three dimensions is supported in media with long range correlation sahimi and mukhopadhyay 1996 we should note that in random or short range correlated media if the critical porosity is overestimated one should expect the exponent t to be underestimated this however is not the case for samples b 1 low and b 2 high because setting φ c 0 did not change the optimized t values figs 4c j show the estimated and simulated k l values for eight samples analyzed by gerke karsanina 2021 as can be seen eq 5 with c 0 85 and φ c 0 1φ estimated the scale dependence of permeability accurately we found that the average relative error ranged from 2 03 ah 1 low to 11 08 b 2 low and rmse from 0 021 ah 1 low to 0 113 b 2 low indicating well agreement between the theory and the simulations we also found that neglecting the effect of porosity led to substantial underestimations of scale dependent permeability results not shown using k l k lmin lmin l t ν resulted in average relative error between 87 7 for sample ah 1 high and 44 6 for sample b 2 high which highlights the effect of porosity on the estimation of k l to study the effect of finite size on the results we set c 0 in eq 5 and estimated k l k l min for all samples in this dataset both the average relative error and rmse values insignificantly increased results not shown the average relative error ranged between 2 06 and 11 12 and rmse between 0 021 and 0 114 this is because the fundamental length scale c 0 85 is substantially less than the system size in this dataset making the term c l 1 ν very small the increasing or decreasing trend in the scale dependence of permeability is a function of several parameters in eq 5 i e φ φ c c and t φ c was estimated from φ φ c 0 1φ using the hunt 2004 approach and t was determined by fitting eq 3 to the porosity permeability data in our analyses accordingly the balance between the two terms φ φ c or 0 9φ and c l 1 ν played a crucial rule for large system sizes where l c the term c l 1 ν becomes negligible compared to φ φ c and thus the scale dependence of permeability is essentially controlled by the effect of porosity and its trend with the scale for small system sizes where l c the term c l 1 ν dominates φ φ c and k l k l min depends mainly on the value of c and its scale dependence in this study we however did not change c with the scale at filed scale one may need to consider the assumption of varying c with system size due to complexities and multi scale behavior at large scales 5 discussion 5 1 the fundamental length scale in this study we set the fundamental length scale c equal to 0 85 kapitulnik et al 1983 the value 0 85 in units of the bond length is based on monte carlo simulations of percolation on a square lattice although ghanbarian et al 2013 also used c 0 85 and found well agreement between simulations and theory one should expect that it is not necessarily valid in all types of porous media we also assumed that the fundamental length scale c does not vary with scale however if the pore throat length distribution and the typical pore throat length vary from one scale to another one should expect c to change with increasing the system length following hunt 2006 esmaeilpour et al 2021 recently set c equal to the typical pore throat length and accurately estimated the scale dependence of permeability from pore throat radius and length distributions in pore networks 5 2 spatial heterogeneity small versus large scales at small pore and core scales permeability is controlled by small scale heterogeneities such as pore space properties e g pore throat radius distribution pore connectivity and surface roughness however at large scales e g field or reservoir fluid flow is influenced by large scale heterogeneities such as spatial distribution of low and high permeability zones due to the presence of different lithofacies as well as fractures and their orientations nordahl ringrose 2008 studied how permeability varied as a function of scale using three dimensional numerical modeling of lithofacies they found that for formations with low mudstone contents vertical permeability increased with scale while horizontal permeability was nearly constant for systems with high mudstone content their results appear to imply the opposite horizontal permeability decreased with scale while vertical permeability was almost constant nordahl ringrose 2008 proposed a normalized standard deviation as a criterion to calculate the representative elementary volume they found that the size of rev depended on vertical and horizontal permeabilities as well as the correlation lengths of lithofacies capturing small scale heterogeneities compared to large scale ones is practically more feasible due to complexities associated with spatial and temporal variations as well as anisotropy at large scales further investigations are still required to develop a theoretical framework to estimate the scale dependence of permeability at field or reservoir scales where probably both matrix and fracture network contribute to flow and transport boutt et al 2012 hoffmann et al 2020 5 3 limitation in this study we estimated the value of the critical scaling exponent t from the porosity permeability data one should note that for media in which porosity does not vary with scale while permeability increases the exponent t determined from the porosity permeability data becomes unrealistically large similarly when porosity does not change with scale while permeability decreases the exponent t becomes negative although negative correlations between porosity and permeability have been experimentally reported in the literature garing et al 2015 mangane et al 2013 sabo and beckingham 2021 from percolation theory viewpoint the value of t is expected to be greater than its universal value in random and short range correlated media and greater than 0 in long range correlated systems sahimi 2011 one may also determine the value of t from the pore throat radius distribution feng et al 1987 hunt et al 2014 kogut and straley 1979 if available 6 conclusion to estimate the scale dependence of permeability we developed a theoretical model by incorporating effects of porosity and finite size we applied power law scaling law from percolation theory that links permeability to porosity and critical porosity through a critical scaling exponent and modified it by including the finite size effect i e c l 1 ν we demonstrated that within the proposed scale dependent approach eq 5 the permeability may increase or decrease with the scale depending on the model parameters to evaluate our methodology we compared the theoretical estimations via eq 5 with four different datasets including eleven simulations from the literature the critical porosity φ c was approximated as 10 of porosity and the critical scaling exponent t was determined from the porosity and permeability data results showed reasonable agreement between the theoretical estimations and the numerical simulations with average relative error ranged between 27 5 and 10 2 we also found that the effect of porosity and its trend with the scale is profound and neglecting its contribution may result in substantial underestimations in the scale dependence of permeability further investigation is still required to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed model eq 5 using experimental measurements and a broader range of porous media credit authorship contribution statement behzad ghanbarian conceptualization methodology

188,estimation of urban evapotranspiration et is meaningful for evaluating the urban heat island effect and promoting urban water conservation while multi source satellite based et models for farmland

instantaneous latent heat flux le simulation moreover the rmse and bias were 0 092 and 0 023 respectively in simulating the vegetation latent heat flux fraction lev le when verified with respect to the stable water isotope measurements due to limited water availability the impervious urban surface evaporation magnitude was found quite low with minimal variation on different test days the results emphasize the importance of coupling lulc information in the urban et modeling conceptualization certainly the tru model improved the et simulation accuracy in urban areas and could facilitate the

have been derived customized et models for urban areas are still sparse in the literature the primary differences between the urban and farmland or natural ecosystem areas lie in the presence of large proportions of impervious surfaces and anthropogenic activities in the urban areas kuang and dou 2020 kuang and yan 2018 furthermore the surface conditions in the urban areas are highly complex and heterogeneous resulting in regional scale urban et simulation being quite challenging wong et al 2015 wang et al 2016 faridatul et al 2020 limited numbers of satellite based urban et models exist in the literature with single source schemes being more prevalent examples include the surface energy balance algorithm of the urban usebal model faridatul et al 2020 the empirical urban et eu model wang et al 2016 and the three temperature urban et 3t model qiu et al 2017 the relatively simple physical mechanism used in the single source models leads to non functionality of the acquisition of the et components in urban areas the primary bottleneck of the satellite based two source modeling approach lies in their lack of reliable parameterization schemes for soil evaporation and impervious evaporation estimation in the two source models the soil evaporation is usually estimated as the residual component of the energy balance equation such as in the tseb model norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2008 or are based on the relationships with air humidity such as pm mu model mu et al 2007 2011 since these parametric schemes do not accurately capture the rapid changes in the soil surface wetness they tend to result in high uncertainty in the et simulation gao et al 2016 therefore the current soil evaporation parametric scheme and two source et model cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous urban regions furthermore in the handful of urban et models evaporation rates from urban impervious surfaces are usually calculated in the same manner as that of other urban land surface types which results in significant overestimates of et simulation wang et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 another obstacle is the lack of long term field observations based on eddy correlation ec and stable water isotope technology in urban areas that continuously measure urban et and its components these limitations certainly hinder the development and evaluation of multi source urban et models the development of urban et models began with grimmond and oke 1991 with estimates of the urban et in the vancouver canada using the energy balance method further liu et al 2010 developed a customized satellite imagery based urban et model by modifying the energy balance equation and selecting the hot cold pixels from the satellite imagery and subsequently mapping the et distribution in oklahoma us to further simplify the complexity in the model structure and to better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces wang et al 2016 proposed an empirical urban et eu model combined with spectroradiometer derived data to estimate the et in phoenix us the eu model highlighted the importance of using land use and land cover lulc information in the urban et calculations to reduce the input parameters in the urban et models qiu et al 2017 developed a three temperature et 3t model which relied only upon the remote sensing thermal infrared band to retrieve the urban et the performance of the 3t model was tested with the et measurements using the bowen ratio method for shenzhen china recently faridatul et al 2020 developed a surface energy balance algorithm for urban areas usebal for which the model was modified from the conventional single source model sebal and applied in dhaka bangladesh however due to the lack of ground et measurements the performance of the usebal model was not adequately evaluated in light of the above discussions the common issues pertaining to the urban et model are identified as follows 1 urban soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration are not partitioned in the single source urban et models 2 lack of reasonable parameterization scheme for et estimation for the impervious surfaces 3 performance of the existing urban et models has not been rigorously evaluated and 4 the existing urban et model variants are solely based on the mechanism of a single source et model for the farmland and natural ecosystems which ignores the heterogeneity involved with the urban surfaces to facilitate the mapping of the urban et components and to fill the existing research gap between the et simulations in the farmland natural ecosystems and urban areas the present study was undertaken with the following specific objectives 1 to develop a three source urban et model tru that accounts for the et from impervious urban areas soil surfaces and vegetation surfaces 2 to verify the performance of the developed tru model with the ec and stable water isotope based measurements in tianjin china 3 to provide clear insight about the spatial patterns of the urban et components 4 to compare the developed tru model performance with the existing five satellite based et models and 5 to make a comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and limitations of the tru model 2 model formulation 2 1 tru model structure and development to distinguish between the relative contributions of the soil surfaces vegetation canopy and impervious areas to urban et simulation it is assumed that the urban impervious surfaces e g buildings and transportation areas and pervious surfaces e g forests cultivated fields sparse vegetation bare soil and water bodies exhibit a mutually independent evaporation processes long and singh 2012 yang and shang 2013 first tru divides the impervious surfaces and pervious surfaces according to the lulc the lulc characteristics were retrieved from the landsat oli images using the deep learning classification method convolutional deep belief network cdbn wang and li 2019 in tru the et from the impervious surfaces is parameterized as a single evaporation process while the et from the pervious surfaces is described as a two source processes i e soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration the patch based model mechanism has been widely adopted and verified in the conventional two source et models for farmland and natural ecosystem yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 the detailed model structure of the proposed tru model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 1 et parameterization scheme for pervious surfaces to estimate et from the pervious surfaces tru adopts a newly developed two source parametric scheme as revised from the tseb model gan et al 2019 norman et al 1995 2000 song et al 2016 the following is a detailed introduction of the et parameterization scheme for non impervious

impedance in response to the variations of the environmental factors e g soil moisture vapor pressure deficit and co2 concentration donohue et al 2013 in tru g was determined through an improved methodology as based on the derived lulc information the pervious surfaces are further divided into vegetation coverage area and non vegetation coverage area wherein the g in these two types of areas are estimated by the empirical relationship with rn after bastiaanssen et al 1998 kato and yamaguchi 2005 8 g r n l s t α 0 0038 α 0 0074 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 vegetative land cover c g r n non vegetative land cover where cg is an empirical coefficient depicting the behavior of non vegetative surfaces the value of cg depends on the surface heat capacity and the surface heat conductivity in general a higher cg estimate corresponds to a stronger heat conductivity and a larger g value based on extensive field measurements the cg is found to be varying over a wide range under different surface conditions and seasons anandakumar 1999 brutsaert 1982 silberstein et al 2001 the reference cg values as adopted in the tru model are listed in table 1 anandakumar 1999 and kato et al 2005 for a given soil layer the rns consists of the soil latent heat flux les soil sensible heat fluxes hs w m2 and g the hs was estimated by calculating the temperature gradients of soil surface and air shown as eq 10 the les were determined using an improved parameterization scheme based on the complementary relationship theory as shown in eqs 11 12 gan et al 2019 9 h s l e s g r n s 10 h s ρ c p t s t a

corresponds to a large value of ref the expression of ref is given as eq 12 12 r e f 1 1 a exp b s d i in eq 12 a and b are the two empirical parameters unitless where a and b are set as 0 028 and 8

1989 and ep is the atmospheric drying power w m2 as shown in eq 13 the original ep parameterization scheme mainly relied upon the differences in the air humidity to reflect the water content of the soil surface granger and gray 1989 shown as eq 13 however the air humidity exhibits very poor interactions with the surface soil moisture and ts has a faster response to soil moisture changes a higher ts corresponds to a lower soil surface moisture and a lower soil evaporation and vice versa to reflect the soil surface wetness using ts is a better alternative in the satellite based et models gan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 replaced ep with the total latent heat flux lesa w m2 and integrated ts into the lesa parametric scheme the expression for lesa is shown as eq 14 further sdi is transformed as sdi lesa lesa rns g gan et al 2019 the final les is calculated using eq 15 the newly parameterization scheme for les circumvents the need for soil moisture data allowing the model to be

difference lies in the non requirement of component temperatures decomposition used in the water bodies evaporation parametric approach for the vegetation layer rnv is composed of the vegetation latent heat flux lev and the vegetation sensible heat flux hv w m2 the lev and hv are determined by calculating the temperature and humidity gradients between the vegetation canopy and air eqs 17 and 18 note that the parameterization scheme of lev in tru is quite different from the original tseb model which uses the priestley taylor empirical formula to estimate lev gan et al 2019 norman et al

to obtain the root of tv 4 for each groups of ts and tv calculate the estimated lst lste based on eq 19 it is assumed that lste is the nonlinear mixing of tv and ts after norman et al 1995 anderson et

and repeat the steps 1 5 2 1 2 et parameterization scheme for impervious areas et in the impervious area is calculated independently by tru the impervious areas are characterized by intensive human activities hence the contribution of the urban anthropogenic flux a w m2 to the surface energy balance equation cannot be ignored a is generated by automobile exhaust metabolism and industrial plants the le of the impervious surfaces leimp w m2 is parameterized using eq 20 20 l e i m p ρ c p γ v p d r a r i m p where rimp is the impervious surface resistance s m which is estimated using eq 21 leimp is close to 0 in the dry mid day period and leimp approaches to its maximum value during wetter mornings and evenings 21 r i m p exp 8 206 4 225 w where w reflect the degree of surface wetness w

respectively a can be determined using eq 22 based on the energy budget 22 a l e i m p h i m p g i m p r n i m p a summary of the input variables adopted for the tru model is presented in table 2 2 2 study area to evaluate the performance of tru model tianjin city china which is located between longitudes 116 43 e to 118 04 e and latitudes 38 34n to 40 15 n is chosen as the study area tianjin is a megacity in northern china with a total area of 11 966 km2 and has a population of 15 6 million tianjin has a semi humid monsoon type climatology with annual average ta magnitude of 14 c 2 m height and the annual average precipitation of 580 mm approximately 25 of the city is covered by impervious land which are mostly distributed in the central and southeast coastal regions the geographical location of tianjin and existing land use information is presented in fig 3 2 3 field observations two open path ec systems gives continuous measurements of le and h at two field sites located in the tianjin city site 1 was established on the campus of nankai university in the southern part of the city 38 59 n 117 20 e altitude 3 m the ec tower height is 10 m and the underlying surface is a locust forest land with an average plant height of 7 8 m site 2 was established at the central main urban area with ec height of 10 m 39 05 n 117 18 e altitude 7 m the underlying surface is a mixed area comprised of forestland and 78 impervious land the spatial distribution of the flux footprints around the two ec towers on 23 jan 2017 are shown in fig 4 the two ec systems automatically collected the samples at 10 hz and the ec device contained a laser gas concentration analyzer li cor inc usa and a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the le h co2 flux bowen ratio rh es ea and vpd data were averaged over a period of 30 mins the g was measured using the plate method at the two sites hfp01 netherlands where the installation depth of the soil heat flux plates was 5 mm lu et al 2018 furthermore the stable water isotope method was adopted to partition the et into soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration at the two test locations for a detailed overview of the stable water isotope sampling and modeling procedure please refer to appendix 2 2 4 satellite and ancillary data a total of 63 cloud free test days were selected during the experimental period the landsat oli etm images were downloaded from the united states geological survey website usgs http glovis usgs gov it is noted that the cloud free period was defined as less than 13 cloud coverage during the satellite overpass time as obtained from the usgs s official website the selection of the test date took into consideration of both the cloud obstruction and the ec energy closure the ec system has the problem of unclosed energy balance le h rn g which ensures the energy closure ratio larger than 0 8 for all selected test days the residual energy balance re method was performed to rectify the energy closure twine et al 2000 the original resolutions of the visible light and near infrared bands of the landsat oli sensor were 30 m whereas the original resolution of the thermal infrared band of the landsat etm sensor was 60 m the collected satellite images spanned for the period 2017 to 2020 and were resampled further to a spatial resolution of 30 m in order to retrieve a part of the input parameters ndvi lst and α for tru model the atmospheric corrections of the landsat oli etm imagery were conducted using the polymer method pahlevan et al 2019 the specific dates and energy closure information adopted in tru model verification are presented in table s1 moreover the meteorological inputs such as ra ta u ea and rh were observed at the 41 meteorological stations within the city at a temporal resolution of half hour since the lst serves as a central input to tru model ground verification of landsat derived lst is highly essential at sites 1 and 2 a hobo automatic temperature probe was used to measure the lst around the two ec towers onset inc usa the verification outputs revealed that the satellite based lst could provide reliable ground lst retrieval with a root mean square error rmse of 0 76 k but slightly underestimated with a bias estimate of 0 69 k table s1 3 results and analysis 3 1 validation of the tru using ec measurements four surface energy balance components rn g le and h at an instantaneous time scale were verified with the ground ec observations in the 63 test days during the period of 2017 2020 to better match the le observations at the satellite pixel scale the flux footprint model was adopted to average the fluxes in the upwind direction of the two ec towers choi et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 fig 5 presents the scatter plots of the measured and simulated four energy balance components and table 3 depicts the specific statistical performance evaluation indices as envisaged from fig 5 and table 3 tru provided reliable rn and g estimates on the 63 test days yielding an rmse of 24 8 w m2 a mean absolute percentage difference mapd of 4 7 and a bias of 9 6 w m2 for rn simulation the slight overestimation of the rn could be attributed to the underestimation of the lst refer to table s1 which certainly led to the underestimation of the surface longwave radiation eq 2 tru has lower rmse and mapd estimates when compared with several other urban et models which is primarily attributed to the improved conceptualization of ε in the rn calculation eq 3 jassas et al 2015 wagle et al 2017 moreover g was calculated using the empirical relationship with rn shown as eq 8 yielded the rmse mapd and bias estimates of 12 2 w m2 8 5 and 5 6 w m2 respectively the instantaneous le simulated using tru agrees well with the two ec observations with rmse estimate of 40 2 w m2 mapd of 10 2 and bias of 10 8 w m2 for individual test days the day of year doy 127 in 2019 had the lowest deviation compared with ec observations for le simulation the rmse was 27 3 w m2 for doy 127 in 2019 however the doy 189 in 2019 had the largest deviation with an rmse value of 65 7 w m2 for le simulation which may be due to atmospheric advection effect in that day furthermore the tru was demonstrated to have the capability to discriminate the le across different seasons the estimated le values varied in the range of 53 2 w m2 to 372 3 w m2 with a median of 185 7 w m2 across the 63 test days the large variation range of simulated le proved the applicability of the tru approach in capturing the seasonal variations of the urban et similarly the verification of h revealed rmse estimate of 43 5 w m2 mapd of 11 4 and bias of 9 6 w m2 on the 63 test days the results of h verification exhibit the similar performance to that of le furthermore it is evident that the observed and estimated le values at the site 1 were significantly higher than site 2 conversely the observed and estimated h values at the site 1 were significantly lower than the site 2 this is due to the underlying surface around site 1 being mainly composed of vegetation and soil and available water to evaporate exists which increase le whereas since the impervious surfaces occupies the major portion of the areas around the site 2 most of the available energy generates h thereby increasing the air temperature unlike several other two source et models that calculate le h as the residual part of the surface energy budget norman et al 1995 long and singh 2012b yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 tru never exhibited a biased performance for the le h simulation which could be attributed to the fact that le and h were equally treated in the tru model the reliable simulations of le and h revealed that tru has great potential to be applied in the farmland and natural ecosystems due to the benefits of the newly developed le parametric scheme 3 2 validation of the tru using stable water isotope measurements the ratio of the vegetation latent heat flux to the latent heat flux lev le as simulated by tru model was verified with stable water isotope measurements at the two test sites to the best of our knowledge no past study has evaluated the performance of urban et model based on the stable water isotope measurements fig 6 a presents the scatterplot of the estimated and simulated instantaneous lev le values at the two test sites fig 6 b and c shows the changes of lev le with ndvi at the two test sites across the 63 test days respectively as envisaged from fig 6a b and c a good consistency was observed between the lev le simulations and observed counterparts as depicted from table 3 the rmse mapd and bias estimates are 0 092 12 7 and 0 023 respectively in lev le estimation moreover both tru model and the stable water isotope measurements successfully captured the dynamics of lev le variation with the ndvi changes in different test days the simulated lev le values at site 1 varied in the range of 0 36 to 0 98 with a median magnitude of 0 62 during the 63 test days while the corresponding variation at the site 2 varied in the range of 0 08 to 0 56 with a median value of 0 28 furthermore it was found that the observed and estimated lev le were significantly higher at site 1 than at site 2 which is explained by the higher vegetation coverage around the site 1 however it should be noted that the lev le on the four test days were significantly underestimated by tru model black dots in fig 6 a due to the lack of detailed atmospheric process information the source of discrepancy and underestimation on the four test days remained unknown however some past studies have reported that the stable water isotope method usually associated with higher lev le estimates when compared with other et partition methods such as sap flow and lysimeter wen et al 2016 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 3 3 spatial patterns of lev les and leimp fig 7 represents the spatial patterns of lev les and leimp in tianjin on the six test days 8 aug 2018 7 sep 2018 15 jan 2019 8 jun 2019 12 sep 2019 and 24 dec 2019 these test days reflect the variation in spatial distribution of urban lev les and leimp in different seasons as envisaged from figs 3 and 7 the vegetation cover in the urban suburbs was dominated by deciduous plants corresponding to high magnitude of lev during the spring and summer and lower magnitudes in the autumn and winter the lev estimates in the urban suburbs exhibited a wide range of seasonal variation throughout the analysis period in the case of a lower fc and predominantly planted by evergreen vegetation the magnitude of lev in main urban area was relatively lower than the suburban areas and exhibiting minor seasonal variations fig 7 for spatial patterns of les the higher value of les was mostly noticed in waterbody regions such as the yuqiao reservoir in the northern part of tianjin 2060 km2 black triangle and the floodplains and depressions regions of the southern region sporadically distributed red mapped areas in fig 7 in addition to the water body areas the higher les value are also prevalent in the bare soil regions for seasonal change of les the lower variations in the les values were observed in the spring and summer season because of the higher fc value in the corresponding seasons conversely the higher les values were observed in the autumn and winter due to the large areal coverage of bare soil and lower fc furthermore as compared to the suburban areas the les exhibited a smaller variation range for central main urban area in different seasons for lev and les distribution in various land use types the lev was found to be decreasing in the order of forest area 265 4 44 1 w m2 farmland 238 7 60 1 w m2 city gardens 212 5 62 2 w m2 sparse vegetation 201 7 46 8 w m2 and bare soil 168 9 28 7 w m2 the les was ranked in the decreasing order of waterbodies 388 9 76 8 w m2 bare soil 210 9 39 7 w m2 farmland 182 4 25 1 w m2 city gardens 120 1 43 3 w m2 and forest 85 5 33 6 w m2 fig 8 fig 9 provides an expanded view of the lev and les estimates surrounding the ec tower at the site 1 where each color map in fig 9 c contains 8 12 pixels generally the lev and les in the nearby locust forest regions were higher than those in the central road area theoretically since the roads are primarily covered by bare soil the les of the central road should be equal or higher than that of the nearby locust forest regions actually the compactness of the soil surface is greatly increased due to the high frequent movement of vehicles and humans on the road causing the surface soil moisture to decrease and lower les magnitude as a proof of concept this explains the differences in the spatial distributions of the lev and les in the road and nearby locust forest regions for evaporation estimation in the impervious areas the leimp exhibited less variation on different test days the average and maximum leimp values were found to be 17 3 w m2 and 33 6 w m2 respectively on the 63 test days figs 7 and 8 the leimp depicting relatively lower magnitude corresponding to the lev and les which is attributed to zero rainfall event during the six mapping days causing limited water to evaporate from the impervious surfaces fig 10 illustrates the spatial distribution of the le in the two typical test locations of tianjin on two test days in fig 10 a the central region is constituted by large farmland areas surrounded by impervious surfaces while fig 10 b shows a coastal region in tianjin wherein the farmland area is located in the central eastern area and the western area is mostly covered by impervious surfaces as depicted from fig 10 the le estimates in the farmland reached 300 400 w m2 while the le values of the impervious surfaces were less than 30 w m2 the reasonable le patterns in these two test regions is a solid evidence that tru successfully captured the spatial variations of le in the regions having both pervious and impervious surfaces 3 4 compare tru model performance with other models to further evaluate the performance of the tru model the outcomes of the tru model were compared with five satellite based et models prior to the model comparison we verified the le estimates using tru and satellite images and the le estimates using tru and meteorological observations on 63 test days see fig 11 overall the instantaneous le estimation by the two types of input data sources were closely matched as evidenced from the r2 rmse and bias estimates of 0 78 32 1 w m2 3 4 w m2 respectively these results suggest that tru could provide reasonable le estimates at both the regional and site scales since there are no existing reports on urban multi source et models tru model was compared with the three types of single source urban et models including the usebal model faridatul et al 2020 eu model wang et al 2016 and 3t model qiu et al 2017 furthermore it was compared with the two types of dual source models for farmland and natural ecosystems including the tseb model norman et al 1995 yao et al 2016 and the pm mu model mu et al 2007 2011 to ensure the absence of bias in the model intercomparison six satellite based et models were run using the same satellite imageries and meteorological input datasets in the 63 test days fig 12 a presents the scatter plot left and taylor diagram right of the simulated and measured instantaneous le values for the six models tru usebal 3t eu tseb and pm mu fig 12 b presents the scatter plot left and taylor diagram right of the simulated and measured lev le values for three types of dual source models tru tseb and pm mu tables 4 and 5 presents the specific statistics for le and lev le verifications as envisaged from fig 12 a and table 4 the tseb model resulted significant overestimation of le bias of 37 6 w m2 note that systematic overestimation of le by the tseb model also reported in farmland and natural ecosystems e g yao et al 2017 furthermore the relatively poor performances of the 3t and pm mu models demonstrates the reduced applicability and reliability of using a single type of satellite band for the urban areas the pm mu model that does not adopt the thermal infrared band information yielded the highest le estimation error rmse of 84 3 w m2 followed by the 3t urban model which is deprived of visible light and near infrared band that significantly underestimated le bias of 33 4 w m2 moreover the eu model that computes the urban et using a simple empirical regression based approach resulted higher rmse estimate of 66 8 w m2 the performance comparison of the tru and u sebal models provides convincing evidence on the necessity of adopting a multi et source scheme for the urban areas the u sebal improved the urban et simulation performance by integrating the lulc information on the conventional energy balance models however in essence u sebal is still a single source scheme whereas tru with its multi source model conceptualization further improved the performance of urban et simulation as the three types of single source models do not have the capability to partition the et components only the three multi source et models were inter compared for lev le simulation tru tseb and pm mu from fig 12 b and table 5 the improved applicability of tru in instantaneous lev le simulation is justified with rmse estimate of 0 089 followed by the tseb rmse of 0 094 and the pm mu rmse of 0 178 models surprisingly although the tseb and tru exhibited a large performance gap in simulating the le the performance difference is relatively narrower in lev le simulation as seen in the table 5 the intercomparison results indicate that tseb performed slightly inferior to tru a possible reason is that the two models are both based on an iterative procedure for decomposing the lst and achieve et partition norman et al 1995 moreover the pm mu model had the poorest lev le simulation accuracy as depicted from the rmse and bias estimates of 0 178 and 0 27 respectively the pm mu model relies upon the complementary relationship theory to characterize the les which is similar to the physical mechanism of tru model however a significant difference from the tru is that the pm mu mainly uses the relative humidity to reflect soil surface moisture change the large performance gap between tru and pm mu in et partitioning demonstrates the superiority of using ts to delineate the surface wetness by the tru model over the conventional relative humidity parameter to reflect soil surface moisture change in the pm mu model overall in comparison to the existing single source urban et models and dual source et models for farmland and natural ecosystems the proposed customized multi source solution scheme for the urban areas greatly improved the simulation accuracy of et and its components 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of lulc and ndvi determination in the urban et simulation the classification of urban areas into impervious and pervious surfaces based on satellite images faced substantial challenges due to the presence of significant mixed pixels and spectral fusion under various surface conditions wang and li 2019 in practice the impervious and pervious surfaces classification plays a fundamental role in the performance of satellite based urban et models under the unavailability of accurate lulc information the accuracy of the urban et model will be decreased significantly faridatul et al 2020 wang et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 among the existing lulc extraction methods the deep learning based classification method has proven to be more robust and has an excellent range of applicability in the urban environments wang and li 2019 as conceived from the present analysis the kappa coefficient was 92 01 for the cdbn based classification approach which proves that the method successfully extracted the spatial features and different edge information in tianjin the deep learning based approach achieved higher classification accuracy through multi feature extraction and efficient processing in a large and complex feature space data environment however the performance of the cdbn method is primarily confined to the quality and quantity of the training samples the ideal training samples require various surface coverage samples with significant characteristics and a larger number of effective training samples are also necessary to achieve lulc extraction in high accuracy however it is usually difficult to obtain sufficient high quantity and quality training samples for model operations which leads to large uncertainty in the classification results therefore the future improvement of the tru model necessitates improved reliability for lulc extraction which can be achieved by the following measures 1 compare various lulc extraction methods to obtain the most reliable lulc outcomes these methods include the spectral mixture analysis method sma weng et al 2008 the supervised and unsupervised classification method giansante et al 2003 the urban index method coles et al 2017 and the multi source data fusion method luo et al 2018 2 increases in the number of training samples when using supervised unsupervised classification method to extract the urban lulc overall to achieve a high precision urban et simulation accurate assessment of lulc information is an essential prerequisite and requires further performance improvements although the ndvi adopted in the tru model provided satisfactory et prediction accuracy according to the above validation results a recent study raised doubt concerning the linear ndvi transformations sousa and small 2018 the study reported that using ndvi in heterogeneous urban areas has significant limitations the uncertainties come from scaling nonlinearities rolling at moderate to high values and a greater sensitivity to soil and atmospheric effects will lead to inevitable errors in urban et modeling sousa and small 2018 small and milesi 2013 small 2001 as an alternative the spectral mixture analysis sma approach has been proposed and widely applied in the recent few decades adams and smith 1986 small 2001 2003 the sma method fully utilizes the reflectance spectrum information of all the satellite bands rather than the involvement of only few bands in the linear ndvi transformation approach moreover the sma considers the illumination effects and the contribution of reflectance in non vegetation areas thus resulting in significant improvement to et simulation accuracy in the low fc areas furthermore the fc is less sensitive to the spatial resolution of the satellite images in the sma method as the sma uses the area weight linear mixing method on the sub pixel scale processing hence the sma shows more robust performance in a wide range of remote sensing sensors a recent study suggested that the et simulation accuracies of the sebal and surface energy balance system sebs models were improved by 7 and 18 respectively when sma approach was used to estimate the fc li et al 2018 this demonstrated the importance of considering the sub pixel scale heterogeneity by the sma method to estimate the sub pixel scale vegetation fractions to account for the heterogeneity involved with the urban underlying surface areas the coupling of the sma with tru model is inevitable and would certainly improve the accuracy of the urban et simulation to great extent 4 2 limitations of tru and future work although tru model proposed in this research significantly improved the physical process description and urban et simulation performance tru has certain inherent limitations and require further improvements as listed below 1 tru does not circumvent the four types of impedance parameters calculations for each pixel long and singh 2012b suggested that the uncertainty involved in the impedance parameter calculations may cause significant errors in the final le estimates a recent study showed that more complicated impedance calculation would cause larger uncertainty to the final et estimates zhao et al 2020 moreover the underlying uncertainty in the determination of impedance parameters may offset the positive effect of the improved tru physical process description for le simulation to this end more effort is needed to reduce the calculations of impedance parameters or propose a more simplified impedance parameter estimation scheme 2 tru uses beer s law to partition rn to rns and rnv components as shown in eqs 4 5 the uncertainties involved with simplified lai exponential functional method have been widely reported and may bring substantial errors in et simulations norman et al 1995 yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 to effectively reduce the uncertainty involved with the beer s law the improved rn decomposition method proposed by the kustas and norman 1999 which consider the radiation transmission between the canopy and soil could behave as a feasible alternative 3 except for suburb forests and main urban environments no ec and stable water isotope measurements have been conducted for the other urban land uses in this study due to limited time and funding as a result the performance of tru under various urban surface conditions still lacks a comprehensive evaluation such as water body areas and bare soil areas presently there exists more than 500 ec sites across the globe consisting of diversified climates surface conditions http fluxnet ornl gov however the ec observations in the urban areas are scarce and incomplete wang et al 2012 baldocchi 2008 franssen et al 2010 furthermore continuous stable water isotope based field observations in the urban areas have not been reported to date the development of urban et models require extensive ground observations to cause further improvements to the model performance which is the biggest bottleneck in the satellite based urban et models development currently therefore collection of measured et and its component datasets in the urban areas is essential for further improvement in the urban et model performance 4 since the main objective of this research is to understand the physical mechanisms of tru model the urban et and its components were calculated and verified at the instantaneous scale as satellites overpass in this study subsequent research should convert the instantaneous et to daily or monthly estimates based on the existing timescale expansion methods in order to evaluate the tru model s performance across a larger temporal domain nishida et al 2003 sugita and brutsaert 1991 5 conclusions this paper proposes a three source remote sensing et model for the urban areas tru tru categorized urban et between urban soil evaporation urban vegetation transpiration and impervious evaporation the urban impervious and pervious surfaces were divided according to the lulc information a soil evaporation parameterization scheme based on the complementary relationship theory was proposed for tru model the developed tru model was evaluated for tianjin china based on landsat oli etm images across the period of 2017 2020 the major findings of this research are listed as follows 1 tru model validation for instantaneous le simulation across the two ec towers during the 63 cloudless days revealed the rmse estimates of 40 2 w m2 mapd of 10 8 and bias estimate of 10 2 w m2 the results demonstrated that as compared to the existing single source models for urban areas usebal eu and 3t and the dual source models for farmland and natural ecosystems pm mu and tseb tru with its urban three source solution scheme performed the best in urban et simulation 2 the instantaneous lev le estimation by tru was verified with the stable water isotope measurements the rmse mapd and bias estimates were 0 092 12 7 and 0 023 respectively tru outperformed tseb and pm mu in terms of et partitioning which is attributed to the new parameterization scheme for the le and efficient lst decomposition processes 3 the spatial distributions of les and lev exhibited large variations on different test days while the leimp exhibited minor variations and attained lower estimates on different test days the leimp ranged between 0 to 33 6 w m2 with an average estimate of 17 3 w m2 which are considered to be reasonable values the results emphasize the importance of considering the anthropogenic heat in the energy balance equation and independent calculation of le in the imperious areas 4 the future research paradigm needs to further improve the physical mechanism and performance of tru based on the concept of urban lulc extraction coupled sma method in tru and reduced impedance parameters calculation in addition extensive evaluation of the proposed tru model under varying global lulc and climate conditions could justify its improved model robustness and applicability credit authorship

of et partition using stable water isotope method the stable water isotope method was used to partition the et in two sites the soil samples were collected at different soil depths 0 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm the water vapor samples were collected at three levels 5 cm 9 m and 18 m xiao et al 2012 and vegetation sampling from leaves stems and roots all of the samples were collected at land etm satellite transit date the samples were taken at 11 30 12 00 am according to the isotope steady state diffusion assumption this time can also better match with the local satellite passing about 11 57 am vegetation samples of site 1 were taken from locust trees robinia acacia plantation and vegetation samples of site 2 were taken from surrounding landscape trees koelreuteria paniculata the vacuum extraction device was used to extract the liquid water in all of solid samples and the ratio of isotope composition δ18o ratio of heavy 18o h2o to light 16o h2o was tested through a stable water isotope analyzer abb tiwa 912 the isotopic composition of et δet soil evaporation δs and vegetation transpiration δt were calculated based on the keeling plot method wang and yakir 2000 c g model craig and gordon 1965 and the isotope steady state assumption moreira et al 1997 respectively finally the lev le in two sites was determined by the isotope mass conservation theory lev le δet δs δt δs huang and wen 2014 wen et al 2016 3 sensitivity analysis of tru model sensitivity analyses are crucial to understand the impact of various input parameters on model results here the sensitivity of le for seven land types was investigated through increasing decreasing different gradients for each input variables as per sanchez et al 2008 zhan et al 1996 a11 s i 1 l e l e 0 l e 0 100 from le sensitivity results fig 13 fc was found to positively affect le simulations in vegetation covered areas when fc increase 20 le increase 19 5 in farmland 18 7 in forest 19 9 in city garden area and 18 5 in sparsely vegetated areas for sensitive of α results suggested a negative relationship between α and le across the seven types of land use moreover the influence of α on le was observed more significant in a lower and non vegetative areas than in a higher vegetative areas specifically a 20 increase of α would lead to 18 4 le decrease in impervious surfaces 17 9 decrease in bare soil area 18 4 decrease in water body area as a comparison a 15 4 decrease of le was found in farmland a 13 6 decrease in forest and a 14 5 decrease in sparse vegetation area the influence of α on le was through the rn calculation eq 2 a larger α would cause a greater proportion of short wave radiation that returned to the atmosphere lst was negatively correlated with le when lst increased 1 k le decreased an average of 8 8 and a 2 k increase of lst caused average of 17 5 decrease in the seven types of land uses yao et al 2017 reported that a 2 k increase of lst led to 11 4 decrease of le in the tseb model long and singh 2012b found that a 2 k increase of lst could result in le decrease of 28 6 in the ttme model overall the impact of lst on le simulation in tru model was smaller than in ttme model and closer to the tseb model it can be explained by tru and tseb being both based on the iteration process to decompose lst while ttme rely upon the trapezoid framework to decompose lst finally for the sensitive of three types of meteorological factors ta ea and u results suggest ta and u increased the le but ea revealed an inhibitory effect on le a 2 k and 20 increase in ta and u would cause average 11 6 and 11 3 increase in le respectively and a 20 increase of ea caused average 16 2 decrease in the le estimates for seven types of land use long and singh 2012b indicated that a 2 k increase of ta led to a 27 6 increase in le a 20 increase in u and ea resulted 12 2 increase and 3 1 decrease in le respectively compared with ttme model long and singh 2012b tru exhibited more sensitivity to ea and insensitivity to ta indicated that ea plays a fundamental role in the le estimation for tru the ta affect le by affecting the calculation of rn eq 2 a higher ta caused a higher rn and a larger le while a higher ea corresponded to a lower potential evaporation thus caused a negatively impact on le the effect of u on le was mainly reflected in the calculation of impedance parameters a higher u value corresponded to a lower aerodynamic impedance and promote le in summary for le simulation tru was significantly impacted by fc and α and presented a moderate sensitivity to lst and meteorological factors ta ea and u 4 comparison with leimp by tru with other models in theory when there is no rain or road cleaning event watering cart almost all of the available energy on impervious surfaces generates sensible heat flux h and surface heat flux g the leimp value should be close to zero because there is no available water for evaporation therefore the leimp simulation is a good indicator to reflect the performance for the urban et model here we compared the average leimp values in tianjin city estimated by the six urban et models tseb pm mu usebal 3t model and eu fig 14 present the boxplot of the estimated leimp by six models during 63 test days results suggested that due to the lack of independent parameterization schemes for impervious areas the tseb pm mu 3t model and eu model yielded unreasonable leimp values and significantly overestimated leimp two types of urban et models usebal and tru which calculated leimp as an independent module get reasonable leimp estimates the average leimp of 24 5 w m2 by usebal and average leimp of 17 3 w m2 by tru in 63 test days were considered as reasonable values in general the comparison results suggested that it is necessary to calculate le as an independent feature for impervious areas in urban et models 5 comparison of tru model performance with pt jpl and alexi using ecostress data nasa s recent ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress science mission aims to reduce the uncertainty in plant water use and soil water content monitoring fisher et al 2020 to further evaluate the performance of the tru model we compared the le results simulated by the tru based on the ecostress image with priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and atmosphere land exchange inverse model alexi anderson et al 1997 the ecostress was launched to the international space station in jun 2018 the ecostress has an irregular orbit and shooting images continuously between 52 n and 52 s at different times of the day until now there are total of 30 images of ecostress data available in tianjin city the thermal infrared sensor in ecostress contains five bands that ranged from 8 12 5 μm wavelengths three types of et models were driven with the same input data at a spatial resolution of 70 m pixel size of ecostress the flux footprint model was performed to calculate the average flux in the upwind direction of the two ec towers fig 15 presents the scatter plots left and taylor diagrams right of the simulated and measured instantaneous le values by three models based on ecostress data tru pt jpl and alexi during 30 test days overall the best performance for le simulation is the tru model with the r2 of 0 78 rmse of 42 2 w m2 and bias of 2 3 w m2 the pt jpl and alexi shows significant overestimation of le r2 of 0 63 rmse of 49 5 w m2 and bias of 22 4 w m2 for pt jpl and r2 of 0 58 rmse of 57 4 w m2 and bias of 30 1 w m2 for alexi the overestimation of le can be explained as the two models are both based on the improved p t formula to simulate lev to this end they have similar physical mechanisms with the tseb model compared with the empirical p t formula the parameterization scheme of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration proposed in the tru model is more reasonable in le simulation 
188,estimation of urban evapotranspiration et is meaningful for evaluating the urban heat island effect and promoting urban water conservation while multi source satellite based et models for farmland and natural ecosystems have been developed these models lack the object oriented solutions for the urban areas in view of this the present study proposed a three source remote sensing model for urban areas tru to simulate the urban et which can discriminate between urban soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and impervious surface evaporation the new parameterization scheme proposed herein is characterized by the theory of complementary relationship to estimate the urban soil evaporation evaporation losses in the impervious areas were independently estimated in accordance with the distribution of urban land use and land cover lulc the developed tru model was evaluated for 63 cloud free test days in tianjin china by using 30 m landsat operational land imager oli enhanced thematic mapper plus etm images the outcomes of this study revealed a root mean square error rmse of 40 2 w m2 and a bias of 10 8 w m2 compared with the two eddy correlation ec observations for the instantaneous latent heat flux le simulation moreover the rmse and bias were 0 092 and 0 023 respectively in simulating the vegetation latent heat flux fraction lev le when verified with respect to the stable water isotope measurements due to limited water availability the impervious urban surface evaporation magnitude was found quite low with minimal variation on different test days the results emphasize the importance of coupling lulc information in the urban et modeling conceptualization certainly the tru model improved the et simulation accuracy in urban areas and could facilitate the mapping of urban et components at high spatial resolution keywords urban evapotranspiration three source model impervious surface evaporation complementary relationship et partition 1 introduction

vinukollu et al 2011a 2012 song et al 2016 yao et al 2017 chen et al 2020c although significant improvements in the development of satellite based et models for farmland and natural ecosystems regions have been derived customized et models for urban areas are still sparse in the literature the primary differences between the urban and farmland or natural ecosystem areas lie in the presence of large proportions of impervious surfaces and anthropogenic activities in the urban areas kuang and dou 2020 kuang and yan 2018 furthermore the surface conditions in the urban areas are highly complex and heterogeneous resulting in regional scale urban et simulation being quite challenging wong et al 2015 wang et al 2016 faridatul et al 2020 limited numbers of satellite based urban et models exist in the literature with single source schemes being more prevalent examples include the surface energy balance algorithm of the urban usebal model faridatul et al 2020 the empirical urban et eu model wang et al 2016 and the three temperature urban et 3t model qiu et al 2017 the relatively simple physical mechanism used in the single source models leads to non functionality of the acquisition of the et components in urban areas the primary bottleneck of the satellite based two source modeling approach lies in their lack of reliable parameterization schemes for soil evaporation and impervious evaporation estimation in the two source models the soil evaporation is usually estimated as the residual component of the energy balance equation such as in the tseb model norman et al 1995 anderson et al 2008 or are based on the relationships with air humidity such as pm mu model mu et al 2007 2011 since these parametric schemes do not accurately capture the rapid changes in the soil surface wetness they tend to result in high uncertainty in the et simulation gao et al 2016 therefore the current soil evaporation parametric scheme and two source et model cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous urban regions furthermore in the handful of urban et models evaporation rates from urban impervious surfaces are usually calculated in the same manner as that of other urban land surface types which results in significant overestimates of et simulation wang et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 another obstacle is the lack of long term field observations based on eddy correlation ec and stable water isotope technology in urban areas that continuously measure urban et and its components these limitations certainly hinder the development and evaluation of multi source urban et models the development of urban et models began with grimmond and oke 1991 with estimates of the urban et in the vancouver canada using the energy balance method further liu et al 2010 developed a customized satellite imagery based urban et model by modifying the energy balance equation and selecting the hot cold pixels from the satellite imagery and subsequently mapping the et distribution in oklahoma us to further simplify the complexity in the model structure and to better characterize the heterogeneity of urban surfaces wang et al 2016 proposed an empirical urban et eu model combined with spectroradiometer derived data to estimate the et in phoenix us the eu model highlighted the importance of using land use and land cover lulc information in the urban et calculations to reduce the input parameters in the urban et models qiu et al 2017 developed a three temperature et 3t model which relied only upon the remote sensing thermal infrared band to retrieve the urban et the performance of the 3t model was tested with the et measurements using the bowen ratio method for shenzhen china recently faridatul et al 2020 developed a surface energy balance algorithm for urban areas usebal for which the model was modified from the conventional single source model sebal and applied in dhaka bangladesh however due to the lack of ground et measurements the performance of the usebal model was not adequately evaluated in light of the above discussions the common issues pertaining to the urban et model are identified as follows 1 urban soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration are not partitioned in the single source urban et models 2 lack of reasonable parameterization scheme for et estimation for the impervious surfaces 3 performance of the existing urban et models has not been rigorously evaluated and 4 the existing urban et model variants are solely based on the mechanism of a single source et model for the farmland and natural ecosystems which ignores the heterogeneity involved with the urban surfaces to facilitate the mapping of the urban et components and to fill the existing research gap between the et simulations in the farmland natural ecosystems and urban areas the present study was undertaken with the following specific objectives 1 to develop a three source urban et model tru that accounts for the et from impervious urban areas soil surfaces and vegetation surfaces 2 to verify the performance of the developed tru model with the ec and stable water isotope based measurements in tianjin china 3 to provide clear insight about the spatial patterns of the urban et components 4 to compare the developed tru model performance with the existing five satellite based et models and 5 to make a comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and limitations of the tru model 2 model formulation 2 1 tru model structure and development to distinguish between the relative contributions of the soil surfaces vegetation canopy and impervious areas to urban et simulation it is assumed that the urban impervious surfaces e g buildings and transportation areas and pervious surfaces e g forests cultivated fields sparse vegetation bare soil and water bodies exhibit a mutually independent evaporation processes long and singh 2012 yang and shang 2013 first tru divides the impervious surfaces and pervious surfaces according to the lulc the lulc characteristics were retrieved from the landsat oli images using the deep learning classification method convolutional deep belief network cdbn wang and li 2019 in tru the et from the impervious surfaces is parameterized as a single evaporation process while the et from the pervious surfaces is described as a two source processes i e soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration the patch based model mechanism has been widely adopted and verified in the conventional two source et models for farmland and natural ecosystem yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 the detailed model structure of the proposed tru model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 1 et parameterization scheme for pervious surfaces to estimate et from the pervious surfaces tru adopts a newly developed two source

scaled down using the relative evaporative fraction coefficient ref the value of ref depends on the degree of wetness of the soil surface gan et al 2019 wherein a higher soil moisture content corresponds to a large value of ref the expression of ref is given as eq 12 12 r e f 1 1 a exp b s d i in eq 12 a and b are the two empirical parameters unitless where a and b are set as 0 028 and 8

1989 and ep is the atmospheric drying power w m2 as shown in eq 13 the original ep parameterization scheme mainly relied upon the differences in the air humidity to reflect the water content of the soil surface granger and gray 1989 shown as eq 13 however the air humidity exhibits very poor interactions with the surface soil moisture and ts has a faster response to soil moisture changes a higher ts corresponds to a lower soil surface moisture and a lower soil evaporation and vice versa to reflect the soil surface wetness using ts is a better alternative in the satellite based et models gan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 replaced ep with the total latent heat flux lesa w m2 and integrated ts into the lesa parametric scheme the expression for lesa is shown as eq 14 further sdi is transformed as sdi lesa lesa rns g gan et al 2019 the final les is calculated using eq 15 the newly parameterization scheme for les circumvents the need for soil moisture data allowing the model to be

activities hence the contribution of the urban anthropogenic flux a w m2 to the surface energy balance equation cannot be ignored a is generated by automobile exhaust metabolism and industrial plants the le of the impervious surfaces leimp w m2 is parameterized using eq 20 20 l e i m p ρ c p γ v p d r a r i m p where rimp is the impervious surface resistance s m which is estimated using eq 21

respectively a can be determined using eq 22 based on the energy budget 22 a l e i m p h i m p g i m p r n i m p a summary of the input variables adopted for the tru model is presented in table 2 2 2 study area to evaluate the performance of tru model tianjin city china which is located between longitudes 116 43 e to 118 04 e and latitudes 38 34n to 40 15 n is chosen as the study area tianjin is a megacity in northern china with a total area of 11 966 km2 and has a population of 15 6 million tianjin has a semi humid monsoon type climatology with annual average ta magnitude of 14 c 2 m height and the annual average precipitation of 580 mm approximately 25 of the city is covered by impervious land which are mostly distributed in the central and southeast coastal regions the geographical location of tianjin and existing land use information is presented in fig 3 2 3 field observations two open path ec systems gives continuous measurements of le and h at two field sites located in the tianjin city site 1 was established on the campus of nankai university in the southern part of the city 38 59 n 117 20 e altitude 3 m the ec tower height is 10 m and the underlying surface is a locust forest land with an average plant height of 7 8 m site 2 was established at the central main urban area with ec height of 10 m 39 05 n 117 18 e altitude 7 m the underlying surface is a mixed area comprised of forestland and 78 impervious land the spatial distribution of the flux footprints around the two ec towers on 23 jan 2017 are shown in fig 4 the two ec systems automatically collected the samples at 10 hz and the ec device contained a laser gas concentration analyzer li cor inc usa and a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the le h co2 flux bowen ratio rh es ea and vpd data were averaged over a period of 30 mins the g was measured using the plate method at the two sites hfp01 netherlands where the installation depth of the soil heat flux plates was 5 mm lu et al 2018 furthermore the stable water isotope method was adopted to partition the et into soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration at the two test locations for a detailed overview of the stable water isotope sampling and modeling procedure please refer to appendix 2 2 4 satellite and ancillary data a total of 63 cloud free test days were selected during the experimental period the landsat oli etm images were downloaded from the united states geological survey website usgs http glovis usgs gov it is noted that the cloud free period was defined as less than 13 cloud coverage during the satellite overpass time as obtained from the usgs s official website the selection of the test date took into consideration of both the cloud obstruction and the ec energy closure the ec system has the problem of unclosed energy balance le h rn g which ensures the energy closure ratio larger than 0 8 for all selected test days the residual energy balance re method was performed to rectify the energy closure twine et al 2000 the original resolutions of the visible light and near infrared bands of the landsat oli sensor were 30 m whereas the original resolution of the thermal infrared band of the landsat etm sensor was 60 m the collected satellite images spanned for the period 2017 to 2020 and were resampled further to a spatial resolution of 30 m in order to retrieve a part of the input parameters ndvi lst and α for tru model the atmospheric corrections of the landsat oli etm imagery were conducted using the polymer method pahlevan et al 2019 the specific dates and energy closure information adopted in tru model verification are presented in table s1 moreover the meteorological inputs such as ra ta u ea and rh were observed at the 41 meteorological stations within the city at a temporal resolution of half hour since the lst serves as a central input to tru model ground verification of landsat derived lst is highly essential at sites 1 and 2 a hobo automatic temperature probe was used to measure the lst around the two ec towers onset inc usa the verification outputs revealed that the satellite based lst could provide reliable ground lst retrieval with a root mean square error rmse of 0 76 k but slightly underestimated with a bias estimate of 0 69 k table s1 3 results and analysis 3 1 validation of the tru using ec measurements four surface energy balance components rn g le and h at an instantaneous time scale were verified with the ground ec observations in the 63 test days during the period of 2017 2020 to better match the le observations at the satellite pixel scale the flux footprint model was adopted to average the fluxes in the upwind direction of the two ec towers choi et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2009 fig 5 presents the scatter plots of the measured and simulated four energy balance components and table 3 depicts the specific statistical performance evaluation indices as envisaged from fig 5 and table 3 tru provided reliable rn and g estimates on the 63 test days yielding an rmse of 24 8 w m2 a mean absolute percentage difference mapd of 4 7 and a bias of 9 6 w m2 for rn simulation the slight overestimation of the rn could be attributed to the underestimation of the lst refer to table s1 which certainly led to the underestimation of the surface longwave radiation eq 2 tru has lower rmse and mapd estimates when compared with several other urban et models which is primarily attributed to the improved conceptualization of ε in the rn calculation eq 3 jassas et al 2015 wagle et al 2017 moreover g was calculated using the empirical relationship with rn shown as eq 8 yielded the rmse mapd and bias estimates of 12 2 w m2 8 5 and 5 6 w m2 respectively the instantaneous le simulated using tru agrees well with the two ec observations with rmse estimate of 40 2 w m2 mapd of 10 2 and bias of 10 8 w m2 for individual test days the day of year doy 127 in 2019 had the lowest deviation compared with ec observations for le simulation the rmse was 27 3 w m2 for doy 127 in 2019 however the doy 189 in 2019 had the largest deviation with an rmse value of 65 7 w m2 for le simulation which may be due to atmospheric advection effect in that day furthermore the tru was demonstrated to have the capability to discriminate the le across different seasons the estimated le values varied in the range of 53 2 w m2 to 372 3 w m2 with a median of 185 7 w m2 across the 63 test days the large variation range of simulated le proved the applicability of the tru approach in capturing the seasonal variations of the urban et similarly the verification of h revealed rmse estimate of 43 5 w m2 mapd of 11 4 and bias of 9 6 w m2 on the 63 test days the results of h verification exhibit the similar performance to that of le furthermore it is evident that the observed and estimated le values at the site 1 were significantly higher than site 2 conversely the observed and estimated h values at the site 1 were significantly lower than the site 2 this is due to the underlying surface around site 1 being mainly composed of vegetation and soil and available water to evaporate exists which increase le whereas since the impervious surfaces occupies the major portion of the areas around the site 2 most of the available energy generates h thereby increasing the air temperature unlike several other two source et models that calculate le h as the residual part of the surface energy budget norman et al 1995 long and singh 2012b yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 tru never exhibited a biased performance for the le h simulation which could be attributed to the fact that le and h were equally treated in the tru model the reliable simulations of le and h revealed that tru has great potential to be applied in the farmland and natural ecosystems due to the benefits of the newly developed le parametric scheme 3 2 validation of the tru using stable water isotope measurements the ratio of the vegetation latent heat flux to the latent heat flux lev le as simulated by tru model was verified with stable water isotope measurements at the two test sites to the best of our knowledge no past study has evaluated the performance of urban et model based on the stable water isotope measurements fig 6 a presents the scatterplot of the estimated and simulated instantaneous lev le values at the two test sites fig 6 b and c shows the changes of lev le with ndvi at the two test sites across the 63 test days respectively as envisaged from fig 6a b and c a good consistency was observed between the lev le simulations and observed counterparts as depicted from table 3 the rmse mapd and bias estimates are 0 092 12 7 and 0 023 respectively in lev le estimation moreover both tru model and the stable water isotope measurements successfully captured the dynamics of lev le variation with the ndvi changes in different test days the simulated lev le values at site 1 varied in the range of 0 36 to 0 98 with a median magnitude of 0 62 during the 63 test days while the corresponding variation at the site 2 varied in the range of 0 08 to 0 56 with a median value of 0 28 furthermore it was found that the observed and estimated lev le were significantly higher at site 1 than at site 2 which is explained by the higher vegetation coverage around the site 1 however it should be noted that the lev le on the four test days were significantly underestimated by tru model black dots in fig 6 a due to the lack of detailed atmospheric process information the source of discrepancy and underestimation on the four test days remained unknown however some past studies have reported that the stable water isotope method usually associated with higher lev le estimates when compared with other et partition methods such as sap flow and lysimeter wen et al 2016 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 3 3 spatial patterns of lev les and leimp fig 7 represents the spatial patterns of lev les and leimp in tianjin on the six test days 8 aug 2018 7 sep 2018 15 jan 2019 8 jun 2019 12 sep 2019 and 24 dec 2019 these test days reflect the variation in spatial distribution of urban lev les and leimp in different seasons as envisaged from figs 3 and 7 the vegetation cover in the urban suburbs was dominated by deciduous plants corresponding to high magnitude of lev during the spring and summer and lower magnitudes in the autumn and winter the lev estimates in the urban suburbs exhibited a wide range of seasonal variation throughout the analysis period in the case of a lower fc and predominantly planted by evergreen vegetation the magnitude of lev in main urban area was relatively lower than the suburban areas and exhibiting minor seasonal variations fig 7 for spatial patterns of les the higher value of les was mostly noticed in waterbody regions such as the yuqiao reservoir in the northern part of tianjin 2060 km2 black triangle and the floodplains and depressions regions of the southern region sporadically distributed red mapped areas in fig 7 in addition to the water body areas the higher les value are also prevalent in the bare soil regions for seasonal change of les the lower variations in the les values were observed in the spring and summer season because of the higher fc value in the corresponding seasons conversely the higher les values were observed in the autumn and winter due to the large areal coverage of bare soil and lower fc furthermore as compared to the suburban areas the les exhibited a smaller variation range for central main urban area in different seasons for lev and les distribution in various land use types the lev was found to be decreasing in the order of forest area 265 4 44 1 w m2 farmland 238 7 60 1 w m2 city gardens 212 5 62 2 w m2 sparse vegetation 201 7 46 8 w m2 and bare soil 168 9 28 7 w m2 the les was ranked in the decreasing order of waterbodies 388 9 76 8 w m2 bare soil 210 9 39 7 w m2 farmland 182 4 25 1 w m2 city gardens 120 1 43 3 w m2 and forest 85 5 33 6 w m2 fig 8 fig 9 provides an expanded view of the lev and les estimates surrounding the ec tower at the site 1 where each color map in fig 9 c contains 8 12 pixels generally the lev and les in the nearby locust forest regions were higher than those in the central road area theoretically since the roads are primarily covered by bare soil the les of the central road should be equal or higher than that of the nearby locust forest regions actually the compactness of the soil surface is greatly increased due to the high frequent movement of vehicles and humans on the road causing the surface soil moisture to decrease and lower les magnitude as a proof of concept this explains the differences in the spatial distributions of the lev and les in the road and nearby locust forest regions for evaporation estimation in the impervious areas the leimp exhibited less variation on different test days the average and maximum leimp values were found to be 17 3 w m2 and 33 6 w m2 respectively on the 63 test days figs 7 and 8 the leimp depicting relatively lower magnitude corresponding to the lev and les which is attributed to zero rainfall event during the six mapping days causing limited water to evaporate from the impervious surfaces fig 10 illustrates the spatial distribution of the le in the two typical test locations of tianjin on two test days in fig 10 a the central region is constituted by large farmland areas surrounded by impervious surfaces while fig 10 b shows a coastal region in tianjin wherein the farmland area is located in the central eastern area and the western area is mostly covered by impervious surfaces as depicted from fig 10 the le estimates in the farmland reached 300 400 w m2 while the le values of the impervious surfaces were less than 30 w m2 the reasonable le patterns in these two test regions is a solid evidence that tru successfully captured the spatial variations of le in the regions having both pervious and impervious surfaces 3 4 compare tru model performance with other models to further evaluate the performance of the tru model the outcomes of the tru model were compared with five satellite based et models prior to the model comparison we verified the le estimates using tru and satellite images and the le estimates using tru and meteorological observations on 63 test days see fig 11 overall the instantaneous le estimation by the two types of input data sources were closely matched as evidenced from the r2 rmse and bias estimates of 0 78 32 1 w m2 3 4 w m2 respectively these results suggest that tru could provide reasonable le estimates at both the regional and site scales since there are no existing reports on urban multi source et models tru model was compared with the three types of single source urban et models including the usebal model faridatul et al 2020 eu model wang et al 2016 and 3t model qiu et al 2017 furthermore it was compared with the two types of dual source models for farmland and natural ecosystems including the tseb model norman et al 1995 yao et al 2016 and the pm mu model mu et al 2007 2011 to ensure the absence of bias in the model intercomparison six satellite based et models were run using the same satellite imageries and meteorological input datasets in the 63 test days fig 12 a presents the scatter plot left and taylor diagram right of the simulated and measured instantaneous le values for the six models tru usebal 3t eu tseb and pm mu fig 12 b presents the scatter plot left and taylor diagram right of the simulated and measured lev le values for three types of dual source models tru tseb and pm mu tables 4 and 5 presents the specific statistics for le and lev le verifications as envisaged from fig 12 a and table 4 the tseb model resulted significant overestimation of le bias of 37 6 w m2 note that systematic overestimation of le by the tseb model also reported in farmland and natural ecosystems e g yao et al 2017 furthermore the relatively poor performances of the 3t and pm mu models demonstrates the reduced applicability and reliability of using a single type of satellite band for the urban areas the pm mu model that does not adopt the thermal infrared band information yielded the highest le estimation error rmse of 84 3 w m2 followed by the 3t urban model which is deprived of visible light and near infrared band that significantly underestimated le bias of 33 4 w m2 moreover the eu model that computes the urban et using a simple empirical regression based approach resulted higher rmse estimate of 66 8 w m2 the performance comparison of the tru and u sebal models provides convincing evidence on the necessity of adopting a multi et source scheme for the urban areas the u sebal improved the urban et simulation performance by integrating the lulc information on the conventional energy balance models however in essence u sebal is still a single source scheme whereas tru with its multi source model conceptualization further improved the performance of urban et simulation as the three types of single source models do not have the capability to partition the et components only the three multi source et models were inter compared for lev le simulation tru tseb and pm mu from fig 12 b and table 5 the improved applicability of tru in instantaneous lev le simulation is justified with rmse estimate of 0 089 followed by the tseb rmse of 0 094 and the pm mu rmse of 0 178 models surprisingly although the tseb and tru exhibited a large performance gap in simulating the le the performance difference is relatively narrower in lev le simulation as seen in the table 5 the intercomparison results indicate that tseb performed slightly inferior to tru a possible reason is that the two models are both based on an iterative procedure for decomposing the lst and achieve et partition norman et al 1995 moreover the pm mu model had the poorest lev le simulation accuracy as depicted from the rmse and bias estimates of 0 178 and 0 27 respectively the pm mu model relies upon the complementary relationship theory to characterize the les which is similar to the physical mechanism of tru model however a significant difference from the tru is that the pm mu mainly uses the relative humidity to reflect soil surface moisture change the large performance gap between tru and pm mu in et partitioning demonstrates the superiority of using ts to delineate the surface wetness by the tru model over the conventional relative humidity parameter to reflect soil surface moisture change in the pm mu model overall in comparison to the existing single source urban et models and dual source et models for farmland and natural ecosystems the proposed customized multi source solution scheme for the urban areas greatly improved the simulation accuracy of et and its components 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of lulc and ndvi determination in the urban et simulation the classification of urban areas into impervious and pervious surfaces based on satellite images faced substantial challenges due to the presence of significant mixed pixels and spectral fusion under various surface conditions wang and li 2019 in practice the impervious and pervious surfaces classification plays a fundamental role in the performance of satellite based urban et models under the unavailability of accurate lulc information the accuracy of the urban et model will be decreased significantly faridatul et al 2020 wang et al 2016 qiu et al 2017 among the existing lulc extraction methods the deep learning based classification method has proven to be more robust and has an excellent range of applicability in the urban environments wang and li 2019 as conceived from the present analysis the kappa coefficient was 92 01 for the cdbn based classification approach which proves that the method successfully extracted the spatial features and different edge information in tianjin the deep learning based approach achieved higher classification accuracy through multi feature extraction and efficient processing in a large and complex feature space data environment however the performance of the cdbn method is primarily confined to the quality and quantity of the training samples the ideal training samples require various surface coverage samples with significant characteristics and a larger number of effective training samples are also necessary to achieve lulc extraction in high accuracy however it is usually difficult to obtain sufficient high quantity and quality training samples for model operations which leads to large uncertainty in the classification results therefore the future improvement of the tru model necessitates improved reliability for lulc extraction which can be achieved by the following measures 1 compare various lulc extraction methods to obtain the most reliable lulc outcomes these methods include the spectral mixture analysis method sma weng et al 2008 the supervised and unsupervised classification method giansante et al 2003 the urban index method coles et al 2017 and the multi source data fusion method luo et al 2018 2 increases in the number of training samples when using supervised unsupervised classification method to extract the urban lulc overall to achieve a high precision urban et simulation accurate assessment of lulc information is an essential prerequisite and requires further performance improvements although the ndvi adopted in the tru model provided satisfactory et prediction accuracy according to the above validation results a recent study raised doubt concerning the linear ndvi transformations sousa and small 2018 the study reported that using ndvi in heterogeneous urban areas has significant limitations the uncertainties come from scaling nonlinearities rolling at moderate to high values and a greater sensitivity to soil and atmospheric effects will lead to inevitable errors in urban et modeling sousa and small 2018 small and milesi 2013 small 2001 as an alternative the spectral mixture analysis sma approach has been proposed and widely applied in the recent few decades adams and smith 1986 small 2001 2003 the sma method fully utilizes the reflectance spectrum information of all the satellite bands rather than the involvement of only few bands in the linear ndvi transformation approach moreover the sma considers the illumination effects and the contribution of reflectance in non vegetation areas thus resulting in significant improvement to et simulation accuracy in the low fc areas furthermore the fc is less sensitive to the spatial resolution of the satellite images in the sma method as the sma uses the area weight linear mixing method on the sub pixel scale processing hence the sma shows more robust performance in a wide range of remote sensing sensors a recent study suggested that the et simulation accuracies of the sebal and surface energy balance system sebs models were improved by 7 and 18 respectively when sma approach was used to estimate the fc li et al 2018 this demonstrated the importance of considering the sub pixel scale heterogeneity by the sma method to estimate the sub pixel scale vegetation fractions to account for the heterogeneity involved with the urban underlying surface areas the coupling of the sma with tru model is inevitable and would certainly improve the accuracy of the urban et simulation to great extent 4 2 limitations of tru and future work although tru model proposed in this research significantly improved the physical process description and urban et simulation performance tru has certain inherent limitations and require further improvements as listed below 1 tru does not circumvent the four types of impedance parameters calculations for each pixel long and singh 2012b suggested that the uncertainty involved in the impedance parameter calculations may cause significant errors in the final le estimates a recent study showed that more complicated impedance calculation would cause larger uncertainty to the final et estimates zhao et al 2020 moreover the underlying uncertainty in the determination of impedance parameters may offset the positive effect of the improved tru physical process description for le simulation to this end more effort is needed to reduce the calculations of impedance parameters or propose a more simplified impedance parameter estimation scheme 2 tru uses beer s law to partition rn to rns and rnv components as shown in eqs 4 5 the uncertainties involved with simplified lai exponential functional method have been widely reported and may bring substantial errors in et simulations norman et al 1995 yang and shang 2013 yao et al 2017 to effectively reduce the uncertainty involved with the beer s law the improved rn decomposition method proposed by the kustas and norman 1999 which consider the radiation transmission between the canopy and soil could behave as a feasible alternative 3 except for suburb forests and main urban environments no ec and stable water isotope measurements have been conducted for the other urban land uses in this study due to limited time and funding as a result the performance of tru under various urban surface conditions still lacks a comprehensive evaluation such as water body areas and bare soil areas presently there exists more than 500 ec sites across the globe consisting of diversified climates surface conditions http fluxnet ornl gov however the ec observations in the urban areas are scarce and incomplete wang et al 2012 baldocchi 2008 franssen et al 2010 furthermore continuous stable water isotope based field observations in the urban areas have not been reported to date the development of urban et models require extensive ground observations to cause further improvements to the model performance which is the biggest bottleneck in the satellite based urban et models development currently therefore collection of measured et and its component datasets in the urban areas is essential for further improvement in the urban et model performance 4 since the main objective of this research is to understand the physical mechanisms of tru model the urban et and its components were calculated and verified at the instantaneous scale as satellites overpass in this study subsequent research should convert the instantaneous et to daily or monthly estimates based on the existing timescale expansion methods in order to evaluate the tru model s performance across a larger temporal domain nishida et al 2003 sugita and brutsaert 1991 5 conclusions this paper proposes a three source remote sensing et model for the urban areas tru tru categorized urban et between urban soil evaporation urban vegetation transpiration and impervious evaporation the urban impervious and pervious surfaces were divided according to the lulc information a soil evaporation parameterization scheme based on the complementary relationship theory was proposed for tru model the developed tru model was evaluated for tianjin china based on landsat oli etm images across the period of 2017 2020 the major findings of this research are listed as follows 1 tru model validation for instantaneous le simulation across the two ec towers during the 63 cloudless days revealed the rmse estimates of 40 2 w m2 mapd of 10 8 and bias estimate of 10 2 w m2 the results demonstrated that as compared to the existing single source models for urban areas usebal eu and 3t and the dual source models for farmland and natural ecosystems pm mu and tseb tru with its urban three source solution scheme performed the best in urban et simulation 2 the instantaneous lev le estimation by tru was verified with the stable water isotope measurements the rmse mapd and bias estimates were 0 092 12 7 and 0 023 respectively tru outperformed tseb and pm mu in terms of et partitioning which is attributed to the new parameterization scheme for the le and efficient lst decomposition processes 3 the spatial distributions of les and lev exhibited large variations on different test days while the leimp exhibited minor variations and attained lower estimates on different test days the leimp ranged between 0 to 33 6 w m2 with an average estimate of 17 3 w m2 which are considered to be reasonable values the results emphasize the importance of considering the anthropogenic heat in the energy balance equation and independent calculation of le in the imperious areas 4 the future research paradigm needs to further improve the physical mechanism and performance of tru based on the concept of urban lulc extraction coupled sma method in tru and reduced impedance parameters calculation in addition extensive evaluation of the proposed tru model under varying global lulc and climate conditions could justify its improved model robustness and applicability credit authorship

of et partition using stable water isotope method the stable water isotope method was used to partition the et in two sites the soil samples were collected at different soil depths 0 5 cm 10 cm and 20 cm the water vapor samples were collected at three levels 5 cm 9 m and 18 m xiao et al 2012 and vegetation sampling from leaves stems and roots all of the samples were collected at land etm satellite transit date the samples were taken at 11 30 12 00 am according to the isotope steady state diffusion assumption this time can also better match with the local satellite passing about 11 57 am vegetation samples of site 1 were taken from locust trees robinia acacia plantation and vegetation samples of site 2 were taken from surrounding landscape trees koelreuteria paniculata the vacuum extraction device was used to extract the liquid water in all of solid samples and the ratio of isotope composition δ18o ratio of heavy 18o h2o to light 16o h2o was tested through a stable water isotope analyzer abb tiwa 912 the isotopic composition of et δet soil evaporation δs and vegetation transpiration δt were calculated based on the keeling plot method wang and yakir 2000 c g model craig and gordon 1965 and the isotope steady state assumption moreira et al 1997 respectively finally the lev le in two sites was determined by the isotope mass conservation theory lev le δet δs δt δs huang and wen 2014 wen et al 2016 3 sensitivity analysis of tru model sensitivity analyses are crucial to understand the impact of various input parameters on model results here the sensitivity of le for seven land types was investigated through increasing decreasing different gradients for each input variables as per sanchez et al 2008 zhan et al 1996 a11 s i 1 l e l e 0 l e 0 100 from le sensitivity results fig 13 fc was found to positively affect le simulations in vegetation covered areas when fc increase 20 le increase 19 5 in farmland 18 7 in forest 19 9 in city garden area and 18 5 in sparsely vegetated areas for sensitive of α results suggested a negative relationship between α and le across the seven types of land use moreover the influence of α on le was observed more significant in a lower and non vegetative areas than in a higher vegetative areas specifically a 20 increase of α would lead to 18 4 le decrease in impervious surfaces 17 9 decrease in bare soil area 18 4 decrease in water body area as a comparison a 15 4 decrease of le was found in farmland a 13 6 decrease in forest and a 14 5 decrease in sparse vegetation area the influence of α on le was through the rn calculation eq 2 a larger α would cause a greater proportion of short wave radiation that returned to the atmosphere lst was negatively correlated with le when lst increased 1 k le decreased an average of 8 8 and a 2 k increase of lst caused average of 17 5 decrease in the seven types of land uses yao et al 2017 reported that a 2 k increase of lst led to 11 4 decrease of le in the tseb model long and singh 2012b found that a 2 k increase of lst could result in le decrease of 28 6 in the ttme model overall the impact of lst on le simulation in tru model was smaller than in ttme model and closer to the tseb model it can be explained by tru and tseb being both based on the iteration process to decompose lst while ttme rely upon the trapezoid framework to decompose lst finally for the sensitive of three types of meteorological factors ta ea and u results suggest ta and u increased the le but ea revealed an inhibitory effect on le a 2 k and 20 increase in ta and u would cause average 11 6 and 11 3 increase in le respectively and a 20 increase of ea caused average 16 2 decrease in the le estimates for seven types of land use long and singh 2012b indicated that a 2 k increase of ta led to a 27 6 increase in le a 20 increase in u and ea resulted 12 2 increase and 3 1 decrease in le respectively compared with ttme model long and singh 2012b tru exhibited more sensitivity to ea and insensitivity to ta indicated that ea plays a fundamental role in the le estimation for tru the ta affect le by affecting the calculation of rn eq 2 a higher ta caused a higher rn and a larger le while a higher ea corresponded to a lower potential evaporation thus caused a negatively impact on le the effect of u on le was mainly reflected in the calculation of impedance parameters a higher u value corresponded to a lower aerodynamic impedance and promote le in summary for le simulation tru was significantly impacted by fc and α and presented a moderate sensitivity to lst and meteorological factors ta ea and u 4 comparison with leimp by tru with other models in theory when there is no rain or road cleaning event watering cart almost all of the available energy on impervious surfaces generates sensible heat flux h and surface heat flux g the leimp value should be close to zero because there is no available water for evaporation therefore the leimp simulation is a good indicator to reflect the performance for the urban et model here we compared the average leimp values in tianjin city estimated by the six urban et models tseb pm mu usebal 3t model and eu fig 14 present the boxplot of the estimated leimp by six models during 63 test days results suggested that due to the lack of independent parameterization schemes for impervious areas the tseb pm mu 3t model and eu model yielded unreasonable leimp values and significantly overestimated leimp two types of urban et models usebal and tru which calculated leimp as an independent module get reasonable leimp estimates the average leimp of 24 5 w m2 by usebal and average leimp of 17 3 w m2 by tru in 63 test days were considered as reasonable values in general the comparison results suggested that it is necessary to calculate le as an independent feature for impervious areas in urban et models 5 comparison of tru model performance with pt jpl and alexi using ecostress data nasa s recent ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress science mission aims to reduce the uncertainty in plant water use and soil water content monitoring fisher et al 2020 to further evaluate the performance of the tru model we compared the le results simulated by the tru based on the ecostress image with priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and atmosphere land exchange inverse model alexi anderson et al 1997 the ecostress was launched to the international space station in jun 2018 the ecostress has an irregular orbit and shooting images continuously between 52 n and 52 s at different times of the day until now there are total of 30 images of ecostress data available in tianjin city the thermal infrared sensor in ecostress contains five bands that ranged from 8 12 5 μm wavelengths three types of et models were driven with the same input data at a spatial resolution of 70 m pixel size of ecostress the flux footprint model was performed to calculate the average flux in the upwind direction of the two ec towers fig 15 presents the scatter plots left and taylor diagrams right of the simulated and measured instantaneous le values by three models based on ecostress data tru pt jpl and alexi during 30 test days overall the best performance for le simulation is the tru model with the r2 of 0 78 rmse of 42 2 w m2 and bias of 2 3 w m2 the pt jpl and alexi shows significant overestimation of le r2 of 0 63 rmse of 49 5 w m2 and bias of 22 4 w m2 for pt jpl and r2 of 0 58 rmse of 57 4 w m2 and bias of 30 1 w m2 for alexi the overestimation of le can be explained as the two models are both based on the improved p t formula to simulate lev to this end they have similar physical mechanisms with the tseb model compared with the empirical p t formula the parameterization scheme of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration proposed in the tru model is more reasonable in le simulation 
189,despite a detailed knowledge of the spatial temporal dynamics of irrigation being necessary to optimize the agricultural production without exacerbating the pressure exercised on the water resource such information is still often lacking worldwide in this study a double scale analysis on the detectability of the irrigation occurrence over an area in central italy through remote sensing soil moisture is proposed the period of interest is a 3 year time span from 2017 to 2019 the detectability of district or sub district scale irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture data is investigated at two different spatial resolutions 1 km and plot scale three soil moisture products sampled at 1 km resolution are evaluated a dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change downscaled version of smap soil moisture active passive and two sentinel 1 derived products namely the 1 km version delivered by copernicus and a plot scale born version developed by theia and aggregated at 1 km the theia sentinel 1 product aggregated at 100 m is used in the plot scale analysis over the study area the irrigation extent is determined by the fragmentation of the agricultural fields and the complex topography making the adoption of plot scale data necessary satisfactory results are obtained by comparing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution produced through the k means clustering algorithm with ground truth data since the method fails only once out of seven in properly reproducing the irrigated or non irrigated conditions occurred over four pilot agricultural fields graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords irrigation detection irrigation mapping remote sensing soil moisture temporal stability land surface modeling k means algorithm 1 introduction the role played by irrigation in the economy of the hydrological balance over anthropized basins is not negligible in fact in the context of the significant anthropogenic interventions on the natural systems that have led many scientists to classify the current era as the anthropocene steffen et al 2011 montanari et al 2013 savenije et al 2014 the irrigation is recognized as a primary source of global freshwater consumption it affects not only the availability of water resources but food production and climate also as an example it is documented that heavily irrigated areas are affected by evaporative cooling phenomena moore and rojstaczer 2002 kueppers et al 2007 during the past decades the intensification of irrigation practices made possible a doubling of the agricultural production despite an increase of cropland by only 12 rosegrant et al 2002 gleick 2003 this trend is expected to be further strengthened during the upcoming years the challenging scenario foreseen for the near future makes a further 25 70 increase in the agricultural production necessary to face the requirements coming from ever growing population and climate change hunter et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018 hence disposing of precise information on irrigation practices is crucial to optimize the agricultural production nevertheless comprehensive and detailed data about the irrigation extent and the amounts of water applied for irrigation purposes are generally lacking worldwide in fact irrigation related data sets are usually limited to statistical surveys referred to specific periods and or to certain areas of the world the remote sensing technology allows to overcome the aforementioned limitations ozdogan et al 2010 recently a number of remote sensing based applications and techniques aimed at identifying where irrigation occurs peña arancibia et al 2016 deines et al 2019 bazzi et al 2020 dari et al 2021 and at retrieving the amounts of water actually applied for irrigation brocca et al 2018 zaussinger et al 2019 dari et al 2020 are emerging in particular soil moisture is a key variable to be used as a proxy of irrigation brocca et al 2017 several studies have investigated the possibility of detecting and mapping irrigation through products obtained from both microwave and microwave merged with optical remote sensing kumar et al 2015 evaluated the capability of multiple coarse resolution soil moisture products in detecting irrigation signals over the conus contiguous united states among all the evaluated data sets namely ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system esa cci sm european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture smos soil moisture and ocean salinity and windsat only ascat soil moisture showed some potential in detecting signals attributable to irrigation over the plains of nebraska escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 analyzed the similarities and discrepancies between five remote sensing products and soil moisture modeled through the surfex isba surface externalisée interaction sol bioshère atmosphère land surface model masson et al 2013 over the north east of spain the remotely sensed data sets considered were ascat amsr e smos at its original resolution and at 1 km the latter obtained by downscaling the coarse resolution data through the dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change algorithm merlin et al 2013 the authors found a scarce correlation 0 2 0 4 between the high resolution smos data and the modeled soil moisture over a heavily irrigated area attributable to the irrigation information contained in the remote sensing data set as the model did not consider irrigation qiu et al 2016 compared the trends of soil moisture data over china obtained by multiple sources the esa cci data set the era interim land european reanalysis interim land reanalysis and ground observations discrepancies between remotely sensed soil moisture and precipitation trends found over irrigated areas were interpreted as an irrigation signal lawston et al 2017 pointed out the potential of surface soil moisture data from the enhanced 9 km version of smap soil moisture active passive in detecting irrigation occurring over semiarid areas located in the western united states the capability of capturing irrigation patterns through active and passive microwave remote sensing products was investigated by zhang et al 2018 the authors compared soil moisture from amsr e and its successor amsr 2 from ascat and from the esa cci data set with soil moisture from the era interim reanalysis over china some potential of ascat in detecting irrigation occurring over arid areas was pointed out very recently dari et al 2021 carried out an analysis on the capability of several remotely sensed soil moisture data sets to detect irrigation over a 125 x 80 km tile in the north eastern of the iberian peninsula partially occupied by heavily irrigated domains the considered products were ascat 12 5 km sampling the enhanced 9 km version of smap the copernicus sentinel 1 product 1 km sampling and two dispatch downscaled products at 1 km resolution obtained by coarse resolution smos and smap data the disaggregated products especially smap at 1 km proved to be able to detect irrigation occurring over the pilot area furthermore maps of irrigated areas produced through the k means clustering algorithm were proposed by exploiting spatial temporal statistical features derived from smap at 1 km soil moisture as input maps reaching an accuracy up to 78 in reproducing the actual irrigated areas were proposed the aforementioned studies exploited coarse to medium spatial resolution products to detect regional scale irrigation patterns the spread of very high resolution up to the plot scale soil moisture data has recently opened up important perspectives in the detection of irrigation occurring on the single agricultural field and more in general over agricultural areas where irrigated and rainfed portions are highly mixed together gao et al 2018 used metrics derived from the sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar data to map irrigation occurring over a 400 km2 area within the urgell district in catalonia spain bousbih et al 2018 proposed annual maps of irrigated and rainfed areas over a semi arid region of tunisia obtained through a methodology based on the synergy of sentinel 1 sar data and sentinel 2 optical data an accuracy of 77 was achieved by exploiting soil moisture indices to map irrigation at the field scale further studies showed the suitability of the merging of sentinel 1 sar data and sentinel 2 ndvi normalized difference vegetation index for irrigation mapping bazzi et al 2019 and detection bazzi et al 2020 purposes le page et al 2020 highlighted the potential of sentinel 1 derived soil moisture products in detecting irrigation events occurring over maize plots located in the south west of france the authors also pointed out the limitations of the above mentioned products mainly attributable to the low temporal frequency and to disturbances due to well developed vegetation the scale mismatch between the spatial resolution of satellite retrieved information and the extent of the irrigated areas remains a crucial issue in developing reliable algorithms and techniques to map and quantify irrigation massari et al 2021 under this perspective two research questions are addressed in this study the first one refers to the detectability of irrigation signals at the spatial scale of 1 km by adapting the approach based on indices describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture proposed by dari et al 2021 for its application over an area where because of the complex topography the irrigation is generally practiced on smaller and highly fragmented agricultural sites this circumstance makes the irrigation detection through satellite more challenging as irrigated and non irrigated fields are highly mixed together as a secondary objective the potential of mapping irrigated areas at very high resolution 100 m through a k means clustering approach by using sentinel 1 derived soil moisture data as an input has been investigated hence a double scale 1 km and 100 m analysis on the detectability of irrigation through remote sensing soil moisture covering the 3 year period from 2017 to 2019 is presented in this study 2 study area the analyses presented in this study have been carried out over flat agricultural areas falling within a domain with an extension of 13 000 km2 located in central italy and enclosing the upper tiber basin the catchment has a drainage area of 5000 km2 corresponding to a 140 km length portion of the tiber river falling almost entirely into the umbria region an overview of the study area is provided in fig 1 also showing the digital elevation model dem and the land cover map the dem is provided by the copernicus land monitoring service and has a spatial resolution of 25 m the land cover map is derived from the corine land cover clc data set referred to the year 2018 and its spatial resolution is 100 m the study area is crossed by the apennines which determine a complex orography the highest altitudes are detectable in the east side and decrease towards the west side where values ranging between 100 m a s l and 800 m a s l can be observed because of the heterogeneous topography the agricultural fields are mainly located in flat areas enclosed by adjacent reliefs the orographic context and the crop rotation contribute in creating a complex mosaic of small a few hectares irrigated fields characterizing the pilot area the irrigation water withdrawals are often not efficiently managed since the farmers are not properly supported by guidelines aimed at optimizing the irrigation practices casadei et al 2021 in this study four agricultural study areas have been identified the upper tiber area 122 33 km2 the trasimeno area 152 09 km2 the left tiber area 292 12 km2 and the right tiber area 292 12 km2 the agricultural soils are mainly silty in fact in all the districts the percentages of silt are higher than those of clay in turn greater than those of sand according to the isric international soil reference and information center soil grids data set v2 0 updated from its former version hengl et al 2017 the average district scale rate of silt varies between 39 45 for the upper tiber area and 46 26 for the left tiber area the upper tiber area shows the highest district scale percentage of sand equal to 28 the above mentioned rates are referred to the first 5 cm of the soil layer of interest for remote sensing applications the upper tiber area is located immediately downstream of the montedoglio dam which supplies a large amount of the water destined to irrigation practices through a network called sistema orientale montedoglio the district falls between two regions umbria and tuscany hence the irrigation is managed by two different consortia namely the comprensorio alto tevere umbro responsible for the portion in umbria and the comprensorio valtiberina toscana responsible for the fields in the tuscany region the trasimeno area takes its name from the adjacent lake and is fed by water supplied through the sistema occidentale montedoglio network the left tiber area is mainly managed by a consortium called consorzio della bonificazione umbra and encloses the districts of the umbrian valley finally the right tiber area groups the districts of the central tiber valley and those located in the valleys of several tiber tributaries mainly the genna caina and nestore rivers in general the highest intensity irrigation season is from june to september the most widespread crops over the pilot agricultural districts are maize wheat and tobacco the latter is intensively cultivated especially in the upper tiber district which is the most evenly irrigated portion of the study area sunflower forage and other crops are also present as well as areas destined to vineyards sprinkler irrigation is the most common technique but drip irrigation also is widely used surface irrigation is scarcely practiced as it is adopted only in a small system in the left tiber area 3 materials and methods 3 1 remote sensing data in this study three soil moisture products have been considered smap and two different versions of sentinel 1 namely the 1 km product delivered by the copernicus global land service and the plot scale version produced by theia the smap product adopted in this study is a 1 km version obtained through the dispatch downscaling algorithm merlin et al 2008 and provided by isardsat this product together with the 1 km version of sentinel 1 and the plot scale born version of sentinel 1 produced by theia and aggregated to the 1 km spatial resolution have been considered in the coarse resolution analysis in the analysis at a plot scale the sentinel 1 product delivered by theia and aggregated at a spatial resolution of 100 m has been used the smap mission launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and spatial administration nasa has the aim of monitoring the surface soil moisture and the freeze thaw state at global scale entekhabi et al 2010 the revisit period of smap is 2 3 days at the equator the mission was originally designed with the aim of providing surface soil moisture observations at three different spatial resolutions 3 km 9 km and 36 km by combining the benefits of active and passive remote sensing for this reason the satellite was equipped with an l band radar 1 26 ghz which prematurely failed in july 2015 and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz in this study a downscaled version of smap at 1 km obtained through the dispatch algorithm has been used according to this method the original coarse resolution surface soil moisture data is disaggregated to higher resolutions through the merging with optical data namely the land surface temperature and the ndvi retrieved by the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor aboard of the terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites the ndvi is a proxy of the vegetation conditions and can be calculated starting from the reflectance of vegetation in the near infrared nir and red r regions of the electromagnetic spectrum 1 ndvi nir r nir r the disaggregation is based on the partitioning of the evapotranspiration between the transpiration component in the root zone depending on the vegetation cover and the evaporation component referred to the first 5 cm of the bare soil defining the soil evaporative efficiency see as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation the redistribution of high resolution data within a pixel of the original coarse resolution product is carried out by exploiting the spatial relation existing between the see over the bare soil and the near surface soil moisture because of the main limitation of the method namely its non applicability in cloudy conditions peng et al 2017 the algorithm returns the original coarse resolution data in case of clouds coverage dispatch s main advantage is that in situ data is not required to perform the downscaling the product used in the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution has already proven its suitability in detecting irrigation patterns and in applications aimed to quantify the irrigation amounts over a heavily irrigated area in the north eastern of spain dari et al 2020 2021 the sentinel 1 constellation is part of the copernicus program developed by the european space agency esa the mission is constituted by two spacecrafts sentinel 1a launched in april 2014 and sentinel 1b launched two years later in april 2016 the two satellites share the same instrumentation namely a sar operating at c band frequency c sar 5 4 ghz and the same orbit 180 apart in the interferometric wide swath imaging mode iw mainly used in the monitoring over land the sensor aboard the sentinel 1 satellites can reach a ground range detected grd resolution of 20 x 22 m bauer marschallinger et al 2018 for a single satellite the revisit period referred to the same orbit is 12 days this value drops to 6 days thanks to the synergy of both satellites the sentinel 1 acquisition strategy privileges europe over which the coverage is guaranteed with a revisit time of 1 5 4 days obtained through different orbits in this study two soil moisture products derived from sentinel 1 observations have been used the first one is the surface soil moisture at 1 km delivered by the copernicus global land service available at https land copernicus eu global products ssm which is obtained by applying the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 hornáček et al 2012 to the high resolution data acquired by the c sar the product has been used in the analysis carried out at a spatial resolution of 1 km and henceforth it is indicated as copernicus s1 the second surface soil moisture data set derived from sentinel 1 and used in this study is a plot scale born product developed by a consortium led by the theia data and services center for continental surfaces the plot scale maps of soil moisture are produced by merging the sentinel 1 derived c sar data with optical data derived from sentinel 2 a sentinel mission developed within the copernicus program with the aim of collecting multi spectral optical observations over the earth s surface martimort et al 2007 drusch et al 2012 sentinel 2 images corrected for atmospheric effects are exploited in the process chain allowing to estimate soil moisture which consists in the application of an inversion algorithm based on neural networks the method is applied over agricultural areas only that in the case of central italy are derived by the clc and ancillary sources sentinel 2 images are also used to delimit homogeneous polygons within the edges of the agricultural parcels considered the plot scale maps whose temporal resolution is 6 days have been downloaded from the catalog available at https thisme cines teledetection fr home the product has been aggregated at two different spatial resolution 1 km and 100 m the 1 km aggregated data henceforth theia s1 1 km have been used in the analysis carried out at the same resolution while the 100 m aggregated data henceforth theia s1 have been employed in the plot scale analysis finally ndvi observations have also been considered in fact comparisons between soil moisture estimates and the vegetation status is crucial in the understanding of irrigation induced conditions the ndvi v2 2 data set has been used in the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution since it is sampled at the same resolution the product delivered by the copernicus global land service is available at https land copernicus eu global products ndvi the ndvi observations have a temporal frequency of 10 days and vary between a physical minimum of 0 08 and a physical maximum of 0 92 they are obtained by the spot vegetation satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation sensor later substituted by proba v project for on board autonomy vegetation whose new vegetation imaging instrument has been designed to ensure the continuity of the mission s observations details on the data processing chain can be found in sterckx et al 2014 while the proba v mission is described in dierckx et al 2014 table 1 summarizes the remotely sensed soil moisture data sets used in this study and their main features 3 2 temporal stability derived indices the temporal stability theory is widely used to optimize the in situ monitoring of soil moisture brocca et al 2010 gao et al 2015 dari et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 it is based on the relative differences method originally introduced by vachaud et al 1985 which has been later employed to address the rain gage network design also morbidelli et al 2019 very recently dari et al 2021 proposed a new framework of applicability of the method the authors proved that the main statistical indices the method is based on represent useful tools to evaluate the capability of remote sensing products to detect irrigation since such indices describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture assuming that θxt is the observed or modeled soil moisture value referred to the pixel x of the spatial grid and to the day t and indicating with θ t the spatial mean varying in time the spatial relative differences rdxt can be calculated for each pixel and for each day through the following 2 r d xt θ xt θ t θ t the temporal mean referred to each pixel x and the spatial mean varying in time are indicated with rd x and rd t respectively the relative difference referred to a certain pixel provides information on its behavior with respect to the areal mean thus describing the spatial dynamics of soil moisture in order to investigate the temporal dynamics also the temporal anomalies are introduced let taxt be the anomaly quantifying the discrepancy between the soil moisture value at pixel x and day t and its temporal mean θ x the temporal anomalies can be calculated as follows 3 t a xt θ xt θ x θ x according to the symbology adopted the temporal and the spatial mean of the temporal anomalies can be indicated with ta x and ta t respectively the abovementioned indices can be exploited as diagnostic parameters to assess the skill of remotely sensed products in detecting irrigation in fact high values of such indices detected over a certain pixel during the irrigation season which is naturally dry indicate wetter conditions with respect to the spatial mean and with respect to the temporal mean of the pixel itself that are attributable to irrigation 3 3 irrigation mapping through the k means clustering the clustering is a process that allows data classification and grouping on the basis of specific features it can be applied to different kinds of data sets jain et al 1999 usman 2013 k means is a particular clustering algorithm useful to group n data points into predefined k clusters on the basis of similar input data features a thorough description of the method can be found in macqueen 1967 after determining the centroid of each cluster through an iterative process starting from a randomly chosen input data element the algorithm assigns each element of the input data vector to its nearest centroid thus performing the clustering the nearest centroid is established through the minimization of the euclidian distance d between the vector of the input data and the vector of the centroids the objective function to be minimized namely the distance d is obtained by the following 4 d i 1 k j 1 n y j c i in which yj indicates the jth element of the input data vector j 1 n and ci represents the ith element of the centroids vector i 1 k the k means is an unsupervised clustering method meaning that the classification does not consist in assigning a new pattern into a specific group predefined through a training process but in grouping the input data points into meaningful clusters that have not been formerly defined but are determined by the input data itself only hence unsupervised techniques such as k means can be successfully applied also when there is no prior knowledge of the clusters mora et al 2017 in this study the k means algorithm has been used in the plot scale analysis to produce binary maps of irrigated not irrigated areas at a very high spatial resolution 100 m the approach has been recently proposed in dari et al 2021 in which maps of irrigated areas at 1 km spatial resolution over a wide irrigated area in the north east of the iberian peninsula have been produced through the k means algorithm with temporal stability derived indices calculated for remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture as input following this perspective the method has been here applied over a more complex area where the spatial scale at which irrigation can occur makes the adoption of higher resolutions e g 100 m necessary the classification has been carried out by considering two clusters irrigated and non irrigated pixels and two sets of features as input data namely the mean of the spatial relative differences and the mean of the temporal anomalies both referred to the period when irrigation mainly occurs i e from june to september of each year of the period 2017 2019 the k means clustering classification has been performed through the scikit learn python package pedregosa et al 2011 3 4 surfex modeling platform a data set of soil moisture modeled through the surfex modeling platform masson et al 2013 has been used as a support in the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution surfex originally developed and currently maintained by météo france consists in multiple schemes that allow to compute the exchanges of fluxes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere four main kinds of surfaces can be modeled through proper schemes the natural surfaces the inland water bodies the oceans and the urbanized areas the isba scheme noilhan and planton 1989 mahfouf and noilhan 1996 boone et al 1999 boone 2000 habets et al 2003 is used for computing the exchanges of water and energy fluxes between the soil vegetation snow continuum over natural lands and the atmosphere in the performed simulations the isba dif scheme within the latest available version of the model surfex v8 1 has been used it has been obtained from the center national de recherches météorologiques in order to run the model at 1 km spatial resolution a regular grid with the target resolution consisting in 89 136 pixels has been used the surfex s default land cover map has been adopted it is ecoclimap ii faroux et al 2013 and has a spatial resolution of 1 km the atmospheric forcing has been taken from the era 5 reanalysis herbach et al 2020 provided by the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf through the copernicus climate data store the atmospheric variables are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 hence they have been resampled to the finer grid adopted prior the surfex isba simulation the benefits of using the era 5 data to force isba simulations especially in terms of the representation of hydrological variables involved in the terrestrial hydrological cycle have been shown in albergel et al 2018 despite a surfex isba version with an interactive vegetation scheme existing in this study a version with a simplified scheme based on the climatology of the leaf area index lai has been preferred this choice is mainly due to the reason for which the modeled soil moisture has been involved into the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution namely to represent a natural not altered situation in which irrigation is not present hence the adoption of a more sophisticated modeling would have been pointless in the isba dif scheme adopted the soil is vertically discretized in 14 layers the surface soil moisture referred to the first 4 cm corresponds to the weighted average of the first two layers whose depths are up to 1 cm and up to 4 cm the normalized indices described in section 3 2 have been calculated for the surfex isba soil moisture which does not contain the irrigation information and for the remote sensing products at 1 km spatial resolution which can contain such information then the results have been compared in particular the differences between the model and the satellite derived indices have been analyzed to highlight discrepancies attributable to the irrigation signal contained in the remotely sensed data it is noteworthy that comparisons between satellite and modeled soil moisture data can be affected by not negligible differences in their associated spatial patterns zhou et al 2020 and climatology dong et al 2020 nevertheless the normalized diagnostic indices used in this study make the remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture data sets directly comparable thus avoiding any rescaling procedure prior to the comparisons however we are aware that residual differences may still exist 3 5 ground truth irrigation data observations on the occurrence of irrigation over four pilot fields during the period of interest have been collected two of them are located in the upper tiber area while the other two belong to the left tiber district the plots have been identified by codes ut1 and ut2 indicate the two pilot fields in the upper tiber area while lt1 and lt2 those located in the left tiber area a summary of the information collected for each pilot plot is provided in table 2 while fig 2 shows their location in detail the crops cultivated in the ut1 field were tobacco in 2017 maize in 2018 and wheat in 2019 irrigation occurred in 2017 and 2018 not in 2019 sunflowers were cultivated without irrigation in the ut2 field during 2017 while the crop for 2018 and 2019 was tobacco and it was irrigated both ut1 and ut2 pilot fields have an area of 1 ha for the pilot fields in the left tiber area ground truth information about irrigation practices is available only for the year 2019 tobacco and pea were cultivated over the lt1 and lt2 fields respectively both pilot fields were irrigated during 2019 the lt1 field has an area of 2 ha while the lt2 plot is bigger 4 5 ha the ground truth data described in this section have been exploited in the analysis carried out at a plot scale spatial resolution to assess the capability of theia s1 soil moisture in detecting the irrigation occurrence 3 6 data preparation in order to perform the presented analyses with spatially coherent data all the products used have been first resampled for the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution the regular grid used to run the surfex isba simulation has been adopted hence the soil moisture from smap from copernicus s1 and from theia s1 1 km as well as the ndvi data have been resampled to that 89 136 pixels grid for the analysis at a plot scale a 100 m regular grid consisting in 1000 1000 cells over the study area has been adopted the soil moisture from theia s1 has been resampled to this grid prior the analyses furthermore because of the complex topography of the study area all the analyses have been carried out over the agricultural districts only namely over a homogeneous flat land 4 results 4 1 analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the main purpose of the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution is to investigate the detectability of district or sub district scale irrigation occurring over the study area through the considered products the capability of the soil moisture data sets in detecting irrigation signals is assessed through indices derived from the temporal stability theory describing the spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture the first considered index is the spatial relative difference providing information about the discrepancies between the behavior of a certain pixel and the spatial mean calculated by considering all the agricultural areas a soil moisture data set able to capture the irrigation signal is expected to show relative differences higher than zero during the highest intensity irrigation periods namely between june and september fig 3 shows the weekly time series of the district averaged relative differences calculated for each agricultural area the upper tiber in green the trasimeno in orange the right tiber in red and the left tiber in blue each panel of the first four is referred to a soil moisture product in panel e the time series of the district averaged ndvi at 1 km are shown with the same colors code the periods from june to september namely when the irrigation practices mainly occur are shaded in light green it is noteworthy that the modeled data set ends in september 2019 the upper tiber area is the only one showing a promising district scale signal according to all the considered products during almost all the irrigation seasons considered in fact smap derived district averaged relative differences are higher than zero during all the focus periods of 2017 2019 see panel a of fig 3 for the two soil moisture data sets derived from sentinel 1 namely copernicus s1 and theia s1 1 km the relative differences detected during the period june september in 2017 and 2019 are higher than during the same time span in 2018 see panels b and c of fig 3 as explained in section 3 4 the surfex isba soil moisture has been included in the analysis as a support in fact this data set is a reference for natural not human altered conditions since irrigation is not present in the modeling the left tiber and the upper tiber areas show an interesting and unexpected result since they experience an increase in the district averaged relative differences during the irrigation seasons see panel d of fig 3 this issue is particularly accentuated for the upper tiber area thus suggesting that the signal observed for the remotely sensed products is not attributable to irrigation only but it may be affected by static patterns also e g soil texture another crucial factor potentially affecting and corroborating at the same time the results obtained over the upper tiber area is the vegetation all the district averaged ndvi time series panel e of fig 3 show a similar behavior with one peak in spring as expected nevertheless for the upper tiber area a second peak during summer and lasting until the end of october can be observed this behavior is likely attributable to the irrigated crops which on the upper tiber district are known to be more evenly distributed with respect to over the other agricultural areas hence on one side the ndvi time series corroborate the detectability of district scale irrigation occurring over the upper tiber area by exploiting the spatial relative differences as a diagnostic index on the other side the ndvi trend over the upper tiber district is particularly reflected on the time series referred to smap and theia s1 1 km for which relative differences higher than zero can be observed until the end of october the two data sets are produced by merging the soil moisture information with the ndvi form different sources i e modis and sentinel 2 hence the results obtained with smap and theia s1 1 km can be partly driven by the vegetation indices exploited in the data sets production chain nevertheless it is noteworthy that in the dispatch algorithm used to produce the smap product used in this study the low resolution soil moisture is distributed into the high resolution pixels in a conservative way namely by keeping the average value hence in the case of smap the effect of the ndvi is not supposed to be so conclusive in fact the ndvi peak detected in spring is not reflected on the time series of smap derived spatial relative differences averaged over the upper tiber district along with the detectability of district scale irrigation signals it is interesting to investigate the potential in spotting sub district irrigation also at 1 km spatial resolution in order to do this a spatially distributed information is needed hence maps of the spatial relative differences averaged during the periods june september of 2017 2019 have been produced for each remote sensing product and the differences with the analogous maps obtained through the surfex isba data set available in appendix a have been calculated the results are provided in fig 4 as specified before the model does not contain the irrigation information hence the spatial distribution of the modeled surface soil moisture is mainly driven by the forcing precipitation and it is regulated by parameters linked to the soil texture and to the vegetation cover whose cycle is the same every year since in the adopted modeling the lai cycle responds to the climatology for the above mentioned reasons the maps showing the mean relative differences calculated for a certain product during the focus periods from which the same maps obtained for the modeled data set are subtracted are supposed to be not affected by static patterns the district scale signal over the upper tiber area deductible from the time series is reflected on the maps too in fact evenly distributed relative differences higher than zero can be observed in all the maps except for those referred to copernicus s1 and to theia s1 1 km during june september 2018 panels e and h of fig 4 recurring sub district portions of positive relative differences over the trasimeno and the right tiber areas can be observed in the maps referred to copernicus s1 and to theia s1 1 km especially for the periods june september 2018 and 2019 panels e f h and i of fig 4 a factor potentially affecting the relative differences calculated over the trasimeno area is the proximity to the homonymous lake in fact the 1 km resolution may not be detailed enough to solve the different signals coming from adjacent water and land pixels nevertheless the fact that the spatial occurrence of relative differences higher than zero over the trasimeno area is not limited to the coastal zones only is comforting finally small scattered portions of positive relative differences are detected over the left tiber area according to the methodology proposed in dari et al 2021 the temporal anomaly is another index derived from the temporal stability theory to be used jointly with the spatial relative differences to evaluate the capability of soil moisture products in detecting irrigation in fact the merging of the two indices provides a characterization both in space and time of the soil moisture data sets thus allowing to determinate if irrigation tracks are concurrently detectable by the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture furthermore the coupling of the analysis in terms of relative differences with the one based on the temporal anomalies is necessary since the spatial relative differences can depend on the heterogeneity of the area of interest unlike for the spatial relative differences the temporal analysis does not show a recurring district scale irrigation signal for this reason the time series of the district averaged temporal anomalies are not shown in the results section of this paper but for completeness they are shown in the appendix a in order to investigate the detectability of sub district scale irrigation signals through the temporal anomalies maps of such index averaged during the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 are provided in fig 5 according to this metric values higher than or close to zero observed during the highest irrigation intensity seasons are attributable to irrigation practices in fact positive or close to zero mean temporal anomalies during the period june september indicate a soil wetness condition higher than or close to the 3 year temporal mean during the dry season each map of fig 5 referring to a specific soil moisture data set and to a specific irrigation season is obtained by calculating the difference with the analogous map referring to the modeled soil moisture in order to remove natural signals due to climate thus highlighting irrigation related patterns for completeness the maps of the temporal anomalies calculated with the surfex isba soil moisture and averaged during the periods of interest are shown in appendix a no significant positive temporal anomalies patterns are detected for smap panels a b and c of fig 5 the clearest signals attributable to irrigation can be observed for both products derived from sentinel 1 during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 the maps derived by the copernicus s1 data panels e and f of fig 5 show portions of positive mean temporal anomalies over the right tiber the left tiber to a lesser extent and the trasimeno agricultural areas in accordance with analogous patterns of positive mean relative differences shown in fig 4 mean temporal anomalies higher than zero over the upper tiber district are detected for copernicus s1 during june september 2019 panel f of fig 5 such patterns reflect the spatial distribution of the corresponding positive mean relative differences over the same pilot agricultural area shown in fig 4 finally the maps referred to the theia s1 1 km product panels g h and i of fig 5 show evenly distributed positive temporal anomalies over the agricultural sites thus indicating wetter conditions reproduced by remote sensing data with respect to the model nevertheless the aggregation of the plot scale data to the 1 km spatial resolution may produce a merging of the information originally coming from adjacent agricultural fields determining the patterns shown in fig 5 4 2 analysis at a plot scale spatial resolution the analysis at 100 m spatial resolution is aimed at evaluating the capability of the theia s1 product to detect irrigation occurring at the plot scale which is likely the proper scale to adopt over a topographically complex and highly mixed area as the one of interest also considering the spatial extent at which irrigation generally occurs in the pilot agricultural sites in fact the very high resolution theia s1 data set allows to investigate the spatial temporal dynamics of surface soil moisture over the single agricultural field according to the methodology already adopted for the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the maps of the relative differences and of the temporal anomalies both averaged during the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively since the information is very detailed a dedicated map is provided for each agricultural area an overall agreement between the patterns of the mean relative differences see fig 6 and of the mean temporal anomalies see fig 7 during the considered irrigation seasons can be observed the pearson correlation coefficients calculated between the mean spatial relative differences and the mean temporal anomalies over each district and during each focus period are provided in table 3 the agreement between the maps of the two diagnostic indices is supported by the overall good correlation obtained which is always higher than 0 61 minimum value obtained over the upper tiber area referring to the period june september 2019 and reaches values up to 0 90 and 0 91 obtained for the period june september 2017 over the left tiber district and the right tiber district respectively the k means clustering algorithm allows to synthetize the results obtained through the fine resolution spatial and temporal analyses the features provided in the maps shown in figs 6 and 7 namely the mean relative differences and the mean temporal anomalies during the highest intensity irrigation periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 have been exploited as input data points in a binary classification of irrigated and not irrigated pixels hence a clustering with two input parameters and two clusters has been performed through the k means method the algorithm has been applied separately for the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 the resulting maps of irrigated and non irrigated agricultural fields corresponding to each focus period are shown in the maps provided in fig 8 with pixels classified as irrigated represented in green and pixels classified as non irrigated indicated in brown the upper tiber area is classified as the most irrigated one among those evaluated in this study during all the three seasons investigated the rate of pixels classified as irrigated is equal to 68 4 of the total during june september 2017 and to 68 and to 65 6 during the same periods in 2018 and 2019 respectively this is an expected result since the upper tiber district is known to be the most evenly and intensively irrigated one among the pilot agricultural areas over the trasimeno area the highest rate of irrigated pixels is detected in the period june september 2018 in fact the percentages of irrigated pixels over such area are 40 7 during the focus period in 2017 53 during the irrigation season of 2018 and 46 during the same period in 2019 higher rates of non irrigated pixels with respect to irrigated ones are obtained over both left and right tiber districts in fact over the left tiber area the rates of pixels classified as non irrigated are equal to 55 7 to 54 9 and to 56 6 for the focus periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the percentages of not irrigated pixels over the right tiber area are 61 9 50 5 and 53 3 for the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in order to test the reliability of the proposed maps the results of the classifications have been compared with the available ground truth information about the occurrence of irrigation collected over the four pilot fields described in section 3 5 the scatter plots provided in fig 9 shows the point clouds identifying the input parameters used to perform the clustering over each district to which the pilot fields belong in accordance with the maps provided in fig 8 the cluster of the pixels classified as irrigated is represented in green while the one grouping the non irrigated pixels in brown the pixels identifying the pilot fields are represented through squares colored in black if the classification is correct or in magenta if the classification is wrong the proposed method reproduces well the real occurrence of irrigation over the ut1 pilot field which was irrigated in 2017 and 2018 not in 2019 over the ut2 plot the theia s1 soil moisture data is not available in 2019 hence only the performances in 2017 and 2018 have been evaluated the ut2 field was not irrigated in 2017 but the algorithm wrongly classifies the corresponding pixel as irrigated while the irrigation occurred in 2018 is well reproduced by the proposed classification it is noteworthy that the result obtained for the ut2 field in 2017 is discussed in the following section finally the lt1 and lt2 pilot fields were irrigated in 2019 and this condition is properly reproduced by the method presented in this study 5 discussion this paper presents a double scale analysis on the detectability of irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture over agricultural areas in central italy during the 3 year period 2017 2019 two research questions have been addressed the first one concerns the suitability of 1 km resolution soil moisture products in detecting irrigation signals over a topographically complex area where the high fragmentation of agricultural fields forces irrigation to be practiced at the scale of a few hectares and where crop rotation is adopted the second research question regards the potential of soil moisture data at a very high spatial resolution in detecting and mapping irrigated areas in the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the detectability of irrigation through active and passive microwave products has been evaluated by exploiting indices describing the spatial temporal dynamics of soil moisture the investigation carried out by adopting the spatial relative differences as a diagnostic index reveals a district scale signal potentially attributable to irrigation over the upper tiber area this result is common to all the remotely sensed data sets evaluated except for the two sentinel 1 derived products during the irrigation season of 2018 see panels b and c of fig 3 nevertheless the uniform district scale signal over the upper tiber area is not fully reflected on the analysis exploiting the temporal anomaly as a diagnostic index the results obtained by the spatial analysis over the upper tiber area are corroborated by the vegetation conditions see the ndvi time series in panel e of fig 3 as the upper tiber district is the only one for which a uniform signal of lush vegetation during summer is detected nevertheless the observed state of vegetation development can also represent a factor affecting the soil moisture data in fact high values of the district averaged ndvi over the upper tiber area can be observed even before summer and a similar trend is reflected on the district averaged time series of the spatial relative differences referred to smap and theia s1 1 km data sets which are developed by merging the soil moisture information with ndvi observations this issue can be explained by the crop type the most common one over the upper tiber agricultural area is tobacco whose harvesting begins before middle september and lasts for a while since the leaf priming technique marowa et al 2015 is adopted i e first the leaves at the basis of the plant and later the upper ones are gradually harvested furthermore tobacco plants reach not negligible heights that may affect soil moisture data from the copernicus s1 product too in fact c band active sensors are known to be highly sensitive to the vegetation cover le page et al 2020 in addition a correction accounting for the effects of seasonal vegetation is not implemented in the retrieval algorithm used for the copernicus s1 production bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the good matching between patterns of positive mean relative differences and of positive or close to zero mean temporal anomalies obtained for the copernicus s1 product during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 suggest the potential of the high resolution c sar retrieved soil moisture in containing the irrigation information even if resampled at 1 km see panels e and f of both figs 4 and 5 wetter conditions with respect to the modeled soil moisture during the highest intensity irrigation seasons are detected for the theia s1 1 km data set also nevertheless the adoption of the 1 km spatial resolution to spot irrigation occurring over a such orographically complex area is associated to not negligible uncertainties that are difficult to be properly assessed for instance the distribution of the agricultural sites over the upper portion of the right tiber area where the fields are located in small valleys along tiber s tributaries enclosed by reliefs surely determines a contamination of the information coming from adjacent agricultural and natural pixels if a sampling at 1 km is adopted several studies have shown the potential of very high resolution sentinel 1 data in detecting irrigation events and mapping irrigated areas gao et al 2018 bazzi et al 2019 2020 le page et al 2020 hence an analysis at a plot scale 100 m by using theia s1 soil moisture has been carried out over the pilot agricultural districts the maps of the temporal stability theory derived indices referred to theia s1 see figs 6 and 7 reveal the potential of this product in reproducing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture over the single agricultural field the good agreement between the spatial and temporal analyses quantified by a spatial correlation ranging between 0 61 and 0 91 ensures the suitability of the indices derived from the temporal stability theory to be used as input features for the k means clustering algorithm with the aim of producing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution unfortunately comprehensive and detailed statistical surveys on the occurrence of irrigation over the pilot area during the period of interest are not available for this reason it has not been possible to validate the proposed maps through ground truth data sets this is the main limitation of the presented study but it is noteworthy that the proposed methodology has been already validated in a former study in which a coarser resolution of 1 km has been adopted dari et al 2021 however it will be important to collect more detailed and comprehensive information on the actually irrigated areas as well as on the irrigation amounts applied to further validate and deepen the presented analyses as a novelty with respect to dari et al 2021 the methodology has been implemented here with very high resolution 100 m soil moisture data needed to investigate the highly fragmented agricultural fields in the study area positive results have been obtained by exploiting the collected information on the irrigation practices occurred over four pilot sites since when both soil moisture and irrigation occurrence information is available the algorithm fails only once out of seven in fact the non occurrence of irrigation over the ut2 field during june september 2017 is not properly reproduced moreover the point referring to the ut2 plot identified by its mean relative difference and mean temporal anomaly is not close to the border separating the two clusters thus indicating a not negligible error see fig 9 this issue is probably attributable to the kind of crop namely sunflower whose plants reach heights that can determine disturbances in the retrieved soil moisture limitations in the use of sentinel 1 derived very high resolution soil moisture data when the crop status is highly developed have been already pointed out in el hajj et al 2017 and le page et al 2020 finally it is noteworthy that during all the three irrigation seasons investigated the upper tiber district is classified as the most irrigated one this portion is more equipped for irrigation and more evenly irrigated than the other districts 6 conclusions on the basis of the above discussed results obtained by the double scale analysis on the detection of irrigation through remote sensing soil moisture presented in this study the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution shows limitations due to the small spatial scale at which irrigation occurs over the study area the promising district scale signal coming from the spatial analysis over the upper tiber area is likely attributable to multiple factors along with irrigation and in any case it is not fully reflected on the temporal analysis potential in detecting sub district irrigated areas is shown by the sentinel 1 derived products especially during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 nevertheless the hyper high resolution maps of figs 6 and 7 immediately provide insights on the loss of information encountered by working with the 1 km resolution data over the study site the analysis carried out at a plot scale 100 m shows the potential in reproducing the soil moisture dynamics on the single agricultural field of the very high resolution theia s1 soil moisture the application of the k means clustering algorithm by using temporal stability derived indices as input data points has led to the production of maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution covering the irrigation seasons in 2017 2018 2019 despite a comprehensive validation not being possible comparisons with the available ground truth information provide positive results since the algorithm fails only once out of seven in reproducing the irrigation occurrence over the pilot agricultural fields hence the method shows its potential if applied to soil moisture data whose spatial resolution matches with the spatial scale at which irrigation occurs in accordance with what found in dari et al 2021 however limitations due to the influence of the vegetation cover are highlighted this study shows the importance to progress towards hyper high resolution soil moisture products that reproduce soil moisture patterns at the same spatial scales as agricultural activities thus representing a useful tool to optimize the production in the esa irrigation project different plot scale resolution soil moisture data sets derived from sentinel 1 will be tested for irrigation detection and quantification purposes over several areas worldwide under different climatic conditions and where several crop types and irrigation techniques are adopted based on these results further information on the potential of high resolution satellite soil moisture observations for irrigation purposes will be

189,despite a detailed knowledge of the spatial temporal dynamics of irrigation being necessary to optimize the agricultural production without exacerbating the pressure exercised on the water resource such information is still often lacking worldwide in this study a double scale analysis on the detectability of the irrigation occurrence over an area in central italy through remote sensing soil moisture is proposed the period of interest is a 3 year time span from 2017 to 2019 the detectability of district or sub district scale irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture data is investigated at two different spatial resolutions 1 km and plot scale three soil moisture products sampled at 1 km resolution are evaluated a dispatch disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change downscaled version of smap soil moisture active passive and two sentinel 1 derived products namely the 1 km version delivered by copernicus and a plot scale born version developed by theia and aggregated at 1 km the theia sentinel 1 product aggregated at 100 m is used in the plot scale analysis over the study area the irrigation extent is determined by the fragmentation of the agricultural fields and the complex topography making the adoption of plot scale data necessary satisfactory results are obtained by comparing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution produced through the k means clustering algorithm with ground truth data since the method fails only once out of seven in properly reproducing the irrigated or non irrigated

land surface modeling k means algorithm 1 introduction the role played by irrigation in the economy of the hydrological balance over anthropized basins is not negligible in fact in the context of the significant anthropogenic interventions on the natural systems that have led many scientists to classify the current era as the anthropocene steffen et al 2011 montanari et al 2013 savenije et al 2014 the irrigation is recognized as a primary source of global freshwater consumption it affects not only the availability of water resources but food production and climate also as an example it is documented that heavily irrigated areas are affected by evaporative cooling phenomena moore and rojstaczer 2002 kueppers et al 2007 during the past decades the intensification of irrigation practices made possible a doubling of the agricultural production despite an increase of cropland by only 12 rosegrant et al 2002 gleick 2003 this trend is expected to be further strengthened during the upcoming years the challenging scenario foreseen for the near future makes a further 25 70 increase in the agricultural production necessary to face the requirements coming from ever growing population and climate change hunter et al 2017 ferguson et al 2018 hence disposing of precise information on irrigation practices is crucial to optimize the agricultural production nevertheless comprehensive and detailed data about the irrigation extent and the amounts of water applied for irrigation purposes are generally lacking worldwide in fact irrigation related data sets are usually limited to statistical surveys referred to specific periods and or to certain areas of the world the remote sensing technology allows to overcome the aforementioned limitations ozdogan et al 2010 recently a number of remote sensing based applications and techniques aimed at identifying where irrigation occurs peña arancibia et al 2016 deines et al 2019 bazzi et al 2020 dari et al 2021 and at retrieving the amounts of water actually applied for irrigation brocca et al 2018 zaussinger et al 2019 dari et al 2020 are emerging in particular soil moisture is a key variable to be used as a proxy of irrigation brocca et al 2017 several studies have investigated the possibility of detecting and mapping irrigation through products obtained from both microwave and microwave merged with optical remote sensing kumar et al 2015 evaluated the capability of multiple coarse resolution soil moisture products in detecting irrigation signals over the conus contiguous united states among all the

amsr e and its successor amsr 2 from ascat and from the esa cci data set with soil moisture from the era interim reanalysis over china some potential of ascat in detecting irrigation occurring over arid areas was pointed out very recently dari et al 2021 carried out an analysis on the capability of several remotely sensed soil moisture data sets to detect irrigation over a 125 x 80 km tile in the north eastern of the iberian peninsula partially occupied by heavily irrigated domains the considered products were ascat 12 5 km sampling the enhanced 9 km version of smap the copernicus sentinel 1 product 1 km sampling and two dispatch downscaled products at 1 km resolution obtained by coarse resolution smos and smap data the disaggregated products especially smap at 1 km proved to be able to detect irrigation occurring over the pilot area furthermore maps of irrigated areas produced through the k means clustering algorithm were proposed by exploiting spatial temporal statistical features derived from smap at 1 km soil moisture as input maps reaching an accuracy up to 78 in reproducing the actual irrigated areas were proposed the aforementioned studies exploited coarse to medium spatial resolution products to detect regional scale irrigation patterns the spread of very high resolution up to the plot scale soil moisture data has recently opened up important perspectives in the detection of irrigation occurring on the single agricultural field and more in general over agricultural areas where irrigated and rainfed portions are highly mixed together gao et al 2018 used metrics derived from the sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar data to map irrigation occurring over a 400 km2 area within the urgell district in catalonia spain bousbih et al 2018 proposed annual maps of irrigated and rainfed areas over a semi arid region of tunisia obtained through a methodology based on the synergy of sentinel 1 sar data and sentinel 2 optical data an accuracy of 77 was achieved by exploiting soil moisture indices to map irrigation at the field scale further studies showed the suitability of the merging of sentinel 1 sar data and sentinel 2 ndvi normalized difference vegetation index for irrigation mapping bazzi et al 2019 and detection bazzi et al 2020 purposes le page et al 2020 highlighted the potential of sentinel 1 derived soil moisture products in detecting irrigation events occurring over maize plots located in the south west of france the authors also pointed out the limitations of the above mentioned products mainly attributable to the low temporal frequency and to disturbances due to well developed vegetation the scale mismatch between the spatial resolution of satellite retrieved information and the extent of the irrigated areas remains a crucial issue in developing reliable algorithms and techniques to map and quantify irrigation massari et al 2021 under this perspective two research questions are addressed in this study the first one refers to the detectability of irrigation signals at the spatial scale of 1 km by adapting the approach based on indices describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture proposed by dari et al 2021 for its application over an area where because of the complex topography the irrigation is generally practiced on smaller and highly fragmented agricultural sites this circumstance makes the irrigation detection through satellite more challenging as irrigated and non irrigated fields are highly mixed together as a secondary objective the potential of mapping irrigated areas at very high resolution 100 m through a k means clustering approach by using sentinel 1 derived soil moisture data as an input has been investigated hence a double scale 1 km and 100 m analysis on the detectability of irrigation through remote sensing soil moisture covering the 3 year period from 2017 to 2019 is presented in this study 2 study area the analyses presented in this study have been carried out over flat agricultural areas falling within a domain with an extension of 13 000 km2 located in central italy and enclosing the upper tiber basin the catchment has a drainage area of 5000 km2 corresponding to a 140 km length portion of the tiber river falling almost entirely into the umbria region an overview of the study area is provided in fig 1 also showing the digital elevation model dem and the land cover map the dem is provided by the copernicus land monitoring service and has a spatial resolution of 25 m the land cover map is derived from the corine land cover clc data set referred to the year 2018 and its spatial resolution is 100 m the study area is crossed by the apennines which determine a complex orography the highest altitudes are detectable in the east side and decrease towards the west side where values ranging between 100 m a s l and 800 m a s l can be observed because of the heterogeneous topography the agricultural fields are mainly located in flat areas enclosed by adjacent reliefs the orographic context and the crop rotation contribute in creating a complex mosaic of small a few hectares irrigated fields characterizing the pilot area the irrigation water withdrawals are often not efficiently managed since the farmers are not properly supported by guidelines aimed at optimizing the irrigation practices casadei et al 2021 in this study four agricultural study areas have been identified the upper tiber area 122 33 km2 the trasimeno area 152 09 km2 the left tiber area 292 12 km2 and the right tiber area 292 12 km2 the agricultural soils are mainly silty in fact in all the districts the percentages of silt are higher than those of clay in turn greater than those of sand according to the isric international soil reference and information center soil grids data set v2 0 updated from its former version hengl et al 2017 the average district scale rate of silt varies between 39 45 for the upper tiber area and 46 26 for the left tiber area the upper tiber area shows the highest district scale percentage of sand equal to 28 the above mentioned rates are referred to the first 5 cm of the soil layer of interest for remote sensing applications the upper tiber area is located immediately downstream of the montedoglio dam which supplies a large amount of the water destined to irrigation practices through a network called sistema orientale montedoglio the district falls between two regions umbria and tuscany hence the irrigation is managed by two different consortia namely the comprensorio alto tevere umbro responsible for the portion in umbria and the comprensorio valtiberina toscana responsible for the fields in the tuscany region the trasimeno area takes its name from the adjacent lake and is fed by water supplied through the sistema occidentale montedoglio network the left tiber area is mainly managed by a consortium called consorzio della bonificazione umbra and encloses the districts of the umbrian valley finally the right tiber area groups the districts of the central tiber valley and those located in the valleys of several tiber tributaries mainly the genna caina and nestore rivers in general the highest intensity irrigation season is from june to september the most widespread crops over the pilot agricultural districts are maize wheat and tobacco the latter is intensively cultivated especially in the upper tiber district which is the most evenly irrigated portion of the study area sunflower forage and other crops are also present as well as areas destined to vineyards sprinkler irrigation is the most common technique but drip irrigation also is widely used surface irrigation is scarcely practiced as it is adopted only in a small system in the left tiber area 3 materials and methods 3 1 remote sensing data in this study three soil moisture products have been considered smap and two different versions of sentinel 1 namely the 1 km product delivered by the copernicus global land service and the plot scale version produced by theia the smap product adopted in this study is a 1 km version obtained through the dispatch downscaling algorithm merlin et al 2008 and provided by isardsat this product together with the 1 km version of sentinel 1 and the plot scale born version of sentinel 1 produced by theia and aggregated to the 1 km spatial resolution have been considered in the coarse resolution analysis in the analysis at a plot scale the sentinel 1 product delivered by theia and aggregated at a spatial resolution of 100 m has been used the smap mission launched in january 2015 by the national aeronautics and spatial administration nasa has the aim of monitoring the surface soil moisture and the freeze thaw state at global scale entekhabi et al 2010 the revisit period of smap is 2 3 days at the equator the mission was originally designed with the aim of providing surface soil moisture observations at three different spatial resolutions 3 km 9 km and 36 km by combining the benefits of active and passive remote sensing for this reason the satellite was equipped with an l band radar 1 26 ghz which prematurely failed in july 2015 and an l band radiometer 1 4 ghz in this study a downscaled version of smap at 1 km obtained through the dispatch algorithm has been used according to this method the original coarse resolution surface soil moisture data is disaggregated to higher resolutions through the merging with optical data namely the land surface temperature and the ndvi retrieved by the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor aboard of the terra eos am and aqua eos pm satellites the ndvi is a proxy of the vegetation conditions and can be calculated starting from the reflectance of vegetation in the near infrared nir and red r regions of the electromagnetic spectrum 1 ndvi nir r nir r the disaggregation is based on the partitioning of the evapotranspiration between the transpiration component in the root zone depending on the vegetation cover and the evaporation component referred to the first 5 cm of the bare soil defining the soil evaporative efficiency see as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation the redistribution of high resolution data within a pixel of the original coarse resolution product is carried out by exploiting the spatial relation existing between the see over the bare soil and the near surface soil moisture because of the main limitation of the method namely its non applicability in cloudy conditions peng et al 2017 the algorithm returns the original coarse resolution data in case of clouds coverage dispatch s main advantage is that in situ data is not required to perform the downscaling the product used in the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution has already proven its suitability in detecting irrigation patterns and in applications aimed to quantify the irrigation amounts over a heavily irrigated area in the north eastern of spain dari et al 2020 2021 the sentinel 1 constellation is part of the copernicus program developed by the european space agency esa the mission is constituted by two spacecrafts sentinel 1a launched in april 2014 and sentinel 1b launched two years later in april 2016 the two satellites share the same instrumentation namely a sar operating at c band frequency c sar 5 4 ghz and the same orbit 180 apart in the interferometric wide swath imaging mode iw mainly used in the monitoring over land the sensor aboard the sentinel 1 satellites can reach a ground range detected grd resolution of 20 x 22 m bauer marschallinger et al 2018 for a single satellite the revisit period referred to the same orbit is 12 days this value drops to 6 days thanks to the synergy of both satellites the sentinel 1 acquisition strategy privileges europe over which the coverage is guaranteed with a revisit time of 1 5 4 days obtained through different orbits in this study two soil moisture products derived from sentinel 1 observations have been used the first one is the surface soil moisture at 1 km delivered by the copernicus global land service available at https land copernicus eu global products ssm which is obtained by applying the change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 hornáček et al 2012 to the high resolution data acquired by the c sar the product has been used in the analysis carried out at a spatial resolution of 1 km and henceforth it is indicated as copernicus s1 the second surface soil moisture data set derived from sentinel 1 and used in this study is a plot scale born product developed by a consortium led by the theia data and services center for continental surfaces the plot scale maps of soil moisture are produced by merging the sentinel 1 derived c sar data with optical data derived from sentinel 2 a sentinel mission developed within the copernicus program with the aim of collecting multi spectral optical observations over the earth s surface martimort et al 2007 drusch et al 2012 sentinel 2 images corrected for atmospheric effects are exploited in the process chain allowing to estimate soil moisture which consists in the application of an inversion algorithm based on neural networks the method is applied over agricultural areas only that in the case of central italy are derived by the clc and ancillary sources sentinel 2 images are also used to delimit homogeneous polygons within the edges of the agricultural parcels considered the plot scale maps whose temporal resolution is 6 days have been downloaded from the catalog available at https thisme cines teledetection fr home the product has been aggregated at two different spatial resolution 1 km and 100 m the 1 km aggregated data henceforth theia s1 1 km have been used in the analysis carried out at the same resolution while the 100 m aggregated data henceforth theia s1 have been employed in the plot scale analysis finally ndvi observations have also been considered in fact comparisons between soil moisture estimates and the vegetation status is crucial in the understanding of irrigation induced conditions the ndvi v2 2 data set has been used in the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution since it is sampled at the same resolution the product delivered by the copernicus global land service is available at https land copernicus eu global products ndvi the ndvi observations have a temporal frequency of 10 days and vary between a physical minimum of 0 08 and a physical maximum of 0 92 they are obtained by the spot vegetation satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation sensor later substituted by proba v project for on board autonomy vegetation whose new vegetation imaging instrument has been designed to ensure the continuity of the mission s observations details on the data processing chain can be found in sterckx et al 2014 while the proba v mission is described in dierckx et al 2014 table 1 summarizes the remotely sensed soil moisture data sets used in this study and their main features 3 2 temporal stability derived indices the temporal stability theory is widely used to optimize the in situ monitoring of soil moisture brocca et al 2010 gao et al 2015 dari et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 it is based on the relative differences method originally introduced by vachaud et al 1985 which has been later employed to address the rain gage network design also morbidelli et al 2019 very recently dari et al 2021 proposed a new framework of applicability of the method the authors proved that the main statistical indices the method is based on represent useful tools to evaluate the capability of remote sensing products to detect irrigation since such indices describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture assuming that θxt is the observed or modeled soil moisture value referred to the pixel x of the spatial grid and to the day t and indicating with θ t the spatial mean varying in time the spatial relative differences rdxt can be calculated for each pixel and for each day through the following 2 r d xt θ xt θ t θ t the temporal mean referred to each pixel x and the spatial mean varying in time are indicated with rd x and rd t respectively the relative difference referred to a certain pixel provides information on its behavior with respect to the areal mean thus describing the spatial dynamics of soil moisture in order to investigate the temporal dynamics also the temporal anomalies are introduced let taxt be the anomaly quantifying the discrepancy between the soil moisture value at pixel x and day t and its temporal mean θ x the temporal anomalies can be calculated as follows 3 t a xt θ xt θ x θ x according to the symbology adopted the temporal and the spatial mean of the temporal anomalies can be indicated with ta x and ta t respectively the abovementioned indices can be exploited as diagnostic parameters to assess the skill of remotely sensed products in detecting irrigation in fact high values of such indices detected over a certain pixel during the irrigation season which is naturally dry indicate wetter conditions with respect to the spatial mean and with respect to the temporal mean of the pixel itself that are attributable to irrigation 3 3 irrigation mapping through the k means clustering the clustering is a process that allows data classification and grouping on the basis of specific features it can be applied to different kinds of data sets jain et al 1999 usman 2013 k means is a particular clustering algorithm useful to group n data points into predefined k clusters on the basis of similar input data features a thorough description of the method can be found in macqueen 1967 after determining the centroid of each cluster through an iterative process starting from a randomly chosen input data element the algorithm assigns each element of the input data vector to its nearest centroid thus performing the clustering the nearest centroid is established through the minimization of the euclidian distance d between the vector of the input data and the vector of the centroids the objective function to be minimized namely the distance d is obtained by the following 4 d i 1 k j 1 n y j c i in which yj indicates the jth element of the input data vector j 1 n and ci represents the ith element of the centroids vector i 1 k the k means is an unsupervised clustering method meaning that the classification does not consist in assigning a new pattern into a specific group predefined through a training process but in grouping the input data points into meaningful clusters that have not been formerly defined but are determined by the input data itself only hence unsupervised techniques such as k means can be successfully applied also when there is no prior knowledge of the clusters mora et al 2017 in this study the k means algorithm has been used in the plot scale analysis to produce binary maps of irrigated not irrigated areas at a very high spatial resolution 100 m the approach has been recently proposed in dari et al 2021 in which maps of irrigated areas at 1 km spatial resolution over a wide irrigated area in the north east of the iberian peninsula have been produced through the k means algorithm with temporal stability derived indices calculated for remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture as input following this perspective the method has been here applied over a more complex area where the spatial scale at which irrigation can occur makes the adoption of higher resolutions e g 100 m necessary the classification has been carried out by considering two clusters irrigated and non irrigated pixels and two sets of features as input data namely the mean of the spatial relative differences and the mean of the temporal anomalies both referred to the period when irrigation mainly occurs i e from june to september of each year of the period 2017 2019 the k means clustering classification has been performed through the scikit learn python package pedregosa et al 2011 3 4 surfex modeling platform a data set of soil moisture modeled through the surfex modeling platform masson et al 2013 has been used as a support in the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution surfex originally developed and currently maintained by météo france consists in multiple schemes that allow to compute the exchanges of fluxes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere four main kinds of surfaces can be modeled through proper schemes the natural surfaces the inland water bodies the oceans and the urbanized areas the isba scheme noilhan and planton 1989 mahfouf and noilhan 1996 boone et al 1999 boone 2000 habets et al 2003 is used for computing the exchanges of water and energy fluxes between the soil vegetation snow continuum over natural lands and the atmosphere in the performed simulations the isba dif scheme within the latest available version of the model surfex v8 1 has been used it has been obtained from the center national de recherches météorologiques in order to run the model at 1 km spatial resolution a regular grid with the target resolution consisting in 89 136 pixels has been used the surfex s default land cover map has been adopted it is ecoclimap ii faroux et al 2013 and has a spatial resolution of 1 km the atmospheric forcing has been taken from the era 5 reanalysis herbach et al 2020 provided by the european center for medium range weather forecast ecmwf through the copernicus climate data store the atmospheric variables are provided at a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 hence they have been resampled to the finer grid adopted prior the surfex isba simulation the benefits of using the era 5 data to force isba simulations especially in terms of the representation of hydrological variables involved in the terrestrial hydrological cycle have been shown in albergel et al 2018 despite a surfex isba version with an interactive vegetation scheme existing in this study a version with a simplified scheme based on the climatology of the leaf area index lai has been preferred this choice is mainly due to the reason for which the modeled soil moisture has been involved into the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution namely to represent a natural not altered situation in which irrigation is not present hence the adoption of a more sophisticated modeling would have been pointless in the isba dif scheme adopted the soil is vertically discretized in 14 layers the surface soil moisture referred to the first 4 cm corresponds to the weighted average of the first two layers whose depths are up to 1 cm and up to 4 cm the normalized indices described in section 3 2 have been calculated for the surfex isba soil moisture which does not contain the irrigation information and for the remote sensing products at 1 km spatial resolution which can contain such information then the results have been compared in particular the differences between the model and the satellite derived indices have been analyzed to highlight discrepancies attributable to the irrigation signal contained in the remotely sensed data it is noteworthy that comparisons between satellite and modeled soil moisture data can be affected by not negligible differences in their associated spatial patterns zhou et al 2020 and climatology dong et al 2020 nevertheless the normalized diagnostic indices used in this study make the remotely sensed and modeled soil moisture data sets directly comparable thus avoiding any rescaling procedure prior to the comparisons however we are aware that residual differences may still exist 3 5 ground truth irrigation data observations on the occurrence of irrigation over four pilot fields during the period of interest have been collected two of them are located in the upper tiber area while the other two belong to the left tiber district the plots have been identified by codes ut1 and ut2 indicate the two pilot fields in the upper tiber area while lt1 and lt2 those located in the left tiber area a summary of the information collected for each pilot plot is provided in table 2 while fig 2 shows their location in detail the crops cultivated in the ut1 field were tobacco in 2017 maize in 2018 and wheat in 2019 irrigation occurred in 2017 and 2018 not in 2019 sunflowers were cultivated without irrigation in the ut2 field during 2017 while the crop for 2018 and 2019 was tobacco and it was irrigated both ut1 and ut2 pilot fields have an area of 1 ha for the pilot fields in the left tiber area ground truth information about irrigation practices is available only for the year 2019 tobacco and pea were cultivated over the lt1 and lt2 fields respectively both pilot fields were irrigated during 2019 the lt1 field has an area of 2 ha while the lt2 plot is bigger 4 5 ha the ground truth data described in this section have been exploited in the analysis carried out at a plot scale spatial resolution to assess the capability of theia s1 soil moisture in detecting the irrigation occurrence 3 6 data preparation in order to perform the presented analyses with spatially coherent data all the products used have been first resampled for the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution the regular grid used to run the surfex isba simulation has been adopted hence the soil moisture from smap from copernicus s1 and from theia s1 1 km as well as the ndvi data have been resampled to that 89 136 pixels grid for the analysis at a plot scale a 100 m regular grid consisting in 1000 1000 cells over the study area has been adopted the soil moisture from theia s1 has been resampled to this grid prior the analyses furthermore because of the complex topography of the study area all the analyses have been carried out over the agricultural districts only namely over a homogeneous flat land 4 results 4 1 analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the main purpose of the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution is to investigate the detectability of district or sub district scale irrigation occurring over the study area through the considered products the capability of the soil moisture data sets in detecting irrigation signals is assessed through indices derived from the temporal stability theory describing the spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture the first considered index is the spatial relative difference providing information about the discrepancies between the behavior of a certain pixel and the spatial mean calculated by considering all the agricultural areas a soil moisture data set able to capture the irrigation signal is expected to show relative differences higher than zero during the highest intensity irrigation periods namely between june and september fig 3 shows the weekly time series of the district averaged relative differences calculated for each agricultural area the upper tiber in green the trasimeno in orange the right tiber in red and the left tiber in blue each panel of the first four is referred to a soil moisture product in panel e the time series of the district averaged ndvi at 1 km are shown with the same colors code the periods from june to september namely when the irrigation practices mainly occur are shaded in light green it is noteworthy that the modeled data set ends in september 2019 the upper tiber area is the only one showing a promising district scale signal according to all the considered products during almost all the irrigation seasons considered in fact smap derived district averaged relative differences are higher than zero during all the focus periods of 2017 2019 see panel a of fig 3 for the two soil moisture data sets derived from sentinel 1 namely copernicus s1 and theia s1 1 km the relative differences detected during the period june september in 2017 and 2019 are higher than during the same time span in 2018 see panels b and c of fig 3 as explained in section 3 4 the surfex isba soil moisture has been included in the analysis as a support in fact this data set is a reference for natural not human altered conditions since irrigation is not present in the modeling the left tiber and the upper tiber areas show an interesting and unexpected result since they experience an increase in the district averaged relative differences during the irrigation seasons see panel d of fig 3 this issue is particularly accentuated for the upper tiber area thus suggesting that the signal observed for the remotely sensed products is not attributable to irrigation only but it may be affected by static patterns also e g soil texture another crucial factor potentially affecting and corroborating at the same time the results obtained over the upper tiber area is the vegetation all the district averaged ndvi time series panel e of fig 3 show a similar behavior with one peak in spring as expected nevertheless for the upper tiber area a second peak during summer and lasting until the end of october can be observed this behavior is likely attributable to the irrigated crops which on the upper tiber district are known to be more evenly distributed with respect to over the other agricultural areas hence on one side the ndvi time series corroborate the detectability of district scale irrigation occurring over the upper tiber area by exploiting the spatial relative differences as a diagnostic index on the other side the ndvi trend over the upper tiber district is particularly reflected on the time series referred to smap and theia s1 1 km for which relative differences higher than zero can be observed until the end of october the two data sets are produced by merging the soil moisture information with the ndvi form different sources i e modis and sentinel 2 hence the results obtained with smap and theia s1 1 km can be partly driven by the vegetation indices exploited in the data sets production chain nevertheless it is noteworthy that in the dispatch algorithm used to produce the smap product used in this study the low resolution soil moisture is distributed into the high resolution pixels in a conservative way namely by keeping the average value hence in the case of smap the effect of the ndvi is not supposed to be so conclusive in fact the ndvi peak detected in spring is not reflected on the time series of smap derived spatial relative differences averaged over the upper tiber district along with the detectability of district scale irrigation signals it is interesting to investigate the potential in spotting sub district irrigation also at 1 km spatial resolution in order to do this a spatially distributed information is needed hence maps of the spatial relative differences averaged during the periods june september of 2017 2019 have been produced for each remote sensing product and the differences with the analogous maps obtained through the surfex isba data set available in appendix a have been calculated the results are provided in fig 4 as specified before the model does not contain the irrigation information hence the spatial distribution of the modeled surface soil moisture is mainly driven by the forcing precipitation and it is regulated by parameters linked to the soil texture and to the vegetation cover whose cycle is the same every year since in the adopted modeling the lai cycle responds to the climatology for the above mentioned reasons the maps showing the mean relative differences calculated for a certain product during the focus periods from which the same maps obtained for the modeled data set are subtracted are supposed to be not affected by static patterns the district scale signal over the upper tiber area deductible from the time series is reflected on the maps too in fact evenly distributed relative differences higher than zero can be observed in all the maps except for those referred to copernicus s1 and to theia s1 1 km during june september 2018 panels e and h of fig 4 recurring sub district portions of positive relative differences over the trasimeno and the right tiber areas can be observed in the maps referred to copernicus s1 and to theia s1 1 km especially for the periods june september 2018 and 2019 panels e f h and i of fig 4 a factor potentially affecting the relative differences calculated over the trasimeno area is the proximity to the homonymous lake in fact the 1 km resolution may not be detailed enough to solve the different signals coming from adjacent water and land pixels nevertheless the fact that the spatial occurrence of relative differences higher than zero over the trasimeno area is not limited to the coastal zones only is comforting finally small scattered portions of positive relative differences are detected over the left tiber area according to the methodology proposed in dari et al 2021 the temporal anomaly is another index derived from the temporal stability theory to be used jointly with the spatial relative differences to evaluate the capability of soil moisture products in detecting irrigation in fact the merging of the two indices provides a characterization both in space and time of the soil moisture data sets thus allowing to determinate if irrigation tracks are concurrently detectable by the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture furthermore the coupling of the analysis in terms of relative differences with the one based on the temporal anomalies is necessary since the spatial relative differences can depend on the heterogeneity of the area of interest unlike for the spatial relative differences the temporal analysis does not show a recurring district scale irrigation signal for this reason the time series of the district averaged temporal anomalies are not shown in the results section of this paper but for completeness they are shown in the appendix a in order to investigate the detectability of sub district scale irrigation signals through the temporal anomalies maps of such index averaged during the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 are provided in fig 5 according to this metric values higher than or close to zero observed during the highest irrigation intensity seasons are attributable to irrigation practices in fact positive or close to zero mean temporal anomalies during the period june september indicate a soil wetness condition higher than or close to the 3 year temporal mean during the dry season each map of fig 5 referring to a specific soil moisture data set and to a specific irrigation season is obtained by calculating the difference with the analogous map referring to the modeled soil moisture in order to remove natural signals due to climate thus highlighting irrigation related patterns for completeness the maps of the temporal anomalies calculated with the surfex isba soil moisture and averaged during the periods of interest are shown in appendix a no significant positive temporal anomalies patterns are detected for smap panels a b and c of fig 5 the clearest signals attributable to irrigation can be observed for both products derived from sentinel 1 during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 the maps derived by the copernicus s1 data panels e and f of fig 5 show portions of positive mean temporal anomalies over the right tiber the left tiber to a lesser extent and the trasimeno agricultural areas in accordance with analogous patterns of positive mean relative differences shown in fig 4 mean temporal anomalies higher than zero over the upper tiber district are detected for copernicus s1 during june september 2019 panel f of fig 5 such patterns reflect the spatial distribution of the corresponding positive mean relative differences over the same pilot agricultural area shown in fig 4 finally the maps referred to the theia s1 1 km product panels g h and i of fig 5 show evenly distributed positive temporal anomalies over the agricultural sites thus indicating wetter conditions reproduced by remote sensing data with respect to the model nevertheless the aggregation of the plot scale data to the 1 km spatial resolution may produce a merging of the information originally coming from adjacent agricultural fields determining the patterns shown in fig 5 4 2 analysis at a plot scale spatial resolution the analysis at 100 m spatial resolution is aimed at evaluating the capability of the theia s1 product to detect irrigation occurring at the plot scale which is likely the proper scale to adopt over a topographically complex and highly mixed area as the one of interest also considering the spatial extent at which irrigation generally occurs in the pilot agricultural sites in fact the very high resolution theia s1 data set allows to investigate the spatial temporal dynamics of surface soil moisture over the single agricultural field according to the methodology already adopted for the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the maps of the relative differences and of the temporal anomalies both averaged during the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively since the information is very detailed a dedicated map is provided for each agricultural area an overall agreement between the patterns of the mean relative differences see fig 6 and of the mean temporal anomalies see fig 7 during the considered irrigation seasons can be observed the pearson correlation coefficients calculated between the mean spatial relative differences and the mean temporal anomalies over each district and during each focus period are provided in table 3 the agreement between the maps of the two diagnostic indices is supported by the overall good correlation obtained which is always higher than 0 61 minimum value obtained over the upper tiber area referring to the period june september 2019 and reaches values up to 0 90 and 0 91 obtained for the period june september 2017 over the left tiber district and the right tiber district respectively the k means clustering algorithm allows to synthetize the results obtained through the fine resolution spatial and temporal analyses the features provided in the maps shown in figs 6 and 7 namely the mean relative differences and the mean temporal anomalies during the highest intensity irrigation periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 have been exploited as input data points in a binary classification of irrigated and not irrigated pixels hence a clustering with two input parameters and two clusters has been performed through the k means method the algorithm has been applied separately for the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 the resulting maps of irrigated and non irrigated agricultural fields corresponding to each focus period are shown in the maps provided in fig 8 with pixels classified as irrigated represented in green and pixels classified as non irrigated indicated in brown the upper tiber area is classified as the most irrigated one among those evaluated in this study during all the three seasons investigated the rate of pixels classified as irrigated is equal to 68 4 of the total during june september 2017 and to 68 and to 65 6 during the same periods in 2018 and 2019 respectively this is an expected result since the upper tiber district is known to be the most evenly and intensively irrigated one among the pilot agricultural areas over the trasimeno area the highest rate of irrigated pixels is detected in the period june september 2018 in fact the percentages of irrigated pixels over such area are 40 7 during the focus period in 2017 53 during the irrigation season of 2018 and 46 during the same period in 2019 higher rates of non irrigated pixels with respect to irrigated ones are obtained over both left and right tiber districts in fact over the left tiber area the rates of pixels classified as non irrigated are equal to 55 7 to 54 9 and to 56 6 for the focus periods in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively the percentages of not irrigated pixels over the right tiber area are 61 9 50 5 and 53 3 for the periods june september 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively in order to test the reliability of the proposed maps the results of the classifications have been compared with the available ground truth information about the occurrence of irrigation collected over the four pilot fields described in section 3 5 the scatter plots provided in fig 9 shows the point clouds identifying the input parameters used to perform the clustering over each district to which the pilot fields belong in accordance with the maps provided in fig 8 the cluster of the pixels classified as irrigated is represented in green while the one grouping the non irrigated pixels in brown the pixels identifying the pilot fields are represented through squares colored in black if the classification is correct or in magenta if the classification is wrong the proposed method reproduces well the real occurrence of irrigation over the ut1 pilot field which was irrigated in 2017 and 2018 not in 2019 over the ut2 plot the theia s1 soil moisture data is not available in 2019 hence only the performances in 2017 and 2018 have been evaluated the ut2 field was not irrigated in 2017 but the algorithm wrongly classifies the corresponding pixel as irrigated while the irrigation occurred in 2018 is well reproduced by the proposed classification it is noteworthy that the result obtained for the ut2 field in 2017 is discussed in the following section finally the lt1 and lt2 pilot fields were irrigated in 2019 and this condition is properly reproduced by the method presented in this study 5 discussion this paper presents a double scale analysis on the detectability of irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture over agricultural areas in central italy during the 3 year period 2017 2019 two research questions have been addressed the first one concerns the suitability of 1 km resolution soil moisture products in detecting irrigation signals over a topographically complex area where the high fragmentation of agricultural fields forces irrigation to be practiced at the scale of a few hectares and where crop rotation is adopted the second research question regards the potential of soil moisture data at a very high spatial resolution in detecting and mapping irrigated areas in the analysis at 1 km spatial resolution the detectability of irrigation through active and passive microwave products has been evaluated by exploiting indices describing the spatial temporal dynamics of soil moisture the investigation carried out by adopting the spatial relative differences as a diagnostic index reveals a district scale signal potentially attributable to irrigation over the upper tiber area this result is common to all the remotely sensed data sets evaluated except for the two sentinel 1 derived products during the irrigation season of 2018 see panels b and c of fig 3 nevertheless the uniform district scale signal over the upper tiber area is not fully reflected on the analysis exploiting the temporal anomaly as a diagnostic index the results obtained by the spatial analysis over the upper tiber area are corroborated by the vegetation conditions see the ndvi time series in panel e of fig 3 as the upper tiber district is the only one for which a uniform signal of lush vegetation during summer is detected nevertheless the observed state of vegetation development can also represent a factor affecting the soil moisture data in fact high values of the district averaged ndvi over the upper tiber area can be observed even before summer and a similar trend is reflected on the district averaged time series of the spatial relative differences referred to smap and theia s1 1 km data sets which are developed by merging the soil moisture information with ndvi observations this issue can be explained by the crop type the most common one over the upper tiber agricultural area is tobacco whose harvesting begins before middle september and lasts for a while since the leaf priming technique marowa et al 2015 is adopted i e first the leaves at the basis of the plant and later the upper ones are gradually harvested furthermore tobacco plants reach not negligible heights that may affect soil moisture data from the copernicus s1 product too in fact c band active sensors are known to be highly sensitive to the vegetation cover le page et al 2020 in addition a correction accounting for the effects of seasonal vegetation is not implemented in the retrieval algorithm used for the copernicus s1 production bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the good matching between patterns of positive mean relative differences and of positive or close to zero mean temporal anomalies obtained for the copernicus s1 product during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 suggest the potential of the high resolution c sar retrieved soil moisture in containing the irrigation information even if resampled at 1 km see panels e and f of both figs 4 and 5 wetter conditions with respect to the modeled soil moisture during the highest intensity irrigation seasons are detected for the theia s1 1 km data set also nevertheless the adoption of the 1 km spatial resolution to spot irrigation occurring over a such orographically complex area is associated to not negligible uncertainties that are difficult to be properly assessed for instance the distribution of the agricultural sites over the upper portion of the right tiber area where the fields are located in small valleys along tiber s tributaries enclosed by reliefs surely determines a contamination of the information coming from adjacent agricultural and natural pixels if a sampling at 1 km is adopted several studies have shown the potential of very high resolution sentinel 1 data in detecting irrigation events and mapping irrigated areas gao et al 2018 bazzi et al 2019 2020 le page et al 2020 hence an analysis at a plot scale 100 m by using theia s1 soil moisture has been carried out over the pilot agricultural districts the maps of the temporal stability theory derived indices referred to theia s1 see figs 6 and 7 reveal the potential of this product in reproducing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture over the single agricultural field the good agreement between the spatial and temporal analyses quantified by a spatial correlation ranging between 0 61 and 0 91 ensures the suitability of the indices derived from the temporal stability theory to be used as input features for the k means clustering algorithm with the aim of producing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution unfortunately comprehensive and detailed statistical surveys on the occurrence of irrigation over the pilot area during the period of interest are not available for this reason it has not been possible to validate the proposed maps through ground truth data sets this is the main limitation of the presented study but it is noteworthy that the proposed methodology has been already validated in a former study in which a coarser resolution of 1 km has been adopted dari et al 2021 however it will be important to collect more detailed and comprehensive information on the actually irrigated areas as well as on the irrigation amounts applied to further validate and deepen the presented analyses as a novelty with respect to dari et al 2021 the methodology has been implemented here with very high resolution 100 m soil moisture data needed to investigate the highly fragmented agricultural fields in the study area positive results have been obtained by exploiting the collected information on the irrigation practices occurred over four pilot sites since when both soil moisture and irrigation occurrence information is available the algorithm fails only once out of seven in fact the non occurrence of irrigation over the ut2 field during june september 2017 is not properly reproduced moreover the point referring to the ut2 plot identified by its mean relative difference and mean temporal anomaly is not close to the border separating the two clusters thus indicating a not negligible error see fig 9 this issue is probably attributable to the kind of crop namely sunflower whose plants reach heights that can determine disturbances in the retrieved soil moisture limitations in the use of sentinel 1 derived very high resolution soil moisture data when the crop status is highly developed have been already pointed out in el hajj et al 2017 and le page et al 2020 finally it is noteworthy that during all the three irrigation seasons investigated the upper tiber district is classified as the most irrigated one this portion is more equipped for irrigation and more evenly irrigated than the other districts 6 conclusions on the basis of the above discussed results obtained by the double scale analysis on the detection of irrigation through remote sensing soil moisture presented in this study the following conclusions can be drawn the analysis carried out at 1 km spatial resolution shows limitations due to the small spatial scale at which irrigation occurs over the study area the promising district scale signal coming from the spatial analysis over the upper tiber area is likely attributable to multiple factors along with irrigation and in any case it is not fully reflected on the temporal analysis potential in detecting sub district irrigated areas is shown by the sentinel 1 derived products especially during the irrigation seasons in 2018 and 2019 nevertheless the hyper high resolution maps of figs 6 and 7 immediately provide insights on the loss of information encountered by working with the 1 km resolution data over the study site the analysis carried out at a plot scale 100 m shows the potential in reproducing the soil moisture dynamics on the single agricultural field of the very high resolution theia s1 soil moisture the application of the k means clustering algorithm by using temporal stability derived indices as input data points has led to the production of maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution covering the irrigation seasons in 2017 2018 2019 despite a comprehensive validation not being possible comparisons with the available ground truth information provide positive results since the algorithm fails only once out of seven in reproducing the irrigation occurrence over the pilot agricultural fields hence the method shows its potential if applied to soil moisture data whose spatial resolution matches with the spatial scale at which irrigation occurs in accordance with what found in dari et al 2021 however limitations due to the influence of the vegetation cover are highlighted this study shows the importance to progress towards hyper high resolution soil moisture products that reproduce soil moisture patterns at the same spatial scales as agricultural activities thus representing a useful tool to optimize the production in the esa irrigation project different plot scale resolution soil moisture data sets derived from sentinel 1 will be tested for irrigation detection and quantification purposes over several areas worldwide under different climatic conditions and where several crop types and irrigation techniques are adopted based on these results further information on the potential of high resolution satellite soil moisture observations for irrigation purposes will be
